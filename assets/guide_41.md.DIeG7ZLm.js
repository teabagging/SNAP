When trying to carefully drive up these ramps, they simply get pushed forward. I tried putting my foot on the break while accelerating, but still no luck. They seem to be too light to actually create friction between the floor and the ramps.The so called rubber feet dont work, they get simply pressed or torn after a just a couple of uses. The surface on these ramps is almost completely smooth, no traction whatsoever.You are better off buying the original old fashioned metal ramps. They never fail and are stronger and heavier. I found a couple of the metal ramps on craigs for a fraction of the cost, and in perfect condition.DO NOT BUY THESE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhino Ramp 8000","review":"Bought these for my Vette. The length of the ramp is not sufficient to get the car on and off without using wood extensions. Getting on is OK, but getting off without the wood slipping and crashing the bumper is a real trick. Have to bore a small hole in the wood and a small hole in the ramp to \\"lock the wood extension into place\\" to avoid slippage.Other than that, they work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY- You have been warned.","review":"Total waste of money. Just slides as you try to go up on it. May as some here say work ok with light cars with skinny tires. I dont know. But, I do know if you have wide tires and a heavy car forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"I bought these ramps so I could get under my Firebird, the metal ramps are too steep. So far the Rhino Ramps have performed great, even though they could be a little more sturdy. I haven't had any of the sliding problems mentioned above, but I also use mine mostly on grass. You could probably buy a nonslip rubber mat to put under them to keep them from sliding on concrete. For $35 I can't complain too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"These save a ton of time and hassle","review":"Bought a set of these for doing the oilchanges on the family cars over the weekend. They work great on cars with lower ground clearance, and are easy to set up and store. Much simpler than having to get the car up on jacks or blocks. RWD cars may have a bit more trouble getting up these if they're used on surfaces with lower traction, but FWD (and 4WD/AWD) cars will get up them just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Concrete","review":"These things are not at all safe. They may work out on dirt, but if you try to use them on a concrete floor, raising the front of a rear wheel drive vehicle (or the rear of a front drive), they shoot out from under the wheels and become lethal projectiles. One of them actually put a huge dent in the front of my Snap-On roll around and it would have surely shattered the ankle of anyone it had hit. I have a set of these plastic POS's and won't even give them away for fear of them injuring someone. Go for a good set of welded angle iron ramps and stay FAR, FAR away from these killers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, don't buy these","review":"I purchased these ramps to perform service on my cars. Figuring that despite all the negative reviews I could make these work! No such luck. These ramps are worse than useless, they are dangerous! They ended up sliding around on the garage floor, and when I got one wheel up onto one of them it ended with an ominous looking bulge on its sides. They are sitting on the side of the house waiting for trash day to go where they belong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - cheap plastic - broke 1st use Toyota Scion Xa","review":"On the first use one of the ramps slid and broke. It was a small car and these things are suppose to be good for 8000 lbs? Toyota Scion Xa 2005. The problem with these is they are plastic and light weight. I followed the directions exactly. You would be much better off with metal steel ramps that have some weight to them at any price. These might work in level hard packed gravel... but on a smooth level dry clean garage floor they slide too easy and are not safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramps Slide Around and Buckle Under Pressure","review":"I own a Ford Crown Victoria, which is RWD. When I first tried to drive up these ramps, they slid (BTW, I did not ride the brakes during this attempt). To keep them from sliding, I placed them against the curb. The second time I drove up the ramps, the plastic started to buckle. At the point where the ramps met the curb, the plastic bowed outwards. These ramps may have temporarily held the weight of my car, but I don't believe they would last for long. When they finally fail under pressure, someone is going to get seriously hurt. From now on, I will only use steel vehicle ramps. Plastic is not a very good load-bearing material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I have a 2005 Infiniti G35 Coupe with the sport suspension and 19 wheels first of all those that have said great for cars with low ground clearance i dont know what cars they are driving that they consider low ground clearance the sport suspension and 19s come factory on my car and i couldnt clear it going forward. However if i need to lift the back end off the ground yea they work fine but as another person mentioned the tires will slip on them i spun up the rear tires a little when lifting the back up and that was when they were new i cant imagine after repeated use. All in all a waste of money just spend the money where it should be spent in a proper floor jack and jack stands and do it right the first time instead of trying to cut corners and do it quick and the lazy way."},{"rating":"1","title":"hell no....

Wide enough for our Sienna, good clearance, solidly built, fairly lightweight. They stay in place pretty good when pulling up on them, I've had them skid a time or 2 which seems normal. My only minor gripe is the little traction rubber piece in the front falls off. I need to glue or screw it on, no biggie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifting an ATV","review":"I purchased these ramps to raise my ATV to make it easier to change engine oil. Since I am using an automobile specific product for another purpose, it isn't perfect for my needs. Access under the ATV would be better if the ramps were steeper and shorter in length. However, this is not really a fault of the product but because I am adapting it to another purpose. The ramps are very sturdy, raise the ATV to a good working height, and hold it stable. These ramps come in a very big box but were shipped free with Amazon's super saver free shipping. I was able to get better ramps and a lower cost at Amazon than I could purchase locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere...","review":"I agree with the previous review.

After I'd sat down with the book for less than half an hour I found numerous items that any competent editor would have found, errors that are reminiscent of what happens if I write something at three in the morning and don't check it again after getting a good nights' sleep. I found similar problems in the Sherry bio. There is an interesting book here, but the final product lacks the touch that a good editor could have lent the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent biography but there is one problem...","review":"As a biography of Beatrice Wood's life and work, this volume is both interesting and well written. And Wood's glazes are unique in many cases, but the quality of her pottery itself (the thrown pieces) is simply sub-par!I notice that the author commented about a time in Wood's life when she worked as an apprentice to Otto and Gertrud Natzler, and that they apparently asked her to leave, because she was becoming competitive with them. This is hard to believe, because Ms. Wood's clay work (the design and execution of the ceramic pieces themselves) is just not of that high a quality. She was clearly not \\"competitive\\" with Gertrud Natzler's clay work, nor was she competitive with Otto Natzler's glaze skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Bought a Second Jacket","review":"I bought one of these jackets and two pairs of matching pants a couple of years ago. They make an excellent jogging suit combination.

Since I wear the jacket so frequently I decided to order another one just now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great value","review":"I ordered this product because I was travelling to California and did not have a jacket. I am a big guy, and although I ordered a 5xl the jacket rode up over my belly in the front among my other issues with this garment, which are:* It is too thin - no liner (buy this just to have a jacket on..it is literally too thin to \\"break the wind\\")* It is very expensive for what it is...* If you are a tall person as I am it was not long enough...2 to 4 inches would have served me well."},{"rating":"1","title":"zipper pull tab troubles","review":"accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side. all my other zippered garments come that way. this turfer men's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward. would not buy again for that reason.this shell is otherwise nicely made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This is a well-made windbreaker, a bit heavier than many, which is great for general all-purpose wear.

Besides different techniques of meditation, there are also different types or goals of meditation. This book explores the differences between concentration, awareness and devotional meditation.Another type of meditation espoused by Steven Harrison is actuality meditation. According to the author, \\"getting awareness is as simple as getting to where we already are.\\" There are no meditation techniques to practice. Awareness is a fact of life that can't be started or stopped. He tries to tell us \\"how to be in the moment.\\"This book touches upon some good insights about meditation, even if one does not accept the author's conclusions and the basic thesis of his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of Meditation is a great read","review":"What is meditation? I was meditator myself for many years and it is exactly true what Steve Harrison says about meditation. It comes to us prepackaged by teacher, religion or philosophy with a promise for better future. We want the outcome of it because we don't know better. Meditation promises results, that is just another big No-thing. Meditation is a word just as God is a word, a word that points to something that we could not possibly know in its entirety, and that is because the word does not represent anything concrete. Some people find the book boring because they look for another meditation method; meditation is a mind concept a thought that is in the field of mind. Nothing more but a healthy trance, good luck enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking series of essays","review":"Getting To Where You Are: The Life Of Meditation by Steven Harrison is a compelling examination of the practice of meditation - including its benefits, what it can and cannot help with, and expressions of daily spirituality through the machinations of life itself. A thought-provoking series of essays carrying a transcendental message about what it means to be in touch with oneself and the quest to better understand both the physical and the spiritual realms, Getting To Where You Are is enthusiastically recommended reading for students of spirituality who seek to employ meditation as a means of acquiring all that this ancient practice has to offer them in our modern times."},{"rating":"2","title":"you are already where you are!","review":"This book does a good job of explaining the unexplainable. This is a very unique and effective contribution to non-dual literature, since he dares to criticise the whole guru business and puts in perspective all misconceptions around in the field of spirituality and enlightenment. I would recommend readers of his book also to take a look at Tony Parson's book, \\"As It Is\\".Jan Kersschot, author of \\"Nobody Home\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design","review":"Great design and Kohler quality. Very easy to get the right water temperature. Also very easy to keep clean. This purchase was for my second bathroom. The first identical model was installed in 1998 and still looks and works like new. No leaks, no dribbles, just great. I installed myself, no plumber.After buying my first faucet I saw a Kohler TV ad where a woman asks a designer to design a house around this very faucet. I did not have the opportunity to do that but one could at least easily design a bathroom around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish wore out","review":"After only 3 years the finish near the end of the spout wore entirely through, I was simplly going to replace it with another reliable brand but the oringal shut offs were located too far away for any other brand because the supply tubes are extra long on this unit. Kohler gave me a hard time on the phone claiming that it had to be cleanser related even though we only used paper towels. Anyway, I was glad to see that unit is still available through Amazon so I'll just swap it out and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked all over the floor","review":"There's some sort of internal problem with the valve I installed - water pours down from the valve body through the cock hole and onto the floor when the valve is running (but not when it's shut off) - could be the same aerator problem, the aerator leaking inside the valve trim - trying to get Kohler to replace it, but not yet.This isn't much of a valve - it's a rough brass and soldered copper tubing valve with stamped and plated covers to make it look like a cast brass valve. I guess it's OK for the price but not what I expected at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it right back","review":"What isn't completely obvious from the picture unless you look closely is that the outer surface of the spout is in two halves, an upper and lower half, and they meet on the sides. With the copy I got, there was close to a 1/16\\" gap on the right side, so you could see right in, and at best it would be a pain in the behind to keep clean. Another copy might be better but it seems like an unfortunate design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good knife","review":"I wanted a knife this knife because it was lightweight and had a unique look to it. It is well constructed and deploys easily with one hand. You can position the clip for tip up or tip down carry. I really only use this item for cutting cheese, and carrying around when I have nice clothes on. It works well but, since I primarily cut cheese with this blade I would get something with a full flat grind and more belly. This blade is just so nice that I can't give it box cutting duty even though I think the blade shape is particularly well suited for that type of duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another unique Spyderco knife","review":"Pros: Very light for a knife of this size, well-balanced in hand, design of blade (both hollow-grind and swedge-grind) makes meat & poultry cutting a breeze. Con: When worn in pant's pocket with clip the non-sharpened spine serrations (jimping) to hold the thumb steady when cutting tends to scrape hand. This is especially true if the pocket is smaller and the pants tighter like with jeans. This knife is another winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroic effort, but mangled output","review":"I own 12 of the original soundtracks for the themes that are included in this compilation (which are reorchestrations/re-recordings by the City of Prague Philharmonic)...

I am not terribly computer savy, but was able, through trial and error, to use the software in a relatively short period of time.Main drawback is the limited number of plants in the menu.

We're in Colorado and trying to use xeriscaping to save on our water bill and not one of the plants i'm looking for is included in the plant library.

I was especially affected because I am an Oregonian as well ( though I was born here, as opposed to having moved here like Thompson) and because I lived a year of my life in Montpelier, where he stopped on his tour. It was cool seeing stuff I recognized. I also enjoyed Thompson's whiny, self-pitying and -criticizing tone which reminded me of Crumb or Pekar. It was just good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb even after 90+ years","review":"For a book that is so out of date (my copy is from 1916), it is remarkably current for those who want to make clothing at home that does not look home made. Not only does it cover pattern drafting and clothing construction methods, but it also goes into appropriate fabrics and design elements. There is a chapter covering embellishment in the form of embroidery, as well as what we know today as French Hand Sewing. While the cost per yard of fabrics listed can only be dreamed of today, I refer to this book even more often than my beloved and well used Vogue Sewing. A treat for the eyes, not only for those who want well constructed garments for themselves, but also for those who want to make quality clothing for antique dolls. Wonderful all around.

Go back and get the two aformentioned books - Especially Triggerfish and you will be laughing out loud for the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Step Down","review":"When I discovered this author I quickly bought all his books. I purchased this one in hard cover as soon as it came out. I shouldn't have bothered, this one is not up speed. The book is disjointed and hard to follow and thus, unlike his previous efforts, doesn't hold the reader's attention. I don't mean disjointed in a wacky way that is endearing, I mean disjointed as in bad writing. There are still some laughs but they are few and far between. Some of the evil forces at work are just background noise and you never really have any insight or interest in them. It just kind of limps to a tacky happy ending when the reader has long since lost interest in what's happening. Was the author being too clever by half or is he just running out of steam? I don't know but in the future I'll wait for the paperback version or just hit the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Bamboo: A Novel","review":"I am a fan of Tim Dorsey and his works. I stumbled upon him by accident after having read my latest Carl Haiiasen Book, and boy am I glad I did. I was a little disappointed in this book because I felt it lacked the edge that some of his earlier novels had. The \\"creative violence\\" of Serge just isn't there and the laugh at loud moments are few and far between. Don't get me wrong, you will find very few authors who write with the creativity and twisted humor that Tim does...but this novel is lacking in some of the grit of the first few novels. I like Tim's books because I am a Floridian and when the plot stays within the state, for me personally, it makes for a better read. I hope the next novel gets back to the roots of the first few books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why People Stare at me on Planes","review":"This one is the best so far.

Someone get Coleman out of the props locker!","review":"If you know Dorsey, you know what to expect from one of his novels, and this is little different... the biggest change being that the majority of the book takes place in Hollywood, California (instead of Florida.) Serge, our favorite anti-hero serial killer, has become fixated on the movie industry and the nettling question of why movies set in Florida of late stink like the Everglades on a hot afternoon. Armed with his own screenplay, he and his drug-addled sidekick trek out west to rectify the situation, and get caught up in multiple dovetailing sideplots along the way.Hollywood has been skewered before, of course, so technically this book breaks little new ground, but admittedly it is well-done and a hoot to read. There are stronger entries in Dorsey's catalog (and if you're new to him, start elsewhere), but Big Bamboo is still a solid entry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim's best yet!!!","review":"For those unfamiliar with Tim Dorsey's work and his recurring character Serge... well then you need to crawl out from under a rock and climb back into you grave. Tim's books are a grab you by your throat,laughter inducing, piss running down your leg riot! This one in particlar is my favorite, seeing as I'm a HUGE film buff and that happens to be Serge's big beef in this one is filmmaking. I don't want to give anything away here, so I'll just do what I always do and make my comparison the way only I can.If Quentin Tarantino and Dave Barry had a kid together and it was raised by Courtney Love... that kid would read \\"The Big Bamboo\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keep your had clear","review":"challenges your mind to keep up with the action...gotta love Serge (well maybe \\"like\\" Serge)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnier than President Bush's Speeches","review":"This whole series of books by Tim Dorsey can be described as a twisted and funny study on the dark side in all of human beings. Tim Dorsey manages to take everyday situations and make them incredibly funny. Based in Florida, the series follows the twisted life of Serge Storms (one of the best characters ever created) and all his sick, violent and disturbed adventures. Of course, along the way you will get to meet every kind of character you can imagine.The interesting thing about this series is that behind all the funny stories, there are tons of social and political criticisms. I have read all the books in the series, and each one keeps getting better. If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino movies, Family Guy cartoons or South Park cartoons, you will love these books. A MUST BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serge Has Finally Jumped The Shark","review":"If Torpedo Juice was Serge portraying Fonzie strapping on the skis, then The Big Bamboo was DEFINITELY Serge jumping the shark.It was bound to happen. This series, I'm sorry to say, has run out of steam. Ironically enough it's no coincidence that both the television series 'Happy Days' and this novel 'The Big Bamboo' both jumped the shark when they were set in LaLa Land, California. You take your lead characters out of their natural elements and they flounder.Now, I've re-read Torpedo Juice twice and even purchased the novel on CD to see if there was something I was missing. I wasn't. I had the distinct impression that that particular novel was being 'phoned in'. The Big Bamboo suffers from the same malady. Although, this time it was even worse.I looked forward to kicking off the Spring and Summer time with a new Dorsey novel. Alas, I think the ride has finally come to an end.Sorry, Tim.

If you are new to the Dorsey books, you should start with Florida Roadkill which is the first of the series.If you are an old hand at the Dorsey books all I can say that you don't already know is that this one did not disappoint.PLOT REMINDER: Serge goes Hollywood.

I would say this is the perfect match to use with a cart cover. I have a cart cover but didn't think it was going to be cold enough to bother with that.

The setting seemed accurate and not overly modern, though it did not transport me like the best historical ficion should.I really liked the main character, the hunchback lawyer Matthew Shardlake.

It's 1537, and Shardlake has been sent to the Benedictine monastery at Scarnsea, Sussex, by Lord Cromwell to investigate the murder of a king's commissioner. Using reports from the monastery inspection two years early, Cromwell hoped the commissioner could convince the abbott to voluntarily dissolve the monastery. Shardlake soon discovers evidence of sexual misconduct, embezzlement, and treason. Sansom brings the Reformation to life with plenty of atmosphere and a clever plot. Shardlake is a hunchback, but his brilliant intellect more than compensate for his physical limitations. He is compassionate and committed to the ideals of Cromwell's reforms, but is growing increasingly wary of the motives of his fellow reformers as the book progresses.http://www.stopyourekillingme.com/S_Authors/Sansom_C-J.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series of Historical Fiction","review":"If you liked \\"Game of Thrones\\" readers will love this book and the series.

There is no problem he can't adjust, no mystery he can't solve. He may be Lord Cromwell's \\"man\\", but he's his own man as well. I like to read C.J. Sansom's books about Matthew Shardlake because not only do I like the Tudor History he imparts, I like the fact that his stories are very, very interesting. I go to bed at 11:00 p.m. but I don't go to sleep until 1:00 a.m. It's so hard to put Matthew Shardlake down! Like a good mystery? Sansom is not just good - he's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Death...","review":"I started reading with some anticipation of being entertained.

What could a night owl do but run to Amazaon books and look up the author? Who would not be excited about reading a book about a hunchback lawyer investigating murders at a monastery during the relgious upheaval times under King Henry VIII? It was entertaining that I sat up reading it instead of watching Craig Ferguson and I liked it so much that I have ordered the second one. I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I took Dissolution (& 2 other Matthew Shardlake mysteries) out of the library first, since CJ Sansom was a new author for me. Then I HAD to have it! I am on my second read, & I intend to read all of them in order this time. I reccommend the Shardlake series & I intend to try some of Sansom's other books as well. So far I have bought three of this series, including the most recent Heartstone, which I bought thru Amazon since it's not been released in the US yet. My British copy even has a ribbon bookmark in it, which is totally cool. If you start the series, you'll get hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step Back in Time","review":"In Dissolution, Sansom introduces us to his main character, Matthew Shardlake, the compassionate and sensitive hunchbacked lawyer. Sansom gives us the rich flavor of Tudor England, through speech, descriptions of the buildings, clothing styles, animals, politics, religion, and even tweeks our sense of smell! All this a rich backdrop for Medieval murder. I was encouraged by my well-read sisters, to begin this journey, and, since doing so, I have been entranced! But as they suggested, I strongly encourage you to begin with this book in the series! I gave it a 4-star rating, as the murder mystery aspect was not quite as nail biting as the later books in the series, but make no mistake, this book is a treasure! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"If I could give this thing zero stars I would...THIS TOY IS ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS!!! The reviews that say this toy doesn't work right are correct, the clock piece doesn't work at all, and the music part works some of the time. Slight movement of this toy makes it reset.

After putting it together, the clock didn't work on ours either. My husband and I took the bottom of the desk apart. When you push the clock in, it pushes an electronic piece down which is why it doesn't work. After putting it all back together, it worked fine for two days. Now only two buttons on the clock work. To get the music to play, we had to shove something down next to the top of the desk to make sure it kept playing. I will be contacting Fisher-Price, this toy is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice But Won't Turn Off!!","review":"My wife and I bought this for our son for Christmas. While putting it together on Christmas Eve I found that the On/Off switch does not work. No matter what I do the toy remains on all the time (luckily it has a sleep mode). I called Fisher Price about the problem and they want me to take it apart and send in the desk and clock portion (at my expense) to them and they will send replacements in 4-6 weeks. I cannot do this since my son loves to play with it. I bought an item from Little Tikes and they are sending me the item with in 10 business days. Fisher Price really disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed on Christmas","review":"This was the \\"big gift\\" from Santa.

No stores have them. Decide to check to see if any were in stock on line and saw all the reviews. Next time I will read the reviews first to see if I should bother putting something together.

Buy This!! :(","review":"I purchased this toy for my 2 yr old nephew's birthday because he loves anything with lights and music. The price was 55.00 but using my 2 Amazon coupons made it a FREE toy with free shipping. While I am disappointed with the toy I guess for free I can't complain although I could have used the coupons for something that he would actually play with :( This is a large toy which takes up space and is rarely used. He is now 3 and the toy has dust on it. The only thing he has ever done with it is bang on the piano. The clock works fine on this one so I cant comment on everyone else's problem with that. While it was fairly simple to put together it is a flimsy thin plastic cheaply made toy that is not worth the price. There are many other educational toys out there that your child will actually use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational, Fun & entertaining","review":"I bought this for my son after he turned 3, it was easy to assemble (I assemble the toys not my husband) Although my now 4 year old knows his ABC's, numbers, animals, & shapes he still likes this toy. The desktop is easy to pull up & down & he has never had a problem of any kind, it's such a good toy that even the batteries still work. God is awesome!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective, Obnoxious & Loud","review":"I bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday. She loved to colour, and so I figured that she and her brother could share this as a learning tool. Well ... that is not what is happening! The Top Panel (with the clock Face on it) is supposed to insert a certain way so that some electronics can match up and connect together so the learning stuff works ... well, they did not match up, nor can we take it back apart to try and reallign the connections!!! We were told that the toy is not defective ... that the error is our and we are stuck with just another \\"piano\\" type toy ... we already have several of those!!! But all in all, our kids love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time or money","review":"This toy is a real disappointment. I bought it for our 2 year old for Christmas and realized after putting it together that it is very flimsy. She enjoyed turning the hands on the clock, although it did not work, but to do this she had to lean across the desk. The desk part bends very easily and tilted over every time she reached over to play with the clock. She also almost pinched her fingers when switching the desk up and down. This should be recalled for safety reasons or change the age range. Needless to say, I returned this to the store and got a refund. This toy really deserves a no-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun 2 Learn Preschool Center a disappointment","review":"We also purchased the Fun 2 Learn preschool center as a Christmas Present for our 3 year old daughter. After assembly of the product we discovered that the clock portion of the product did not work. We reported the complaint to Fisher-Price who informed us that they had no prior complaints, which is doubtful considering the reviews on this site. Their only option was for me to disassemble the product and send back the defective clock/keyboard part and wait 3-4 weeks for new delivery of the new part, reassemble myself and hope the new piece would work. This is disappointing considering my 3 year old was ready to play with the new toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning Tool","review":"I bought this item for my nieces (triplets), and they love it.

The clock on the table did not work. She could only use the keyboard. I call the company and they didnt have any replacement parts and said I would have to ship the product back.

I shipped it back on 12/26 and on 12/27 I got the second one in ... same problem, clock not working (at first the piano wasn't either). I called FP, they are not aware of any issues (at this moment).

For progressive rock, it was a very weak decade and hardcore prog fans dismiss the 1980's as the \\"decade of nothing good for progressive\\". That is mainly true to an extent but there are some gems from this decade if one looks hard enough. \\"Huseg\\" from the Hungarian band East is one such gem. Using the complex styles from 1970's prog bands, \\"Huseg\\" blends complex head-spinning guitar solos by Janos Varga along with more modern keyboards. Some people will have a hangup with the use of digital keyboards on this album but let me assure you these keyboard solos are blazing and everybit as impressive as the 70's legendary keyboards from Tony Banks, Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, etc...

But this book just doesn't work. It seems a mishmash of different parts and seems haphazardly, even lazily written. Waugh seems to get bored of his protagonist Guy Crouchbook toward the end and dumps him to follow other characters, characters recently introduced to us and who we don't particularly care about. Although the Crete scenes are nicely done, we just want to get them over with. This book isn't half as good as the first part of the trilogy and, I hate to say it, if it wasn't Waugh it would almost certainly not be in print today."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more broken strings!","review":"I've been using an E-Force Lethal racquet (which is excellent), but I broke the strings every six weeks (I play 4 times a week).

The harshness of my criticism is directed toward the producers of this disk, as both the TV show, and scores are brilliant.

Going to the website reveals nothing substantial about this CD and apparently that's intentional, because this CD is a big rip-off. 98 tracks on the CD and only five or six are devoted to calls. A couple are funny, the rest are so-so. I had heard about the split between Johnny Brennan and Kamal, and when there was a new CD marketed under the Jerky Boys name after so long, I'd assumed they had patched things up. Wrong again.

I am a huge fan of the boys and was eagerly awaiting lots of new calls, but instead got 96 tracks of re-recorded snippets of past jerky boy calls and 6 so-so prank calls. I too think all the voicemail and ring tones should have been released for free on the web site.The calls that are on the CD have their moments, but not one of them comes close with the classic calls on previous CDs.I would have liked to hear a bunch of calls that went bad where the callers knew who it was or the call derailed in some other way. At least that would have been new material and I am sure some of it is very funny. Brennan has to have dozens of calls like this if he was still making them at the height of their popularity.I really hope Brennan releases a killer CD next or it might be the end of a true comedy legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ringtones for my Phone!!","review":"This is a comeback for Johnny Brennan who put this out for his fans because the cell carriers were raping people for almost 3 bucks for Jerky ringtones...

I was amazed at how cheaply this series is now being produced. No artwork on the DVD, no artwork on the inside of the cases. The worst of all is the fact that Universal markets these sets as \\"complete & uncut\\". They are not uncut. \\"Last Salute to the Commodore\\" is missing more than 10 minutes of footage. In the 1970s, commercial breaks did not run 25 minutes for a 2 hour program. That is common now, but not in the 70s. \\"Commodore\\" runs just over 95 minutes. In a 2 hour slot, that leaves 25 minutes for commercials. As I said, not in the 70s. The show is very jumpy because of the cuts. Each of these episodes is heavily cut up. If you don't mind chopped up episodes, and cheaply done packaging, this set is for you. Otherwise, look at the alternate sets being offered online by other providers. Universal deserves no one's loyalty. Universal is home of vast numbers of greed merchants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed the first four seasons of Columbo very much. Excellent stories and very enjoyable acting. Unfortunately, season five does not follow that same trend. The stories are trite and the acting is below par. Actors that performed very well in previous seasons episodes (Jack Cassidy, Robert Vaughn) seem to have become bored and unimpressed in this set. Even the maestro, Peter Falk, is below par. He has become bumbling and boring in most of these episodes. Also, it seems as though the stories were based on 30 minutes worth of ideas stretched out to 90 minutes. What happened? How could such a clever show change so dramatically? I felt season four was great. Maybe everyone was tired of doing it by season five. If this is what I have to look forward to in season six i won't be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"columbo the fifth season","review":"first two discs were fine third disc would not play movie if it did it would jump and stop therefore i did not see the third disc which had 2 episodes on it ,therefore i belive i got ripped off"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good season of Columbo...but not the best","review":"Your typical three disc set featuring several outstanding episodes included here are \\"Identity Crisis\\" directed and starring Patrick McGoohan reprising his \\"Secret Agent\\" character of sorts; \\"Now You See Him\\" an interesting and absorbing story about an escaped Nazi war criminal (Jack Cassidy) masquerading as a famous magician at an upscale L.A. supperclub; and \\"Last Salute to the Commodore\\" which puts Columbo against Robert Vaughn, a greedy son-in-law who murders his wealthy yachtsman father-in-law so he can regain control of his vast shipbuilding empire.

And why would an audience put up with a magician who takes 20 minutes to escape from an underwater tank? Why did Ricardo Montalban murder his trusted assistant, you don't find out until Columbo solves the case. And why was Colunbo wearing his rumpled outfit while vacationing in Mexico?

I played something similar as a youth, but it was not magnetic like this one (a great improvement because the playing pieces stay in place). The idea of the game is to travel from your starting state to an ending state based upon the play of drawn cards (the map gets filled in as cards are played; you can only leave your starting state if an adjacent state's card has been played). Unlike a lot of \\"State\\" games, this one does not involve asking trivia questions -- its just about \\"going\\". You don't have to be able to read to play this game, since the cards have colored shapes matching the colors of the map pieces (but it does help one learn to spell the names by seeing them on the cards)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic State to State Game","review":"This is an educational game and fun at the same time. I bought it as a present and we all enjoyed it, young and old alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nightly read for me","review":"I once saw Siskel and Ebert speak in Cleveland, Ohio. After they tossed opinions back and forth about the great and not-so-great films of that year, a person in the audience asked them how they differed as critics. Without hesitation, Gene said he was repeatedly outdone by Roger's ability to write beautiful essays. Beautiful, he said. And in this book, you are continuously hit with just that. Roger Ebert has the ability to distill the essence of a film in words that often leave me amazed. He is able to pinpoint the exact moment in a film that doesn't leave you, the moment that stays with you for days, and is able to describe the human dimensions beneath that moment with insightful detail and accuracy. As an avid fan of film, I repeatedly turn to Roger Ebert's Video Companion, not because I want to know whether or not I should watch a movie. But because I learn a little bit more about life from his reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"More essay collection than standard review book...","review":"This is a great book. Ebert's writing style is solid and his reviews are in depth and on the mark. The only slight problem, or maybe misconception, I had with the book was that it isn't the review book you've come to expect. Instead of a quick blurb on if the film is good and worth watching,this book contains full length reviews which are a lot more comphrehensive than most review books (sometimes a little too much info is given,spoiling things if you haven't seen the film).If you're in the market for a book to give you brief good/bad reviews of films, try the Leonard Maltin book, but if you want more essay-like reviews this is for you. It does come with a small booklet with star ratings only for most films."},{"rating":"1","title":"To like or dislike that is the question...","review":"On one level, I like this book. Ebert's witty and insightful reviews truly are enjoyable to read. I enjoy reading about films I know I'll never see.I also enjoy the added features, such as the Film Clip interviews, essays, and obituaries as appendices at the end of the book.On the other hand, I dislike the fact that many of the movies I want to read about are not in the book. I'm surprised at how many times I have turned to the book looking for a review only to come up empty handed. There can be nothing more disappointing. Granted, the book is thick enough as it is, but perhaps Roger could shorten his reviews and pack more into a volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to serve its purpose","review":"When I say that Gene Siskel was the better critic (and writer), it's not just sentiment talking. How in the heck does one give **** to so many perfectly average movies (like \\"L.A. Story\\") as Ebert does in his book? The biggest fault with this annual collection is that it completely fails in its intention. Ebert seems to think of this as a more in-depth version of Leonard Maltin's guide but who needs to read a full-length review of a movie to determine if it's worth a rental or watching on the late show? A better idea for Ebert would be to just issue a complete volume of his work through the years instead of dumping the same reviews (with some additional material to make it \\"new\\") on the market year after year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit","review":"I purchased this work bowl cover to replace a cracking work bowl cover on my current Cuisinart Food Processor.

This is what Jack White probably wants his band to sound like, and although he does an admirable job on his earlier work, I'm sorry to say that he doesn't quite make it (not to knock him though- he has his own sound and I like it). This is the original garage sound, rough raw and hungry. Three chords, distorted guitar, and sexual frustration combined into something far greater than the sum of its parts. Long before \\"punk rock\\" became a genre, these guys were making punk rock.I'm stunned that I'm the first person to review this, but I'll say that if you somehow stumble onto this page, you'd really do yourself a favor picking up a copy.

There has never been a year when I have seen every movie that is included in his annual movie yearbooks, but I could still read every review in the book! It is his prose, his wit, his love for film, and his desire to see the medium move forward, while recoginizing the gennius that can be found in [some] genre films. I highly recommend his writing- There is simply no one better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've semi-often found Ebert's reviews a little inaccurate","review":"In this book when he reviews the film The Day After Tomorrow Ebert claims the character of Sam's mother (you'll understand this if you've seen TDAT) is in New York taking care of a sick hospital patient even though the city is now frozen under ice. Actually, Sam's mother is in another american city (not NYC) taking care of the kid. Some years ago I found the way Ebert reviewed another film (called In THe Dead of Winter) also to be a little inaccurate as well. I think he should watch all the films he puts into books at least half a dozen times before he puts them into book form. He seemingly only watches some of them once and it shows in his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but a little faulty","review":"Ebert's description of the 1950's Godzilla movie that was recently rereleased is a little faulty.

Ever entertaining, with a great cast. Must have for true James Garner fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rockford Files, Season 2","review":"James Garner absolutely shone in this role. Twenty-two episodes here prove why he is considered one of this country's greatest actors. Garner could do it all; romantic leading man, tough guy, western hero & his comedic abilities were, perhaps, his strongest area.This series was practically tailor made for Garner being, essentially, an update of the Maverick character he had portrayed fifteen years earlier. When Stephen Cannell pitched this series to Roy Huggins (creator of Maverick & The Fugitive), Huggins told him the same thing: This is Maverick updated! Get Jim Garner to play the role.Bonus features include the original Rockford Files pilot which ran as a Movie of the Week. It's about 72 minutes long & full of vintage Rockford, There are some subtle differences from the subsequent series, the most notable being another actor portraying his father. Also included is a short interview with Cannell discussing the creation of The Rockford Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 favorite episodes of the series are here!","review":"The \\"Great Blue Lake\\" scam episode along with the Lou Gossett episode concerning basketball point shaving were my 2 favorite episodes of the entire series. The best part was the bonus episode featuring the pilot. William Smith from the pilot is the only 70 year old I'd fear more than Jim Brown as I type this. He is a reputable tough guy with great charisma and was a great asset in the pilot. Rocky and Angel really develop their roles as well. I'm glad the show is getting it's due and paved the way for Magnum which took a lot of Garner's \\"vulnerabilities\\" into the 1980's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockfish...according to Gandy","review":"What more can you say about one of the finest TV series of all time.

To see gigantic creatures pick up human beings and examine them for their possible tastiness--that was an amazing thing to be watching on celluloid! It did not bother me that the motion was a bit jerky--I deduced at the time that these scary studio creations had been posed and shot a frame at a time, and my feeble little mind had thought this was terribly sophisticated, as FX go.

The scripts, staging, and most of the acting are remarkably poor for a major release.For all of the magic in the plotlines, the only real miracle is performed by Tom Baker as he somehow manages to keep at least one movie corpse from rotting away altogether.Here's a suggestion to Amazon: Please consider a requiring reviewers to declare if they have, or had, any financial interest in the product reviewed.Buyer beware: take the time to borrow or rent at least one before you consider buying the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost?","review":"I would like to know the reason why has the cost of this collection jumped from around $33 to over $120?"},{"rating":"2","title":"non stop action by the ragin Cajun","review":"I saw Doug Kershaw live in early 70's at the Jubilee Auditorium in Calgary and was blown away by his live show and that's why I was excited to see that \\"Alive and Pickin\\" had been finally released on CD.

With help, Suze assumes that \\"Red\\" is Red Beaumont, a prominent businessman.Who also happens to be Tad's father. Naturally, Suze is distressed to find that her boyfriend's dad is a murderer....or a vampire! Even more disturbing, Suze finds that Mr. Beaumont is linked with the several disappearances of land owners......... this is a must read, it is practically a work of genius!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suze has a new challenge","review":"When Suze is comfronted by a screaming ghost asking for her to find Red and tell her that he didn't kill her, she knows she has to act. SO when she finally finds a Red, named Red Beaumont, she shocked to find out that he's the father of the first guy she's even dated, Tad Beaumont. But as she continues into this case she finds herself involved in something much bigger. Is this what she was supposed to do? Or has she found herself involved in something a little too supernatural.Just like the last book in the series this book was entertaining and a great ghost story. Don't always go for the obvious answers, becasue you never know what to expect. This book is just as good as the last. Even though another book hasn't announced for the series I hope another one is at least in the works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse is SOO hott!!","review":"One night while trying to sleep(yeah right) Suze is aawakened to a women shrieking her head off.

We also meet Suze's dad and Father Dom finds out about Jesse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I have to say, after reading the first book, I was hooked to the series. These books raise the questions of what if? Are there really ghosts? Well, in these books there are, and it's Suze Simon's job to help them to the other side. Or if \\"helping\\" doesn't work, she uses her fists. I recommend these books too all teens looking for a relaxing read. Their funny, and suspenseful. This one cracked me up at certain parts. The characters as well are vibrant and realistic. Jesse, the 170 year old, not too mention hot, ghost hanging out in her bedroom (which it is implied that he may like her a bit more than a friend), Adam, who's hormones and car take up most of his time, CeeCee, not the looker of the school, but smart and witty, her stepbrothers, who can be annoying, but Doc is pretty sweet, and Suze herself, who is very belivable and funny, with a sassy attitude. It's a great book, and the whole series is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Urban Fantasy","review":"I really like Susannah's character because she kind of sassy and a \\"kick butt\\" kind of girl.

Its a precious work of art and I think it was beautifully crafted and perfected to be something very emotional grasping and captivating towards the listener. The highlights of this album are \\"Pull Away\\", \\"Paint On Your Wings\\", \\"No Fear\\", and \\"Family Affair\\". Her voice itself is so versatile going from easy flowing pop-synch vocals to a heavier huskier, more powerful romp (as on the beautiful Family Affair). There are no more words to describe this albums beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAPD and their latest string of crimes","review":"Poor Mendoza. Just when he was getting used to the new dog, a mockingbird shows up that seems stuck on the song Yankee Doodle. Work isn't much better, since a string of odd crimes has the Homicide Squad baffled. A con man was shot in a car and manages to scribble the word \\"Jewels\\" before dying. An old woman was killed in some sort of voodoo ritual. Another old woman running a boarding house was killed. The crimes just keep piling up.I like these books, but they do have a few problems. One is that the author tries so hard to make each character an individual that they wind up being more like stereotypes than real people. Another is that they are really dated. This was published in 1969 and slang and cultural trends have changed a lot in over 30 years. Still, it's a good read for anyone who likes police procedurals."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst opera productions I've ever seen!","review":"This has to be one of the worst opera productions I've ever seen. The staging and costumes were incoherent and silly. Nothing about this production makes any sense. Why are there \\"wild men\\" with long, shaggy hair wearing tutus dancing in the background? I love to laugh and I'm easy to please, but this stuff is just NOT funny. The story line is simple and the music is okay, perhaps divorced from this ridiculous production it might have been somewhat entertaining. The only good thing I can say about it is that Marlis Peterson sang well. Watching, I thought all the singers must be wishing they were not in this farce. A couple minutes into Act 2, I turned it off. I advise you to skip it unless you are a Haydn freak. Actually, if you are a Haydn freak, you should skip this too, as it will make you sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a cute princess","review":"My daughter picked this princess gown out.

Come on guys; are you really classing this politically-correct, stereotypical pot-boiler up there with Dune, 2001, Consider Phlebas etc? Moonwar has a very strong \\"made-for-TV\\" feel to it and amounts to little more than Dallas or Dynasty in space.

Under the influence of Luddites (people who are against potentially dangerous technologies) the U.N. has banned nanotechnology, including on the Moon. Rather than return to earth the moon's owner, a corporation represented by Doug Stavenger, decides to declare independence. A war ensues. But it isn't much of a classic war. Diplomacy is war by another means, and it is diplomacy and backstabbing that occupy center stage. Ben Bova did a great job showing his character's motivations. My major criticism is that the novel is, like so many published today, too long. You would cut it by a third and loose nothing worth reading. But publishers these days demand big, bulky novels. Some readers must like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertaining","review":"I buy books to be entertained.

The plant manager takes ten chapters to understand the concept of what a bottleneck is. And he does so by being advices by an irritating physics professor that thinks he's beig clever by speaking through questions. If you are a plant manager and you don't understand what a bottleneck is then you should probably find another job. Instead the character in the book gets a promotion. I literally felt like I had to slow my brain down to read this. I think I need to do some Mensa problems now to exercise it back to normal. And if you are thinking that all that reading and waiting will be worth it for some great epiphany at the end...you will be sorely disappointed. I gave it two stars because maybe this book would be ok for high school or younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate All The Way","review":"If you're the typical corporate manager and you're more adept at playing the game than seeing what's right in front of your face, than this might be the book you need. For anyone else, forget it. The author states numerous times that the \\"theory of constraints\\" is nothing more than common sense, and he's right. In noncorporate speak, \\"a chain is only as strong as its' weakest link\\" pretty well covers the content of the book. The first forty pages are devoted to unearthing the revelation that the \\"goal\\" of being in business is to --make money! Actually the real revelation of this book is that there are so many corporate stiffs in this world that it sold millions of copies teaching them what any entrepreneur figures out in their first day."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD CD - chapters mislabeled & out of order","review":"Sound quality was great and the effects kept it interesting. Unfortunately, the computer files were mislabeled so when I put this on my ipod the chapters were rearranged. When I was listening, the chapters were presented out of order.

A must read for supply chain and business professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that stood the test of time","review":"With 'The Goal', Goldratt introduced one of the most important mechanisms for continuous improvement, the philosophy initially introduced by Deming, and then brought to perfection by the Japanese industry.The book reads like a novel -- which I found very pleasurable --, with Alex Rogo, the main character, facing termination of his manufacturing plant due to poor performance. With the help of Jonah, a brilliant physicist/systems thinker, Alex gradually discovers a process for elevating a system's performance, process dubbed by the book author \\"The theory of constraints\\".In a nutshell, the premise is this: the throughput of a system is currently limited by the performance of its weakest component. Determine that component and implement measures that help it improve.With 3 million copies sold worldwide in 3 editions, the Goal, which was written 27 years ago (in 1984) boldly stood the test of time, to become one of the most important business books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"I purchased this book for a college course that I was taking and at first when I saw how big the book was, I was discouraged because I did not want a long boring and dull read. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very VERY easy read and the story was great at helping me to understand business operations and the theories behind it. The book gave really good examples included in the story and the characters are realistic.

The author has done a very good job of keeping the story interesting and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read, and worthwhile","review":"I enjoyed the book, and it was an easy read. Not much is really directly applicable to what I do but I enjoyed the modeling of, and abstractions around, an old business---even if nothing particularly earth-shattering is surfaced. Some of the narrative was a bit hokey, but none so much so that it made me want to stop reading.I agree with others that this is good to have read, and helps to inform a solid operational and organizational theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theory of Constraints / Operations Management","review":"This book is a novel with the purpose of instructing the reader in the theory of constraints. The book details how one should go about analyzing operations or any system to find, fix and/or optimize the overall structure and the overall process. It is about the analysis of processes and how to structure them and manage them, in view of the constraints contained within them. Anyone interested in accounting, operations management, process management, continuous improvement, etc. should read this book. It is a fast and easy read, but it contains much substantive insight into analyzing and optimizing processes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke and Mirrors","review":"Upon recommendation I purchased all 3 in the series.

He thoroughly exposes his Theory of Constraints, which is a valid consideration for just about all of life's interrelationships and business activities.That being said, the story could have been told using only about two-thirds of the pages that Goldratt devoted to the tale.Despite its repetitive story line, I gladly recommend this book to those who have an open and creative mind. Its concepts and story should have wide appeal, especially in the world of business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louis Fabricio Bermeo - IME 415 For Dr. Phil Rosenkrantz","review":"The Goal by Goldratt is a good read. I tried to read Deming in the past and even though he is a management genius his book put me to sleep at times, but the Goal was great! Half soap opera and half management, it held my interest while delivering the goods. Bottlenecks, excess inventories, and a management that wont shut up about \\"efficiency\\" reports make Mr. Rogo's life hell. In the end common sense and Industrial Engineering techniques prevail and Alex, along with his staff, learn to depend on themselves for solutions. They become their own guru's and no physicist is needed. So it is a great book that any management bound/engineering individual must read. I will finish off with a beloved quote from the book, \\" Do not let common practice replace common sense.\\" That may not be the exact quote, but that is how I remember it. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Business Story","review":"This book was required for my Operations Management class, and to be honest, I wasn't looking forward to having to read it.

I'd highly recommend this book for anyone in business or managerial positions of any profession. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storyline & worth the read ...","review":"I was given this book at my workplace. I delayed reading it, honestly, because it looked a little old school. However, once I picked it up, I realized why it had been rated the #1 business book on several all-time lists. It's easy to read in a story format. It flows easily and allows the reader to digest the information as if he/she were in the room with the characters. The story is based around manufacturing and plant management but weaves in the entire business organization/team building/leadership side of things as well. I would have preferred a few more business applications. That's the only reason I give the book 4 stars. Overall, it's a nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This was a required read in a process improvement class. A very unique and interesting way to learn about lean. This is a novel with story plots yet a clever and thought provoking way to teach the subject matter. I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite business book of all time","review":"This is by far my favorite business book and probably favorite overall book. It's a bit old, but still a classic. I'd especially recommend this book to someone who is new to manufacturing and theory of constraints. A great follow up book is the more modern, Velocity, which brings TOC together with lean and 6 sigma. Both books are co-written by Jeff Cox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle errors","review":"I have found various errors in the kindle edition of this book. Surely one should not compromise on quality editing when producing ebooks. It is quite irritating to come across so many errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"The 3 rings overlap with each other creating a thickness that does not allow normal 3 hole paper to move easily. I had to double punch my papers to create bigger holes just to get the rings to close properly and my papers don't \\"flip\\" easily. I would see if there is a different ring section for the rack system before purchasing these. (The rack system that goes with this is fine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No warranty-- beware!","review":"I purchased this about six months ago, and we've been happy with the quality until we pushed the pause button and it fell into the machine, ne'er to be seen again! Upon calling Amazon, I discovered what another reviewer mentioned... that there is no warranty, and apparently this company does not exist, as there is no website, no phone number, nothing available. It's a risky way to spend $140."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Warranty!","review":"Bought this DVD player November 2004. Initially it worked fine. 7 months later it won't read any DVDs & the screen stays blank. There apparently is no warranty for this product. I ended up buying a portable DVD player by Polaroid. Much better quality, a 7\\" screen and a warranty.If you buy the Malata DVD player invest in the One-Year Replacement Plan. Otherwise if it fails you are out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"My unit failed and the colors faded to a mostly black and white screen within the first 15 minutes of use. This item does not come with a manufacturer's warranty card, so be cautious if you want to the unit to be of use beyond Amazon's 30 day return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it not been defective...it would have been great...","review":"Had to return the one that we purchased as the screen kept flickering/waving up and down (non-viewable)in between normal play...during the brief moments that it would play straight in between the flickering, it looked fine...so had ours not been defective...it probably would have been worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No earphones?","review":"The discription says earphones. None got earphones in packages so should state that. Picture in steaky(lines)and not widescreen just full screen. Portable DVD Players are better with 10\\" or 11\\" screens,much clearer and use less battery power."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable and Interesting Book To Read!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book because the plot was intersting and it wasn't boring or depressing.I think this book is awfully nice but the mistakes confused me.Anyway,I think ya'll should read it cause it's really awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good book! better then sweet valley twins!","review":"FRANCINE PASCAL NEVER ANSWERED MY QUESTION! DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT IN THIS BOOK IT SAYS THAT THEIR IS A 6TH GRADE TEACHER WHEN THERE IS NO 6TH GRADE IN THIS SCHOOL. AND IT SAYS THAT JESSICA IS IN HOMEROOM, AND IN BOOK #1 THE GYM TEACHER SPECIFICALLY TOLD JESSICA AND ELIZABETH THAT THERE IS NO HOMEROOM IN SWEET VALLEY JR. HIGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"The premise is realistic and the added bits of romance and angst remind me so much of my junior high/middle school years. The basic story is that Jess has to plan a dance for Homecoming, so she gets all her friends to help, forgetting that some don't get along. One of the subtle themes that SV seems to be portraying more and more is to keep an open mind--don't judge on appearance or first impressions. In middle school and high school, this is definitely a theme that should be explored more. Ronald Rheece seems to be a total geek, Bethel very opinionated, and Kristin very superficial, but as the characters get to know one another, it becomes blatantly obvious that everyone has assets and faults, and that we can overcome them if we just keep open minds. This, in itself made the book excellent, but the clincher was the Damon-Jessica romance. Those two are destined to be together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Bad EBook","review":"This was a great read. The characters reminded me of what I remember of the inhabitants of Cannery Row and Tortilla Flats. They are engaging and colorful. I am glad to become acquainted with Mr. Russo and will read him in the future.That being said, the Ebook version I read was really poorly done. Random italics popped up throughout and distracting typos abounded. It looked like they'd run it through a cheap OCR and released to Kindle without reading it once. For instance, the \\"El\\" in \\"El Camino\\" consistently was printed with a UK Pound symbol sign instead of an E . (I don't have that key in this browser). Very distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"At The Top Of My List","review":"I read a lot and enjoy really good writing and storytelling. I don't think there is a better example of both than this novel. Russo is a great storyteller. And \\"Nobody's Fool,\\" in my opinion, is his best. The characters are different, rich and savory, unpredictable yet predictable, smart and quick, self destructive, full of life, memorable, laughable, and all become so believable we wish we knew them. The second reason his stories are so darn good is his writing. It is so effortless for the mind to absorb. You don't realize you are reading the story because you are so caught up in seeing it--the words just seem to materialize in your brain as real-life images. Great book. Great story. Even greater characters. I loved it and hated for it to end.Month's later P.S.: After reading a disappointing novel, I will reward myself by rereading a chapter or two from \\"Nobody's Fool\\" at my favorite coffee shop. My copy is now so tattered and worn I am going to have to buy another copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sully is not terribly likeable","review":"This novel was written well enough. My only real problem with it was that I couldn't relate in any way to the main character, and I'm doubtful that most literate people could. I wanted to like him, but he's a lazy man who doesn't take care of himself and throughout the progression of the book, he shows no improvement. It made it a little hard to care what happened to him enough to keep reading. Other characters were far more interesting (like the main character's landlady). I would've been interested to hear more from them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the kvelling?","review":"So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say \\"Hurrah\\" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much \\"muchiness\\" as the Brits would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Down to Earth, Humorous","review":"A must-not-miss book; when I turned the last page I regretted there was not more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure entertainment","review":"Richard Russo is a master of creating unforgettable characters and combining laugh-out-loud comedy with pathos. This is one book I could not put down! I will never forget \\"Sully\\", Miss Beryl and Rub (where did he get that name?) and the joys and tears in small-town America. I will read it again and again - do not want to miss one paragraph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Could I interest you in a cup of tea?\\"","review":"Richard Russo is quickly becoming my favorite author. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is filled with characters endowed with traits that either made me laugh out loud or cry. Donald Sullivan (Sully) the main character appears to be a disappointment to all but himself. He's lived a lifetime making mistakes and as he gets older he makes it clear, he has absolutely no intention of changing his ways, for anybody. As for his detractors, \\"I'll grow on 'em.\\" Sully's unpretentious attitudes during his dialogues are hysterically funny. Eventually, the reader realizes Sully is the type of person we all need in our lives, faults and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"POOR, POOR, POOR quality - DO NOT BUY - goes right into the trashcan.

My expectations fell through the floor. i notified the vender, NOT AMAZON, and they felt they had held up there end of the bargain admitted they knew about the stickers and the condition but felt their discription was accurate.

There is a dance section with clear instructions. The only thing I don't like about this DVD is there is no warm-up. There are plenty of drills throughout the program, which most other DVDs have not included, which has bothered me with other instructionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT for Beginners!","review":"I am not new to dancing but I am a total newb to belly dancing. There is no warm up at all. She just jumps right on in to the drills without any indication of what she is doing and doesn't even tell you ahead of time that she is about to introduce a new step. This would be good for someone who isn't new but just needs a refreshment. I might try this again after I watch it a million time and actually catch on to her routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"No at all easy to follow","review":"I bought these thinking it would be a step by step for total beginners, but it is very difficult to follow.

Each move flows into the next in a way that you can learn one part of the dance then the next part and so on in a way that is easy to learn. Its easy to follow along with the dancer. You can focus on each thing separately and get a great work out at the same time you are learning to dance.

I have harman kardon avr, and polk rm6880, as well as polk tsi 300 speakers, completing a tuned and precise 7.1 system. This turntable matches the quality, if not excedes my expectations. The range of sound, spacial seperation, and overall brightness of the music makes me wonder why i didnt purchase this turntable sooner.

Well this Beatles/Wings fan definately is AMAZED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, but add some extras","review":"My first test was on the Shure \\"Audio Obstacle Course\\" test record, the supplied cartridge did not do well. I added a Shure M97XE Cartridge and the improvement was dramatic, lower record noise and much better tracking at 2 grams.

The Internet didn't take over our lives until after 1997 - it hasn't been that long! So don't knock it. Those who claim it was a jaded idea when it was written could never have come up with anything with foresight like he could.This book is not representative of just how awesome Mr. Bova's writing is. I suggest reading Moonwar or The Kinsman Saga, anything from 1990 on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, plus it doesn't live up to its potential","review":"Cyberbooks was written in 1989, and is based on the premise that one day books will be delivered electronically to handheld devices, instead of printed on paper. Since you're reading this on ( ), you know that this was not particularly visionary - it's true today, barely a decade later. Even at that time, this was pretty easy to predict. That's not the book's main problem though. The problem is, it's pretty dumbed-down. I had read the Exiles Trilogy by the author a couple of times, and was disappointed by this book. I know he can write better. There are parts that read like Bova was going for a farce, but it's unclear - it may just be bad writing. The book also has some totally unnecessary about the Japonese. Get the Exiles Trilogy, not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but the description is wrong","review":"Okay I saw the movie just a few hours ago and none of what is described above is what I watched. Okay, yes a couple did clam to be forced to do acts infront of a camera but the rest of it is bogus, least the one I saw (it was a close to final film).Now to tell you a little about the movie, I'm not one for giving anything away so I'll leave it more as a \\"who done it\\" kind of movie.Silent Voyeur was leaps and bounds beyond what I expected from Georg Koszulinski. His first film Blood fo the Beast, was rough but anyone could see he had a story to tell and given the funds he could tell it, well Silent voyeur is it.The movie was at a perfect pace and always had you feeling wrapped up in the events. A great pychological thriller that should not be over looked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I'm a big heinlien fan.

The wand is very weak and hardly moves the metal filings around at all. My son uses a strong refrigerator magnet to play with this, but he just likes moving the filings around, and not making faces much.

This game interested him for a few minutes over a couple of days. not worth it.If you are looking for magnetic fun, I recommend magnetic super stones or magnetix building pieces or magna tiles.I would like to also mention that Find Cool Toys, the seller of this product, shipped in a timely manner, and their customer service was excellent.

Together they face challenges set before them by forces seemingly older then time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I Like most of JAK's books, but I was very disappointed in this one. I found the male-female medieval stereotypes annoying, and the fantasy plot and characters not good enough to counteract it. Usually one can count on JAK for some witty quips in even the more banal of her books, and this one didn't even have this. This is an older novel apparently, and it shows. My advice is to re-read one of the Arcane series instead - you will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasy romance","review":"I enjoyed this book the first time I read it quite a few years ago and I enjoyed it now...did I mention I really like this author?? well..

We followed the instructions precisely and got the project done over a three-day weekend. Unfortunately, I measured the rim and it is only 9' 9\\" which is pretty sad. The top of the sleeve is exactly at ground level so there is either a flaw in the hydraulic system or in the instructions. Secondly, the crank system for this backboard is pretty much trash. It is very difficult to crank up and down and I snapped 3 bolts before buying a grade 8 bolt from a hardware store.

It then did okay for two weeks of travel -- being pulled on and off of trains and taxis, rolling a few blocks to the next hotel, etc. -- but it was the Chicago-LA leg of the flight home that killed it off. It arrived with one of the end pockets hanging open -- the zipper was still there, but the zipper head had been pulled completely off the teeth and was nowhere to be seen. Good thing that we hadn't packed anything in that pocket!

BRING BACK MARLY MARL! C'mon LL, I know you got more talent than this...get angry again! Trust me, this is a sub-par performance for LL. I hope he can come back from it.

When you throw all your weight on one side to push it down to lock it, it will lock. But once you go to the other side to lock it, the first side pops up and unlocks. It's like a comedy routine. You may get it to seemingly lock on both sides, but one side will unlock at some point on its own.Also, this rail sits on top of the bed, so your blankets get pinned down on one side. If you were to use 2 rails, you could never get the covers up. The rails also sit in several inches, so a single bed gets very narrow.This product is unsafe, and with serious design flaws.

It's not safe!","review":"Sorry Safety 1st, but this is the worse product that I've ever purchased from your otherwise great brand. Ours broke before our daughter even had a chance to use it! We were practicing how to raise and lower the bed rail, and one side just broke off from the base. It's supposedly follows the new safety standards...this means that the rail clamps to the TOP of the mattress (as opposed to just being sandwiched between the mattress and box spring). But that new standard means that you lose some inches of bed space, and if the rail is going to break off, it's not safe anyway! I read the prior reviews and thought maybe some of the other parents weren't using it right or were just being too picky. But I learned my lesson. As a pediatrician and a mom, I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart with Baby in Bed!!","review":"This is the WORSE product!

My only issue was when my 22MO son somehow pulled one of the feet off when my wife was making the bed - considering the difficulty of putting it back together it shouldn't have been that easy to break it. PS - The sliding coupling inside the foot has lands that are supposed to stop the coupling at the top position that are somewhat pointed at the end and have determined that this is what made it so easy to be disassembled."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, just don't be dumb.","review":"It's always important to read the bad reviews to see the real reason why people don't like a product. In some cases, it's just ignorance that leads to a bad review. In the case of this bed rail, I saw that many people said (1) it doesn't fit thick mattresses and (2) it comes unlocked.All I can say is that if you're having these problems, then you're just not following the directions.First, there are thickness adjustments on each side. It comes shipped in the smallest position, so all of these stories about people stuggling to close the rail just make me laugh. Just open it all the way up, lock the \\"elbow\\" in place, and then squeeze it until the indicator shows \\"locked.\\" Done.As for unlocking, all I can say is that you didn't lock it in the first place. If I have one complaint, it's that it's too hard to unlock when properly locked. My wife can't even do it.Bottom line: while there might be better bed rails out there, this rail does work and does fit thick mattresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bed rail is NOT SAFE","review":"I purchased this product thinking that it would be not only safe, but help my daughter to make a nice transition from the crib to her big-girl bed (since the rail sits on top of the mattress, it would prevent her from getting stuck between it and the mattress, and would also make for a smaller sleeping space, more cozy, like her crib). I set it up and put her on the bed. It took my nineteen month-old one shake to get it to collapse. I thought for sure I did something wrong, so I checked everything, and relocked it. Second try, it collapsed again. I returned it and got a different model that is simpler, and amazingly enough, actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be safe but impossible to use","review":"This item is very awkward to set up and use. Never was able to get it to lock properly and finally gave up in frustration. It may be a very safe product but when it is unusable it is not safe at all.

My husband, an engineer, easily figured out how to set it up, and explained it to me, however the first time I tried to put it down, it broke at the elbow. My husband then had to jimmy a way to get the elbow back in. The second one did the same. Once secured, there is nothing that will get it to move, but it takes a long time to get it locked into place, even when you know how to do it.

My issue with this product is that the rail sticks out so unbelievably far from the bed when it is in the \\"down\\" position, I am absolutely certain that my son would have whacked his head while playing on the floor near the bed.

But I have bought 2 of them now and I prefer the \\"especially for toddlers\\" over this one. (I think that is the brand) The reasons for my opinion are:1. Because it sits on top of the bed, it takes up too much of the mattress. Some people like this feature and say it seems more secure, but I think it is just as secure as the other one that has a strap that locks under the entire mattress. This one takes up a good 2-3 inches of my sons bed!2. Although not impossible to put together, it did require more effort than the other one. The other one needed no tools for assembly.3. It is cheaper- usually people think cheaper in price means cheaper in value, but this is not the case.Trust me on this one. I have had both brands and the especially for toddlers brand is a better buy. If that one isnt available, fine- buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Aggravation!","review":"We originally purchased two of these bed rails for our twin daughters. We have now returned them THREE times due to the fact that they keep breaking at the elbow (mind you, these have been three different rails that have broken in the same way, not the same one breaking three times). When they are assembled and on the bed they've worked okay...occasionally the lock slips a little, but never enough to make the rail fall down. Unfortunately, this is the only rail available at our local store to fit our thick mattress. However, now that I have to return this again, I will be searching to find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use on Crib or Toddler bed.","review":"I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that \\"converts\\" into a toddler bed. Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib. There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed. Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space. After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again. It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed. My question is \\"WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety 1st bed rails","review":"I appreciated the added safety measures. However, the rails take up too much space on top of the mattress. They are not at all easy to use, difficult to lock and when disengaged they stick out about a foot from the bed making them unsightly and difficult to make the bed. A better \\"mousetrap\\" need be invented."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's terrible","review":"I didn't have this item 24 hours before I returned it. It was fairly easy to put together but hard as $%@ to flip down. It was also much too big for my daughter's bed and I am having flashbacks to how hard it was to take the darn thing apart so I could shove it back in the box and return it. It's no wonder that Walmart already has it on clearance. It's a poorly designed piece of garbage. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied--Returned The Product","review":"This product is very secure, but it is difficult to get the rail up and down. It was impossible to fool with everyday when trying to make the bed, so I returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought this bed rail and returned it the next day after fighting it for 30 minutes. My husband and I would get one side locked and the other side would pop out. A few times we got both sides to lock, and then would push on it as if were my son rolling against it. Both sides popped out every time. I had read the mixed reviews and thought I would try it because it is the only one Toys-R-Us or Babies-R-Us has. I am going to keep looking or just use pillows to cushion my son. I feel he is safer with no rail than with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this rail.","review":"I purchased this rail thinking it would be wonderful. One of the ones I bought broke at the elbow like others are complaning about. I went to return it and didn't have the box so I was unsuccessful. It also sticks out from the bed so far that when it is down I can't carry my toddler to bed and place him in while asleep. I am to short to do this and I am 5'5. I hope you will have other choices when you go to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT STAY LOCKED!!!","review":"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this rail and will return it asap. Bottom line: this rail does not stay in the locked position. I pull up the rail and lock it into position and verify, according to the directions, that the lock indicator window is green. Then, with just the tiniest bit of a pull inward by touching the top of the rail (such as a child may do while in bed), the rail unlocks and pops open completely. UNSAFE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsatified","review":"Short and to the point, do not buy this gate. It does not live up to its name or promises. The gate does not fold down very well and is rather difficult to get to stay locked and in the place that best fits your bed. It is sturdy but that is its only plus. I am looking for its replacement and will return it as soon as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyed mom","review":"I am very disappointed with this rail and plan to return it as soon as I can find another. I'm very frustrated that this seems to be the only rail sold in the stores around me.The main problem with this rail is that it doesn't stay in the locked position. In the past couple weeks of using the rail, it has only stayed in the locked position all night, maybe twice. Even when I use all of my weight to push the sides down so that the little silver ball is down and the window shows green, it still pops up. I can't imagine what to do differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOM OF 3 IN BROOKLYN","review":"THIS BED RAIL DOES STOP THE KID FROM FALLING OUT OF BED AND IT ALSO TAKES UP ABOUT SIX INCHES OF THE MATTRESS, COMPLETELY PREVENTS YOU FROM MAKING THE BED WITH OUT TAKING IT OFF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AGAIN AT NIGHT TO UNTUCK THE BLANKET. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO BUY MATTRESSES MORE OFTEN BECAUSE IT SQUEEZES THE MATTRESS IN ORDER TO LOCK AND AFTER ONLY A MONTH OF USE MY SONS MATTREESS HAS A PERMENANT INDENTATION. I HATE IT AND NOW CANT FIND ANY OTHER SINGLE BED RAIL THAT DOESN'T LOCK ON TOP OF THE MATTRESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within weeks","review":"We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first. I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it. The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in. As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer. There should be some way to fix it when it pops out. Definitely would not reccommend it. To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRY A DIFFERENT ONE!","review":"My son hasn't even slept in his new big bed yet and I already don't like this contraption! It's so cumbersome! It takes a college degree just to lock it into place and a whole lesson in rocket science to fold it down. I see no way to keep the bed looking nice and made when my son is not sleeping - and I can't even begin to think how terrible putting sheets on the bed with this thing will be. I'm taking it back tomorrow! I'm not even going to bother trying it out. I'm already frustrated! I'd probably throw the thing out a window if I had to keep it! What ever happened to the bed rails that just folded up and down flat against the side of the bed!? It wasn't all that long ago I babysat a boy who had one - where have they gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"I bought this bed rail because I liked the fact that it secured on top of the mattress. I felt this was a safer alternative to the bed rails I have used in the past that slide out from the mattress making it possible for children to become lodged in between the mattress and the bed rail.This product was very simple to assemble and seemed sturdy until I tried to put it on my daughter's bed. After locking it into position, all it would take is a simple nudge and it would disengage.I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for two nights","review":"I can certainly understand that some of the negative reviews come from a misunderstanding or inability to install the rail correctly. We also had this problem when we first set it up. We had to try several things before we figured out how to lock it properly. Once we had it locked we loved it! Two nights later I tried to lower the rail to tuck the sheets in and one side popped out. It is hard to explain what piece, but basically it was a section that was supposed to help the rail lower and it was already assembled when it came out of the box so it was impossible to push this particular piece back in from where it popped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this bed rail! Dangerous!","review":"This bed rail BREAKS and is a danger to your child. It works like large jaw that bites the mattress. It can be tightened at the top of the mattress and at the bottom. The bottom connection is what breaks. Its mechanism includes one of those metal press-in buttons. On one of our bedrails, the metal button ripped off! On the other, the housing for the metal button pulled out of its socket. Neither can be fixed. Neither can be secured in any way that will keep your child safe. Do not endanger your child with this flimsy contraption."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD!!!","review":"First of all Safety 1st's claim that this rail is for mattresses up to 10 inches thick is WRONG! We first tried it on a new mattress for my son (9 inches thick) and there was no way this thing would fit. After repeated tries we finally tried it on a thinner, older mattress (6 inches thick) and it took my husband leaning with all his weight repeatedly for this thing to fit! Forget about having to go thru this everytime I need to change the sheets!! Bottom line: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock Pops Up","review":"I bought this bed rail looking for a convenient way to secure my daughter in her bed. She is moving into the twin from her crib. It was convenient and easy to assemble, however upon installation the rail poped up and unlocked itself. The directions call for you to push down on the rail until the base locks and the top guides show a green locked icon. After doing so I noticed the red creeping back into the window and then after about 3 mins. one side completely onlocked. I returned it and grabbed another, thinking it was a one time flaw - but the second one did it as well. I was really disappionted in this bed rail, it had me sold on the touting that their \\"no gap\\" system was better than its competition. However 0 for 2 tries is now a waste of my time and money. I will be selecting from another line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this bed rail -- there are many better choices!","review":"I bought this gate to put on my bed for nights when one of my kids (ages 3 and 1) crawled into bed with us. The assembly went fine and I didn't have any trouble securing it to the mattress. Within the first hour of my one year old sleeping next to the rail, she slammed her head against the not-padded metal pole that runs along the bottom of the bed rail. How can Safety 1st make a product that goes on top of a child's bed and not pad the metal pole??? My active sleepers would hit this rail every night. I had to line the bed rail with pillows to avoid future injury. In addition, we had the same trouble as many others when the plastic piece popped out of one of the legs when my husband tried to put the rail down to its unacceptably protruding down position and we were unable to get it back in without it popping right back out. This rail is going back to the store, even though we threw out the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this bedrail","review":"I completely understand why there are so many negative reviews for this bedrail. The first problem is that it takes up about 6 inches off of the mattress. The second problem is that to lock it in place you have to significantly squeeze the mattress. (After continued use this will definitely damage the mattress.) Third, it takes a lot of effort to put it up and down (for changing sheets, etc.). I am going to return this and look for another bedrail."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product - not sure what others are talking about!","review":"I have read the reviews and been using this bed rail for about 9 months now. My son co-sleeps with me while my husband is at work and I bought this rail to keep my sone from rolling out of the other side of the bed. I have a pillow top plush mattress and have no problems getting this rail on and off the bed and opened to change sheets several times a week (and I am now 8 months pregnant!).The rail has TWO places to release it to make it open bigger to put on and off the mattress and opens to well OVER 12\\" so I am not sure why anyone has problems securing it. Mine has NEVER popped open and now with my son at 17 months old, it takes some pretty good abuse and kicking when he starts jumping around on the bed.I highly recommend this product! I like that is long and I don't worry that my son can 'scoot' around it while sleeping"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"If you are in search of a bedrail you will quickly be dismayed by the limited selection available at the typical chain stores. Toys/Babies R Us carry this one in the store, and where I shopped in RI, it was the only choice. So home it came. And back it will go. I do not wish to fiddle with the loose hinges and cranking sounds that push the mattress down, (creating a slope for my 2 year old to roll down)when I am trying to quietly put my son to sleep. It takes up 6 inches off mattress space and doesn't even have the decency to provide padding. Not to mention the fact, that once you do figure out how to \\"fold it down\\" the thing protrudes out from the mattress a good 4-6 inches, not only looking ugly, but creating a place for the child's LEG TO GET TRAPPED during daytime use!Ridiculous. product.

This is the last album before Jay blew up and went mainstream. Which means this is arguably his most gutter hood album. With this record you can hear his pain, regrets, paranoia and insight into the mind of a hustler. You can tell that he knew that he was in position to become the man once \\"BIG\\" was gone. My favorite cuts are Imaginary Player, A Million, Streets is Watching, Who you Wit, Where I'm from, and You must love me. Don't Sleep!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not as bad as people have been saying it was","review":"After the death of King Of New York superstar Biggie Smalls aka The Notorious B.I.G, questions were circling about who was going to take his spot. Many suspected Jay-Z to fill in that position, unfortunetly this album didn't convinence many listers. Personally that album wasn't that bad, although more commercialised than this pervious LP \\"Reasonable Doubt\\". The album has a few gems that it could done without, like \\"I Know What Girls Like\\" and \\"Sunshine\\", but with cuts like City Is Mine, Friend Or Foe '98 and Streets Is Watching along with many more, you can't go wrong with this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifetime Collection","review":"Jay-Z, Jigga, Jahova or whatever you call him he have what you're looking for. The moment I got to track 3 \\"I Know What Girls Like\\" it has been well worth picking this up. For a successful artist, ghostwriter and business man, I was glad to hear \\"Imaginary Player\\". This song he goes for the throat to all emcees/rappers that talk that bling, bling talk by questioning where's all that you say in your rhymes. On this release you can finish listening to the previous release \\"Who You Wit II\\" with an extra verse. In My Lifetime goes through his life and Jay's accomplishments. \\"You Must Love Me\\" is probably the best song ever recorded by Jigga that no one pays attention to. The \\"Face Off\\" featuring Sauce Money is a great collaboration how the both of them oppose all competitors, including women. As a great comparison of \\"Rap Game/Crack Game\\" in conclusion I'll tell you this...In My Lifetime, Vol.1 is dope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The jigga man!","review":"Jay-Z is excelente rapper/singer.

Fans of rap would like The city is Mine, I know Mhat Girls like with Puff and Lil'Kim, Lucky Me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"\\"An Ordinary Hero\\" by Debra Feldman succeeds on many levels. I was looking for a historically-based novel that delved into the emotions felt by soldiers in Vietnam, a new view of the issues dealt with by Tracy Kidder in \\"My Detachment\\". What I found was much different, but I couldn't put it down until I finished.\\"An Ordinary Hero\\" is about \\"Reweavers\\" who travel back in time to correct mistakes. Feldman's powerful characters get second chances. They can create an alternate history, if hints provided by the Reweavers allow them to avoid moral lapses that sent them down the wrong path the first time.Is this book a mystery; is it science fiction; or perhaps it's a mystical parable about the consequences of moral lapses? Don't worry about classifying this novel - just enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Class!","review":"Machan delivers a smooth mix of classically styled jazz numbers that leaves the listener begging for more. Her vocal range is tremendous and the session players are perfect. Machan is talented, sexy, and savvy enough to surround herself with musicians who match her skill at every turn. Buy it...Listen...and Enjoy. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machan shines!","review":"Machan's first release shines with some very well written songs executed soooo beatifully with her great guitar playing and beautiful, rich voice.Machan has gained great experience touring wuth some top names such as Sting, Pink Floyd and Pat Benatar and it shows in the tonal beauty on this cd as well as her second release.I suggest this CD to anyone who's a lover of great smooth jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"R&B, Japanese style","review":"Pushim stands out among the legions of recent Japanese R&B-influenced singers . . . she actually has a voice, a style, and well-written material. This music should be accessible even to non-speakers of Japanese: although she uses only a smattering of English, that is preferable to others who try to sing in a foreign language when their skills are not really up to the task. If you want your J-pop in English, try Hikaru Utada (although I think only her very early CubicU album is all-English, hopefully there will be more in the future). And if you like Pushim, definitely buy \\"Colorado\\" by Tina!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I will always love this series!","review":"I was 14 when this series came out and I remember sneaking and watching it in my room. I was/am totally in love the Marcus and Krista. To be honest (I'm going to get attacked for this) I've never been a Blade fan, Wesley always really creeped me out and I've never enjoyed the movies. I love the work put into the vampires on this show though, and I adore the Marcus/Krista relationship because I think it's highly complex. Marcus is in my top fav bad guys ever. I miss this show, I was so upset when I found out they quit making it. Seriously, if I had a genie, I'd make him bring this show back with it's original cast (I was furious to see Jill wasting her talent on wipeout!!!). I watch this series once or twice a year, and I miss it so much </3 ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different take on Blade","review":"Important to note if buying this DO NOT also buy Blade: House of Chthon. That is included in the complete series as the two part opener. Moving on Fingaz is no Snipes. But ther stories are strong. The supporting cast is actually better than most of the movies. Except of course Kris Kristofferson, he's the man! BUt the series is far better than Blade Trinity, but not as good as the first two Blade movies. Interesting side note, there are topless women in the tv show, but there were never any in the movies... odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously??? Big let down.","review":"Had high hopes for this show & it let me down. Week Lead actor!!!! Or perhaps bad directing. Bad writing & editing. Leaves you hanging at the end.

Blade 1 & 2 were great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a series","review":"It was a cool show. Good follow up to the movies. The guy that played Blade was cool.

I miss it!","review":"I totally looked forward to Wednesday nights on SpikeTV for Blade: The Series! It was a fun show which kept true to the Blade movies and even added some fun along the way. With the budget that Spike had to make this series it did a fantastic job! It left me wanting more after every episode! I couldn't believe that it had to be cancelled because it got too expensive for Spike to produce. I wish it got picked up by someone else. The acting was more than adequate, and the special effects and fight scenes were great! I was waiting for the Season release on DVD, and now that it is around the corner I will be purchasing it the day it comes out! All the nay-sayers of this series need to remember that it was a TV show and not a big budget movie. Spike and the directors and writers did a great job with this. It's pretty obvious that it had an audience if it is being released on DVD! BUY IT and enjoy some comic book fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shame it didn't last longer than it did.","review":"This is a very good series and a great companion to the three Blade movies with Wesley Snipes. It continues on where the movies left off and Kirk \\"Sticky\\" Jones was an excellent replacement for Snipes. I give it four stars instead of five only because of the way the series ended. It's a shame it didn't last longer than it did (13 episodes, one season). Other than that, it was really good. I highly recommend this for any Blade fan or any person who likes vampire and/or action films or tv shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"it popped right up","review":"it came fast and popped up very easy I could do it all by myself.

I do keep mine up, but it fits perfectly between my house and garage and is ziptied to the fence on the third side. The stakes that are supposed to hold it in place are pretty flimsy and bend easily. It works for my needs, but then again it is not out in the open. You get what you pay for and for the price you can't expect something super sturdy. I think it will work for most people as long as you are using it when it is up and take it down as soon as you are done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not sturdy","review":"The canopy is nice and looks good.

I have since gone to stores and looked at other models which are made with much stronger materials. Several people were inpressed and we were delighted until the second time we tried to set the unit up. It costs $63.00 to buy a replacement rod for the one that snapped, at what look like a construction flaw. I was stupid to not check on the warranty before purchasing. I now understand why there is none, this is a flimsy waste of my money. We now must purchase another unit which is made of better materials, maybe if you did not plan on setting up and taking down this unit often it would be a good buy, but that did not meet our needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap not well made","review":"you would think something this heavy would be better made, for one the bag didnt have wheels, it was so heavy the straps that it did have started to tear when i took it to my car, set up easy however the wind blew it over,no big deal we picked it up and tried to collapse it to pack up and a few bars were went out of shape, VERY THIN FRAGILE metal, it took 4 people & nearly a hour ( luckily the campers next to use helped) tocollapse it since it wasnt bending right related to bend polls. so its heavy and cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark & moody","review":"This is definitely Darkseed's best album to date. With \\"Diving into Darkness\\" Darkseed has honed their songwriting skills considerably. The songs are for the most part midtempo doom-rockers and have plenty of catchy hooks.Overall, the album is driven by crunchy, distorted guitars and a punchy rhythym section. The vocalist sings in a Nick Holmes/James Hetfield style for the most part, occasionally punctuated by death growls. Electronics and synths are featured on this album much moreso than on previous releases, but they mixed tastefully into the songs so they don't dominate but rather add character and atmosphere. No one will mistake this for Depeche Mode.If you like your metal moody and melodic, then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some notable highlights","review":"The first piece, Wq 31, is my favorite on this CD. Its first movement captures all the delights of JS's counterpoint, while encapsulating the essence of CPE's unique style. Alternating fits of boisterous activity are tempered by contemplative reflection. The transitions are engineered brilliantly.For some reason, I find this music pairs well with driving on winding mountain roads in wet weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not funny and a waste of time and money","review":"This book is not funny - a total waste of time and money. Poorly written, awkwardly constructed and riddled with humor not worthy of fifth graders. I do not know who these so-called writers are, but they are not humorists. Avoid at all costs"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Andi, but I Could Do Without Pop Up","review":"Leave it to Andi Sexgang to do something different. Pop Up is a collection of mostly superfluous (and bad) remixes. The only track even worth mentioning is Archimedes Dub: Eureka! The band always had a soft spot for dub, as evidenced by the last (and, as far as I can tell, untitled) track on The Wrath of God, and Mongolia and Who on Earth Can That Be? from Deiche. Otherwise, this album ranges from the pointless (a mix of Barbarossa without guitar?!?) to the painful (does anyone really want to hear what Andi's voice sounds like slowed down?). For rabid completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment. I expected many more things","review":"The book has nice black and white photographs which capture many aspects of the typical Israeli soldier's life but the text is very poor and absolutely not engaging, to the point of being a major disappointment. If the photographs are not your main motive to buy a book, avoid this title and read the old but still good book \\"A Portrait of the Israeli Soldier\\" by Reuven Gal or any of the Israeli sodliers' memoirs published recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little away from being awful.","review":"The only redeeming factors of this film were the lead, Brian White, the female lead (aka bad girl) and antagonist. Those 3 actors save a pretty weak story and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. As a writer looking into exploring a gigolo story line, I'm happy to see this film step into every cliche you'd expect plot wise. Screen writers need to watch bad films to see the pitfalls they must avoid in their own work, and this movie is a great example of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad movie.","review":"Another pretty good urban drama to have in your collection. These may not be the best actors in the world, but they will most definitely do. In fact, i think all of the \\"Trois\\" movies are pretty good to have in your collection.

The acting was second rate at best, the plot was weak and the main woman in the story pictured in the background on the box cover was cute but not all that appealing to me.I've seen all of the Trois movies and each one up to the second one got better, but this one was a major bomb. The story revolves around an up and coming rap artist who turns to becomming a male escort in order to pay off his debts. He meets a woman who gets him established in the business, she runs his affairs, cares for him and becomes quite attached to him. Soon, he learns that paying off his debts are the least of his problems. He falls in love with one of his clients and things begin to fall apart from there. The scenes had no spark to them and the actresses seemed to be trying too hard to be something that should come almost naturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Organizer!","review":"I have three of these organizers and love them!

To me, a Game Boy which is incompatible with classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games is no Game Boy. Instead, I would go with the Game Boy Advance SP because you get a backlit screen (which the Game Boy Micro offers as well) as well as compatibility with all classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games (which the Game Boy Micro does NOT offer). Because of its incompatibility with classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games, I cannot recommend the Game Boy Micro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god!!!

IS THIS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF NINTENDO'S MARKETING SCAMS, OUT TO ROB EVERY VIDEO GAME FAN OF THEIR LAST PENNY?! YES, YES, I KNOW THAT THIS THING IS SMALLER, BUT WHY BOTHER WHEN YOU CAN PAY TWENTY DOLLARS LESS FOR AN SP?! I HAVE NO IDEA WHY NINTENDO WOULD MAKE SUCH A STUPID THING AS THE GAMEBOY MICRO!

And he gives a whole bunch (more than 200) questions employers might ask along with an inciteful description of how they might be answered. While the reader is not expected to memorize the 200+ questions, they can learn a very effective pattern on how the employer's questions can be answered.

Can't quite think of what the makers of this one were imagining. Not bad photography and an intriguing premise can't save this improbable, poorly acted thriller from losing its way early on. Entire scenes begin and end, and nothing of any consequence happens...then, when the passengers start disappearing (on a boat so small this plot device is inconceivable) logic disappears as well. The crowd I watched this with threatened to mutiny, especially in the film's excruciating last half hour, in which the \\"mystery\\" is revealed.

Norsworthy's prose sings and his plots sizzle, creating a page-turning impulse that leads the reader through a wild collection of characters, circumstances and and eventualities. Those who generally prefer novels will delight in the intertwining of the characters and locations from story to story. This is a gritty, realistic book that brings the past in direct conflict with the present, presenting jarring choices to the characters and a new understanding of America to the reader.

As other reviews have stated this isn't going to heat up a large area, but it wasn't designed to do so. I'm using for work in an enclosed vehicle without the engine running. I previously used a much larger Mr. Heater which ate up all the oxygen quickly and really wasn't a good idea. This heater however, is rated at a fraction of those BTU's so it's much safer and gives off plenty of heat to cut that freezing chill and create a comfortable environment where I don't need a big coat or gloves.The reason for 4 stars: As others have said it smells when new, and in a enclosed vehicle I noticed a haze filling the space which probably isn't good to breathe. This however is subsiding as I near the end of the first tank of fuel, which has lasted a long time.Now this doesn't have a low oxygen sensor, or tip over shut off like the Mr. Heater products so you'll have to be more careful, but overall happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent blind heater","review":"Excellent blind heater. I did run two full cans of fuel through it before taking it to the blind. The smell at first use is terrible and do not attempt using it before burning it off with at least one tank of fuel.

I have always been drawn to historical biographies (\\"Galileo's Daughter\\", \\"The Last Alchemist\\") and this tale of William Dampier, a sometimes pirate and alltimes scientific observer, really captivated me. I'm not too well versed in the time period covered by the book (the 1680 through 1714) so I found much to be surprised and entertained by. Descriptions of the wild and rough life on the fringes of European civilization contrasted well with the glimpse provided of little-touched or oftentimes completely unexplored islands in the Pacific. I was also interested in the depictions of the buccaneer culture, its social conventions and the consequences that result in disrupting that society. It was a fascinating time, Dampier was a very interesting character and \\"A Pirate of Exquisite Mind\\" was an enjoyable and enlightening book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written bio of an interesting guy","review":"Dampier was a fascinating person, a real live buccaneer and also one of our first naturalists. Since I like buccaneers and naturalists, he works well for me. The book is fun to read and well-researched. I dug it.If you're into books about explorers, you can check out my list - imaginatively titled \\"Books about explorers\\" - for a few more recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read and a Good Reference","review":"This account of the life and times of William Dampier is refreshingly detailed. The authors successfully described the 17th Century world in all of its gritty reality. With these hard and unforgiving times as a backdrop, the reader can realize what Dampier was up against and how only an exquisite mind could accomplish what he did, under those circumstances.I heartily recommend this read for anyone interested in seafaring in the 1600's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dampier taught scientists how to observe.","review":"William Dampier had a quite interesting life, but not easy one. This lovely book brings him back from relative obscurity in a very vivid manner. What I would consider as a most important about him, is that he truly directed scientists of his time to the method of detailed and careful observing. During his first two lengthy voyages...first as a buccaneers' companion, second as a captain of the official scientific expedition...he stunned England with his books offering unexpected details related to weather, ocean movement, biology, anatomy and anthropology among many other fields.That made him an important precursor to James Cook and Charles Darwin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only conscious vibes come from this CD...if you listen well.","review":"Capleton has been around for a while and if he continues singing like a prophet then he's gonna be around for a lot longer.

It does an excellent job. Starting with recordings from 1906, it takes the listener on a chronological trip through women's music. Thoughtful, and beautifully packaged, I can't recommend this collection highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Joni?","review":"If Amazon had a half-star system, I would have given this (otherwise) fantastic collection a four and a half. Missing Joni is not enough to cost it a star, just half.But rather bewildering, considering Joni being one of the most influential women in rock, and considering Rhino's access to her Reprise and Asylum catalogs.But really, this is one hell of a box set. Just the first two discs alone are worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content is good but disjointed in many places","review":"The content is probably good but it is very disjointed in many places. Large print is good. Mitchell Parry's book \\"The Road to Optimism: Change Your Language, Change Your Life\\" is less disjointed. I think that the content could be written better if only one author was writing it. I found the first half of the book was much better in content and flow than the last half of the book. It didn't flow for easy understanding. I find that a good book makes me want to read it again. I have little interest in reading this one a second time. NOTE: I only read non-fiction books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Recommend","review":"Sorry this is one of the few products I wish I did not buy. I hate to give a negative review but I have too. First on this product the cover does not slide fully over key where your key hooks to the key ring. Your key ring only through the rubber loop on the end and not your key it's self. So basically your relying on the rubber jacket to hold your key in. Which I tried mine in the blue one and jingled my keys around and the my key falls out. The Black key light was tighter but still don't trust it. But Being a person who where his keys on belt clip I do not trust my key slide into this product. I have lost several key ring tools and quick connect key ring separators to know things come off and go missing. So having my key held in by a feeble rubber sleeve as my keys swing around during the day I am going to have to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not secure key","review":"There is only one problem with this product but unfortunately it��s a huge problem.

In a rare dilletantish mood, Sacks rambles around Micronesia shaking hands and looking at vegetation. Absent are the usual meticulous studies of the human mind; the passion is diluted by a rambling, shambling pseudostructure of historical fragments, slogging through ruins, and hanging out with old chums.

But this book is so disjointed and rambling. It's all fluff and hardly any meat. It could have been expanded and written as four good books: one totally about the Island of the Colorblind; one totally about Cycads; one totally about the neurological disease bodig on Guam; and the final one containing all of Dr. Sacks' trivia about the Pacific Islands.Jumping back and forth between the story and the voluminous notes was irritating, and the notes, while interesting, were not especially necessary for the most part. The good doctor does not go as indepth as he has in his previous books and this is sorely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sense Of Wonder","review":"Oliver Sacks is able to convey his sense of wonder about the compexities of nature in such a way as to pass that wonderment and curiosity to the reader. In \\"Island of the Colorblind\\" he reveals the potential strangeness and uniqueness of life on islands. He describes how islands, by their very nature, isolate life-forms which develop unique strains of animals or plants. Islands are protected from the forces occuring on large land masses and species adapt in their own way. The Pacific atoll of Pineglap, unknown to me before, is inhabited by islanders born totally colorblind. Guam is inhabited by an inordinate number of people with the neurodegenerative disease, ALS. Merely being aware of these mysteries reinforces the feeling of humility in the midst of natural forces we feel so inadequate to fully understand. If you want to be reminded of the curiosity and sense of wonder you had as a child, savor Oliver Sack's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Portrait of Capetian France","review":"This books provides a well written history of Capetian France, covering the monarchs as well as society, the economy and the monarch's relations with the Church.

For Mara and Dann to have finally reached the North and home was super but I selfishly wanted them to experience a hundred more adventures. Thank you for such a smashing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Read More Than Once in a Lifetime","review":"This is a futuristic story of the world taken to the brink of time. The characters are Doris Lessing's most unforgetable.I place Mara as being one of the most unforgetable heroines of all times and Dann- the troubled boy child of a civilization on the brink of non-existance. The trials they endure ,the peoples they meet and conquer, all add up to a very fine read indeed. The story is gripping with the world in utter chaos at the end of an Ice Age. Doris Lessing has managed to play with mental illness in a futuristic world, showing how the depth of unease can mar a child for all time. I can't believe I missed this book for so long. It truly is a good read and not easily put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally captivating","review":"I couldn't put this book down. The world Doris Lessing creates is captivating and I was completely caught up in the plight of Mara and Dann's journey. One of the most original and exciting books Doris Lessing has ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"I really tried to like this book, but I just couldn't. There were too many occasions where the author asked me to suspend my disbelief so that the plot could continue. How do the same people end up always finding each other? The relationship between the main characters made me very uncomfortable, and I am not a complete prude. The way love in most forms was presented in this novel was completely disheartening, and as a mother, the way that children were portrayed in this work was difficult to stomach. I understand that the idea here is that we are all destroying our world, and given the chance to do it all again we most likely would make the same stupid mistakes, but there were very few characters to like or admire in this book. I really didn't care if they made the same mistakes we make every day...frankly I was hoping to see the last of all of them very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"A highly recommended book.

Thus, this \\"current treatment\\" book misses full five years of stent development and progress. Also, I have not found any quoted study from the years 2001 and 2002. How can this book pretend to review current diagnostic and treatment strategies (the copyright of this book is from 2003)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cursory info at best","review":"I am a Nurse Practitioner seeking a one-stop, all-inclusive cardiology resource. This is not it. In fact, there is more indepth info in the cardiology sections of my Internal Medicine books.

My apologies to the editor and contributors, I am sure you are fine cardiology professionals, but the book doesn't quite cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"nice concise review but may be too basic for many. not cardiology board directed. reasonable accumulation of various trials but seems to lag behind when concerned about some newer therapies / stents etc. useful as aid during med school, residency and quick aid for cardio fellows as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"No mention of ME (CFS) a very common and extremely disabling disease incorporating cardiomyopathy. Running treadmill tests on ME patients is very detrimental to them as post exertional malaise is a hallmark of the disease. Cardiologist should be aware of the exercise contraindication.Also ME patients have reduced ejection, low blood volume, orthostatic intolerance, and increased cardiac disease mortality.

I bought this one for my teenage daughter for her birthday and within 3 days of using it , the shutter button stopped working. Amazon paid for the shipping back, no problem, but cannnot replace it with a new one because they won't be stocking any more of this model . This leads me to believe that I am not the only one that has had a problem with this camera. Research others as I would avoid this one even though the price is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reliability","review":"I owned this camera for a bout 8 months and took very good pictures. Than out of the blue I got a focusing error and the lens would not detract. The product is out of warranty and would cost too much to repair. I will never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet! Digi Cam Hero! Got stars in my eyes!","review":"I am giving it 4 stars...I got this camera today and it is really small compared to my old hp 315 camera. It takes great pictures but the shutter takes a while to snap things like a cat. It has no sound for video ): that realy hurt me but I got used to it I bought this for a digi not a video. The battries drain if you leave the LCD on a long time...1 hour latter my battries were dead but I was taking alot more videos than pics. Then the ISO settings suck and a dumb I mean up to 400 I would spend more that 40 bucks for this camera which I did get it for that price. I would get a cannon or kodak for a little more money but his camera is great for 40 bucks! so in the end 0 stars, Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This is a good camera for taking photos...outside...in good light...if nothing is moving. I bought it to replace a similar older Fuji. This camera is not nearly as good as the older one. Most photos are blurry or out of focus. Colors are not great. I wish I could get my money back on this bad boy. My advice...if you do buy it...take lots of pics quickly. Inspect. I've loved Fuji in the past, but this one is a dog and a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuji Finepix A500","review":"A wonderful camera to use. Ease of use and compact makes it a great camera to take along where ever you go. I certainly couldn't complain of the price either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Camera","review":"I love this camera in every way except the power button, which is very tiny even for 5'3\\" me. Also, you cannot always tell in bright lighting if the picture has taken, although it usually has.What I love is its size and the quality of the pictures - inside and outside.Downloading from it is a simple process.Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuji have gone really cheap","review":"No rechageable batteries,no dock, no web cam feature why did I ever buy this.The zoom on it sucks.Should have stuck with my A340"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of hard earned dollars","review":"This is my second Fuji Digital Camera. The first one failed with a \\"ZOOM ERROR\\" after only a few months of average use. The camera was useless. I returned it to the place of purchase, and of course the model is no longer in production. After an argument with the store manager, they allowed me to trade up to the newer model, charging only the difference.Well After about a year of average use, I got the exact same \\"ZOOM ERROR\\" message on the newer model. I do not want to pay $250 every two years for a camera, so this will be my last FUJI purchase. When I spend money, I expect reliability, and FUJI misses the mark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera for a Business Traveler","review":"I bought the Fujifilm Finepix A500 as a camera to pack in my PC case on business travel. I use it mainly to get candid snapshots in business meetings and conferences. It is small, discrete, and works well for the purpose intended. The 5MP resolution allows me to get quick shots without much care for composition, background clutter, etc. since I use a photo editor to take care of those tasks later-on. When buying this camera note that it does not have a case or much on-board storage. An XD memory card and a case are necessary. I also recommend getting a NiMH battery charger to keep battery replacement costs low."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke within three weeks","review":"The camera stopped functioning within three weeks of purchase. It would no longer close or zoom. It did however take excellent photos while functioning, so it doesn't get the worst rating. We are still awaiting the camera's return from Fujifilm. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a little disappointed in the product. Having owned another Fuji digital (which I loved!)and going by the customer reviews I thought this would be a good little camera. Picture quality is excellent, but it is really poor on getting candid shots. The shutter activates so slowly that you don't get the picture that you thought you snapped. Good for outdoor scenery and stills. Not so good for photographing the grandkids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great color","review":"I used this several times, took about 50 pictures with camera, I was disappointed.Compare to my old Fugi A201(2 mega pixel), this A500 does not have good color; it may have better resoltion but the color on photo are not as good as A202.When I checked the spec on those 2 camera side by side, A201 has RGB filter on CCD while A500 ihas just high resolution CCD.Anyway, A500 is disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satsfied","review":"This is a good affordable camera.I really don't have any complaints.Just make sure you don't buy any cheap batteries,cause the camera wont operate or go off after a lilwhile.I personally use the lithium batteries with thiscamera and they last me for a long time dependingon how often you use the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silver Boxes","review":"The book was repetitive and boring. One theme, that could have been stated in a paragraph, was repeated over and over again to create a book. I found it to be primarily about what wonderful things the author has done for people, with letters praising her over and over. Yuk. I read this as a selection for our church's book club, and skimmed the last quarter of it because it simply had nothing to say that it had not been said before. I appreciate the sentiment, just felt that the author spent more time praising herself than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Florence is obviously a Silver Box sent from God, to share such real and needed topic. I have really enjoyed this book; I have shared it with the womens group I lead at my church. The real life examples within this book inspired me to become a better mother, daughter, friend and person. The author is sensitive and loveing while teaching the art of encouragement. You learn to uplift others while becomeing a better person yourself. I highly recommend this book if you have ever been hurt by harsh words or if you have ever hurt someone by an unkind comment. The Lord can use the stories in this book for you to find healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Boxes is the best book I have read.","review":"This book changed my life. I have attended Florence Littauer's speaking engagements on this subject. If she is in your area, it will be the best $$ you ever spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Florence Littauer Classic","review":"Silver Boxes by Florence Littauer has been around for years and it continues to be read and enjoyed for a good reason; it is full of stories from a writer and speaker who has experienced life and taken notice of people. Florence has collected firsthand stories from many of those who have taken her Christian Leadership and Speaking Seminar (CLASS) and these stories are often moving.If your spiritual gift is exhortation you will be especially inspired to step out and exercise your gift in a hurting world.If exhortation is not your gift, Florences stories may open your eyes to to the many people you may pass by each day, not realizing how meaningful your words can be to others.This book is inspirational but (like all of Mrs. Littauers books) it is also practical. It is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Boxes","review":"This is as \\"must have\\" book. We have bought several to pass out to friends. (A real gift of encouragement.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the most encouraging books I have ever read.","review":"This book not only encouraged me, but taught me alot about encouraging other people, and how much that encouragement means to all of us and how it can really shape our lives. It is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose Your Words","review":"I first read Silver Boxes about 20 years ago, and the lessons are still with me. I bought 3 more copies to give away as gifts. It doesn't matter what your budget is, what your background is, or what education have, you have the gift of words. Littaurer shares how our words can be like gifts, all wrapped up in a silver box, and also, how our own words can destroy someone's dreams forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"AwesomeReminds us all that our words can change the world!","review":"Inspirational and fun to read! Uplifting on anyday. One of those books that you can pick up anytime and get a lift! It made me want to look for Florence Littauer's next speaking engagement, so I could meet her in person.

It's wonderful","review":"I listened to the audio book, which is long but wonderful! Once you get through the book you will have learned several very valuable lessons. Mr. Spence provides several approaches for winning your case and learing how to be genuine and convincing. He advocates an emotional and honest investment in your situation and he tells you exactly how to do it. It works, and although many of his cases give court room stories, anyone can apply it to their own life outside the court room. We often interrogate others while being interrogated in life. Check it out!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sodom dropped the ball big time","review":"Sodom made some pretty great albums before they made this album. It sounds like they came up with every song in just a few minutes, or maybe Tom had vocals prepared and he just yelled them over random riffs. You can't hear the guitar that much anyway. It's mostly just drums and yelling. That makes no sense. The only times you can hear the guitar is on those stupid german punk songs. There's at least 3 of them. If you like Sodom, you should get every album that isn't this one. I'm not a big fan of \\"Masquerade in Blood\\" but it's way better than this one. I have no idea what they were thinking. \\"Tapping The Vein\\", the album that was released the year before \\"Get What You Deserve\\" had the same people in the band except Chris Witchhunter was replaced by Atomic Steif. Andy Brings made some awesome riffs on \\"Tapping The Vein\\". It was more of a death metal album. So in short, THIS ALBUM IS RETARDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No stories to tell","review":"Tracy Chapman can certainly sing in a unique, emotional way. No doubt about that.The trouble is, with the album Telling Stories, that she has nothing new to contribute. She has become more joyful, less worrying, and maybe that's why her music doesn't really work out anymore. It doesn't catch. It bores.Pity.Buy her beautiful - but sad - debut album instead of Telling Stories. 'Cause Tracy Chapman has no stories to tell anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not bad...it's just boring.","review":"I could find no other word to describe this album.I love Tracy Chapman. I have most of her CDs. Her debut being her best album and one of the few albums I have from the 80's that still sounds fresh. And New Beginning was an amazing work with a blues touch that Tracy sounded comfortable with. And her newest release \\"Let it Rain\\" is definitely her most beautiful sounding album (in fact I'm listening to it now).But this one is I guess anti-climatic (maybe because it was after the big success she had with \\"Give me one Reason\\"). I really didn't hear a standout track. Nothing really grabbed my attention as if saying, \\"Stop what you're doing! Your mind and ears are mine!\\" All of her albums are solid and full of talent but this album just seems so...ehh (sigh) compared to New Beginning and lackluster next to Let it Rain.

We all feel for you. I have lost those close to me before, and I can identify with your position. I'm sorry. We all are. Sorry that you've lost something that used used to be so close to all of our hearts, something you expressed boldly yet beautifully through your formerly impressive music. You have lost your originality. You have lost you talent for writing songs with passionate, emotional lyrics and stirring, powerful tunes. And, by releasing a recording of this quality, you clearly demonstrate that you have lost respect for your fans. Five years and this is all you have to show? I'm sorry. Sorry it cost me seventeen bucks! Hope you find your newly lost sense of direction and purpose in time to return to the spectacular music you used to compose. I believe I speak for all your disappointed fans in wishing you the best of luck at getting another recording contract.Yours sincerely, Neil Reynolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleasantly Pleased","review":"I've always loved 'Fast Cars' but never purchased the CD. As a matter of fact, I rarely purchase CD's because there is usually one song I like and the rest are alright - I kept hearing 'Telling Stories' on the radio and it made me stop and listen and think. So, I purchased the CD and I've listend to it from beginning to end 4 times so far and the day is only part way through. Tracy's words are not only thoughtful but hopeful yet very real..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a new favorite CD of the moment!","review":"I can't say that this CD reminds me of early Tracy Chapman works, because it doesn't. I will say that the songs are gentle and flowing, and that I am touched by a singer who is expressing herself - and doing it well. I'm so happy that she has moved out of that \\"I-am-so-ugly- my-momma-didn't-love-me- woe-is-me\\" songwriting of years ago. I suppose it was necessary to her own expression and healing, but it was tiresome to me. New Beginnings was lovely, and this CD takes her talents to a higher level. I could listen to this CD day and night! It's a beautiful collection of songs without a stinker in the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling her story","review":"Very well done in a way that only Tracy Chapman is able to. Captivates every bone while listening but still with less passion than her debut album. Nonetheless a absolute must this year so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and severe","review":"Tracy Chapman returns to the early days of Fast Car, story-telling heartbreak in this cd. The harmonies are spare and perfect, the words are ruefully world-weary and loving; an album for a grown-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep album","review":"This album begins with a moderate to fast paced cut -- Telling Stories and ends with the heart wrenching First Try (which is by far the best cut). I would also suggest reading the liner notes for an even deeper listening experience. Unlike many artists, Ms. Chapman's lyrics actually convey a feeling and mood that is truly genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable music and heartfelt lyrics","review":"Tracy Chapman has talent in spades. This is a remarkable album, one that improves with every listen.The songs are written without sentimentality and are raw with emotion and expression. Her lyrics are rich with double meaning and they invite interpretation.Well worth the listen and one of the best albums out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"This is a great CD. Unfortunately it's one of the few Tracy Chapman CDs that you can't download off of iTunes, so you'll probably have to buy the CD itself and burn it onto your computer if you want to listen to it on an MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Chapman New CD","review":"This new cd that she had recorded,is the best one she had ever made.SO FAR....In my opinion.the other cd's were good,i'd say 3 stars,but this one is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album grew on me!","review":"At first, I thought it was just a good cd, then I started listening to it while I was relaxing in my dorm. You won't believe how soothing her voice is over those soft melodies. Plus the lyrics, oh my God, as someone who likes poetry I can't help but give her ups on her lyrical talents. The deepest song on the album, I feel, is #10, \\"The Only One.\\" It's about her losing a daughter, I don't know the song is true, but her derlivery gives you a sense of sincerity and depth that only someone in that situation can portray. Please get this album, it's a breath of fresh air in a musical world of tacky pop and R&B with rhythm but no blues. Plus, have you seen her new look, the girl is beautiful. You gotta get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T.C. OH YEAH.","review":"SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS A THIEF, EITHER ENJOYING MY DAUGHTERS CD COLLECTION OR BUYING SOME @#&!ING DRUGS WITH THEM.

I really had scarcely followed her music. However, something in \\"Telling Stories\\" got hold of me, and I really, really enjoy it. Every track seems to be it's own gem, though I must say that some filler exists here and there. And I disagree with the review who said that Tracy \\"doesn't follow trends.\\" The music from \\"It's OK\\" has dintinctly disco overtones; and it works! Perhaps she just picks her trends carefully, in keeping with the intelligent woman she seems to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Tracy... at her best","review":"Wonderful soft spirit. Very smooth and typical Tracy Chapman doing what she does best. I love this CD after work with a glass of wine. \\"Less Than Strangers\\" is flawless and splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Sweet Music","review":"This CD is both an introspective view of the past 5 years and hopefully a glimpse of where the next 5 years will take this artist. Strong insightful lyrics, delivered with a conviction sorely missing in much of today's music. Some of this is presented in the characteristic Chapman monotone, however, this is not unappealling. With such powerful lyrics, you easily defocus on the delivery and refocus on what is being said, not how. Great muscianship throughout; a sparkling production that brings the most salient quality of each song to the forefront. Emmy Lou Harris was a great addition to this production; I only wish we had been treated to full duet with these two talents. Buy this and the repeat button will get a workout. Ms. Chapman this was well worth the wait, but don't let us wait this long for another CD of this caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJORLY DISAPPOINTING! WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I love Tracy Chapman. I have all her albums. I was looking forward with eager anticipation to her new album, \\"Telling Stories.\\" I was MAJORLY disappointed on listening to it. WHAT HAPPENED! Chapman sounds tired and discouraged. Her voice lacks excitement and enthusiasm. The songs are lackluster and without feeling; the musical arrangements are basically uninteresting. I guess my disappointment stems, in part, because I am comparing \\"Telling Stories\\" with her \\"New Beginning\\" CD, which had such powerfully-worded tunes, as well as interesting musical arrangements that evoked so many emotions. I'm so sad to see this latest CD of hers does not contain the dynamics of \\"New Beginning\\", or other of her music, for that matter. I will look forward to Tracy's next CD with the hope she will have revived her spirit, and that her song-writing creativity and musical artistry will have returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her genius is subtle and beautiful.","review":"I cannot argue with anyone that 42 minutes is simply a tease...but wouldn't one rather be chomping at the bit for more, than skipping over tracks of useless musical fodder? Tracy is at her songwriting and creative apex with \\"Telling Stories.\\" You'll be swooning from her heady (and simple) mixtures of acoustic and solo voice, and choking back tears of personal recollections with her subject matter. Going back to her \\"musical roots?\\" Pah! Tracy blazes her own trail. And this one is paved with subtle and sweet beauty.

It seems the distribution is off, forcing the weight of the main compartment (which in my case would hold a variety of books and papers on any given day) onto a single corner seam.I'm a fan of the sling design for comfort through the day as well as convenience in accessing the contents of the bag - but this particular model is to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty on the shelf.

Cleaning disks typically have a cleaning brush affixed to them, but this one had NOTHING. It was simply a DVD with no cleaning product involved whatsoever! Humorously, the graphic on the screen when the product is supposedly cleaning your XBox shows a brush cleaning away the dirt on the laser lens, as though I was too stupid to see that the actual disk had nothing of the sort. I don't know if this was an isolated case of being a defective disk, but I'm still not too thrilled at having paid $20 (plus shipping) for something that is essentially worthless. The box is sure nice though . . . enough to make to think that you're getting a quality product.I have not tried the disk repair fluid yet, as I have no needed to. However, I suspect that this may of the same quality (that is, no quality whatsoever).

Owly is, for the most part, wordless; everything is conveyed with expressions and thought bubbles. It's clever and funny and heartwarming, a definite change of pace from most of the graphic novels that have been appearing for the past few years. Definitely recommended for when you need a pick-me-up. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"A delightful and thoroughly enjoyable story suitable for all ages, from a 10 year old to my mum's age.

And, as I love comic books, I was lucky enough to come across Owly.She loves it! And I love it! And her mom loves it!It is the perfect 1st comic to give to a kid. Moreover, as there are no words, once you go through the joy of working through the story with her once, she is able to \\"read\\" it by herself or to her little friends! What more can you ask for?You could ask for a wonderful story - Owly has it. Or beautiful art - check. Or great basic lessons of friendship and the beauty of nature - Done and done.So I highly recommend this book to you and your little ones. It introduces them to a style and method of storytelling in the perfect way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Ubiquinone, not the reduced form Ubiquinol","review":"This bottle is Ubiquinone, the fully oxidized form of CoQ10.

Then on page 112 he states \\"[President] Harding has gone down as the worst President in the nation's history up to the year 2000\\". Since the book was published in 2003 Mr. Morgan has to be calling President George W.

Whenever I had seen the show previously I would be laughing throughout almost the entire episode--that didn't happen with a single one of these episodes.

The Plastic guide is flimsy and when trying to enlarge a hole from 1\\" the beginning of the bit work is all over the place.

Jerry croons country oldies like the George Jones classic, \\"Take Me\\" and Merle Travis's \\"Dark As A Dungeon\\" and \\"Nine Pound Hammer,\\" reggae tunes like \\"Sitting Here In Limbo\\" and several traditional songs, which help anchor the album's old-timey sound. The sedate, laid-back version of Bob Dylan's epic \\"Ballad Of Frankie Lee And Judas Priest\\" is a highlight, though, honestly, there's no weak link to be heard on this album. These performances are understated and sincere, and though Grisman may have mined his archives several times for similar material, he is certainly not scraping the bottom of the barrel here... Not at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Beautiful Music From Jerry and the Dawg","review":"As a long time Dead fan who mostly listens to old timey country, blues, folk and bluegrass nowadays this eclectic batch of Gracia and Grisman offerings was a tasty treat. The playing is excellent throughout and I like the rough, worn tone of Gracia's voice at this stage in his career. Highlights for me included \\"I'm Troubled\\", \\"Sittin' Here In Limbo\\" and \\"Drink Up And Go Home\\".But it's on \\"Dark As A Dungeon\\" that I felt the strongest dose of Dead style musical magic. Somehow Garcia's vocals make this a song not just about a coal miner but about all of us as we trudge through the work-a-day world, feeling trapped and hoping for something better. I would also encourage listeners to seek out the originals by great traditional artists such as Jimmie Rodgers and Merle Travis.

Nothing could prepare me for how bad it really was.All of the elements were there to make something good- cast and setting. After a semi-interesting pilot, the series devolved into a convoluted soap opera about a teen aged girl/terrorist/religious nut. Sorry- but the mono-theistic robot theme was the weakest part of BSG(2003). Caprica was not improved or elevated by basing the whole wretched show on BSG's weakest plot element.Religious robots?

Then they cancel, and want us to pay $70 for non HD for the whole season? LMAO. I only paid $60 for the BR seasons of Lost a peice. I loved the series. But uuuuhhhhh....we are not stupid. This is truly trying to milk the fans, and I look down on SyFy and universal. They can become a channel of perpetual Giant Spider movies. I for one am gettig sick of their ability to market shows.

When the show came on back this past september, it did a 180 in direction from the episodes back on the spring, with a confusing story line on mob like story, then the last 5 episodes took a different direction, moving into a hirer gear, but at the same time dropping characters or situations and designing new ones that seem to forget the previous ones.

It spent a lot of effort establishing the story of the colonized planets prior to the development of the Cylons, and began to evolve into the events precluding the first Cylon War. There is action, but not to the level of the original Battlestar Galactica series. But, it's not supposed to. This is the story of how it all began. I only wish the Battlestar audience was a little more patient, because we would have gotten the origins of the time before Cylons and what led to their hatred of humans. The Caprica series probably only had 3 seasons in it maximum to be able to tell the whole story, but sadly it ended after only 1. I bought it anyway for how much I enjoyed it.

This is my favorite tape measure. Easy to use and secure locking mechanism. Made in England, rugged, no cheap China. It is bulky, not something you would carry to the lumber yard or to the store for measurements. However great for a construction site, wood working shop, and especially for landscaping. Comes w/ a nice belt clip attached, that actually works. Non metal, plastic and \\"rubberised\\" case; so less likely to damage a floor or itself when dropped. Large clear numbers, and the tape can go out 7 feet horizontally without bending. Orange and black color to be quickly found.The marketing boys obviously had fun w/ the name.Excellent for the price. They should drop the \\"power tape\\" part, some people may think it is battery operated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy but not perfect","review":"The Power Tape is a very solid tool. Very sturdy and the measuring is great and very accurate. The housing is very well made too.On the downside, the tape is too large to my average-size hand.

I am using my older tape now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not accurate","review":"I loved this tape measure when I first received it.The lock was great the belt clip- genius.But I kept getting errors when doing fancy house mouldings.I finally traced it down to the tape stop.

It reveals the truth about wolves and the damage they have done, and are doing, to elk herds, cattle, etc., and the money they are costing ranchers.

A good forty to fifty percent of the text is identical from book to book. I don't mean similar, I mean copied word for word. That's quite a racket. Just keep selling the same text under different names.As to the book itself, I found the instructions to be vague and incomplete. It would provide nothing to the experienced user and confuse the heck out of a novice.

After receiving it, i made sure i read through the directions fully once and identified my parts the installation was easy. It is very straightforward and simple, just a little time consuming. The most important thing Ive learned from this product though is the small black foam pad and plastic/metal spacers that attach between the backboard and rim are NECESSARY. If you don't have them, do not set it up or the backboard will break. Mine came per-installed but some just come in the box as Ive read. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THEM AND USE THEM.

This is probably one of the best basketball hoops I have owned and my kids just love it.

Great basketball equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare","review":"This system looked great and the thought of having a glass backboard was very appealing. Unfortunately the backboard splintered upon installing the rim to it, not once, but twice. The directions are very specific to not overly-tighten, which I did not. As a matter of fact, the 2nd backboard that splintered did so after installing only 2 bolts to it (instead of the 4 it requires). I immediately disassembled the entire system, phoned Amazon, and they returned it without any hassle. I've since purchased a new system (from Amazon)with a polycarbonate backboard and will never purchase one with a glass backboard again. Amazon customer service made a terribly frustrating experience bearable with their excellent customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality but assembly is difficult","review":"Putting those poles together was brutal. I lubed it up and still was difficult. Rubber mallet is a must along with some serious energy. Somehow they need to make this easier. However. Once it is together it is a quality system. Glass is so much better than the cheap plastic. This system will last for many many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"I purchased this system because it had a thicker pole compared to other portable systems. The system is well built but the backboard does shake a little when the ball hits it. I think the degree of shake is acceptable. I chose to fill mine with sand instead of mixing water and anti-freeze ( I live in the midwest). The front piece of flat triangle shaped plastic does rebound a lot of the shots.My only complaint with the system (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is with parts that were missing from the box. I was missing 4 white plastic spacers. Make sure to check all pieces before assembly. If you are missing anything call spalding directly for replacement.

Very cool movie, entertaining to the max!!!","review":"Hello World,Ya know we see so many movies on the shelves in these \\"mega movie\\" stores, or even on net rentals for the techno advanced miser. But in essence we read covers and take a chance and if you like all the classics in this genre, well then this is the flick to see. Really \\"zupa\\" acting with great humor which in my opinion makes the film. Not too much gore mind you but the fact of the, matter is that it takes you on an enlightening journey into a slasher's life. Which in my opinion is something I've never seen before.

It's a deconstructionist horror film, in which the genre is disassembled and analyzed, then reassembled at small scale at the end. I can't recommend it enough, if you like horror movies at all. It's much smarter than most.The Blu-Ray edition is garbage. Beyond the lousy packaging, it has no extras: no commentary, no deleted scenes, no bonus features of any sort. There isn't even a *menu*. This isn't because there are no extras for the movie. They're all only on the DVD edition. I don't know how this makes any sense, but there it is. Buy the DVD.

While the movie is great (I'd easily give it 4/5 stars) and it looks and sounds alright (it's shot documentary style so it looks a bit grainy but it's supposed to) there are no special features to speak of. Not even a simple menu. Now I would have understood if there weren't any NEW special features or if they were not in HD (this happens quite a bit sadly) but NONE AT ALL? The DVD had them...why exclude them? If you're interested in owning Behind the Mask I recommend seeking out the DVD and if you already own it don't bother upgrading. Knowing Anchor Bay they'll release another version in a year anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for horror completists","review":"\\"Behind the Mask\\" is a great concept that is executed poorly. The two exceptions are Robert Englund (of course, he's an amazing actor in anything) and Nathan Baesel as Leslie Vernon. Baesel singlehandedly carries this entire movie. His energy and enthusiasm pull up the remainder of the movie almost to his level. Baesel manages to make his serial killer likeable, and gets you on his side. It would have been strictly amateur hour if he had not been in this film. IMDB shows that Baesel has worked steadily since this movie, and I'm not surprised. For horror fans, this may be an acceptable time killer; for non horror fans, this will not be entertaining in the least. Rent before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper!!

And it's not that original. I don't know how anyone can say that this is a must for horror fans. If you want to see a film like this that is a \\"must for horror fans\\", pick up a copy of \\"Man Bites Dog\\", and leave this film on the shelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise, Weak Delivery","review":"The premise sounds interesting. A film crew following a would-be serial killer preparing for his first kill. Unfortunately, the director couldn't keep a straight face and ruined such a great setup almost immediately. First of all, why is there another camera filming the film crew if there's only one cameraman in the movie? If they had followed the example of Blair Witch and at least pretend that the whole thing was real, this could have been a little gem.Another advice to the director: If this movie is pretend to be a documentary, don't hire actor that's well known in the genre. Once he shows his face, everyone know that the whole thing is a fake. As much as it might have been the director's wet dream to work with such legend, his presence destroyed the entire movie.Overall, the movie isn't scary and I wonder if it would have been better as comedy. No, I guess it wouldn't. They borrowed great deal from many films and there was hardly anything original about the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie was awful.

The acting was terrible. So was everything else. This is the first time I actually could not sit through the footage. The writer may of had an idea of some nut case taking a cue from slasher movies, to go around murdering people, but at least get people that can act, or at least want to try and act the parts. I say to all ; Save your money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont understand...","review":"How this movie got anything above a 1 star, and that 1 star is ONLY because there were a few slightly amusing parts to it, thanks only to the guy playing the up and coming serial killer.

What a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome spoof","review":"With every horror film I've watched recently, I've had my reservations. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but my partner warned my that it wouldn't be like anything we'd watched together thus far. I laughed through the whole thing. The documentary feel to the beginning of the movie REALLY worked for me. Our killer has a sense of humor, a personality, and seems like such a sweet guy. When he jumped out of the closet to commit the murders, my jaw just kinda hit the floor. I guess I knew he'd go through with his plans but it was still kinda shocking... I LOVED IT!The music was well done, it was just spooky enough at the end. The juxtaposition of the two moods were perfect. It wasn't a gradual change which made it even more noticable.Basically, I thought it was well done. Great characters, great mood, great everything on this one. I definately recommend this one with a solid two thumbs up. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"in a word: boring","review":"Like other reviewers have already mentioned, Behind the Mask has an interesting concept, but the performances are extremely dull. I didn't find anything even remotely funny in any of the dialogue, and there was nothing creepy or scary about it whatsoever. Hardly any gore, or blood for that matter, is shown in this movie. No scares, no laughs, no gore, but plenty of dialog that tries to be witty, but just ends up being extremely boring. I feel bad for Robert, Kane, and Zelda...and wish their talent could have been put to better use in another movie. Not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The quality of this item is less than I expected. I would rather have this music done by well known artists in single CD's. The sound quality is poor at best. Some of the music I have on single CD's ie; Van Cliburn. The 1812 Overture sounds like a studio recording instead of cannons going off it sounds like a studio sound effect. In the future I will elect to buy Single recordings.

I'm old enough to remember Abba when they were still at their peak and I was a closet fan back then (it was pretty uncool to like anything that wasn't Lynyrd Skynyrd or Van Halen), but I really enjoy these remixes. The energy of the production and the sweet voices of these kids make for a great combination, and I'm glad that the works of Bjorn, Agnetha, Frida, and Benny are going to be introduced to a new generation.If you like techno/euro-dance rhythms and know all the words to Abba's hits like I do, I recommend you have a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Why? I like ABBA, and I like European dance mixes. Put them together, and you get A-Teens. Granted, their voices can't be considered great and pale compared to the original Abba, but the energy and vigor that comes through makes up for it. They're not claiming to be a musical revolution anyway, they're remaking disco hits which were lighthearted to begin with.

I heard mamma mia and instantly fell in love with it.The A*teens are a fabulous band and America needs to give them a chance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Generation","review":"Bursting on to the scene towards the end of the last decade, the A-Teens aimed to take the songs of ABBA and bring them to the youth who didn't have the chance to enjoy the originals. Now, these covers aren't a patch on the classics, but who said they tried to be. It's a pretty daunting task to take the songs loved by so many and try to make them shine, and the Teens don't feel to excite. The vocals are perky and fresh, and they work on the chosen tunes pretty well, with highlights including their spirited take on the disco gem \\"Dancing Queen\\", the forceful \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\", the romantic \\"Our Last Summer\\", and the bouncing \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\\". Their takes on \\"Super Trouper\\" and \\"The Name Of The Game\\" can appear flacid at parts, but on the whole, this is flawless pop production and tribute. Wisely, though, the band moved on from their ABBA covers following this release to make a go at doing it with their own stuff. It's a nice pop album, not essential, but nice enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABBA did it better, much better","review":"I just wanted to say that these are all unoriginal songs. They belong to ABBA who sang them first and far better than A Teens or whatever they call themselves. People don't seem to get that little fact. I'm only 15 and I'm an ABBA fan.

These are just a bunch of currently pretty teens copying on a classic.If you want these songs just buy ABBAs GOLD, why buy a corporation machine processed bands versions of 70 classic pop songs.It is like buying those compilations from Television with other unknown artists singing once great songs from RONCO...Absolutely horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"There doesn't seem to be anything new or different about this CD. A bunch of kids just took other people's songs and sang them (badly). Part of why ABBA was so awesome was that they were this Swedish band that wrote cool songs in English. Also, I read some review that said A*Teens sing better than ABBA. Um, I don't think so. I just listened to their version of Super Trouper, oh my gosh, it's terrible. Their singing voices definitely need some help, and it just really lacks that special something that ABBA had. It's just really boring. I heard Mamma Mia and liked it, until I heard ABBA's version, which is much better. Instead of this ripoff, just buy ABBA's Gold CD. By the way, I'm not some old person that's against new sounds. I'm 18 and I have seen the light! Haha. I really just discovered ABBA and I just don't like that most people my age only know A-Teen's version of Dancing Queen or whatever. The original is just so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation Is Not Always Flattery","review":"So what's next? An English teen group who tries to carbon copy the Beatles?

Those are huge CD's Mom!)I once enjoyed as a youth (remember Supertramp?) my daughter recoils in horror. When I saw this CD, I knew right away that my daughter and I could both enjoy it. Combining the songs I once enjoyed with the fresh new faces of my daughters generation, I took a chance (no pun intended here)! They may not be the original, but the vocals are easy on the ear and strikingly similar! A refreshing change from your typical \\"bubblegum\\" fare.

They're okay, and thee songs are still catchy. Still dance-able. But no, they are not half as good as ABBA was. They are wannabees that don't measure up. The magic that was in the original is gone. It lacks feeling and purpose that the original has. The songs are still there, but the feeling is not. I don't entirely know why they even created this album; they sound like just another ABBA tribute band to me. If you want to experience the ABBA magic, get ABBA Gold or something. Just not this. After all, why mess with perfection?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"This is one of the most unnecessary records that had been released in the last few years.

Why? Simply, because this gruop can't match the quality of ABBA. You can't compare the great Agnetha and Frida's voices with the two singers here. And remember that when ABBA started their career as a group, every member were well known in Sweden as individual artists, that's to say they were experiencied musicians, and this group doesn't appear to be so. In fact, the interpetations here are all danceable, the recording quality is ok, but the whole thing is not as enjoyable as ABBA was.I will finish this review with a question: can anyone tell me who played the instruments here and what did the two boys here? I'k like to know it since I can't find the credits anywhere on my copy, and the male voices doesn't appear bo be evident on the recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable CD due to copy protection","review":"I bought this CD to play on my computer at work. However, it has a copy protection software on it that Universal Music created back in the 1990s, and it crashes when you try to use it on a modern computer. The only way to \\"open\\" the CD is to let it install a piece of software on your computer called \\"Universal Media Player\\". That software is supposed to make the music tracks on the CD available to you. But when you try to start the music, the software crashes.

Oops!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABBA is back, and better than ever...","review":"Okay, maybe not necessarily BETTER, but the A*Teens are definitely at least as good as the old ABBA. The songs are more modern, and have a great beat. My favorites are \\"Mamma Mia\\" (of course), \\"Dancing Queen\\", \\"Super Trouper\\", and \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\\". Like I said, they all have a great beat. My mom has the old ABBA cd, and I was comparing the new songs to the old songs. They're very similar and have kept the old ABBA \\"sound\\", which is a good thing, but have added a more \\"techno\\" beat.

Ah, the wages of sin. The original is one of ABBA's best harmony pieces, but the remake suffers by comparison...their voices aren't quite robust enough to carry it off.

I actually hated their style, so whiny and sappy, though they did have some decent text.So I actually don't know what got me to buy this CD, probably listening to the A-Teens' version of \\"Gimme Gimme\\". These songs have taken a whole new spirit and personality with these remixes, something that was definitely lacking in the original versions. I don't like all the songs, as some really sound too much like the original, but I like most of them. They are great for parties as they are good to dance but not so annoying like trance and can be ok as background for talking. I personally love to play the CD in the car.People who were listening to ABBA when they were young might not like this that much, but their children, like me, are likely to really appreciate the added rhythm and beat.

I had a ASE Certified Master Mechanic check my truck after it started running ruff and his computer identified the bad plug. We changed them out and went back to the AC plugs and all is well. The only bad thing is I had to send them back to Amazon and only got $38 of my original $48 purchase back and that is after I had to pay a mechanic $50 for a diagnoses and another $60 for the AC plugs and installation. \\"Live and learn!\\". rc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Songs","review":"This CD sucks.

'Young Turks' 'Do ya think Im Sexy' are edgy classics, that evoke an age and emotion, once you get past the trappings of their era.Rod did extend his career for a time by covering unknown songs of great merit 'Some guys' 'Downtown Train'.

The quality of the songs seem to get diluted. On this one, all the songs are starting to sound the same. The first one was the best one in my opinion, and had the prettiest melodies.

It is sort of a combination of a commentary and devotional book at the same time. I think the reason for this is because it so clearly captures the essence of the Sermon on the Mount. God's Word should be deep and result in a changed life. So if this what you're looking for, then I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for No Doubt Fans","review":"I bought this CD, desperate for new No Doubt songs and expecting something that was just pretty good, since it's an album of mostly B-sides and songs that were scrapped before they could make it onto any original No Doubt CD. I'm really glad that I did get it because this CD completely exceeded my expectations. These songs do not sound like rejects. They're all good enough to have made it onto the albums they were originally recorded for. The remixes are also great. It's like listening to a brand new, original No Doubt CD, which we're not likely to get for a while. This is definitely a must-have for any No Doubt fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection of miscellaneous songs","review":"I tend to like No Doubt's odd collections, like BEACON STREET and EVERYTHING IN TIME, because the songs that are left off the albums (or done on the side or, in the case of BEACON STREET, recorded while waiting for other things to happen) are less slick pop and closer to their first album. I was a big fan of theirs before they were famous, when I was in high school, and tend to prefer their more ska and power-pop songs.\\"Cellophane Boy,\\" \\"I Throw My Toys Around,\\" \\"Big Distraction,\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" are the primary attractions of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"b sides","review":"I love No Doubt.

I can't really complain as it was just under $3.00 but it isn't quality by any means. The light itself is not very bright and the button to turn it on is right under the end of the clip. This may be a common place to put the on button but here the clip is pretty tight so it seems to turn itself on even with the slightest unwanted pressure. As far a pressing the on button it is very small so you have to make sure you press down just in the right spot or you'll be fiddling with it for sure.On the plus side I do like that it is reusable so you don't have to just throw it away - just pop in a new battery and it is good to go.Overall it is worth what I paid but not what I had hoped.

The drawing is really hideous, the jokes(if they are jokes at all) are not funny, and you get a rather unpleasant feeling after watching it. Some racial satires are funny because they make fun of real life people. But when was the last time you've seen a 75 yr old chinese guy who's indestructible, can swear really well in english, and works for free for a single white female? The creator of this cartoon claims that it's a satire on racism. But the satire is nowhere in sight. The film is really about wartime desensitization in practice: give a reason to bring harm to a group of people(cuz they swear and they are ugly), imagine them to be subservient, and actually bringing harm to them. If you are someone who hates certain group of people and wish to bring harm to them but can't, this cartoon might appeal to you.

Rickles, Mason, and other \\"Race Humorists\\" disperse their venom in unbaised portions, and that is when everyone can laugh.

Am I supposed to be offended by Mr. Wong's portrayal? The show was unfunny, politically incorrect or not, although I've gotta say I loved the song \\"Hockey Monkey\\" by The Zambonis.

Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today.

Now I'm stuck with an orange vest that I can't return b/c the company will only credit the original credit card holder and not issue a gift certificate.The vest itself seems all right.

Temperature readings were usually within 1F. However humidity readings were rarely within 5%, and sometimes as much as 25% different.

It took over thirty minutes for any action to take place, if you want to consider her continuously walking to a bar as some action.

That just seemed like someone threw that scene in to show people that the main hero can fight.The characters seem to not have aged in 15 years since the accident, her father, and the hero she ends up sleeping with.

Problem is this often does not release the battery. I am a contractor with large strong hands - good luck for someone with smaller hands.When I contacted Milwaukee, they tried to brush me off by telling me to send the battery in and if they were defective that they would replace them.

I have other brands that the batteries last years and years, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Tools - Crap Batteries","review":"I had three of my eight batteries crap out over the last four months.

Milwaukee is totally unsympathetic when you talk to them. I lost a battery in a short time without getting much use out of it and they are spendy to replace. Again, love the drill but will definitely not buy another Milwaukee tool because of the batteries. There are plenty of other good power tools with batteries that last much longer; one would think that Milwaukee would recognize the problem and try to make their customers happy, but I guess that isn't in the cards.

After reading these reviews and seeing the price of the 18v battery I am very suspicious of buying any more cordless Milwaukee tools. (Even though I am VERY happy with the tools themselves). I have just sent Milwaukee customer service an email telling them this. I don't mind paying a lot of money for a GOOD tool that will LAST.

I even sent my charger back to Milwaukee since I had trouble believing that both batteries would die so quickly.After the charger was confirmed functional I contacted Milwaukee again asking for guidance. They recommended jump-starting my batteries (I suppose to get it above threshold as has been noted in a few other reviews).I did not bother to jumper it as suggested but rather just pressed a standard nine volt battery against the leads for about 30 seconds (the single lead is positive). Sure enough, I then loaded each battery into the charger which lit up and charged the battery with no problem (and the batteries are again working fine). Compared to a third party repair ($35 plus shipping or a new battery $50) this was a pretty cheap alternative - I only wish Milwaukee would have suggested it much sooner (or posted it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks to DP for saving my \\"dead\\" Milwaukee batteries with a cheap 9V","review":"For those who, like me, are frustrated with dead Milwaukee batteries, DP's trick -- place a standard 9V battery against the leads on your dead Milwuakee battery for 30 seconds (single lead on your Milwaukee is positive, the double lead is negative) -- sure did work for me.

They will eventually break from that, I'm sure, at which point I will disassemble the 12 and 16oz units, and combine their good parts to make another good/working unit. I pre-dent the sides of all my cans as well, prior to crushing, to make it easier on the unit. I won't be buying another one of these, for sure.

Soul Coughing produces a unique sound, combining funky drums and stand-up bass, original sampling, and, in-a-word, outstanding lyrics and vocals. After listening to this CD, I have difficulties finding something suitable to play and end up playing it again. It is very difficult to compare their sound to anything else. If I'd have to, I'd pick Talking Heads in the \\"Remain in Light\\" period. At least 5 of the songs of this CD have been on endless repeat in my apartment: \\"Sleepless\\", \\"Hoe many Cans?\\", \\"lazybones\\", \\"Soft Serve\\", and of course \\"Super Bonbon\\".

The only regret that I have is that I had to go for 7 years without owning it. Now I'm hooked.These guys are technically adept and simple at the same time. Almost every song on the album is catchy. And none could be considered boring. My favorite is the stripped-down \\"How Many Cans?\\", which is a true showcase for M. Doughty's amazing voice. Now I'm going to have to pick up the rest of the S.C. catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album; but big letdown from Ruby Vroom","review":"Don't expect quite as much from Irresistable Bliss as you got out of Ruby Vroom. The album just never builds the ferocious momentum and artistic creativity of their first effort. Still, if you're a big fan of Soul Coughing, you'll need this one in your collection.

Now, others may hae a different perspective, but I enjoy melodies, music. I have varied taste and enjoy rock, jazz, pop, show tunes, classical and opera.

I have a slight curve in my back and neck which has now at the age of 48 is taking it's toll. I do see a chiro regularly and so in between visits this comes in handy. I have very stiff shoulders and neck and this really works good at keeping those knots forming. I bought this package 2 for 1 because I must share it with those I love and this is a better price than ordering seperately. The reason I gave 4 stars is that I do find the racket ball with my back to the wall works better on the back, but all the other areas this works great without wearing out your hands trying to knead out knots or from applying self acu pressure.

You would use this DVD to teach yourself some moves so that you look better on a disco floor. But it is not a workout program per se. Whereas dancing can be great exercise this is not interesting and the workout is not more fun.The music is very dull. The dance steps are not really impressive. But if you follow the instructions you can look a lot better on the dance floor. I worked up a nice sweat but it was not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"This DVD is a fun and easy way to get in a quick workout. The tutorial guide is easy and fun. The steps are broken down, although it is not necessary to review because she breaks down the steps in the \\"routines\\" anyway.I got this DVD as a way to start getting active and this does just that. The first 20 minute routine is easier than the second and took me only a few times of doing it to where I felt really comfortable. The second routine is a little harder - it took me a little longer before I felt really comfortable with that one.I would recommend this DVD to someone who is just starting a fitness regimine. My only dissatisfaction is that as the routine progressed (and yes,I was keeping up with her), by heart rate seemed to decrease instead of increase or stay at a good rate. Also, the first routine has a small cool down period, whereas the second, it has over a 2 minute cool down period so they're not consistant in the amount of active activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance workout for Dummies","review":"This steps are still difficult, even for Dummies.

Not even close.While it is hard to write a singular review of so many varied stories, let me say that hardly any of the stories were memorable. Worse, some of the stories were almost incomprehensible. As with other collections of short stories, I would have greatly appreciated some blurb by the editor in front of each story explaining its significance.

I like a lot of Lee's work, but this is definitely my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, and more dullness","review":"This is one book I'll probably throw in my giveaway pile. The plot, such as it is, treats the tired old theme of demons taking over human beings to wreak bloody murder. The title is a sort of pun, since the demon in this novel utilizes postal employees as its \\"messengers.\\" The title is about the best part of the book. The old Heaven and Hell stuff doesn't get my engines revving, especially when the action isn't particularly interesting. Sure, there's lots of gruesome slayings, but nothing I could sink my teeth into as far as plot and character development. Lee's writing is pretty standard: modern, utilitarian, to the point. Not exceptionally winning. If you want a lazy-day read you can plow through and throw out the next day, sure, go for it. Otherwise, take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile and sloppy","review":"The combination of sex and violence presented here isn't anything new, and it fails to shock or disturb, clearly its intention.

A messenger of Satan is seducing postal workers in a small Florida town, getting them to graphically murder as many people as they can before killing themselves. It isn't so much a plot as a device for the author to write one violent, gory scene after another, all leading nowhere. I think he must have gotten paid by the number of times he wrote the word blood, bloody, blood-soaked, blood-covered, etc.This is a bad novel. Violence and gore are no problem if they are integral to the story but here, they are the story and nothing else. The dialog is so over the top it makes you laugh, the characters have no depth and no one behaves or reacts the way a real person would. The author bio says Lee has 15 novels in print. I hope they all aren't as useless as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I burned this book","review":"I usually like the usual horror, gore, and even sometimes sex in a book, but this book was easily the worst book I've ever read. I bought this book thinking it would be like Anne Rice, written well, good plot, and maybe some gore thrown in; I was terribly mistaken. I only got about 140 pages into the book when I decided it wasn't getting any better. The plot was a little intriguing, the characters were decent, but the plot and characters got lost along the way when he started putting in sexual references, rather than sex, and disturbing images. Also, he didn't explain what was happening really well, and didn't focus much on the plot after a while, it just became more blurred. In conclusion, if you're not into the terribly written, half plotted, sex outweighing the gore novels...Do NOT get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My messege...not this one.","review":"I love Lee.

Then I read the Messenger. This is the worst I have read from Lee. It contained none of the fun of his other novels. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror that's painful to read","review":"I am very surprised with the 5 start ratings for this book. I am a true fan of horror, and there's no denying that Ed Lee has written some pretty gruesome stuff. But this book is painfully boring and uninteresting. There is absolutely no character developement or depth. The dialogue is usually ridiculous and I completely agree with the other reviewer about the many storyline blunders. I thought Monstrosity was a good read but this is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty serious and intense!!","review":"Edward Lee has never let me down. This is another crazy and violent tale of his that deals with the occult. This is one of the first books of his that I have read that has little to any humor.

It was done in the modern/minimalistic fashion that is so popular today. I like something that is beautiful, welcoming and comfortable .

Great performances by Sanjeev Kumar, Waheeda Rehman, Shabana Azmi and others.But the DVD is completely an insult to the movie as it does not contain the entire movie.

There may be two or three films in the 90's which a true collector might give considerations but the All time classics like Namkeen will always be a film which one would wish to watch again and again and will not get bored. Also the cast is not too much in terms of counting but Waheeda Rehman, Shabana Azmi and Sanjeev Kumar they have given their ultimate performances.A must to keep film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look, solid design","review":"These stools look great in our kitchen and are built very well. They don't creak or sway like cheaper bar stools. The finish seems bulletproof and is a nice matte look, not too shiny.The only problem I had was that I ordered 4 stools and one was the wrong size. They very promptly sent out a replacement, problme solved.Comfortable seat at the perfect level for our island. They are low profile enought that they tuck under the 12\\" overhang, out of the way.I would buy these again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful read; excellent message","review":"This is a delightful book and sends an excellent message to young readers as well. I in fact do not think a children's book is required to have a message; it just needs to delight. But the message here is that hard work and being good at something is rewarding, and that's a pretty good message for a young reader to receive. Parents of both girls and boys will appreciate the main character's savvy, entrepreneurial qualities. The illustrations are lovely and bright without being too busy, and the tasty recipes at the end are and added treat. My now four year-old son has gone through two apple picking seasons with this book, and refers to \\"Apple Farmer Annie\\" as though she were one of his best pals. I highly recommend this book. Caveat: if you read it to your child in a season other than fall, or if you live someplace where apples don't grow, be prepared to handle the request to visit an orchard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"charming book for young child","review":"We read this book over and over. My just-turned-two year old likes me to talk about the pictures with her, and has fun identifying the objects and finding Annie's dog (who appears on every page). My three year old enjoys the story of Annie's harvest and trip to the city farmer's market. It's a story about farming that my urban children can identify with -- making the connection with the farmer's market we visit on weekends. The illustrations are distinctive and cheery. It's one of our most-read books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids in Nature","review":"Kids always love this sort of nature book. I bought this book to give one of my great grand daughters.

He makes mistakes, and often makes sweeping conclusions with little or no support.One glaring error occurs on page 36. He states that the saddle was placed backward on Black Jack, the president's horse, in the funeral procession. I knew better, but found a photograph and confirmed that the saddle had been installed properly. The boots were backward in the stirrups, as is the custom. Mounting the saddle backward might have turned Black Jack into a bucking horse! This kind of error indicates to me that Livingstone is not a very careful researcher. It led me to read the rest of the book with little faith that Livingstone knew what he was writing about.I believe there is a lot of evidence that JFK's murder resulted from a conspiracy. However, Livingstone would not be a credible source for facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Here!1","review":"When I talked to his former partner, Groden, I was told that Livingtone is crazy. From reading this title, it appears so. He's in love with the Kennedys of Camelot and goes on into the wild blue yonder with this title.Too much B.S. and too much stuff that's hard to believe. What he calls evidence is just opinion... you'll see if you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimee a Break!","review":"This author was in love with JFK it seems. He thought he was the greatest thing in the Presidency since slice bread. His book proves this, but little else. Even though he says he presents evidence, he presents nonsense and b.s.I suggest you watch cartoons. At least it's more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"good fiction but short on facts","review":"Livingston obviously wrote the follow-up to the original High Treason to \\"save face.\\" \\"Case Closed\\" by Gerald Posner exposed Livingston's lazy research, sweeping conclusions and outlandish accusations. The book reads more like a novel than a well-researched piece of investigative journalism. It is quite clear that Livingston came to a conclusion and then tried to bend facts to support the conclusion. If you want to read what happened in Dallas in '63, try Gerald Posner's \\"Case Closed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...","review":"The foot crusher vehicle is very true to the show. The mini Otto action figure fits nicely into it, but you have to position his arms, feet and tail just right.It's got a very cool green buzz-saw that comes out the front, that is very effective at \\"cutting down\\" the bad guys.It has two green missles that fit into launcher tubes on top, but they are not very durable. After a couple of weeks of normal use, it is somewhat difficult to lock them into place. It's not so hard that it kills the whole experience, though.The toy overall is fairly durable. The lid/top comes off so that it doesn't break if you over-extend it. Which happens often when you are playing with your five-year-old :)I highly recommend this toy. It was a huge hit Christmas morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Sky RULES!","review":"This series is the best I have EVER read!! (eat your heart out harry potter!). Chris Wooding is my favorite author and believe me when I say I have read alot of books. If you are a first time reader or a veteran you really should read these books (the whole series).

Buy this phone only if you live in a shoebox and don't want to talk outside of it. Our older 2.4 panasonic with its broken case and antenna still out performs it.(3) This phone lacks in the digital voicemail department also. Trust me... My GE cassete ans. machine would class in at this level only with a used tape.All I have to say is never let your parent buy a cordless phone in a superstore unless you equip them with the exact make and model that you need.Simply said... in the cordless world... you go Panasonic then Uniden or else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful learning tool","review":"when my granddauther was almost 2 we purchased this for her, by the time she was 3 she knew her abc's and could Identify them.

He loves dancing to the songs and taking the letters out and spelling words on the floor. This toy truly makes learning fun! We practice the words on his Magna Doodle and at 26 months old he can actually write the word TOP. A great combination of fun and learning! I would say that this toy is better for children who already know their alphabet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical","review":"It wasn't made clear enough that to get a reading from the gauge you have to pour very hot water on the gauge and propane tank. That isn't practical in alot of situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice poetry","review":"It looks like I'm not as picky as the previous reviewer. All of these free poetry books are formatted as prose rather than verse, and I don't care if the book is complete or not.This is a very short book full of enjoyable poetry. A lot of the poems are about love and nature, and others are Meynell's musings on life, friendship, the future and more. I like the way she writes, but her style is hard to describe, so I'll just recommend that you start reading and see what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition destroys formatting","review":"I love my Kindle, but it's not always great for poetry. In this instance the formatting is so horrible that poems sometimes run into each other. There are no line breaks. It's a mess. Even at this low price, it's not worth it. It's also not a complete collection. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This tool is the only one I could find to remove the inner tie rods on a 2000 Windstar. Fussed & cussed prior to using this tool. Just can't get access to the part without it. It seems well designed & comes with all the other adapter sizes. I would highly recommend it's purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE TOOL!","review":"This is a definite must if you need to replace inner tie rods on your front wheel drive car. Having called around to different shops the charge was around $200 minimum. I wasn't aware that this tool existed, but having exhausted ideas on how to get any other tool into the tight space left no other alternative but to remove the rack and pinion. I really didn't want to do that. With this tool I was able to do both sides in less than an hour. It saved much time and $$$$. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"I recently bought this item after being told my tie rods needed changing. The Parts cost quite a bit, so I wasn't prepared to spend any more by a mechanic. The tool worked like a charm, it took me about 30 minutes to change both tie rods. The tool is solidly built and would last a lifetime. the only thing that had me a bit concerned is that the crows foot that fit my car was already in the tool when I got it so I didn't notice at first. I thought that I ordered the wrong size since the other crows foot were too large for me to use but upon checking the tool it was already inserted. So if you order it check the tool itself upon receiving it. A good buy that was well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat tool","review":"This made the removal of my inner tie rods very easy. I have had issues in the past and wish I had this tool. I will use it only few times in my life but it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a precision tool","review":"Bought this to remove an inner tie rod on my wife's vehicle because it included the 1 1/2\\" adapter I needed. Unfortunately the fit was so sloppy and my tie rod was so tight that this tool just slipped whenever I exerted enough force to loosen the tie rod. This tool was useless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes quick work of inner tie rods","review":"Having the right tool for the job makes all the difference. Inner tie rods are easy to install and straight forward. You simply identify the wrench flat you need, place it on the inner tie rod, slide the tool on and close the band to lock it in and your ready to loosen or tighten. I didn't like the quality of the band though, mine was a little too loose and may not hold up long term. Lisle make allot of specialty tools and is a name you can count on. This is a solid investment if your beginning in the mechanical field or will replace several tie rods to justify the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I initially bought the Lisle Universal Tie Rod tool from a local auto parts store, only to find that it did not fit over the end of the tie rod in my 99 Altima. I returned that one and bought this one from Amazon. Removal and installation of the new tie rod was easy with this tool. If you're trying to decide between the two, go with this one (or the similar Harbor Freight one). It's worth a little extra money to know it will make the job easier instead of harder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another tool","review":"I bought one but could not use it znc had to return it.

I'd rate it 2.5 to make it right in the middle as average but gets only 2 since 3 would make it in above average (3/5) and that's not what I think. The shoulder strap has minimal adjustment range and will work better for very tall people - this I believe is opposite of the K. Chan review on the strap. The shoulder \\"pad\\" is unusable when the strap is cinched up some because it won't slide over the buckle in the strap. I'm 5'9\\", not exactly short, and wanted it to hang closer to my hip/waist instead of lower thigh and the \\"pad\\" can't be used. There is a really thin and flexible flap covering the bottom for supposedly squaring it and adding support but very little.

The bag arrived with one zipper pull missing- the one on the front compartment that can be used for wet/soiled items. The first time I took it to a workout and put a water bottle in the holder, the netting tore. The second time I took it out, the zipper pull on the end compartment broke off. I've only used it three times!

Usually I'm very pleased with the top suggested offer, so when I searched for a standard duffel bag to carry my gym clothes or take for weekend trips, I saw this High Sierra Bubba Duffel at the top of the list.Well I've had the bag for only about a week now and within that time, both of the two zippers to open the main section of the bag have become dislodged and I can no longer zip the bag. IT HAS NO USE TO ME AFTER ONLY A WEEK.I will contact the company as they claim to have a \\"Lifetime Warranty\\"... glad my lifetime has been longer than ONE WEEK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gym bag!","review":"Well worth the money.

The color is good, but the material is very thin and in the absence of padding or lining inside, need to be careful while packing or carrying fragile items. It has the picture of headphone on the side, but there is no hole for inserting the wire. Size smaller than expected, but it may not be seller's fault (not measured against the claim). Having used to good deals in Amazon, this is certainly expensive. Overall not value for money and will not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag, perfect size","review":"I use this bag just to hold my stuff to go back and forth to the gym and I really like it. You can fit at least one pair of shoes and a change of clothes in there, plus a small toiletry bag. The side compartment is nice too for ipods and such. The part that is supposed to hold wet items isn't really all that large-you couldn't put too much in there, but I just keep flip flops in there anyway. Overall the bag seems quite durable and has held up well.

Very pleased overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice Construction","review":"It wasn't big and bulky like some so-called other \\"small\\" duffels I bought. It was just the right size for squeezing into a small-to-medium sized locker. The zippererd side pocket for holding wet things or shoes, I felt, was a little small, but Ok. I had to push a bit to get in a medium sized pair of sneakers. But the overall duffel material was a good semi-stiff fabric: not too flimsy (like a thin nylon one), but not too stiff either. It was almost like a medium canvas material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effecive merge of dramatic video with Tangerine Dream music.","review":"This video very effectively combines a lot of remarkable footage of building demolitions with the music of the German electronic rock band, Tangerine Dream. (Note: The jacket says the video is 42 minutes, but the actual running time is closer to 32 minutes.)The demolitions are presented both as real time views and technically manipulated works. There is some dialog but it is used more like part of the music than as narration. Some of the sequences are almost totally abstract art while others are presented much like documentary film. All are exciting.The music is well mated to the images in every case.Highly recommended for fans of Tangerine Dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling post-war masterpiece","review":"Through Robert Faehmel,the subject of Boell's stark description of life in post-war Germany, the modern reader can truly feel the same sense of unsettlement and social insight. Boell depicts a society where former Nazis, barely unfit to be tried at Nurenberg, now rule over Germany's biggest cities as mayors and serve in the modern beaureacracy. Faehmel is a man who can not survive here without his own rigid regime and almost stereotypic German precision in order to escape his fate in the present and his decisions and losses in the past. In \\"Billiards at Half-Past Nine,\\" brought to the Engish reader by Pulitzer Prize winning translator, Leila Vennewitz, Heinrich Boell, Germany's conscience and master story teller, presents perhaps his greatest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was horrible!","review":"I absolutely HATED this book.

The action contains only this one day when he meets Cornelius, a banana seller who teaches him how life is in the early 19th century in America.All in all the author describes the superficiality of the fast living society in America during the Industrialization and the naivety of immigrants who blindly believe in the wrong promises of the American Dream.To my mind the play is very useful for English lessons and I can really recommend it to everyone who is interested in the American Dream or America in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"More good stuff from Go Nagai.","review":"This is another vintage gem from the creator of Cutey Honey and devilman,it's action packed,sexy and crazy as Nagai's stuff,but..it ended a bit too soon towards the end,I was expecting a much bigger lead-up towards the end,but instead we're left with a lot of loose ends in this which were sadly never answered,it could've used a sequel,but ah well,it's still worth a watch,and that's a fact with this one shot.So check it out,if you like go nagai based anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality item","review":"I got this for christmas and I must say, it's one of the worst things i've gotten in recent memory. The product is cheaply made with low quality parts and terrible button placement, especially on the d-pad.

Which one of mine is faulty by the way; so in the video games I put on it; it's extremely hard to control. The one good thing about this product is it has a great video player and nice screen clarity, but use headphones with volume control, because this doesn't have any means of changing the volume.

We also purchased the shower spray nozzle and garden hose adapter. It is easy to change from the sink to the shower.Also we got the bag which I recommend.

We charged the battery completely and tried again... it would try to light but the pump would'nt do a thing. Are we needing a new pump already?

Even then ended up returning it. The build quality is not of a very high standard. Out of the box we had many issues with leaks. Then the front control dial would only work at a couple of positions, so the product out of the box was not usable. Due to the obvious poor build quality rather than just return it for a replacement I could see that even if you get a fully functioning one, it may last you just long enough that you'll have a faulty unit after your warranty is up, not to mention the coast and hassle of dealing with warranty anyway, and believe me at some point wou will need to do so if you aquire this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy and Tough","review":"I have used this water heater on four recent occasions. The only thing I don't like about it is the water bag. It's easy to strip the plastic threads on the bag and the bag needs to be a gallon bigger and easier to fold down.

All of a sudden it would show one zone at 45degrees and the other at 77degrees. When you open the fridge you can tell by feeling the bottles that those temperatures are actually reversed, as far as the zone goes. Either way, there is no adjusting the temperature and half the wine is almost frozen (actually had ice/frost layer build up on my wine, or it is warm to the touch.

Right now it is sitting in pieces in a box. It might work just fine if you could get it put together, but I may never ever know. I'm just hoping the next time a man comes over he can put it together for me.

They are light and easy to carry and to maintain.I have used tillers for over 50 years....my Dad hitched me to the first one when I was 15, and we had a half-acre vegetable garden. This small tiller is perfect for my flower beds and tomato patch, and it tills beautifully.

The only thing I'd like to see improved is the folding handle system -- it's just not that easy to fold and open the handles, but it's a minor thing.Ok, you might still need your shovel for larger plants, but you'll be easily shoveling into pudding-like soil.Pick up a copy of Tracy DiSabato-Aust's \\"The Well-Tended Perennial Garden: Planting and Pruning Techniques\\" for information on how to prepare the soil for planting.Other folks in other reviews talk in detail about how to use the Mantis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love My Electric Mantis","review":"After ordering the Mantis Electric Tiller, I was a bit skeptical about using an extension cord to till.

And yes... it does bounce a lot, because it is so light and my ground even tho tilled is very rocky.However, I deal with this and really enjoy my Mantis Elec.I have had another tiller before that starts with a T and ends with a Y and really was quite put off by it.Get a Mantis, you'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mantis 7250-02-02 Electric Tiller - Did Not Hold Up","review":"We assembled our tiller, put it in the ground, tilled approximately 6 feet of ground (no sod), when the screws holding the handles together came off.

I am tickled to death with it! At first, it didn't seem to do much with the hard clay that is my yard. But, I discovered that if you wet the ground thoroughly first and then use the 'vacuum cleaner' method the manufacturer recommends, it digs like a demon. I used to break my back digging with a shovel and pitchfork. I just got finished digging up a 20' x 20' four inch deep bed in about 15 minutes. My arms are shaking a bit from the effort, but nothing like if I had used a shovel. So far, it has finished so many jobs that it seems like I don't use it much because it does the work so quick. Of course, I would dread having to till a big garden with it because it is small. But, the small size makes it perfect for landscaping tight places. I highly recommend the mantis for landscaping your yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"With all the money spent on advertising, I assumed that theMantis tiller was just another TV gimmick.

Even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir itself can't seem to duplicate the fervor of this particular performance.

I used to search to see if it was on CD yet a number of years ago, but was always disappointed. I forgot to search again until recently when I noticed it on YouTube.

I thought it was rather strange for a Baroque piece, but kept listening to it to resurrect the Christmas cheer every year.Then I listened toJohn Eliot Gardiner's rendition, and I finally understood what I was missing.Unlike Gardiner's version, this version lacks the lightness of step and vigor of Handel. Instead, it's a muddy, leaden, over-dramatic mess. The microphones seem to be set quite a ways from a HUGE choir and orchestra, creating a foggy, booming atmosphere.From other reviews here, it sounds like many people like this simply because of fond memories from their childhood. If you don't have those memories and know even a little bit about classical music, DON'T get this version.

This is a great tool so long as:1) You don't need to cut more than, say, 3/4ths of an inch in length. Forget getting anything longer in anything like a straight line. You can't see where you're cutting, the grip is awkward, and it moves all over the place.2) You don't need to cut anything more than 1/8th of an inch thick. Even then, expect the ultra-thin blade to bind like crazy.3) You don't need to cut anything hard. Thin plywood? Pegboard? A dowel? Hard plastic? Don't even think about it. It might cut (partially) through some nice Chinese drywall or wet cardboard. Provided it doesn't bind first.In short, I can't see a use for this attachment after trying and failing to use it in several different projects. Maybe you'll have better luck, but you should definitely think twice before purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tool ever","review":"I got this ool for my science class.

Unfortunately the mini-saw barely scores most of the rather thin wood pieces I work with (roughly 3/8\\") and too, it easily gets bogged down and thus, unable to operate properly. . . my antique \\"toy\\" circular saw (Mighty Might Tools -- mid-1970's) is nearly as good as this device and it only cuts balsa & Styrofoam.I'm seriously disappointed and it has made me more hesitant when it comes to purchasing other Dremel attachments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice except the shield can get in the way","review":"The integral safety shield is a good idea but it gets in the way of seeing the path of the blade.

So the this MDF dulls the steel blade. You can't resharpen the blade. There's no other toothed blade types (like carbide) available. Wanna buy a new blade? Spend $8 each.

Although I saw other comments that the game could not run on XP, it ran perfectly fine on my system. The only thing I had to change was my version of Quicktime. Overall, there are some puzzles that can be tantalizing while others are practically common sense. There is really no character interaction at all, making it seem very similar to Mist. My least favorite part about the game is the ending. If you complete your task, there is no dramatic scene of your people being freed or really the \\"bad guy\\" perishing.

In the end, Rothbard illuminates a complete vision of Liberty toward which we can all strive together.Note: some of the references in this 1978 book are dated in terms of technology, nominal dollar values and government issues.

It *looks* like a great idea and simple to use, however, it didn't work very well for me.I have a push mower and a riding mower, so I started with the push mower's blade first. It's a 20\\" Sears mower with a 'mulching' blade. The problem I had with the tool is that it's very hard to slide across the blade; perhaps the blade on my lawnmower was too thick for the tool or the small amount of grass on the blade provided too much friction.After struggling quite a bit to get the tool to move across the blade, I eventually got the blade slightly sharp, but the sharpening stone is already quite warn... there's no way I'll be able to do the three blades on my riding mower.I was hoping to avoid using the good 'old file method to sharpen the blades, but I think that might actually be the easier method. The tool is well made and easy to install, but it's a little harder to use than one might think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Riding Mower Blades","review":"Unfortunately this, like many Dremel attachments, is just too \\"weenie\\" for the job at hand. My mower blades won't even come close to fitting in the guide slot. Maybe a single push mower blade will? Took off the guide and tried the stone by itself: OK if your blade isn't too nicked, and you have a lot of time. I'm way better off free handing with an angle grinder. I bought my Dremel kit a few years ago, and am consistently disappointed with the tool. I have a LOT tools that I love, but this isn't one of them. I think it'd be good for small craft projects (which I seldom do), but for anything bigger there are better tools for almost any task - including sharpening mower blades. I also got sucked into trying the chainsaw attachment, but I get MUCH better results with a hand file."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Dremel accessory I've ever returned","review":"The concept behind this accessory is good but the implementation is poor. The plastic adapter that positions the grindstone at the correct angle to the blade is subject to not fitting the blade because one size does not fit all. Also, the adapter is made of a hard plastic that easily wears down as it is drawn across the lawnmower blade. The grindstone is small and while spinning at high speed multiple passes are required to grind off much metal at all. Dremel used to have a commercial that made the process of blade sharpening using this accessory to be a breeze ... it is not.The easiest was to sharpen a lawnmower blade is by using an inexpensive bench grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawn mower blade sharpener attachment for Dremel","review":"I usually give the products I buy from Amazon very good ratings, but not this time.

I ended up using my Dremel to sharpen the blades without any attachment. Sorry folks, but I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I sharpened three blades for my garden tractor using a file, a conventional electric grinder, and the dremel attachment. Careful use of the grinder produced the sharpest edge. It also produced by far the most uniform edge and was the quickest too.

Finally, a biography packed with excitement!","review":"I have read everything written by Jim Corbett, as well as other biographies written about him. The other bios were well-documented with fact, but failed to hold my interest because of their documentary-style format. This author took a chance with this creative approach to Corbett's life and adventures, and it was worth the effort. Let's face it, the world doesn't need another factual biography of Jim Corbett. Everything there is to know about the man has already been published in three other books. This author has boldly mixed fact with fiction, resulting in a thrilling story that left me spellbound and wanting more. If you believe what the critics are saying about this book, you'll miss a gem of a story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where's the Beef?!!\\"","review":"Having read most of the books by and about Corbett, and all the reviews about'Master of the Jungle' here, I agree with those who gave the book a single star rating. The author's imaginationwas so high, it was sickening. Corbettand sister Maggie were never attackedby the natives before they left India;in reality they wept. Jim didn't pack his belonging into a horse wagon, they were loaded into a truck to be taken to the nearest railway station-Ramnagar. Jim and Maggie arrived at the station intheir own car, and he donated this car to the Forest dept. These are all documented in various books and journals,but it appears that the author and the publisher took the easy street to produce this book. Like one of the critics mentioned here, with apologies to Grafton Novels; I will also give the book a 'R' rating: R is for Recall orR is for Recycle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dramatic.","review":"The author has a great technique for making you feel the fear and causing the hair on your neck to stand on end. I could actually visualize the environment and the scenes depicted. I found the hunts relating to the panthers especially dramatic.I also appreciated the way the story portrayed why the animals turned to maneating, resulting from an injury or handicap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth or fiction?","review":"Being somewhat of a student of Corbetts writing, I was really looking forward to the first new book written about him in some time. Jim Corbetts own writing is full of moment by moment, edge of your seat type of adventure. I was hoping this book would dig more deeply into Corbett the man. Overall I was very disappointed. The book is shallow, inaccurate, and in places dramatized. For the life of me I can't understand why anyone would think they could add to the story as written by Corbett himself. Worst of all some events where altered from what Corbett wrote. If you have never read one of Corbetts own accounts this one might be okay. If you have read the real thing, then don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defacing a Legend","review":"If I could give this book \\"No Star,\\" I would. This is a badly written and shamefully fictionalized re-hash of the career of a true hero. It does Jim Corbett a real disservice. To anyone interested in Corbett's career, I strongly recommend you read instead Corbett's own accounts, Man-Eater of Kumaon, The Temple Tiger and the Man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag. All are easy to obtain if not new then second-hand. They are much better written, much more exciting, and true. The author of this book should be ashamed of himself for defacing a legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT SUBJECT, BUT POORLY PRESENTED!","review":"After reading Corbett's six books and three excellent biographies by Kala (1980), Booth (1986) and Jaleel (1997), I didn't think there was much left in the form of new material on Corbett's life when I came across this title. I was right! There is nothing new here, in fact, there is nothing in this book that could be labeled and sold under the banner of biography. It appears to me that the publisher and the author just 'borrowed' Corbett's name to create an imaginary story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing if you really enjoy Jim Cobett's books","review":"I am a VERY big fan of all Corbett 's books and some other biographies of Colonel Jim Corbett , but this Tim Werling book is pitifully written. This book has none of the \\" smell of gun oil , and gun powder mixed with fear and excitement\\" that Man Eaters of Kumoan (and Corbetts other books) encapsulate. Tim Werling style is more akin to a Mills and Boon love novel than Corbetts 450 400 double nitro express rifle style . Master of The Jungle was a major disappointment to me. I even tried to give my copy of Master of the Jungle away for free at a gun show and no one wanted it! Any one that gives this 5 stars lives on sugary cotton candy (called Fairy Floss in Australia) Dont waste your money I unfortunately wasted mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WERLING writing about CORBETT","review":"I have read many of these kinds of books. However, I was not able to finish reading this book. WERLING lacks the writing skills of the greats in this line of true-life adventures.

I wanted something that would organize without looking tacky. The unit was a little too tall to fit under my cabinets, all assembled, so I ended up taking off the 2 bottom letter trays, and using those in a different spot, to make it a little shorter. This would be perfect for an office! It seems sturdy and so far, it has worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPOINTED","review":"I have wanted this item for quite some time since I love to keep my office organized. I finally decided to purchase it even though I thought it was a bit pricy for something like this. The image of the product actually looks a lot better then when the product arrives. It seems very cheaply made and it is very flimsy. I was very disapointed after spending about $40.00.

Pen holder is a bit to small but serves its purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This story was expertly put together in so much that it explains why the rings are ineffective against the color yellow. That impurity has a name. Does Parallax ring a bell? It also explains what happened to Hal Jordan and how it happened. It was an excellent way to bring Hal back looking blameless.Also, Batman actually gets belted! There aren't too many people in the DC universe that could pull that off, but GL does it. You won't be sorry if you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read if You're New to Green Lantern","review":"Although I'm not new to comics or graphic novels, I have less experience with the Green Lantern series than others. As you read the character backstories provided before the story arc you'll be caught up on anything you need to know going into Rebirth. Having said that I absolutely LOVE this novel. There are many likable GL's in this series however only one lovable one, that one of course being the greatest of them all, Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan is one of the coolest characters as a Green Lantern in all of the DC Universe the GL lore is rich, storied (do some research if you don't already know the basics) intriguing and interesting. Rebirth features the pretty much perfect writing of Geoff Johns and the very fitting artwork of Ethan Van Sciver (who I personally like a lot), these two really were meant to do comics together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Corps is Back","review":"This is a great mini-series collected into one book that explains all the un-answered questions that Green Lantern fans have asked about for years. Lets not forget why the mini-series came about, the return of HAL JORDAN the greatest green lantern of all times. It was nice to see the corps brought back and done with great respect and honor. Geoff Jones is a great writer. His stories are easy to follow. I am a huge Aquaman fan and I am hoping that once the brightest day is over that Geoff will be the writer for the new Aquaman series!!!! Fingers crossed.Great mini-series and if you are a true Green Lantern fan you should have this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geoff John's Thank You","review":"In the 1990's DC wanted to start fresh with Green Lantern so they made him go crazy , kill the corps, and become Parallax. Much later Hal Jordab/ Parallax died saving the sun or some bull.But Hal Jordan is brought back in this four issue mini series by Geoff Johns and Ethan van Sciver.The story is that Hal Jordan is now the host for the Spectre but Parallax is coming back. Kyle Rayner who'd been Hal's replacement while he's been gone recovers his body from the sun and brings it back to earth. Now not giving alot of spoilers but Hal Jordan is revived and there's an explanation of why he went crazy and killed some people.The Writing is good and is easy to read and understand for new comic book fans. The artwork by Ethan Van Sciver is spectactular. It's highly detailed giving a some what realistic view of the comic. I reccomend to anyone even if your not a green antern or comic book fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Having only previously read Agent Orange and Blackest Night, I found this to be a spectacular introduction to the Green Lantern series as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Redemption of Hal Jordan","review":"Geoff Johns brought Hal Jordan back from the dead with \\"Rebirth,\\" a move that delighted many fans and upset others. However, it's not so surprising that DC decided to bring back one of their flagship characters after Kyle Rayner failed to capture the readers' imagination. The story itself is one of the better Green Lantern stories in years, and was followed by the less-than-stellar ongoing series. If you enjoyed this reboot, I also recommend Johns and Gibbons'sGreen Lantern Corps: Recharge."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Incredible How Johns Explains & Expands On Key Aspects of the GL 40+ Year History","review":"This 6 Issue saga brings back Hal Jordan and does a wonderful job of explaining and expanding on key issues we have more than 40 years taking for granted with the GL Mythos. I can't say anything more because it would spoil the epic 6 issue journey. The Art is spectacular too! If you like comics, read it. I guarantee you'll enjoy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong book","review":"I have to admit that I have never thought much of the Green Lantern(s). They just never seemed that interesting to me, but I also heard bits and pieces of their history and I know their general history. I was surprised when I started to hear great things about Rebirth and I figured that it would be a good jumping on point, and it was.Geoff John's somehow managed to pull off a old comic book cliche (It was my clone, It was a robot, I was possessed) but also make it very interesting and he intertwined it very nicely into the story. I would also like to thank him for getting rid and explaining why Green Lanterns are afraid of the color Yellow.While the story and the art are both good though I honestly didn't think Green Lantern: Rebirth was really that great. I mean the way people talked about it I thought it would be like Watchmen or Kingdom Come. Instead it was just a strong story. Worth getting, but its nowhere near the hype in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The artwork in Green Lantern Rebirth was a visual feast. The story was also pretty good. I hadn't really had too much experience with GL before I read this, and that's definately gonna change after reading it.

Because is WAY to expensive for only 200 and some pages. Is such a tiny Absolute. I felt like a moron after I open the package and see the thin book.This $10 new edition of Green Lantern Rebirth is the right way to go, guys. Don't waste your money on the Absolute unless you are a hardcore collectionist.UPDATE: 06/JULY/2010The only thing this book don't have from the Absolute is GREEN LANTERN #1, and GREEN LANTERN SECRET FILES 2005.I'm SO happy because I return my Absolute Rebirth..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sconce","review":"This wall light is very nice.

These books are perfectly tuned toward the adult native english speaker, and very steadfastly increase ones knowledge and ability with the language. I've use the text with 3 different tutors as well, and at the Boston Language Institute, where it is the only text used for Japanese. It does start with romaji, but only to teach hiragana, and then uses hiragana until you know the kanji. Its a perfect procession geared to the unique learning disability of english speaking adults who do may not have the luxury of living in Japan, and by the 2nd volume you are really impressing native speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me while I gouge my eyes out","review":"I am currently using this book in a first-year Japanese class at a community college. I came across Amazon's page for it while I was looking for a better book to learn from, so that may tell you something.I've taken several high school and university courses in 3 different languages (not Japanese), and I must say that this is the worst book I've ever used. Grammatical explanations are terse and lack examples. Vocabulary given is minimal. The book doesn't even have a glossary at the back! This book minimizes the language structure to the point that it's difficult to understand.Please please please, unless you have to buy this book for a class, don't get it. I'd recommend a better book, but I'm still searching for one...um, that came out wrong, not that there's no better book than this (God I hope that's not so!), just that I'm at the beginning of the search. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only attraction is the price","review":"The price of this book is excellent for college students since it's not even more than $20, but I don't recommend it to those who really have a passion to learn Japanese in an efficient way. Its romanized Japanese text is the worst thing of this book, now in my 2nd level class I found out that the majority of my classmates either still use romanized words rather than hiragana/katakana, or have difficulty reading kana, or both. The other bad things of this book are that it's not up-to-date and the vocabularies are not in dictionary form.

The compost starter seems to kick things off in a hurry, so hopefully the compost will be just about done by the time freezing weather comes.Packaging: Some of the pelletized starter leaked out of the product box into the shipping box.

Well, I threw the whole box in (a little at a time, mixing it) and wet things down thoroughly. I went out today, about a week later for the \\"7-10 day turnover\\", and was VERY surprised to see (and smell) a rich compost in the making.

I guess I'll see how easy it will be to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"rated 1 for packaging, not the product","review":"Our grill was delivered totally damaged due to bad packaging. The grill was placed in a box that was visibly too small for its contents with the dome part of the lid touching the top of the box. The dome was very crushed when it arrived. Also, one of the sides of the box was crushed which crushed the wheel and the mechanism that keeps the grill attached to the legs. We were leery about ordering another one and ended up purchasing a grill at Home Depot.In fairness to Amazon, they were most apologetic about the problem and were very quick to take back the product plus reimburse us for the item and the shipping fee to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aussie WalkAbout Grill","review":"I ordered this grill because we had one exactly like the one that I had ordered. I picked this grill because my husband just thought the grill was great but our old (very) grill was falling apart. I gave him the new one for Christmas. I was very disappointed in the shipping of the grill. The box that it was packed in was falling apart by the time that I received it. The main handle on the grill was broken. (I didn't send it back because it would have cost $28.00 to ship). I believe that I can use the handle on the old grill and put it on the new grill. Other than the quality of shipping and the broken handle, I am pleased to have a new grill to replace our old AussieWalkAbout Grill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it after 4 months of use","review":"Purchased the grill from Home Depot and only got four months use out of it before my wife noticed that the paint was peeling off the bottom in large patches.

We let it warm up and after about 10 minutes there was an overwhelming smell of burning paint or plastic? The charcoal was a normal kingsford type and there was never anything else added... ??? We couldn't get the smell to go away no matter what we tried.

This pathetic example of anti-biblical writing has brevity as its only and inconsiderable virtue, and is only capable of being enjoyed by those who have little knowledge and little belief in the Bible. The book contains almost no history about the Bible, and is mainly an anti-biblical philosophical tract devoted to minimalism.

I do wish it had more in the containers, but hey, it's okay for the job it does. i don't buy the waterproof version though, and I do not think that this is hard to wash out. i personally remove it in the shower most of the time, and most of the mascara just washes off with water.

The CD did not have any 30 second music links to preview so I simply took it on faith that the rest of the cuts would be as good as the first. The singer has what I would describe as that typical Brazilian mono-tonal quality to her voice, a la Astrid Giberto and Babel. Unfortunately this quality, the lack of a full backup orchestra and her attempts to sing in English make the CD almost amatuerish in quality. Frankly this lady just can't carry a tune and it is a shame because the guitar and the paino behind her are first rate, but not enough to redeem her performance. I regret purchasing this CD and apart from the first cut mentioned above the rest is very disappointing.

This book helps inform young audiences about our nation's history in a way that they can understand. Although this is a childen's book, it is great reading for all agaes, and really hits home for those who have memories of the Cold War. The disagreement between the Yooks and the Zooks expresses how they both think bread should be buttered. One \\"butter-side up\\" and the other \\"butter-side down.\\" The controversey, turning into a battle shows Dr. Seuss' dislike for generic disputes. The Yooks and the Zooks hurry to develop more powerful weapons, until; both groups take it to an extreme. The underlying theme to the book is the absuridity of battle. Dr. Seuss tries to convey that people must overcome their pride to live in peace. Memories of the Cold War like the wall dividing the Yooks and Zooks add to the realistic element to The Butter Battle Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone should read_ especially with a child","review":"This is a beautiful book showing how \\"ignorance, prejudices and lack of dialogue\\" can lead to clash of civilizations.

Published very late in the \\"Dr. Seuss\\" career, it is as if someone else were attempting to imitate Theodore Geisel's style (which is what I suspect was the case). Unlike \\"The Lorax\\", an earlier book about another serious subject, pollution, in the \\"Butter Battle\\": 1) the imagination and creativity are lacking (nothing equivalent to \\"Brown Bar-ba-loots\\" and \\"Truffala Tufts\\"), 2) the style seems forced (many phrases are adapted from previous books), 3) the author's tone is much more harsh, 4) there is a major continuity problem near the end that confuses both child and adult alike, and 5) most importantly, the writing simply does not flow, making it uninteresting to an average child.My suggestion: leave this until the last book in your Dr. Seuss collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and forced, feels like an imposter.","review":"This didn't feel like an authentic Seuss, just as another reviewer has pointed out... The narrative is stiff, the rhymes lacking fluidity and humor, and the story is just plain dull.

But his childish view of of the Cold War, at his age, is unforgivable. Likening the difference between freedom and Communism to the difference between the location of butter on bread is frustrating, and demonstrates once again how our American celebrities are unbelievably idealistic and out of touch with the realities of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivializes a serious matter","review":"While I love Dr. Seuss, I cannot believe that he trivializes the Cold War in the way that he does with this book. The much hated \\"arms race\\" was a race to protect ourselves and was a race that we not only won, but a race that also brought down the Soviet Union. Ironically, we won it because we outspent the Soviets. We outspent the Soviets because capitalism creates wealth. The fight between capitalism, which allows freedom, and the crushing weight of communism, which ideology has systematically killed more humans than any other in the last century, is not boiled down to something as simple as butter on bread.

With big inventions, the two sides come at a standstill, daring each other to make their move. The book relates to how an actual war starts and how it keeps growing as it gets fed violence and non-sensed kinds of unsolved problems. This book was great with all the wacky coined language.

You've probably heard the expression that a camel is a horse designed by committee. This is a book written by a knowledgable mountain biker then stuffed into the Falcon/Globe-Pequot format. This fomulaic (sp?) approach to a mountain bike guide just doesn't work. The local guides and maps are cheaper, better and lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Christmas DVD","review":"DVD was in very good condition and I really enjoyed it. Received the DVD in time to enjoy it over the Holiday Season."},{"rating":"1","title":"No color","review":"Why did you send me an uncolorized version of this DVD, when the pictures on your website show it in color??The movies are great, but your packaging is very misleading. Don't picture it in color if it is not the colorized version.I am not a happy customer, and will find a colorized version of Holiday Inn somehwere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 star favorite classic movie to own....","review":"Its interesting how timeless the story line is, because here it is 2005 and our parish has many of the same challenges as the character Preiests in the movie. Sure its sappy, but whats wrong with sappy? The music is wonderful the acting wonderful and the message timeless.Barry Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby work so well together to the point you become so absorbed that they actually seem like they are Priests and not actors. The group of young boys who make up the rag tag choir are superb (they were actually members of the Robert Mitchell Boy Choir ). I also appreciated Eily Malyon who played Mrs. Carmody the housekeeper of the rectory.Interesting thing is it Won 7 Oscars, and during the period of the Oscars Bing Crosby was filming The Bells of St Marys with Ingrid Bergman who played Sister Mary Benedict. Both movies were directed by Leo McCarey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Classics","review":"These are two of my very favorite Christmas movies! They are both funny but have a wonderful sentimental touch. Bing Crosby is great as always in both and Barry Fitzgerald is a riot as the old priest in Going My Way. Perfect for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Color this one, please!","review":"When are they going to come out with a colorized version of Holiday Inn? I have never seen a film call out for it more than this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bing Crosby Double Feature","review":"Conceived from an idea by composer Irving Berlin, Mark Sandrich's \\"Holiday Inn\\" is a humorous, festive Crosby/Astaire musical that finds both performers in tip-top, toe-tapping form. Famous for introducing \\"White Christmas,\\" the best-selling single of all time and an instant favorite with troops overseas, \\"Inn\\" is consistently tuneful and entertaining with a sublime Berlin score that covers not just Christmas, but all major holidays. Watch for the July 4th rave-up \\"Let's Say It With Firecrackers,\\" one of many musical highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little mix up with seller is win for me","review":"I had originally ordered the special edition dvd of the movie Holiday Inn through a seller on Amazon. I was sent this dvd instead which was fine with me as I got 2 movies for the price of one. I have always liked Holiday Inn and really prefer the pairing of Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby to the one in White Christmas with Danny Kaye. I Do like the story in White Christmas better through. Great Dancing and singing. Some Geniunely funning moments. The Bonus movie going my way was a delight as I had never seen it and truly enjoyed every minute. Loved the interaction between the two main characters. Great music in this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite children's book","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. It is meatier than the typical children's tome, and filled with simple yet real life information about the buffalo and its environment toward the end of its heyday in the 1870's. I highly recommend this for any parent who wants to introduce their child to a slightly more challenging story that will stimulate the brain and encourage a more advanced intellect, without sacrificing the charm and innocence that a children's volume also needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walk","review":"I have tried many of the Leslie Sansone videos and have always been pleased. Her interaction with the other walkers can get on your nerves, but other than that the workout is excellent and fast. Great workout even if you don't have a lot of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"Once again, Leslie has not let me down. I started with the fast 2 mile walk for a few weeks and then tried the fast 3 mile. It really is a great workout! I feel motivated to move and it is fun. Once I get used to the 3 mile I am definitely going to try the 4 mile. Believe me, this is not something I would have thought I would have said. If you really want a workout, try this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"It's a little too fast paced for me right now, but I plan on getting it down sooner than later"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work out, a little too much talking at times","review":"I first learned about Leslie's work outs through an ON Demand 10 minute workout that was on my cable program. I did it for a few days and loved it! I have been doing this 1 & 2 mile walk for the past few days and I am sore (which is a great thing). I even had my boyfriend to try it one day and he was sweating like crazy and said that his abs have never been that sore! I love this DVD! I havent had a chance to look at the 3 mile DVD that came along with it yet, but I am sure its just as great.At times Leslie does get a little carried away with the talking, and interacting with Jimmy. But after a few workouts you will ignore it. But there is an option on the DVD where u can have the whole workout where the its only music and you cannot hear her talking, If the talking is distracting you too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can pick to workout to music only!","review":"I like this one as you have all sorts of different workout combinations you can do and you can choose to do it with music only and no chit chat...sometimes I like the encouragement though so I do it with the chit chat. Both DVD's in this set make me sweat...and now I like to sweat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Walking Workout - Bad Labeling","review":"Similar to T. Smith, my discs were mislabeled. I decided to keep them rather than send them back. I just have to remember that the labels are switched.I enjoyed the workout for the most part. Leslie is a tad chatty on this one. But, I enjoyed the interval or \\"boosted\\" walking. It was a change of pace. I find that I actually work harder with the DVD's than I do on the treadmill at the gym. And, it is nice to get the upper body work.So far, Leslie has the best walking workouts. I have DVD's from other trainers (Prevention, Kathy Smith, Denise Austin) but I just don't enjoy them as much. I like how Leslie focuses on health rather than weight loss. I think that will help me to stay on track because I will focus on how I feel rather than how much I weigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but....","review":"The DVD is pretty good and you will get a good workout, but I feel that Leslie seems way too goofy on this tape.About the dvd itself: There are 2 DVDs with a chapter option so you can select 1 mile, 2mile, etc. The best feature for this dvd is that it has a music only option so even if you are like me and find Leslie to be too goofy for your taste once you get used to the moves you can play it with no voices and only music. The workouts themselves are interspersed with high intensity jogging and low impact fast walking. From the start it moves pretty fast so if this is your first time with the walk slim dvds try to take it easy until you can move up to the higher intensity moves. Also these workouts don't use any extras like the weighted balls, stretchie, or the ab belt so its very accessible for everyone. 4 stars for the good workout but not for Leslie's goofiness... I usually am ok with her chatter but not on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely terrific! Fun and Easy","review":"I really love this DVD. I injured my back terribly last summer and wanted to do some low impact exercising. Walking was the only thing I could do without re-injuring my back. This DVD was perfect. I was able to start slowly and go at my own pace which made the world of difference. My right leg down to my foot was half numb from my back problem and after several weeks I noticed my leg was a lot less numb feeling...this DVD is really helping my circulation and doesn't hurt my back as long as I go at a steady pace.I highly recommend this DVD or others by Leslie Sansone. She is fun, vibrant and very enjoyable to watch and listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"let me tell you i have done alot of leslies videos and this one is awesome it is sooooooooooooo much fun to do and you will definetly feel it the next day. i know alot of people dont like to hear her chatter but this one is so much fun to watch because it has awesome music and it is very uplifting. of all her videos this 3 mile one is the only one i am going to use from now on. i used a perdometer and it calculated 5894 steps short of 106 for the 6000 you walk for a regular 3 mile walk. trust me this one is fun.for those of you who cant stand the chatter it has a music only button."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE OFF HER ROCKER","review":"I now have seven diff. Leslie Workouts and normally I love them, not so with this one. It seems production was rushed and it did not get any editing as I can see the camera guy cruising by in the background no less than 2-3 times in the two mile walk. Also as other reviews have noted, the two dvd's ARE MISLABLED which shows lack of attention or care. Leslie does not act like herself in these two workouts either. She's way too goofy and out of it, chatting about who knows what while she's out of step and changing things up without letting us know. I tried to do the 3 mile tonight but after just 3 minutes of it I was so annoyed at the program I had to take it out and put in her walk/jog dvd instead. My favorite leslie workouts are Walk/Jog and 3 mile for Abs. They are terrific but this one is not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"At my church exercise class we were using this DVD and I bought it for myself for use at home on days when we don't exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workhorse of a Tool","review":"This product does what it is advertised to do, and does it all day long, every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY 10 YR.OLD LIKES IT","review":"JUST THE FACT THAT MY 10 YEAR OLD LIKES READING IT, SAYS IT ALL. BEST READER I HAVE FOUND FOR KIDS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamsters Are Better Live","review":"This is a very good rock/blues-rock CD, although heavier on the rock. The Hamsters are one of the tightest bands I've ever heard, with decent vocals and excellent guitar. The Hamsters' forte is their impressive treatment of cover material. Yes, they cover Hendrix (quite well, I might add), but also bring more obscure covers to life with excellent interpretations (case in point from this CD - \\"Come To Popa\\" and Robin Trower's \\"Tear it Up\\"). Slim, the band's talented guitarist (and also the vocalist), has agressive, gritty blues-rock leads to fit just about any style of music. His leads are powerful and moving, but never overdone.An even better CD is \\"Hamster Jam\\", an energetic, 57+ minute live recording that much better portrays the band's talent. As stated by a previous reviewer of \\"Route 666\\", this band is best enjoyed live. \\"Hamster Jam\\" has been discontinued for a while, but has recently been re-issued, so it should make it's way back into circulation soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are Hot","review":"After seeing that these guys got together with Carvin Jones when he was in the UK on tour I took a chance. From the first tune, 666, I was grabbed by the neck and soundly rocked. Every song on this CD is great rock/blues. The blues component of their sound is somewhat suble. The lyrics are interesting and coherent. The vocals are rather outstanding. These guys know how to rock you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite scent!","review":"I love this stuff and cannot find it stores anymore. Amazon has the best prices by the way! Healing Garden makes lots of nice scents so even if this is not for you, I do suggest trying some of their other scents. This is sweet, but not too sweet and it is a body spray so it may go on a little strong, but it mellows to a wonderful soft aroma that lingers only lightly. I get TONS of complements when I wear it. \\"Gee you smell so good!!\\" I cannot recommend this more highly! Great price too. Who needs to shell out $$ to smell great???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete. Misssing entries for common drugs.","review":"Two of the few drugs that I ever needed to look up are not even in this book. Glucagon which is a very common antihypoglycemic for one. The combination antihypertemsive drug Diovan HCT was not even mentioned either. I had to go out and but a second reference to supplement this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echo Echo - The Heart of Carbon Leaf","review":"What an astonishingly fresh sound from a band that has finally grabbed the public's attention after years of being the envy of local musicians! Anyone who has watched Carbon Leaf develop can recognize the distinct array of musical influences that they have proudly embraced, and that have become the roots of a distinct and original sound. It is this sound that is best embodied on Echo Echo. From the opening fingerstyle guitar fluidity displayed in \\"The Boxer,\\" to the fabulously produced and musically textured \\"Maybe Today,\\" the listener cannot help but wonder how just five musicians can be so multi-talented, both stylistically and instrumentally. What's even more impressive is that the four-part harmonies, skin-tight rhythms, and classy solos are just as crisp, and even more satisfying in person. Echo Echo is a testament to the extreme talent and heart displayed by this band, and their live show is the reason Carbon Leaf should never stop playing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guys are great !!!","review":"Don't miss this album is fantastic. Great mix of sounds, great voices, great harmony !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full-bore Awesome Music","review":"I first heard The Boxer on DC101 in 2001 and immediately was blown away by the fact that this was great music that didn't rely on foul language and electronic engineering to make it addictive. I got the album that week and was so pleased with it. The Boxer gave way to Shine, my personal favorite. What can you say about a true rock song that manages to include mandolin? Genius. The piano on I Know The Reason is absolutely stirring. I catch myself doing air piano every single time I listen. Bottom line...EVERY single song on this album is awesome. There is no filler on the whole disc.This is music in the truest sense. You can hear the passion in every aspect. The guitars grind, then they seduce. The lyrics are ethereal. You can't have a soul and not get hooked on this album. Carbon Leaf give their all and it shows.P.S. the Bonus track at the end is worth the price of the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"This is a great CD. Every song is excellant. If you get a chance to see them live, do it. If you like Carbon Leaf, check out Spirit Of The West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a chance and loved it!","review":"I heard this song (the Boxer) on Elliot in the morning on DC101 and I love it. I am very cautious about buying a cd when I have only heard one song but I just had a feeling that the rest of the cd would be at least decent. It is GREAT! This guys are talented. I agree that this group is really going to be big. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes a wide range of music. I think it sounds like a mix of traditional irish music and dave matthews band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily their best album!","review":"Echo Echo is a marvelous fusion of alternative, punk and Irish folk music. It is by far their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music, classic song","review":"The main reason you should get this CD is for the wonderful track \\"The Boxer,\\" which ranks as one of the best alt-pop songs from the past ten years, a perfect mix of Celtic and US rock.IT is not that the rest of the album is bad, Mary Mac stands out as a good \\"follow up single\\" but the rest simply pale in comparison.But be assured that if you pick up this album you will not get the usual \\"one good song and the rest filler\\" type of album. Instead you get one all time classic and the rest good, decent rock/pop songs. Pick this one up and be reassured that good rock music is still being made..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lyrics, Awesome Sound, WE WANT MORE!...","review":"These guys are true musicians who can do it all and their music has a style of it's own. It's great to be able to understand all the words to the songs and not have to turn it off when the kids are in the van. My 9 and 6 year old can't get enough of \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"Torn to Tattered\\". My wife and I love the entire CD. Even my mother ordered the CD after she heard ours. I hope they're working on their next CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much overrated!","review":"I had read Douglas's Trading in the Zone before. I had a very high expectation on this one. However, I was very disappointed.The author emphasized throughout the book the importance of entering the zone, a state of mind that you can neglect fear, greed, P/L, and just trade according to your feeling of the market, though he supplemented that with the need of analysis, hardwork, focus blah blah blah, and that different people have different means to enter the zone, illustrated with examples anonymous. Those might be true stories. However, the author just did not tell the readers how they could do it themselves without the assistance of a coach like the author's good self.A reviewer of this book wrote that this should be read together with Douglas's Trading in the Zone and Mc Call's The Way of the Warrior Trader. One should read those two excellent books only, but definitely not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much use for me.","review":"I bought it and not much to learn from it.

The problem is in manifesting those ideas, making them work in concrete reality. Ari Kiev's book goes beyond the typical in that it doesn't stop at merely describing those obstacles to becoming a better trader; it pushes into the realm of implementation.All of us can recall the feeling when everything falls into place, a point made clear from the many relevant interviews that reinforce Dr. Kiev's points. The difficulty--and the strength of this book--is to be consistent in one's effort to maintain that state of mind. There are mny useful tools and exercises offered that will keep traders from unconciously falling back into unproductive habits.Everyone needs help, especially on the path to becoming an accomplished trader. This book is an essential guide to staying aware and taking action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improve your trading","review":"Dr. Kiev's book and in-person assistance has been extremely helpful to me. Knowing industry/company fundamentals will not generate consistent trading profits by themselves. They don't matter every minute of every trading day. Dr. Kiev focuses on helping a trader understand himself and his emotions and how to use the information he has to maximize profits. This book cites numerous examples of traders' identifying personal traits that have inhibited their trading success and how to surpass those issues. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve their trading efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very cute","review":"This diaper cover looked cute in the picture-but in real life it is NOT cute at all.

I try to keep it with my camera (Canon SX100) wherever I go, because it's so stable, even for my bigger (not so sexy-slim) camera.I use it camping, skateboarding, hiking, kayaking, and even for the occasional group-shot. Of course this tripod can be best utilized if you have a timer setting on your camera, otherwise I don't have much use for it.The legs extend to double the size of them shown in the picture, and are fully adjustable from anywhere in between. The only reason I have not given this product 5 stars is because of the \\"Portrait\\" function of the tripod, where my camera isn't as stable because it pulls the tripod off to the side and tips over.

This dvd is fun and a feel good workout. Leslie can always put a smile on my face, while I'm getting a great workout! She does indeed do a lot of talking and joking around in this one, so just be prepared for that. :) I love the joking in this one, that she does with the guy, Jimmy. LOL! This is one of my favorite workouts from Leslie, that I've used. Totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie's Best Workout Yet!","review":"I have tried many of Leslie's walking dvds, but I have to say that this one is by far the best. I have never worked up a sweat with any of her previous workouts. This one had me sweating and loving it. Her new studio set took me by surprise - it wasn't what I was used to -but after about 5 minutes I was so into the walking I didn't care what the set looked like. I love the intervals and the music this time was great. My favorite sections were the booster walking - which is really a jog. I did the entire workout all the way through - and had so much energy it made even my Monday morning blues disappear. This was is a KEEPER!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great routine - this is a lot of fun :-)","review":"This would definately be one of Leslies best workout dvds. I really enjoy doing it and it's totally fun yet fat burning.There are two workouts on two DVD's. The Four Fast Miles is challenging and non-stop cardio using different speeds of walking. With that is a high impact and a low impact so almost anyone can do this. If you can't manage the high impact, there is a low impact variation to try instead. It's also fun to dance to music that you are familiar with and can sing to to make the exercise session go faster. On the second dvd, you actually do some jogging which obviously is a higher impact and more challenging if you aren't at least somewhat fit.She is so encouraging and enjoyable to listen to and watch. The moves are never intimidating and this is such a good workout to do, especially when the weather doesn't 'allow' you to be outside. I love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what she used to be.","review":"This Dvd is a good workout, don't get me wrong about that.I just found her chatting a bit more distracting this time (but you can turn the voice off, so that is good). And, I also did not care for the music selection. I guess I am not an oldies type person.The people in the video seem to be cramped, and too close together, like they are going to run into eachother.I just liked her other arrangements better and her other set better.The workout itself is what I gave the four stars to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Slim 4 Fast Miles (Leslie Sansone Walk at Home)","review":"This is a great exercise video.

At first it really got me sweating and I could feel the work out. But after the second week, it's boring and way too easy.Walk, sidestep, kick, jog. That's basically it. The fact that they put a \\"Music Only\\" setting on the video tells you something about how much Leslie feels the need to talk and joke with her kids (CONSTANTLY).It's an okay video for beginners because the steps are easy to learn. But if you are more advanced and want something high impact then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent way for me to get my walking in when the weather is either too wet too hot or too cold to venture out in.

Lung diseases, 5. Injuries from accidents, 6. diabetes, 7. Flu, 8. Alzheimers, 9. Nephrosis, 10. Septicemia.Nowhere is liver disease found in the top 10, and it is also not skyrocketing. In short, false alarm. Also note that there is some research showing that coffee is very protective of the liver. So if you are concerned about liver health (for example, from alcohol), just drink 3 to 4 cups of coffee a day (unless there is some medical reason for you not to, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"Tones up the mid-section fast!

However when we both got it and popped in the DVD we both laughed through the entire DVD. She hated it. I did too. The movements were too fast and they were not cued very well. The instructor did a lot of talking and trying to act \\"HIP\\" she DID use authentic hip hop moves, I was born in that era, but the manner she delivered it was comically. I would not recommend this to a child that has hyper rhythm and then place them in front of this DVD.. it was hilarious. If your child has no rhythm or is challenged then this may be for them. Buy at your own discretion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Exercise DVD from Jennifer Galardi!","review":"After reading the many positive reviews of this DVD, I decided to purchase it. Although some of the moves are a little hard to do on carpet, it is a great workout! I got through just about all of it and look forward to using it continously as I become more fit. Being in my early 50s and overweight, it is pretty fast-paced, but I can do it!

I read many of the other reviews and was expecting a true high energy hip hop/gruvics workout with current music and moves, but for me this workout was easy, boring and dated. I would say to others reviewing this dvd, if you have taken the latest dance workouts, such as zumba and gruvics, you will find this workout disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Fun!!","review":"I really like this workout DVD. Because it is so much fun to do, the time just flies by. Plus, you are learning some cool, fun and sexy moves. I was drenched in sweat after the first time I did it. I can't wait to learn these moves really well so I can get back out on the dance floor and show these off! I tore ligaments in my left knee and broke my right ankle but I've healed enough now to work out and sweat back into shape.

Not much in the way of cardio, or at least it didn't feel like it. My hips and feet felt it more than anything else, but I did work up a sweat. It's not something I'd do day after day. But it is good to mix in with other work out dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it almost every day","review":"Great dvd. Galardi's enthusiasm is infectious. I would say the intensity level is just about right for someone who is in decent shape, but hasn't been conscientious about exercising.

I use Karen Gayle's Street Fusion for warm-up and isolations, then switch to this for the aerobic dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, and is that really hip hop?","review":"I would give this a big thumbs down. I was not entertained and the workout seemed too simplistic to me. I am not a fitness guru either, but to me, it seemed like my mom with cardiovascular problems could have done this as easy as a walk in the park.

Unfortunately, after going 2/3 of the way through I had to turn it off. It was so, so slow. The hip action in the middle is sort of fun, but the music is not motivational at all. First of all, the music is not very loud and has a generic beat that sounds like it's played on a keyboard. There was zero bass.

So, if you are coordinated then you might want to try this workout. It normally takes me a few times to get the rhythm and the steps down but this video goes really fast and I just can't seem to get it.

Boring. Boring. Boring. Ever want to do hip hip to elevator music? Then buy this DVD!I'm quite a bit overweight and rather out of shape, and somehow this DVD didn't get my heartrate up. Bringing groceries in from the car gets my heart going, yet somehow this dancing didn't.So, to sum it up: If you'd like to learn hip hop with a bunch of middleaged white women to the most boring music on the planet, buy this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip Hop Party?! HA!!","review":"I have yet to get through this entire video because I just can't get into it. Yes, I'm getting a workout, but it's far from being a \\"Hip Hop Party\\". First, the \\"music\\" they play in the background is bad beat loops. I realize they probably can't use actual hip hop songs, but could they at least work with a producer who can give them decent beats to use. Then there's the instructor with her \\"are you serious?!\\" comments - \\"put a little bit of that urban shoulder into it\\"; \\"you can throw me some face...whatever you want, cuz it's all about your ATTITUDE\\". I'm expecting \\"like, oh my gawd becky\\" to come out of her mouth any second. Lastly, the choreography is ridiculous! The \\"sexy\\" segment makes me feel anything but sexy.

Guy de Maupassant's genius shines through in this all-too-short tale of a tortured soul and his stalker vampire. It would be positively sinful to reveal any of the plot as the magic that is woven is delicate like spider silk, and holds you best when you have no idea hat is to come next. A truly chilling tale, all I can do is to implore you to experience it for yourself. To say any more would be like revealing the end of The Raven (\\"Nevermore\\") in recommending Poe.A word of caution however. This version is in French. Be sure to buy the English version if that is the language you seek. It is often known as \\"The Horla\\" and can be found in any quality anthology.I hope this helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Horla","review":"This book is written in French.

Otherwise it flows as fast and is refreshing as a cold coke from the bottle on a sultry summer afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and entertaining","review":"Max(x) Barry has a lot of fun, and even a little soapbox, in this tale of marketing and branding excess. Highly readable, albeit with an ending that could have been a little more developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite","review":"So far i've read this, jennifer gov and company and I would have to say this is one of the best books i've ever read. I'm about to start machine man and I can't wait for the movie for this to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and fun read.","review":"Syrup was an enjoyable read as long as I didn't think too deeply about the details or the plot. The same can be said about almost any movie nowadays though. It's a short read but fun. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry does it again","review":"After reading Jennifer Government and being completely and totally enthralled with the no frills look at the corporate world, I was hooked on Maxx Barry's writing. I set out to find his second title, which actually was written first, Syrup.From the moment I picked it up, I was hooked. The book is organized in a way that the story is told in a series of events that daisy chain upon one another and the plot never stops. Scat and 6 are well formed characters that exploit various facets of the personas in the book with great flair and subtle charm. Their defiance of all odds keeps you routing for their sucess even in the bleakest of situations.This book is a quick read and a whole lot of fun. You're reading the story of Scat and 6 before you're actually processing the corporate dance in which they are so entwined.I really enjoyed reading this book and can see myself reading it again in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-roaring funny","review":"I stumbled upon this book by accident and am so glad I did. SYRUP explores the world of Marketing, and specifically the pursuit of success and fame via the protagonist's idea of a great new soda.The story is written cleverly and the prose is wonderful to read--easy and funny (maybe a less intense Chuck Palahniuk). The book is broken into tight vignettes that move the story along at a marvelous pace.This is a super first novel and I can't wait to read Barry's next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical and dead-on-target","review":"Amazingly enough, Barry has managed to capture the essence of many modern-day romantic interactions while at the same time telling an amusing and captivating story. His prose style is succinct and sharp, and always entertaining. Highly recommended for a quick, few-hour read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky!","review":"This is a great read - I really couldn't put it down. Have given it to a few friends and they think the same. Sure, it's a little corny, but if I wanted serious, I'd read Jane Austen. It's fun, friendly (the writing style, not the characters in the book), entertaining and most of all a bloody good read. Cheers to Maxx!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break, people!","review":"For outsiders to the world of Marketing who think this is some kind of quick-witted expose on how things \\"really\\" happen . . . well, shucks, that couldn't be farther from the truth, people. This is Marketing doing a Marketing job on itself! Think infinite regress! I found Syrup to be a barely-readable, gimmicky, LA imitation of Jay McInerney. Gimme a break. Kudos to Barry for cashing in but I won't be running to the bookstores for his next novel (if ever there is one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bad book","review":"To me the only clever thing in this book are some of the dialogues. But the premise and plot are too unreal and shallow. The book is set in \\"real\\" environment (existing company etc.) yet the events are so superficial and removed from reality, it gets annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The marketing of soda - a love story.","review":"This book had a very similar feel to it as Jennifer Gov't - that sort of fast paced captilalism/commercialism - it keeps the story rollin'. I loved the plot. But I was never sold on Sneaky Pete as a character, he didn't have personality, and I found the romantic relationships to be unrealistic. I still liked the book overall and would read Barry again."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes me want to drink Pepsi","review":"I'm mystified as to why why friends thought this was such an awesome book. There were a few funny moments but I didn't think it was brilliant. I found the use of the occasional Australian slang word really distracting and the whole concept to be, well, stupid. And hey, I'm all for satire -- and I have a sense of humor, too. But I just didn't think this book had a lot of fizz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"This book is Max(x) Barry's first.And if you enjoyed his other novels, then this one is his first and the best one.The plot is mostly ridiculous, but that is the source of the fun. Also note that this predates Coke Blak. Someone over there in Coke's marketing or product development departments must have read this book.Good book for an airline flight or while stranded at the airport waiting for your delayed plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, faced paced & enjoyable","review":"This is the 1st Maxx Berry book that I have read, and I must say that I was impressed. The book is short and sweet - filled with subtle humor, and keen observations about marketing and human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Satire on Marketing!","review":"This is another brilliant book by Max Barry who is one of the best satirists out there regarding office and business situations. This time he pokes his wit at the Marketing Industry. The main character who calls himself Scat (because it is a cool name) claims that every individual can come up with three million dollar ideas per year. Scat has his first; coming up with a revolutionary name for a new Coke drink. He tries to pitch it to a young marketer called \\"6.\\" Immediately Scat is intrigued by 6 and falls in love with her even though she has made it clear that men are not her thing.Scat's idea is a big smash but unfortunately it is undermined by his roommate, aptly named Sneaky Pete. The book moves rapidly with Scat coming up with great idea after another hoping to be rich and land 6 to boot.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to more work by Mr. Barry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All too familiar!","review":"This book is the ideal read for anyone who's ever had an original (and seemingly brilliant) idea either stolen outright or shot down (only to have the idea magically reincarnate by the very person who shot it down.) Syrup was recommended by a work associate of mine, as both of us are of the more creative bent & working in a rather stifling corporate environment. The quickly-evolving story is a definite page-turner. I finished the book in mere hours, eager to learn the outcome. Maxx Barry's characters, while unique in his presentation of them, are highly relatable in the frustrations they experience with business & in personal relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn the rule of threes, Maxx","review":"This book is an annoying read. The rule of threes in fiction states that after the same behavior is repeated twice, the third time needs to be a payoff. But there are no payoffs here. Scat is rendered homeless at least four times, is snubbed dead by the ladylove who hates him but really loves him an equal or better number, and is betrayed in various configurations more times than I cared to count. The overall effect is a bad deja vu where the lead never learns a thing. People can be stupid and dense in real life, but Barry's protagonist really pushes the edge of how much idiocy one person can be capable of. And with me, it crossed the line. Two stars is more than generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burp","review":"'Syrup' starts off strong, but quickly loses its fizz. The characters are great, but the story is just so ridiculous and completely removed from reality, that it ruins whatever good points remain.

Did they get it wrong or what? This book is awful.Let's start with the pretentious, stupid name of the lead female character, 6. Now, ha, ha, that's funny. And, then there's her competitor, @. Gee, that's hilarious also.Interspersed throughout the book are marketing \\"rules\\" that are supposed to provide profundity. Duh.

On inspection of the packaging there is evidence that these are fakes: the cardboard packaging does not line up properly where it has been glued; the ink has rubbed off the folded edges of the cardboard; on close inspection the graphics are of quite a low resolution; there are spelling mistakes and other typographical errors; in places there are problems with the typesetting of the text so that letters partially overlap."},{"rating":"1","title":"bargaincell poor customer service","review":"In December I ordered a new bread pan and blades as I make bread every 5 to 6 days and my original ones were losing their non-stick coating.

Maybe not the worst movie I've ever seen, but right down there near the bottom. It was really downright silly. Has there ever been anything in real life close to what this is? Not that I know. The acting was just o.k. The setting was preposterous, especially when you find out that the \\"blind beast\\" did most of it himself with a little help from his obsessed mother. Of course there was a long tradition of Japanese mothers spoiling their male children. Probably why they grew up exploiting women for the rest of their lives!

If that's what you like in a movie by all means purchase this film. All of what I have mentioned sounds extremely awesome doesn't it? Heed my warning, this is one of the worst films ever created. There are only to cut away scenes in the whole entire film and seeing them used over and over again will involuntarily make you vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known","review":"Just by looking at the \\"stars\\" names I should have known that this was not going to live up to the encouraging blurb for the movie. Yes, I suppose it is a detective movie where they are tracking down a serial killer. However the detective, his partner and the serial killer are all robots. Not even cool, neat, wow special effects type robots. They are plastic, can't move other than their mouths robots. I am guessing someone had a lot of fun filming the robot scenes in their basement. The \\"kill\\" scenes were all the same. A woman (frequently topless) is shown, oblivious to her impending doom, she then sees the killer (we do not), screams, and dies. The whole thing takes usually takes about 20-30 seconds. The rest of the movie is some dreadful dialog between the detective and his partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This is the second one of these portfolios I have bought.

The book seems to focus on bringing the unfamiliar noises and experience of flying so that the child is prepared and less likely to fear the experience. Because our children happen to be fairly laid back, I thought the approach was unnecessary, and would have preferred a more \\"behind the scenes\\" view of flying: what's going on in the cockpit, the control tower, the ground crew, etc. Instead, it encourages the parent to enact the sound of flaps going down, the engine revving, etc.My kids enjoyed the book and I've had to read it hundreds of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for preparing a young traveler","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old before we went on a 5 hour flight.

Not all blacks sleep around and don't know who their baby daddy is. This movie is about men tired of women wanting child support and questioning whether or not the child is theirs. 3 different scenes with basically the same plot except for a twist on the Mexican family. Black women according to this film are nothing but whores trying to get men stuck paying child support for children that aren't theirs....blah, blah, blah. 3 children and 3 different daddies; typical black man unemployed and living off his woman and tripping when the house is burned down and he has no place to go because he doesn't want a job.

However, in the second half Selzer begins talking of general topics which do not live up to the former portion. I will admit that his commentary on abortion and being bald were interesting, and his admittance of being a perpetually carsick child opened a window to his life that awoke imagery of my own childhood, but these points do not save the worth of the final 100 pages.

The choir, on the other hand, deserves high marks for the songs it seems to have sung countless times, like \\"Battle hymn of the republic\\" or \\"The Star-spangled banner\\". But, as I have said before, the habit they have of adding orchestras and brass choirs is a distraction from the singing.

Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted in Conviction","review":"I finished this work this morning with much pleasure in the writings of this author. I have read two other sequils to this favorite novel, Pride and Prejudice and find that this one is more in keeping with the characters and the style that Miss Austin created. It was every bit as enjoyable as reading Miss Austin's book. I'm off to read two more sequel books by Skylar Hamilton Burris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a sequel with some substance!","review":"This is by far the most satisfying \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" sequel I have ever read. The new characters are thoughtfully written, and seem more three dimensional than those in other sequels. Thankfully, characters from Austen's original story stay true to their previous selves, especially the catty, grasping Caroline Bingley. Darcy, Elizabeth and the rest are mainly in the background, as this book concerns Georgiana Darcy and her path to true love. There is little tedious plodding or contrived plot twists I've noticed in other sequels, and everything the characters do and say makes good sense. There are some typographical errors and other editing goofs, but I'm willing to forgive that for a story that is more than a Darcy-Elizabeth Harlequin romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel!","review":"Ms. Burris' and Pamela Aidan's sequels to P&P are my faves! Both are absolutely awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy addition to the genre","review":"Conviction is a lively sequel focused on Georgiana Darcy and, to a lesser extent, Kitty Bennett. Darcy and Elizabeth are supporting players, Jane and Charles Bingham are present, and a few fates are tied up neatly. The character development was well done, except for the repetitive description of the curate. The only thing that drove me crazy was the lack of spell-editing. The author used \\"bare\\" for \\"bear,\\" \\"waiver\\" for \\"waver\\" and \\"gate\\" for \\"gait.\\" Picky to some, but jarring to people like me. While not the best sequel, it moves along without getting too bogged down in slavishly reproducing Darcy-speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"I was sadly disappointed in this book.

It is fairly canned and is purely to drive the story forward... (This isn't a bad thing) however the monsters remind me of watching old Godzilla movies (Not bad, just not the highest production quality by todays standards.)The relationship with the two \\"sisters\\" will capture you and completely rip your heart out too... needless to say you will enjoy this.

It's my favorite book of the entire series and Chicago Anime sent it to me in great condition. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the cover having some very small speckles on it, but that is it! The pages are well cared for and none of them are missing. I always worry about buying used manga because they seem to be more loved than regular books. Meaning they have more nicks and dings than regular books. More often than not I've gone to the library to read some of their manga and when a hugely important scene comes up the page where the important stuff is, is gone. Someone tried to be subtle about it and cut or tore out the page. It's nice to see someone giving out a manga that looks almost brand new on the inside.

This book has very little to do with the main character, Poppy, as a teenager, or about her looking for a husband. Rather, this novel follows Poppy as she grows up and lives a self-centered and un-productive life. I didn't find anything to like about her character -- she was ignorant, boastful, and lazy.

It offers a nice range of line widths for artwork and a must-have for comic art. (And be sure to get the Brush Pen, the pen that acts like a mini-paintbrush!)The peeve I have about Sakura Micron is that the tip of the .005 is a bit fragile and liable to bend, but considering how tiny it is, you sort of expect that.Overall, a good pen whose sizes and alternate colors really make them stand out, but you have to be careful with the points, especially .005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sakura Pigma Micron Pen Set","review":"These pens are great if you need to do drawing or sketching with a very fine tip.

The playtext was cherry-picked to portray Henry as a pure, virtuous, patriotic leader. However, Shakespeare's Henry was very, very different. In addition to his good qualities, Shakespeare's Henry also made political deals with the clergy, executed enemy prisoners (and his own soldiers), threatened innocent people with rape and plunder, and threw his soldiers headlong into battle for highly questionable reasons--all while neglecting urgent issues at home. (Remind you of a certain US president?) Of course, this film was deliberately made as a WWII propaganda piece, so the English king had to be portrayed in a positive light. However, this film is far from representing the Shakespeare play. The color and inventive staging are pleasant to see. Unfortunately, the extreme departure from Shakespeare's text renders this play extremely dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic , Yet Reflects It's Time","review":"When Shakespeare wrote Henry V England was threatened , the monarchy was under siege and he wrote a patriotic propagandistic play that reflected the current times. When Olivier filmed the play over 3 centuries later, England was threatened and the times again called for a patriotic rendering of what was always a patriotic play. Lord Olivier's version of Henry V , filmed during WWII, is remarkable on many levels. I found the opening where the play is actually being staged at the Globe to be a wonderfully creative approach to kicking this off before moving to more realistic live action. The acting is outstanding as would be expected and Olivier's Henry V is in total command. This for me was more enjoyable than Kevin Branaugh's more recent film version although I liked that as well. For my money Laurence Olivier did Shakespeare on film better than anyone else who has attempted. This is great viewing and the DVD transfer is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance by Laurence Olivier, great color.","review":"Didn't care for the sound quality, but since it's from the 1940's it might have been top of the line for it's day.Their presentation of the French is sophomoric but that might be a product of Shakespeare's script.As for Olivier, I wanted to marry the man by the end of the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could only find this on amazon, my husband was so surprised!","review":"My husband's been looking for this version since he saw it as a kid, and I gave it to him for our anniversary, he was super happy and surprised.

Best available.","review":"This is not only one of the finest original cast albums ever made (the first to win a gold record, selling a million copies), it is the quintessential recording of the show. Rex Harrison is superb dramatically and vocally and the 20 year old Julie Andrews matches him every step of the way. The original orchestrations are lush and romantic.

The times have changed, though, and this certainly wouldn't meet the criteria for success in the 21st century. Or even be acceptable, probably.

Julie Andrews was superb in her role as Eliza Doolittle, and should have been given the role in the movie version (nothing against Audrey Hepburn, but she was not a singer), while Rex Harrison was masterfully convincing in his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins. On CD, the album sounds great, and the characters come alive.

G.B. Shaw's \\"Pygmalion\\" couldn't find a better musical adaptation (despite the different endings: in the original Shaw, Eliza leaves Doolittle to marry Freddy). It sparkles through all the songs, and the digital remastered recording sounds terrific. Here's one of those classical works that you have to count in any decalogue of best musicals of all times, being WEST SIDE STORY, ANYTHING GOES or A CHORUS LINE some of the others. Impossible to single out the excellence of one single song because they're all outstanding. If you plan to collect great B'way classics, you may perfectly start with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It all began here...","review":"This album is the original recording of what is usually regarded as the most famous musical ever produced. It stars 20 year old Julie Andrews, who was coming out of the successful 1954 production of THE BOYFRIEND, and was just beginning her musical career. Sound quality, while in monoural, is right up there with other Columbia recordings of the period. Columbia was the best in the business, hands down, and this is no exception.

If you go manual, you will get highlights, but you have to loose the boost, which is the main part of the game. But as far as handling is concerned, it is pretty smooth and gives you almost full effect from the actual arcade. I haven't tried this system on any other game yet, so just be cautious on the compatibility of the system to the game you want to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake picture from J&R on racing wheel","review":"I Thought i was getting the wheel depicted on the site as the Thrustmaster Enzo Ferrari Dual PC/PS2 Racing Wheel. I thought the shifter was a good deal for the money. But i got a totally different wheel that sucks. no shifter like in the picture, just some crappy paddles. and let me tell you the force feedback is a lie. on pc there is no feedback what so ever, even with the lastest drivers installed. and for playstation 2 there is no feedback, its more like a rumble than feedback. i wouldnt suggest this wheel to anyone. unless you like wasting more.overall this wheel really sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy, stylish work shoes","review":"Very comfortable shoes, despite the height.

This collection seemed like a good answer. Unfortunately it's really not.The vast majority of the selections included are cheesy and, even worse, hackneyed poems from the like of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Shakespeare... all the usual suspects. Quite literally nothing that couldn't easily be found elsewhere for free.

Buikstra and Ubelaker have combined information from multiple authors to explain the procedures of analyzing human skeletal remains. The forms in the back of the book are the standard forms for skeletal inventory and analysis used in labs througout the country. This book will satisfy both a beginner, and an advanced scientist, however may be difficult for some beginners to understand without some knowledge of osteology.

That way, no one will get hurt. It looked like a good deal at first. This is a two-sided DVD containing several hours of video at a great price. Sadly, it was too good to be true. I agree with another reviewer about the shoddy tehcnical quality of this film-to-DVD transfer. The images are grainy and riddled with dust, scratches and other contaminants. Worse yet, the audio track is noticeably out of sync. (It was like viewing one of those poorly-dubbed, Japanese sci-fi flicks.) To be fair, however, I did purchase a couple of other titles (Not Lucy, unfortunately) printed by the same company and they were okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Video Transfer","review":"I was very much looking forward to this video, but the quality of the transfer is the worst I've ever seen on a commercial video or DVD. The brightness is recorded so high that only the darkest parts of the video are legible, and turning the brightness down on the TV doesn't help at all. The audio transfer rates a 2 on side 1, and a -1 on side 2 as it is out of sync with the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing with people","review":"This book is now out of print, but it is very helpful for knowing how to deal with people even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but kids got bored of it quick.","review":"I had very high hopes for this book based on the reviews I read here on Amazon. Normally when we get a new book our daughters (3 yr and 18 mos) want us to read them constantly. This is one book they never ask for. To put it bluntly, the book is boring.

Great storyline, great action, great weapons. The utilization of real-world physics puzzles gives this game an added dimension that other shooters don't have.

The physics engine is incredible, allowing the player to pick up almost anything and manipulate it.There are only two gripes I have with this game. First of all, the intro is really . . . really . . . really. . . long. It was a good twenty minutes or so before I was shooting stuff.That is a minor gripe compared to gripe #2: no multiplayer. No splitscreen no x-box live, no nuthin'. Nothing extends the life of a great game like a solid multiplayer experience (e.g. halo and halo 2).Overall, HL2 is a beautiful game with great graphics, gameplay, and intuitive control. If you've already bought HL2 for PC, there's no reason to buy it for x-box. But if you haven't, and you're a fan of FPS's, then I think you'll be very please with this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"HL2 Review","review":"This game rocks!! i've heard many people say thatHalf Life 2for xbox isnt as good as the pc version but i absolutely love this game. the graphics are amazing and gameplay is WOW! 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Christ","review":"This game is still vastly superior to any xbox 360, and as for people who dont own an xbox.

She maintains that by inundating news organizations with position papers, self-serving statistics, and talking heads, their operatives have insidiously shifted national debate rightward. Through four exhaustively documented case studies, she revisits the political right's plans to delegitimize both the American Association of Retired Persons and Head Start, \\"save\\" (read: cut) Medicare, and \\"modernize\\" (read: water down) the powers of the FDA. Scary and compelling, Lieberman's screed gives the lie to the notion of the \\"liberal media\\" even as it will be read by some as a product of that same mythic beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more opinion","review":"How the media distorts and misconstrues information is truly phenomenal...but is it really some vast \\"right-wing\\" conspiracy as Lieberman suggests, or is it fear on both political sides? Each political side seems determined to make the other look unjust, bigoted, and dishonest (politicians come and go but politics never change). As long as people like Lieberman blame and shame one side we get nowhere--it has yet to work in the Middle East. The media, in many ways seems more on the side of anarchy and sensationalism. I'm sure this author is a sincere idealist who feels that if people could just think the way she did the world would be a better place...or at least a \\"safer\\" one.

All is well, if uneasy, until a big storm hits the valley, destroying the tree and causing one of the jays' babies to go missing. Once again, Andy Runton has done a fantastic job of conveying a world of feeling in very simple drawings; Owly is a great series for all ages and, as Runton says on his website, for people who think they don't like comics. If you haven't discovered Owly yet, it's definitely worth searching out. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Don't Like \\"Owly\\", You Might Not Have a Soul","review":"My initial reaction to the first \\"Owly\\" volume was no fluke: this second volume demonstrates Runton's unique talent for telling GOOD all-ages stories.

He recently bought a new Jeep Wrangler and it's hard for me to get in and out of. The grab handles really help me out. The only fault I see with this product is this........in the product ad it does not tell you if you are getting one grab bar per order or two. I wanted to have one for each side of his Jeep, so I ordered two. When the order arrived, I had two sets of two instead of just two like I had thought I had ordered. So, lesson learned. If you need only TWO grab handles, then place your order for ONE of these items and you will get two. If you need FOUR, then order two and you will get two sets of two. Hope this helps others that are thinking of ordering this item. The item itself is great, but now I have two extra handles.

He sets up best practice maxims which are pretty much indisputable and there's a great script at the end for one-on-one web-testing.Easy on technical mumbo-jumbo, big on strategy for making your site accessible and easy to navigate - if the user has to try and guess navigational options, Steve would say you're not doing very well as a designer.Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Recommended as an intro to Usability Principles","review":"This is a great book. I assign it as a college level text for a Web Interface Design Class.My students actually enjoy reading this book, and derive an understanding of important usability principles from it. It presents this fascinating information in a very engaging style.I think this would be good for anyone who is associated with designing web pages. The principles are sound, and important.There are many web sites which have design/usability problems. If only they could read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, a usability book that actually practices usability!","review":"I soldiered through Jacob Neilson's book and felt like I'been been through a four or five note symphony when I was finally finished. Steve Krug has figured out that tirelessly repeating yourself over and over isn't an effective way of teaching. Don't Make Me Think, get's the mission critical points with enough grace and humor to make the book--get this--actually effective. I've read several usability books before this one, so I can't say I learned much new, but would have to say that this book presented in a way that I believe I will be more likely to remember the information and use it. I only wish I hadn't wasted time and money on the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those with experience","review":"While this book might be good for web design newbies, it's definitely not for those with any experience.

It is a book that makes you say \\"I guess an author is born every minute!\\" There were so many things written in the book that a person with half a brain cell would say, no s#&t sherlock. The only reason why I finished reading the book is because 1. I wanted to write an unbiased review on amazon and 2. I had some time alone in sitting on the can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Website developers","review":"Creating an effective Web site is easy with this book. Krug takes you step by step through the process and helps you avoid all the dumb decisions that make so many Web sites annoying and difficult to navigate. His breezy, friendly style makes this book easy to read, even for graphic designers. (Sorry, I didn't mean that.)Seriously, everyone who designs Web sites needs to read this book.

Though it's several years old, the content is still highly relevant.With loads of examples (including our beloved Amazon - see \\"If you love Amazon so much, why don't you marry it\\") of what works and what doesn't work and techniques for usability testing, right down to sample testing scripts, this book provides cost effective ways to ensure your website designs are user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book who has a place next to my computer","review":"This book is a must.

I have always had the \\"Don't make me think\\" frustration underlying many website (and software for that matter) experiences and frequently my website feedback and reviews would reflect this sentiment.This book will prove itself to you because Steve causes you to draw on your own experiences as a web user to understand what your users want from your site."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very few gems in this category.","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone responsible for creating, maintaining or managing web content - from a corporate Intranet to a commercial Internet site to a personal home page.

It is short and goes direct to the point. The author point out what worth to worry about focusing on what work, instead of the millions of ways it wouldn't work. He doesn't take out your freedom, giving you principles instead of recipes. The book is well structured and very practical to use. It stays with the basics. If your work is usability you'll need other sources, but \\"Don't make me think\\" is a great kick off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good browsing book","review":"I'm an amateur web designer/info architect and this book was a pleasure to read. It's not as meaty as other tech-y books out there but it's an excellent place to start. That is, it doesn't have very detailed descriptions of usability practices or methodology. However, it still gives excellent descriptions on things like usability testing (including a pretty good \\"script\\" for guidance and illustration). So it's not really for the \\"converted\\" who already understand the importance of web usability and encorporating this mindset in design (although the book is still a good investment!).And it's definately THE book to give to a non-technical manager/boss/supervisor who just can't understand the extreme importance of usability and what it means to the design process.

I'm sorry to report that this book was disappointing. It took me only a few hours to breeze through and I came away with very little that was new to me and with the perception that this book was light on substance. Perhaps this is because I have been in this field for so long. However, I just finished reading Jeff Johnson's \\"GUI Bloopers\\" and, even after designing GUIs for so many years, I learned so much from Jeff's book. If you are new to this field, Krug's book will help but make sure to read \\"Designing Web Usability\\" by Nielsen, \\"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web\\" by Rosenfeld and Morville, \\"Designing Large Scale Web Sites\\" by Sano, and \\"Web Navigation\\" by Jennifer Fleming. I also recommend Johnson's book on GUI design.

Steve Krug makes an excellent job explaining how users perceive information on the net. Even more surprising is the fact the he does not offer a universal solution to solving usability problems. He just explains how to observe visitor's behaviour and what to make of this observation.

This was my first web design or usability book to read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I particularly found chapter 6 very informative. I teach computers to grades 1 thru 8 and I really put the info about the parts of a webpage to look for to good use when designing a lesson plan for webpage navigation. This book is very understandable. Also, the chapters on usability testing can be very helpful to any corporate web design teams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense may mean \\"what you already know.\\"","review":"I found this book way too basic, and I'm not a web designer by any stretch of the imagination. I think most of the principles found within can be understood simply through the process of using the web over a few years. For example, here's some breaking news from Krug's book: \\"_tabs_ are a good idea!\\" Gee, could that possibly be why every other major site uses them? Guess what else? _Amazon.com_ has a successful user interface!Don't buy this book. There is very little groundbreaking information here. Useit.com and the Yale web design guide, along with the O'Reilly book on information architecture, are far more useful for ideas on usability. I think this book stands as an interesting relic of the years 1998-2000, during which there were simply far too many people designing e-commerce sites, and so inevitably creating too many bad sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilly","review":"I really enjoy this latest entry in the Winter Chill series from Hed Kandi. Very nice chill album, very lowkey. It is heavy on the female vocals, but I find them to be very ethereal and calming, and for me it's a nice experience when I pop in the CD. Hed Kandi is good because they choose different artists and songs that aren't on other compilations, and they've chosen some excellent ones for this disc.Highlights on disc one include Slovo's \\"Killing Me\\" which is probably my favorite. Mooi \\"Sway\\", Kaskade \\"Let You Go\\", Goldfrapp's \\"Forever\\" and Hubtone feat Zoe Johnston's \\"Red Balloon\\" are all highlights on the first disc. Disc two highlights include Headway's \\"Remind Me To Miss You\\", Lamb's \\"Hearts and Flowers\\", Therese's \\"Why\\", Kate Rogers' \\"This Collective\\" and Husky Rescue's \\"New Light of Tomorrow\\".All the songs are wonderful and the perfect soundtrack for a nice quiet evening at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good thought","review":"Very good use of Bible mixed with amazing stories about answers to prayers cried out.

The book relates an around the world cruise taken in the early 1930s when cruising was available to only a few travelers. Historically, prior to the commencement of World War II, its observations and comments are fascinating. From a traveler's perspective its descriptions of famous sites and locations is a temptation to do likewise. Having found this book in the collection of a Great Aunt retired school teacher in the early 1950s, it is today a treasured part of my own collection. \\"How Shall I Know Unless I Go\\" is a sentiment expressed by the author which appropriately describes all of us who simply want to go to any of those places where we have not been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy flash cards","review":"This is a very poor way to learn vocabulary.

The handle is only 9.5\\" long, fulcrum to tip, instead of the original's much longer handle. The handle length makes a huge difference in the leverage, which makes a huge difference in how easy it is to crack a nut. The overall construction is lighter weight.

Second the adjustment barrel sticks making adjustments for different sized nuts very difficult. Third about have the nuts are totally crushed because of the force it takes to crack the nut. Once it cracks there is no control. A longer handle may help, but not sure the rest of the cracker could stand the stress. It is poorly constructed, a lot of loose play in the handle, piston, and adjustment screw. If you are cracking something like walnuts or pecans, which are easier to crack, it might work.

I sent three messages, asking for a shipping label to return this item and get a refund.Each time you use a different size pecan, the mechanism has to be adjusted. Not once, after trying over and over, did I get a clean cracked pecan .The fact that I was ignored and told the complaint was resolved, tells me I was totally being ignored. So I am out $$ for something I cannot and will not use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as pictured","review":"I just received this item and it is not as pictured here. The pic shows 2 screws on one side holding the mechanism to the base (I assume there are 2 on the other), what I received has only one on each side. Item pictured shows all metal parts chomed, item delivered has lower metal parts coated, not chromed. Construction is flimsy, most parts are not machined but cast or stamped, rivets holding the pivot points together are loose and sloppy. This item may be fine for cracking a few soft-shelled nuts, but in my opinion will not hold up to anything harder than the thinnest shelled pecan. I will be returning this item.To the sellers credit, shipping was amazingly quick, but I'm still out the $6.50 they charged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised!","review":"Great price and it works well for our English Walnuts.

Jennifer was a little crazy, true, but she was a great girl.Goodness, this is getting maudlin.The book is well-written, with a good command of using descriptive language to say things in ways you wouldn't expect, and the important little details are all covered and all accurate.

She was 6 lbs at birth but completely healthy. I purchased this item in hopes to get some relief for my sore nipples. The product is bigger than a bottle nipple. It's to wide and sticks out to far. It gagged her so she would not use it. I'm sure it probably works for some people but I had a Medela Nipple shield with my first child that covered all of the areola and was a better fit. This one is bulky. I may have ordered the wrong size so I would say contact a lactation consultant or your hospital's doula for help. The one I used that worked (4 years ago) was given to me in the hospital. I had to order this one online since we are military and stationed overseas. I did like that the baby gets more skin to skin contact with this item...so if your child isn't a petite little one...they may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nipple Shield Out of 7 I have tried","review":"This is my favorite nipple shield I have. I bought one from the hospital and then ordered 6 more types. I love this one due to it doesn't flip back and cover my sons nose.

Plus it still stays in place so I dont have to hold it while my son eats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I recommend using these for short term use only. They are not recommended long-term, because it can affect your milk supply, and/or the transfer of milk from you to your baby, causing slow weight gain. However, there are some women who can use one for the entire breastfeeding relationship and never have a problem.I had sore/cracked/blistered and bleeding nipples from a bad latch. Breastfeeding was extremely painful. The very first time I used this shield, I felt no pain at all. It was instantly gone. The shield quickly filled up with milk and my baby had the swallowing sounds. I had to hold it into place a lot of the times, and had to wash it everytime I was done with it, but well worth it. If you are about to give up on breastfeeding because of problems with the latch, this can save your breastfeeding relationship. Try this before you quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of six breastfed babies . . .","review":"I purchased one of these shortly after my sixth child was brought home. After having suffered with Mastitis several times with my last two babies, I was desparate to not have to go through it again! The shield is a lifesaver. My daughter had no problems latching on the very FIRST time and has been happily nursing since! My breasts healed in three days and I am planning on using the shield until she is at least twelve weeks old to make sure her mouth is big enough to latch on correctly! I would recommend buying TWO because they are very easy to lose. I keep mine washed and dried in a tupperware cup and keep it with me to store after I nurse. It is very simple and easy to use. I will recommend this to anyone who is suffering from sore nipples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-saver product!","review":"My lactation consultant suggests me against this product as she thinks I can never rely on its assistantship for ever. I took her adivce and started breastfeeding right after the emergency C-section,when I had only limited colostrum supply.Disappointedly,I got terrible nipple soreness from both baby's biting and nipple engorgement.I then swtiched to pumping but it still hurt. This prodcut came as my last straw.Fortunatly,IT WORKS!!Thought sometimes the shield did not stay right in place, it provided the best protection.Even when my baby occasionally bit my breast, there was no hurt anymore. My baby seemed to enjoy going back to skin-to-skin contact as my breastfeeding interrupted for a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work.","review":"I bought this at the recommendation of a nursing consultant because my baby wouldn't latch on properly. I knew I was wasting my money when I purchased it, but decided to go for it since it didn't cost much. This product is what it is - just a little piece of plastic. It didn't work any miracles for us with breastfeeding, and it didn't help my baby latch on at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son thought it was a joke","review":"i bought the medela nipple guard to protect a torn nipple from a nursing 12 month old with big teeth. while i am not doubting it's effectiveness for newborns and moms of, my one year old looked at the gaurd and then at me and just laughed. he now walks around with it, chewing on it. if your considering this product for anything more than mild irritation it is very thin and therefor offers little resistance to the powerful jaws of a suckling bundle of energy. i still gave the product four stars because i am sure it would have worked had i been using it when my son was under 3 months and a little less wise on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"So helpful!","review":"I have short nipples, and using the shield was an excellent way to train my little girl to latch on and pull my nipple out.

I highly recommend for those having difficulties with latch on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"My daughter didn't take to these at all. She got frustrated quickly.

He would get frustrated and would not feed so we had to use a bottle, and pump. After we got this we went home and followed the instructions. All that consisted of was to clean the shield and run it in warm water for a few seconds and put it on the nipple after that start to breast feed. it is that easy it solved the issue and took 2 seconds to latch on and feed for the first time like he should for a hour and a half.

Paxton has managed, with this book, to turn one of the most dynamic and exciting periods of European history into a turgid, unreadable mess. At every turn, events are fully detailed, but robbed of even the slightest spark of life, as flat and uninteresting as a dessicated leaf.Though EUROPE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY could be used as reference work, with the scholar dipping in to grab facts as needed, Paxton's work is an utter failure as a cover-to-cover read, thanks to his seeming inability to write in a compelling fashion.

It is very strange and mixes (intentionally) poorly written pornography with rambling discussions of avant-garde literature, descriptions of the Scottish countryside, and ventriloquist's dummy who can think. There is sex and books and then more sex and more books. The plot is hilarious: a book within the book by a man who drags Princess Diana's corpse to ancient stone circles, a pair who drag a weighted ventriloquist's dummy to said circles to test the validity of said book.I write this positive review knowing that almost every reader will dislike this book. I eagerly await the day I meet someone else who loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious literary reviews disguised as porn","review":"If it hadn't been a book for my English class, I never would have touched it. The very cover is repulsive, the sex scenes are grotesque, mechanical, explicit, and detached, and anything that isn't a sex scene (which is about 98% of the book) is high-brow literary criticism of books no one really cares about.

For instance, if you read through the Editorial Review on this page, you can see there's potential in the story, but reading the actual book is just a waste of time.

I imagine this book being dreamed up by a yoga teacher thinking, \\"Hmmm... How can I make a name for myself in this yoga game and maybe squeeze out a couple bucks while I'm at it?\\" Perhaps I give too much credit to the author. Though the book contains some cute bits that doggie lovers will surely enjoy, \\"Doga\\" adds nothing to either the great bodies of yoga or pet literature. In fact, it may even detract from both.

Even though you might expect a less vocal album, i guarantee your satisfaction.4 traxx on this album are rated 5stars on my media player, but the track i just can't stop listening to is 49%.

I am pretty picky when it comes to romance novels, don't like sappy predictable fluff. This book is a definate keeper. I've read it over about 3 or 4 times.

There were too many pages of - yes you will, no I won't, not ever! drama. Liam was a passionate pirate, he came on strong but tried ever so hard to prove he was not like his father. I was not convinced. Katherine was a spoiled child without any redeeming qualities.I know I can't expect characters to be other than true to their times, so in that respect they may be exactly perfect. However, quality characters transcend the times they live in. Beauty and gorgeous bodies without a head or a heart aren't enough.I did not like the characters, did not care if they ended up together.

How many times does it take to \\"almost\\" have sex? That got aggrivating by the second half of the book.Another thing I didn't like was Liam's obsession with Katherine. He seemed a little off-his-rocker in some parts. In this day and age, he would be called a stalker. But then again, he was gorgeous and she really does want him.Finally, I thought the author took too many liberties with Queen Elizabeth's character.That said, this was a very good book with plenty of sexual tension, a hunky hero, a strong-willed heroine that knows what she wants and goes for it even if it doesn't include the hero, and an original plot.

I found her spoiled and too fast to take the easy way out of every situation. She was pathetic; I like heroines 'strong' in their love of their man, that know their own mind and second best is just not an option. I don't think she ever really knew what she wanted.

The soles are supportive, but felt kinda stiff at first and took a few days to get used to. They have pretty good sized lugs on the sole for grip in the dirt, but watch out if you step on a wet rock or pavement. Whatever the soles are made of doesn't provide much traction on wet surfaces.

The mitre is the pointed hat worn by prelates that resembles the hat worn by the pater in the Cult of Mithra, and is totally different than a tiara.It is clear the author wrote this book hurriedly for quick profit.

The juxtaposing of texts from the Bible and from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the comparison of similarities between the story of Osiris and the story of Jesus, the observations of cosmology, physical symbolism, and tradition, are all revealed in startling and unexpected ways that will give serious students of both Egyptian and Christian metaphysics a great deal of food for thought and reflection.

As I tried to get the flash to work, I read in the instructions that it requires a full battery, and the flash won't work without a \\"full\\" battery. They mean it. I was able to get the flash to work for one picture (after warming up for 2-3 minutes), then the battery power went to half and it wouldn't work anymore. One picture - that's all it takes to burn half of the battery power in this camera.The only selling point of the camera is the appearance, which didn't even fool my 4-year old with the pitiful performance.

I am convinced that Dr. Kelly did not have anything close to the mathematical ability to read Einstein's original paper, which contains very difficult formulas.Instead, Dr. Kelly tried to get the gist of Einstein's ideas by reading the comments between the formulas. He siezed on one comment that seemed to equate rotating frames with inertial frames. In the book, Dr. Kelly's central argument is against this equivalence.But Einstein did not equate these frames at all - Dr. Kelly simply misinterpreted a comment in the dense, poorly annotated Relativity theory. And yet, when he encountered books that spelt out Relativity in plain terms, he insisted they were the ones misreading Einstein.Dr. Kelly's own 'theories' are mathematically facile and quickly lead to self-contradictions. There is a scientific mistake in the first paragraph of the first chapter.

The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky.

The affectless narrative, with no hint of emotion, neither pain or feeling, gives no clue as to how Morvern feels about her boyfriend's suicide. Her subsequent actions suspend any moral judgement or moral sense--seemingly. But what we have, in my opinion, is a blank slate for morality. It goes on like this throughout the entire novel. Only the ending gives some sort of a resolution: she is still hopeful, despite all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you should just see the movie","review":"The following is a synopsis of one of the scenes in _Morvern Callar_. It doesn't involve major characters and it doesn't reveal a plot point, but it does give something of the book's tone.It's Hogmanay. The narrator and her social circle have gathered in a local hotel. Midnight passes, then closing time, so the police come to make them leave. One man buys several whiskies and wants to take them with him but the police won't let him, so he pours the whiskies down the throat of his fish, takes the fish outside, and drinks the whiskies out of the fish's mouth.If that baffled you, you should probably skip the book entirely. In short, it's so Scottish it probably won't travel well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absence glowing among the unbearable presences","review":"Him is someone we have all killed, maybe with less whit and coolness. What an odd start and what a distance from her actions. Morvern is almost placed among all the dull surroundings, faced with a life that she cannot cope with. A brilliant study on relationships and the way you can just ignore them when they become imposed, and how humans respond mechanically to the most important things, on death, just a step away, a snap pf the goldish lighter on a Silk Cut. It reminded me of Camus' starting line : Aujourd' hui, maman est morte."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lame attempt","review":"It's a weak attempt at writing something that would be a mix between Albert Camus' \\"Outsider\\" and Irvine welsh's \\"Trainspotting\\". I kept on reading hoping that it might get better but it didn't. There is no storyline, there are just clipped futile descriptions of nature and party scenes... The lack of proper dialogue makes this even more distant. I was left with no feelings of sympathy towards the protagonist whatsoever. I completely agree with the other reviewer who said: 'A bloke can't do a woman', it's just lame. And amazon.com should be careful about tossing recommendations based on earlier readings and ratings. This is nothing compared to Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about language, music, escape, and life being handed on","review":"It seems that readers (see above reviews) saw the depressing table setting here and looked no further. Actually, the book is exhilarating. Morvern's tongue is a potent cocktail of Scots, slang, and autodidactic poetry, and it's more erotic in and of itself than anything since the motels sequence of Lolita. Her character, far from blank or emotionless, is wanton, savage, but with great depths of wisdom--she's a changeling, and her story is almost mythic, beginning with its premise. This book has a pulse you can nearly dance to, but, like some great undiscovered piece of trance dub, it has symphonic undercurrents, with a strange and terrible beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gospel is important, but let's not get carried away. .","review":"This book, in my opinion, was written from the perspective of a fan. There are numerous books written on music by music scholars (e.g., Early Jazz by Gunther Schuller) which I prefer to this type of writing because the authors ideas are backed up by examples that include musical knowledge and music history knowledge. Heilbut make many statements about the importance of Gospel music as an influence on US pop music that are untrue and not backed up with any facts or examples. I did enjoy the stories about some the key architects of the gospel sound, but the \\"religious fanatical\\" perspective of the author turned me off. I know enough about music and US music history to know when the author was getting emotional about a music that touched him personally. This is a problem if the reader is not educated in music and US music history, they may take the many fantastic claims that Heilbut makes about Gospel music as truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"French Designers","review":"I felt that this book was a nice collection of work by French designers.

It seems as if the over the years heavily used mixed master tapes have been used for remastring instead of going back to the original elements.

Sure that the narrative would gel, I read on and on, but ultimately tossed the book into the wastecan with a sense of defeat.

A book this stylistically inclined should have a grand theme to sustain, to sweep the reader along, to enable him or her to lie back with languid passion and husk, \\"Take me...I'm yours...\\" McGowan's tome got a cranky \\"Oh, all right!\\" out of me, at best. I think it's a book from a young lady with a lot of potential, plus perhaps a lot of personal problems she needs to work out. I'm looking forward, though hardly holding my breath, to her next.

The stream of consciousness narrative draws you in so expertly that I felt nostalgic for a world I'd never inhabited. I'm British but to see the UK through American eyes was incredibly interesting - stuffy, old-fashioned bunch that we are - but to also see it through the eyes of a stroppy teenager and want to be there is an amazing skill on the part of Heather McGowanAll I can suggest to the negative reviewers below is to suggest that you try again, unless you want your literature on a plate.Astonishing piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHEETS EVER MADE","review":"These sheets are strictly for apprearances.

The drawings and cartoons provide a bit of humor to the text and the writing is cloear and focused. The only drawback to the book is that the layperson does not get the full effect of the book without a very good grasp of biochemistry (hence the term layperson!). To get the real scope of the book, one would need to read a good Biochem text ( I personally suggest Lehninger, et. al. Principles of Biochemistry, 3rd ed.). A good pharmacological text would greatly enhance the reader's understanding of the subject as well (i.e. Goodman and Gilman's). Otherwise, the book does give a very brief, very good overview of many aspects of Medicinal Chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best picture is the one on the cover!.","review":"The author states that this book is aimed at undergraduates who have a basic grounding in chemistry and are interested in a future career in the pharmaceutical industry.Chemistry background includes now elements of quantum chemistry and molecular orbital theory.

I ended up going to the library and checking out \\"You & Your Baby Pregnancy\\" by Dr. Laura Riley. This book has been the best I've seen yet.

Kitzinger can't seem to help editorializing about the supposed past degradation of women in childbirth, all at the hands of men. The commentary was both insulting and irrelevant.

I would say that many women do not know that there are many options you have to choose from during your pregancy and labor.

For anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition. Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long effects. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not for me","review":"This book was definatley not for me. My OB office recommended it as their top pick of pregnancy books. I found it to be out dated and boring. I haven't even picked it up since I completed the first few chapters. I felt that it was to focused on the technical side of child birth and pregnancy rather than putting into lamens terms what is happening to your body.

If so, I'd like to hear how it's accomplished. What makes it doubly laughable is that Adorama and Opteka themselves attest to the viability of this, and get this; \\"OPTIMAL FOCAL LENGTH FOR THIS PRODUCT TO USE, IS 70MM!\\" What a hoot! My Canon 100mm Macro focuses down to 12\\", both parties mentioned, advised me to use my 70-200mm, which minimum focus distance is 3.5'. Unless the Opteka HD slide copier had optics of its own, (it does not) how exactly, would that be possible? Rhetorical question, it can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this copier is not useful for negatives","review":"I bought the Opteka HD2 slide copier for the Canon EOS and then spend a few hours trying to learn how to use it. I copied a couple of slides with moderate success, using the unit attached to my 28-80 Canon lens. It was difficult to get the slide in focus and to get it lined up to shoot the image, but it was possible. What is not possible is to use it for copying negatives. Most independent editing programs (iPhoto, Photoshop Elements) do not have the necessary software to invert color negatives to positives. They can do black and white, but not color. So the Opteka, which has no software with it, just can't be used to invert color negatives. I had to send it back and buy a much more expensive slide and negative copier, the Nikon Coolscan V. I'm still waiting for delivery of the new machine, but I have high hopes, based on reviews by others."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Quality wise unit was o.k.

Not efficiently or quickly. My slides are difficult to load as they are \\"thick\\". The pictures are not necessarily photo quality photos. If what you are looking for is an archival form of viewable images, then this will work. I'm sure a professional would have far better results that I am getting. I don't care if the photos are not centered, don't care that you can't adjust to fill the entire photo frames and have pics that need cropping.If you are looking for professional pictures from slides, don't bother. Although, some of the ones I had done don't look any better than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Very disapointed.No way to use negative strips.Image is croped significantly and a lot of definition is lost there. a better choice of the lens would minimize thisThe slide magazine is too tight making very difficult to introduce and remove ordinary paper frame slide and impossible to use plastic frames."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step down","review":"Bought this based on read reviews. Does not live up to it. Photos are highly vignetted and the position of the slide holder is offset from center (when zooming in to get better frame filling you lose the bottom of the pictureThis is used with a Canon 50d with a 24-105 f4L lens.I used the Opteka to scan two trips from Jamaica and Breckenridge (shot in raw for maximum ability to adjust) and then compared them to a Plustec 7500i scanner in Lightroom 3.4.PlusesThe scans took a fraction of the time- one role - 10 minutes vs 2 hours.Color saturation and post processing.NegativesHigh vignettingmisalignmentsome distortion caused by the Opteka lens, (high aberration)no ability to clean up artifacts (Plustec with Silverfast use a uv scan to remove)More after scan processing.ConclusionIf you do want a cheap way of scanning old slides and just want to make some 4 x 6's then go ahead and buy. But if you want higher quality scans, stick with a dedicated scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slide copier or door stop?","review":"I recently purchased this Opteka HD Slide Copier for Canon EOS Digital SLR Cameras. I bought it to copy the hundreds of 35mm slides I have. Unfortunately, this copier has a square opening in its slide holder, and the rectangular image of a 35mm slide is partially covered on the ends (or top and bottom). It cannot be used to properly copy a single one of my slides. An email to Opteka seeking a solution to this problem has gone unanswered.If you are looking for a doorstop, you can do better.If you are looking for a slide copier, you can't do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"I've used this copier to copy over 700 slides and I'm reasonably pleased with the results.pros: inexpensive and does a pretty good job of copying, resolution could be better but then you're talking a more expensive scanner and much more time copying.cons: insertion of the slides can be tricky (actually it drove me a little nutty, but I lack patience), f/11 is supposed to work best but my camera does not always allow it so I switch to a different setting, you MUST straighten each slide (just get it reasonably straight using the duplicator then adjust in your software)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I can slide about 12 slides per hour. Well, I have about 1000 I would like to re-scan. But I don't have the time. So I thought I could attach this to my macro lens (EF 100 f2.8/L) and my body (5D mk II) and greatly increase the speed, plus get RAW files (which CS5 and Bridge make so easy to edit).I was wrong, the ten slides I tried all came out looking like total rubbish. The dust was very visable, the grain looked worse than noise, and the sharpness was like looking through water.If you want a 2MP quick answer to scanning, I guess this is OK, but for a modern hi-res DSLR, this is total junk. I guess the only pro, the AF focused fast and good, and you can shoot pretty much at f/2.8, f/11, or f/22 and there is not much difference (except for exposure time). Well, at least I only spent about $30!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!","review":"After you factor in gas & mileage, it's a better deal than buying them from the local Sam's Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Outs with Substance!","review":"10-Minute Time Outs for Busy Women isn't your normal run-of-the-mill fluffy devotional.

Using God's Word and sharing relevant examples from women from all walks of life, I found I could relate to her stories.Grace offered practical ways to put truths into practice. I particularly liked how I was invited to focus on God's character, and to pray for myself and another busy woman in my life. Grace used touches of humour and added beautiful hymns and poems to some meditations. Her writing is engaging, inspirational and refreshing.This book is for all women (as we are all busy) whether you work at home or outside the home. Any woman who needs to take a 10-minute break out of her day to help focus on what matters most can benefit from this book. It would make a wonderful gift to a special woman in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is wonderfull !","review":"Everybody that is interested in historical geology and paleontology must have this book.
