If you get this fantastic book, be prepared to be glued to each and every page. I found myself crying while reading some of this. It vividly describes the roller-coaster ride of deep emotions and tribulations that some people go through involving someone with critical health issues. It also poignantly reveals how people struggle with psychological turmoil in ways much like with physical maladies.This book, like many of Joy Fielding's books, is expertly written! It is a must read! All of Joy's books are very diffenent in so many multitudinous ways!

There is a lack of moral foundation for the whole story.First, the book focuses on a faithless husband; then it moves on to a child who has her first experience of sex in her own home when her parents are gone. Finally, in a poorly contrived subplot, the \\"heroine\\" convinces her mother to kill her when \\"it's time.\\"The book is written to sell. And it has! So I assume that the author achieved her goals.It is basically a shallow and romanticized portray of euthanasia. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First Time for me!

Though it helped to pass the time on a trip, the story wasn't very plausible, the characters were generally not very likable or smart and, in the end, I wasn't really rooting for anyone except the fact that I was finally finished. This is in no way harsh criticism of the author; the writing was more than adequate, it was the story I wasn't too fond of. I think this just isn't my genre. My mom is way into the movies shown on the \\"Lifetime\\" network; with a cheating husband, dying wife and bratty, rebelious teenage daughter this story seems tailor-made for the \\"channel for women\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Wonderful! Terrific! Emotional!","review":"This is one of those books that made me feel like I knew these people and that I could actually experience the emotions stirred up by this story. This story gave me a better understanding of ALS/ Lou Gerhig's Disease. A very good book, easy to read and finish because it's so interesting right from the beginning, and the people are so \\"real\\". There's a teenage daughter that has to watch her mother go through her terminal illness, and the author made her so real to life. Excellent book......Pick this one up and read it, you'll most definitely enjoy it and learn from it. There was so much more to this story than an illness though. An almost exhusband who finally opened his heart to love. That part of this book is so touching. Another thing this book did is make me realize how a person's past can form the future if allowed. This is such a great story about much more than a terminally ill wife/mother/daughter. She's got spunk, hope, and faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read in Years","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago, but I loved it so much, I always recommend it to everyone.

Sure, if you want to get super analytical you can find many faults with the characters, the plot, etc. But I put all that aside and I just let myself into the story - and my definition of a good story is one in which I never notice the fact that the writer mentions \\"Evian\\" water. I cried like a baby at the end and that felt really good. Don't go into this book thinking it is a Pulitzer Prizer winner - it's not. But it is a damn good read of a heartfelt and well-told story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book - Just Be Ready to Cry","review":"I got into this book not realizing that it would contain one of those rare stories where it's almost too hard to read because of the emotions it evokes. I almost stopped reading it because it was actually depressing me but knew I couldn't put it down without finishing it. I'm glad to say I did finish the book, had a good cry and felt that I was actually a better person for reading this story of how a family deals with devastating news. It certainly made me realize that I, like so many others, trivialize my many blessings while overlooking the fact that millions of people deal with heartbreaking news of a terminal illness every day. The author is so good at creating real characters and situations, the story hooks you in from the beginning and never lets you go. Just be ready to shed a few tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I started this book and was unable to put it down. This book will have you hooked from the being.

The subject of Alzheimers is one that seems to be popping up in every third story recently, but Lonergan tackles it with honesty and care and avoids the all too cliche portrayal one might see in a play like 'Surviving Grace.'

The musicians were fine, its the SINGERS that ruin it. For example \\"Think of Me\\" sung by Lesley Garrett doesn't even SOUND like the song! The end where she goes up the scale is suppossed to be POWERFUL, and OPERATIC, NOT lazily swooning!Have these performers ever actually PERFORMED this music? I am aghast that I wasted 20 dollars on this CD...and KICKING myself for it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value","review":"Basically two disks for the same price as a lot of the other one disk Andrew Lloyd Webber collections.

Atwood's metaphors and imagery make this book so much more exciting than just that synopsis. Her main character reverts back to nature as her mind tries to deal with psychological onslaughts from many different factors in her world. The text is challenging, but it is just experimental enough to keep the reader engaged. You'll definately need to reread this one to capture all its subtleties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary Dreck","review":"I'll never forget how much I hated this book, a miserable read that stands as a yardstick to measure everything I hate in fiction. Because my first Atwood novel was the masterful \\"A Handmaid's Tale\\", I eagerly sought out a replay of that unforgettable book by reading her first really acclaimed work. Reading this thin volume felt like a lifetime's penance for every novel I have ever enjoyed. Some self-conscious, dated, impressionistic, terribly indulgent rumination on the injustice of life for the modern woman, by finishing it I learned a valuable lesson, namely what it is that I hate in a novel.

Atwood has an uncanny ability to make normal things have a very macabre meaning. Surfacing is probably the book where she best uses her gift of extended metaphor. Her writing style in this book is even more free-flowing than is typical for Atwood. While Surfacing is one of Atwood's shorter novels, this story of a young woman realizing and dealing with her mental paralysis, is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylistic work of art, but a bit misanthropic","review":"I am not satisfied with this book. I find it too narrow-minded and cynical. At some parts it even supports hatred, eg (speaking about people in general) 'I wanted ...a machine... that would evaporate them...that way there would be more room for the animals.' (end of 18th Ch). Though this may be just a phase in protagonist's development I just couldn't empathize with her. Otherwise I liked her style of writing and I got quite involved with the protagonist in some passges. But, I disapprove of exaggerations in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this be the same author as 'Amazing Grace'?","review":"I found this book very disappointing, and actually, outright disgusting. Past and present are all jumbled together with awful character development, throughout. Normally, if I don't care for a book, I give it away. This one I threw away."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and pretentious","review":"A very disappointing and awfully boring novel. Almost all the characters are flat, the language desultory and the plot painfully viscous.To all those of you who seem to think that you have to either love this novel or else you didn't grasp the full depths of it : i can well see the depths Atwood AIMED at (just as her \\"Survival\\" project of establishing a genuine Canadian literature is rubbed in on every single page!), but I think she fails to convey them convincingly by literary means.The fact that she wrote it in 1972 may be an excuse for the overabundant psychoanalytic, feminist and nationalist elements in it, but it is no excuse whatsoever for the poor literary quality of this novel, which claims a lot more than it can keep.Highly pretentious and not recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"If this was a mystery, where was any kind of suspense? This was about coming to terms with an unwanted abortion. Was she ever married? Does anyone care? She started unravelling from page 172 onward; why then? I felt this book was a waste of precious reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly overated work with limited appeal","review":"I was forced to read this for a feminist theories class and almost fell asleep during several portions of the book, as well as our class discussion. While part of the assignment is the teacher's fault (insisting on standard English for assingments while touting this book) I really do not think anybody should have to be subjected to such a horrid arrangement.Having previously heard about Ms. Atwood's writing from numerous feminist friends who were active in the second wave, I really wanted to give her work a chance, and thus was disappointed by the style. Since we already know the protagonist is trying to sort her life out and come to grips with a past abortion, the language structure only produces a giant headache--especially for those on tight academic assignment deadlines.This book would be okay for leisiure reading, but under no circumstances should be expected reading for a two week (or less period)."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't read the cover","review":"For those of you in love with metaphors this is for you. Personally, I don't want to work so hard to get through a novel. After reading Alias, Grace by Margaret Atwood, I thought I had a winner with this book. I spent so much time re-reading her pages as my mind would drift. I still have 40 pages to go and I am seriously considering throwing in the towel. I have the feeling the narrator is going to wake and everything is going to be a dream. I was attracted to the book's description, and maybe that was my first mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakout in the mud","review":"I loved this book. It was not the first Atwood book I have read (which was The Blind Assassin) but it surely stuck in my mind enough to review it two years later!It reminded of friends who were at the edge of getting rid of. Bad memories encouraged by present activities. These charactors are all , save the narrator, to be forgotton because they are irritating and in the way most of the time. The point is the search for the father and his appearance in a deep-water visual which scares the hell out of me.Another visual which is not scary but hits home is the naked mud covered narrator trying to escape reality and embrace the primordial by just experiencing!! Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for Atwood fans","review":"I am an avid Margaret Atwood fan, and thus felt compelled to finish reading this book in the hope that it would somehow be as emotionally provocative as are many of her other works. Yet I felt incredibly disappointed in this earlier work of hers. Although her writing is interesting and the symbolism is vivid, it feels like Margaret Atwood is still searching for her literary voice and style. This novel seems to represent her search for her writing style, as it flips between using poetic symbolism and diary-style narratives. Quite disappointing- and I recommend to anyone reading this as their first Atwood attempt, to read another of her much greater works (i.e. Bodily Harm, Alias Grace, Robber Bride, Wilderness Tips) to truly experience the power of her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased this product prior to my current HP cartridge running out.

She has so much action in her books that you just get tired of jumping from one disaster to another. She fails completely on drawing a vivid picture of her characters. At the end of the book I have a bunch of names in my head and not a single defining characteristic sticks so I can get a true feel for them. The reviewer says nonstop thrill ride but even a good roller coaster has some slow places so you can catch your breath. Long descriptive passages of place and character provides these breathing spaces, something Ms. Chance does not excell at to put it mildly.

I find it to be erratic, inconsistent, and suffering greatly from lack of cohesion. It's hard for me to really get into the story when it does not seem to have any kind of \\"flow\\".I will try to finish \\"Claimed by Shadow\\" so as not to be a quitter and all, but after this book I do believe I am done with this author. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"downhill slide","review":"As others have noted, to me, the number 1 problem is that there is too much explanation going on. It bogs down the story and makes it oh so boring. It felt like pages and pages and pages went by that, in realtime, was a nanosecond of inner monologue as she explained, gave commentary, hedged back and forth, then came back to real time. None of which really was necessary for the story or character building or of general interest.Second major problem is that it bears just too much resemblance to the LKH Anita Blake series. Granted, you can tell she is giving it her own spin here and there, but the bare bones of the theme are just too close and invites unfavorable comparison (whether you liked the AB series or hated it.)Having nothing to read, I stuck it out but just had to quit by the third book, it was just progressively too awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Only read it because I had bought it.

This CD provided the next best thing to those unavailable soundtracks.In the last few years movie soundtracks have become big business with every year seeing the re-release of some of the old classics. The original soundtrack recordings for A Bridge Too Far, Midway, The Great Escape, and others have recently been released on CD.

I barely recalled the music when I saw the film (which should have warned me), but other reviewers here said it was a great score, exciting, thrilling and such.WHAT were THEY listening to???This CD is little more than sampled percussion, drum hits and a lot of synth string lines. Not a melody or theme anywhere to be heard. It's very much in the lines of low-budget TV thriller music that can't afford an orchestra and uses samples and synth.I'm glad I only lost $[...] in the deal.Track down and listen to the John Williams original if you can find it; it's worth the search and is much more rewarding.

The other cuts were worthlessly used up by someone named Fergie whose music I'll never buy. The other cuts are unfortunately the composer dramatizing action with music that always turns out to be just noise. Thomas Newton Howard and John Williams, two of my favorites, also do this. I don't think it's their idea; I truly think it's the director and producers who may see a movie in trouble and are trying to get an effect that their story-telling cannot. James Horner is best with action as he goes the opposite way and makes the music slow and quiet (i.e. the car chase scene in \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\")However, these two cuts are quite beautiful, but very, very short. I'm thinking of taping the end title music off of a DVD as that music is much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome score, just not enough of it here","review":"Once again, as with 'Pirates of the Caribbean', Klaus Badelt has written an awesome action score for Wolfgang Petersen's 'Poseidon'. The only problem with it is that there is considerably less of the score than I would have liked to see. The movie is about 90 minutes long, so where is the rest of that score? The actual CD is only about 40 minutes long and 3 of those songs are from the party scene. I expected those songs to be included but the score is what I'd liked to have seen more of. Having said that, Badelt's work is well tuned to the events in the movie - sharp percussion punctuating the score as the ship is rolled upside down by the rogue wave, and brass crescendos as the survivors make breakthroughs in their attempts to escape. Brass & strings also portray the grand ship 'Poseidon', as it glides along the water in the opening sequence - an apparent mastery of engineering & technology.

The authors show that one's worldview necessarily affects how one mediates. Unawareness of one's assumptions creates the potential to do great harm as a mediator. Our assumption that it's our job to make a settlement happen requires us to behave in a way that is neither neutral nor helpful to the parties. It's too easy to use our litigation tools (such as evaluation, analysis, and persuasion) against both parties in order to further our own agendas. By gaining clarity about what our agenda is, and about what's beyond our jurisdiction, we reduce the harm we do to the parties; and we create more opportunity for the parties to take greater responsibility. The approach described in this book supports parties as they tend to grow from weakness to strength and from selfishness to compassion.

Songs like \\"Blame It On the World\\" and \\"Sail On, Sail On\\" contain exquisite hooks and show why these guys are some of music's best songwriters, even without the great writer Al Anderson on guitar. There's the usual crazy humor. Who else could write songs about hotel housekeeping and termites and make them hummable, besides being great? One or two tunes go over the top: \\"I Want My Mama.\\" But they're just Terry being Terry. This guy is a fab musician who could keep up with Thelonious Monk if he had wanted to.

An appologetics for liberal political activism, the second pincer of Spong's claw acts to demonize traditional faith as \\"hateful.\\" Label the opposing debate as \\"hate\\" and shut them down from the beginning.While the frosting on his little cake looks and tastes pretty good, the underlying cake is as tasteless and unnourishing as a sawdust breadloaf.

It must be killing Spong watching 100's of millions of faithful Christians feeling more centered on our united faith with John Paul's passing eternal life with Christ (which Spong says dosn't exist) and the joy of a new orthodox Pope ..., while the empty theology of relativism and revisionism withers away.Spong and his message are like old Lawrence Welk reruns - tired relics of a hyppie generation that no one takes seriously anymore.

As such, it has no merit and is not worth the money or the time spent on reading it.I have no problem with exploring the works of liberal thinkers. I've spent time with Schleiermacher, Tillich, and Bultmann and read the critiques of classical Christianity offered by Nietzsche, Freud, Marx, Feuerbach, and others. Those are good examples of criticisms of the Bible and orthodox Christianity; Spong is not. He may be popular, but the crowd with which he is popular is simply the mirror image of the Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson fanbase. The \\"open-minded\\" Spong not only misrepresents the orthdoxy he attacks, but he is also just about the poorest representation of his own liberal tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"revisionist history = zero credibility.","review":"Okay, let's get it straight: Jesus was not married, no matter how much you read The da Vinci Code. At least, the evidence was overwhelming. It's certainly possible, but in His case it's not probable. Like most Jewish holy men of his time, he was celibate. The wedding at Cana was not His, since He stated it's \\"no business\\" of His that they ran out of the drinky-drinky. Paul used examples of Jesus' disciple's marriages when defending marriage. If Jesus was married, he would've most likely used, you know, the Son of God's marriage as a good example? But he doesn't. Because He wasn't. Married.There is nothing in the discredited gnostic gospels that say he was married, either. Where does Spong get this idea?Spong just has a chip on his shoulder with conservatives, theologically and politically. Nothing new to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Higher Power, so make-up your own morality","review":"Well, since the concept of a higher power who in creation established eternal truths is a primative, pre-Newtonian construct, then any religion which establishes moral codes and acknowledges such is false.

There are only 5 Commandments:1 - Thou shallt vote for Democrats2 - Thou shallt not condemn anyone except Christians3 - Thou shallt not hold to any moral absolutes4 - Thou shallt not believe in God as anything other than the\\"feel-good\\" desires held within oneself5 - Thou shallt believe all evil is the result of the BibleSpong is SOOOOO Al Franken, and so over.

Spong's liberation and revisionist theology continues in this latest work, only with the added theology of \\"Eco-Justice.\\" The bishop also continues his self-portrayal as some pioneering martyr, struggling for a reformed church.

If God says it, that DOES settle it. How can any man possibly have the nerve to say that if God, the supreme ruler of all things, gives a command, that a man can disrespect it and do as he pleases?\\"...neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate HOMOSEXUALS, nor sodomites... will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor. 6: 9-10, NKJV).I'm sorry Mr. Spong, but God has spoken. And he certainly doesn't need your supposedly professional opinion on the matter. I hope nobody was deceived by this book.

You sold more books.","review":"However, writing about a popular idea does not make it truth. Argument by assertion is neither intelligent nor responsible. Spong's arguments are neither reasoned nor convincing, but only assumptive. The Bible is not a hopelessly mysterious collection of riddles. It is a simple read in plain ordinary language. There is only truth in God's word. Molesting the fabric of this truth may sell books, but it does not change truth to lies as Spong would have people believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the general reader.","review":"The Sins of Scripture is clear, non-technical, and presents material in a manner easily understood by the general reader such as myself.The Sins of Scripture, like other books by Dr. Spong, shows that you can be a Christian without leaving your brains at the Church door as you enter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening and uplifting","review":"This book faces facts head-on. Christianity has been doing things wrong for two millenia now, and Spong wants things to change. This isn't going to be an easy change for many people.... in fact, most Christians won't be able to handle this change, as it stands directly in conflict with what the majority believes. This book also brings to light a lot of information that the average believer misses out on. A lot of things that is \\"common knowledge\\" among scholars that just doesn't seem to filter down to Joe-Christian.I look forward to John Shelby Spong's next book, and recommend this book to anyone who's had enough of the close-minded fundamentalism that seems to show up everywhere in our [North American] culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sins of Scripture","review":"A faithfulled and comtemporary exploration of the Bible and how it has been used to meet the needs of man rather than to the glory of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sins of Scripture","review":"The book have really helped me to see how the Scripture has been used incorrectly by many.

Overall, it was an awesome buy, especially if you're looking for a boyfriend/husband gift.

The chapters are very short and don't go into much depth. They just give you a few pictures to work with.

You do not paste 100 articles from the paper willy nilly together and call it a book. How did this woman get to be a New York Times Bestselling Author. Obviously New York Times book buyers ar a sorry lot.The book has no cohesion, no sense of organization, almost like stream of consciousness story telling.

I found this book to fall along the same lines of the Homoka/Bernardo case here in Canada to the point of being scarey. I have to sit here and wonder after reading this book how two individuals can become so sick and demented to kill/decapitate and burn another human being. Both Will & Stephanie can blame no others then themselves, and to try to blame the other is totally crazy in itself. This tells me that they are in denial of their actions which is not good.

For some reason the author portrays Stephanie Martin as a sweet girl gone bad. Well, she went so bad that it is hard to believe that there wasn't some kind of abuse going on in her family. We never find out the real reason they killed Michael Hatton and the Author admits we probably will never know. I think Stephanie might have orchestrated the crime. Maybe she was mad that Michael Hatton didn't pay attention to her, or maybe she just really wanted to see what it felt like to kill someone. Who knows?, and reading this book won't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average true crime book.","review":"Nothing impressive about the writing of this story.

I have purchased three more copies -- as gifts and as an addition to our Yoga Teachers Association library.

Call-and-response with oud is featured with the steady treble of the drums and clangling cymbals of the riqq. In contrast to some other Yemeni albums that feature dances of heavy drumming, this recording is only vocal. The simple melodies and rhythms are straightforward and largely consistent throughout the album. One track is a quat-chewing song and was recorded in a room dedicated to the herb; indeed, the singer in this instance has a wad of the leaf within a cheek. Although the selections come from various regions of Yemen, any distinctions are not obvious. To my ears, the music here is more Arabian than what one expect from an ancient trade crossroads."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express . . . ?","review":"This tea was a serendipitous mistake: Having ordered Madagascar Vanilla Red (also recommended), the order was confused and this arrived instead.

The scent in the cup is enticing. The box art is whimsical (the artist must dig an interesting variety of teas in his off hours), and overall, this is an excellent \\"morning tea\\" to start the day.

Bad Writing...","review":"This book had a good premise, but a flawed execution.I was expecting a fresh new take on Regency romance, but this had to be one of the most mundane and predictable plots ever. The main characters don't have any spark. The author tells us they do - over and over - bet we never actually see it. The writing was laughable. (Yes, I know romance novels can get cheesy, but this was just awful. Every kiss \\"shook to the core of the soul.\\")The punishment at the end was annoying. It was totally out of character for Marianne, she was acting like a moron.The Widow's Club gossip wasn't very racy and/or entertaining.I think if the author had instead made Clarissa and Sherwood's story the primary one, it would have been a much better read.

The struggle of this realization between Marianne and Adam while passion flames between them keeps the reader captivated. The only criticism is that I longed for even more passion and love scenes between the characters, as Ms. Hern knows how to write wonderful love scenes.

The explanations and examples are generally very clear, and there isn't a lot of distracting nonsense. In many textbooks they try too hard to teach through \\"Real World\\" examples. i find such examples confusing because they obscure the math behind the example.I also felt this book had a nice mix of easy, medium and challenging problems. And it feels like the author really understands and strives to clarify many of the hurdles faced by Linear Algebra students.Make no mistake about it, Linear Algebra is a tough class that requires a lot of dilligence and abstract thinking. This book isn't going to guarantee you an A.

The problems are difficult and you will not know how to do the problems even after you have read the text because of its poor explanation of concepts. The publisher's website contains a solution manual to the problems, but even it doesn't explain things clearly. Unless your teacher is excellent, you will have a difficult time if you take a course that uses this book. You will most likely have to read other texts or use the internet to actually learn. This book is definitely not recommended for self-study.

Important theorems left as problems for students.2. Presentation of the material forces students to flip back and forth between chapters nearly every lesson.3. Lessons themselves are unclear. Subspaces are nowhere defined and examples using them are given before spaces. There is no consistency in the book. He sometimes gives a geometric presentation, and other times prefers to stick with an algebraic one, obviously both would be helpful...but often times he picks the more unhelpful one.4. Answers to odd problems are often nowhere to be found. Answers to even problems can't even be found in the answer manual.5.

Everyday, my professor says how unhappy he is with this book because they present information in an odd sequence. For instance, we learned about subspaces before knowing what an actual space is.

The reading sections are so short as to be terse, and they ill-prepare readers for the section problems. In my opinion, Bretscher does not effectively explain the concepts of linear algebra.Furthermore, I rely on answers to odd problems to check my work. Often, they are invaluable guides.

Moreover, (odd) answers for concept questions or proofs are omitted entirely.Take my advice, spend your [money] on something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"This is THE worst math book I have seen in my student career.

This book was assigned in an introductory linear algebra course at Cornell and if it weren't for other, much better linear algebra books, I would not have done well at all. One of the main flaws with this book is the lack of concrete examples, which in itself is enough to make it a terrible introductory text, but in addition, the study guide ironically gives detailed answers to relatively easy questions but NO explanation AT ALL of difficult, more theoretical exercises. The only reason that I can figure as to why this book is so popular among good universities is that they are trying to give students a hard time early on, perhaps to discourage them from taking further mathematics courses.

However, both his words and the attacking tone of his comments indicate this person has serious problems. I think the review says more about the reviewer than it does about Javan's books. He was right about one thing, Javan's books are not literary poetry. They are short reflections on our relationships with ourselves, others, and the world we live in. They are not only beautiful and easy to understand, but as indicated by several hundred people who have signed the guestbook on Javan's website they are especially helpful when things are going bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"This is a touching book, don't get me wrong.

Black diamonds are really crappy diamonds that have been placed in a nuclear reactor. The black color results from the diamonds being bombarded by intense neutron radiation. This makes the diamonds radioactive, and have to be stored until their radioactivity dies out. Only then are they sent to market.

They also have huge inclusions right on their surfaces. They are gray in color (not close to black as shown in the picture). One is darker than the other. Even though their color would hide most flaws, the quality is so obviously poor it would be embarrassing for anyone to wear them.I also would like to note that the white gold settings are not as shown in the picture. The stones are propped up on top of settings so the white gold cannot be seen on the perimeter when viewed directly from the front.I ordered them a couple of days ago but now when I view the item, it says \\"Item under review\\" due to customer feedback.

I later found out that Black Diamonds are just that way, unless you buy high quality, basically flaweless, this is what you can expect to see.

I really don't think the \\"1 cttw\\" is accurate. 1/2 ct stones are larger than these. In any case, you do get what you pay for, and they seem to be a fair value at the price I paid.

Both stones have visible hairline scratches in the surface, indicating poor polishing technique. Total cost in this condition should be sub 30-40 dollars.I am willing to accept that these may not be absolutely 100% tip top perfect, but the cut needs to eliminate any and all obvious physical occlusions and cracks from the outside surface.

Not exactly a scientific study, but from my quick trial and error, it seems as if it was a faulty charger.Also, this happened the first night we had the charger and never got any better.

This book shows the reader a side of the EMS that can only be told by someone who has been there. Not only does the reader travel through the dark canyons of Manhattan with its dead and dying but also the dark canyons of Frank Pierce's mind. Frank struggles with remorse and guilt for those he could not save. Their ghosts haunt him. He waits for that one call that will change his luck and give meaning to his life and job. Throughout the book Frank teeters on the edge of sanity and keeps the reader wondering if he is going to make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books written by and about EMS","review":"Being a paramedic myself for a number of years, and also having worked 911 service for the city of New Orleans, I can honestly say that 'Bringing out the Dead' is hands down, the best book written about EMS. Most of the books written about the medical profession portray healthcare providers as noble crusaders, super-human creatures doing \\"the good work\\" for a higher purpose... What a load of crap! 'Bringing out the Dead' tells it like it is, a very real glimpse into the TRUTH of Pre-Hospital Emergency Medicine. This book ranks right up there with 'The House of God'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive.","review":"An honest and engaging glimpse into the life of a New York City Paramedic. The material puts aside conventional plot development and focuses more on the complex thought, reactions, counter-reactions, and weaknesses displayed by the Main Character. He meanders, going from one scene to another to 'bear witness', only to slowly sink into a spiral. At times I found myself laughing out loud at some of the emergency situations but was immediately silenced as the remaining words and sentences emerged. New York itself provides such crucial backdrop to this story. I've always thought of the famous City as a mini-version of our planet, harboring in concentrated form every kind of pain, hope and guilt known to mankind. This is not a debut Novel- it's quality literature. I don't think it paints EMS crews or the job itself in negative light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough assessment of life on the streets in EMS.","review":"This book could easily be about any urban paramedic's experiences on the street. Many times I found myself thinking \\"That was my patient once.\\" At times, however, it was true fiction, somewhat unbelievable to the trained eye.

The most crucial part.I don't lightly give out 1 star ratings, but this movie earned it in my view.You read the plot synopsis, and then you watch the movie, and at first bit, its going that way.

For a Harvard grad the author apparently hasn't learned much about research or the ability to accurately portray science. The characters are stock one dimmensional, the plot is ludricrous, and the background is just plain silly. I can easily allow for some literary license, but atmosphere can be best created through accuracy in details; the author fails miserably on this score (ie, his description of the hospital and ED settings...oxygen cylinders are always green, not orange, for example). I do appreciate his effort at attempting to find a scientific basis for the supernatural, but believe he should have thought it through more before commiting it to paper. His characters need a lot of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific premise, terrible writing.","review":"Holden has a great idea (unless it's not really his idea, if you've read DAY AFTER TOMORROW) but he can't write.

I ended up reading it all the way through in one night. I loved the premise, the writing wasn't that bad for a debut novel, but I hated the ending.

It starts with an interesting premise but then it doesn't really go anywhere with it except into long and detailed descriptions of, well, gross stuff. And the bad guys, the super bad guys of all time, are the Chinese (big surprise there given our current economical/political situation with China). But their goal seems so small and uncreative. The plot starts out with high tech ambitions but it turns out to be so 1950s.And why does the heroine not only have a great body but a tongue that can perform amazing feats? Geez.If you're desperate for something that won't tax your own brain cells and you like reading about vaporized brain stuff, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No understanding of scientific research","review":"The premise is great and I like his writing. But, as an Irish scientist and writer, the first few pages ruined it for me with highly inaccurate depictions of mice navigating through a maze which would never be used in real research.

The core idea of the story -- a scientific explanation of ghosts -- is a good one, and a very compelling tale could be written around it. Alas, this isn't it.

Each image is given a full page, unencumbered with text, and thus obtains its full power. Unfortunately, that's where it ends, as most of the rest of the book is like looking through somebody's stamp collection, with up to 5 images a page!. There are simply too many images crammed in, so, instead of enjoying the prints for what they are, you are left wondering what they would have looked like had they been presented properly. This is especially unfortunate when you realise prints are an ideal opportunity to present the work as the artist might have wished - since, unlike paintings, they are actually intended for reproduction.So, useful if you want just an academic catalogue record of everything that is in the Marcia and Granvil Specks collection, but pretty useless otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distinctive Voice","review":"What struck me about In Search of Black America: Discovering the African American Dream was the author's tone. There is a feeling of treading optimism and genuine concern but not condescension for his subject--the places of black middle class life in the United States. I was reminded of the work of Albert Murray and Anthony Walton's Mississippi in that this book shares a similar impulse to try and understand black middle class life. In Search shows the presence of an author who is questioning but also brings sensitivity without the heavy handedness of a writer focused on elevating or denigrating their subject; one who is genuinely interested in hearing and seeing the people who he writes about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Silicone Utensil","review":"This 12\\" spoon is light-weight, but quality silicone that holds up well to high-heat cooking and is dishwasher-safe in the upper basket.

She retells her story, although not quite bringing it to a really interesting level. I was left wanting just a bit more, as Ms. Craig worked and socialized with many legendary figures. She does a solid job of recapping her life, but always seems to be holding back some interesting details.Of course, that is her choice and maybe that is exactly how she wanted it. She discusses ballet, Batgirl, Star Trek, working with Elvis and other aspects of her life. She paints a pretty good picture of her life.Having met Ms. Craig several times, I think this book is an excellent reflection of her personality. She is open, funny and honest about the general stuff, but politely quiet about other things. In a way, it is refreshing not to read a tell-all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for those who want to know Excel more","review":"One of the excellent book of Excel. However it is out of stock.

They don't tell you to do this, but I recommend cutting the mouthpieces (after you form-fit them to your teeth) so they JUST cover your teeth. Mine covered a good part of my gums, on the top and bottom, and I would wake up in the middle of the night whith my teeth in serious pain. It must have penetrated through my gums and irritated my nerves.

When the second package came, it had the exact same expiry date ( I don't understand why they didn't take the time to check for one with a later date, it would have saved them money in refunds!) so I can only assume that their stock is old and they havent replaced it.

The rest of the show needs to match him in character and quirk and it doesn't yet. It's a standard CBS crime procedural with a quirky male lead. Give me some grit, CBS! Let Lucy Liu be just as brilliant and quirky. Put more money into the Production Design so I don't feel like I'm watching them act against an Ikea catalogue instead of my beloved dirty, gritty NYC. Give the Production Design the HBO treatment. And about this whole 'they will just be friends' stuff, that's fine for now, but eventually, please ship them, show.

People have said that it's too much like BBCs Sherlock, but I watch both shows, and while they are both modernized Sherlocks, other than that they don't really resemble each other. Each is great in its own way, and should be looked at, appreciated, and taken as entirely different, original shows instead of compared to each other. Elementary is definitely lighter and funnier than Sherlock, and Lucy Liu's Joan Watson is fantastic as Jonny Lee Miller's Sherlock's assistant. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot better than I expected","review":"I thought that this series would be cheesy but it actually is surprisingly good. I like that Sherlock Holmes has been updated a little but still pays homage to how the character was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

THis is a good show for mystery fans and for fans of sherlock holmes. IN this version sherlock is not a sociopath like in the bbc modern version 'sherlock' , he's a guy struggling with addiction and such.

There is a plethora of reality shows (too many) and it is great that CBS has produced something other than one of those here. It is wonderful to have a show that has intrigue and suspense. The introduction of some of the famous bits of the original Sherlock Holmes keeps the thread of that character intact. I hope they continue to produce this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this show","review":"I've been a fan of Johnny Lee Miller since Eli Stone. He does a fairly good job bringing Sherlock Holmes into the modern world. You have to remember that in this show, Sherlock Holmes has never existed before and no one has ever heard the name.

I rarely watch TV, having only a 2 shows that I currently follow, so I missed the first couple episodes, not knowing when the series started. With the lovely Amazon feature of being able to buy just an episode, I downloaded the pilot and watched one evening while biking. I was immediately hooked. I thought the actors brought forth the known characteristics of Doyle's characters beautifully and that the essense of the novels translated nicely into a modern setting.After watching the episode, I put the series on season pass on my Tivo and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new show!","review":"This is a great show!

Johnny Lee Miller does great work developing a complex role in a modern world of smart phones, tv's, and, computers. The best detective show to come along in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrid adaption","review":"This American attempt to update the Sherlock Holmes series might appeal to those who have never read the books or seen any of the BBC adaptions of them. I am not adverse to trying to update the series but this is whiny rather than witty, crass instead of clever, substituting P.C. platitudes for plots with finesse.

'Sherlock' in name only...","review":"I'm really surprised how many people seem to like this show! It's just another dumbed down mystery show. I'm also quite surprised how many reviewers said they were Sherlock Holmes fans, since this show has NOTHING to do with A.C. Doyles Sherlock Holmes except the blatant ripoff of the name! Doyle is never even mentioned in the credits for Petes sake! I've only watched 2 episodes, and that's about 1 too many; the 'mysteries' are trite, the 'solves' are ridiculously simplistic and unimaginative, and the acting is 'meh' at best. Comparing this to the true-to-literature, but modern era, 'SHERLOCK' starring Benedict Cumberbatch is like comparing Van Gogh to Kincaid!

Thought maybe you could knock-off another brilliant British TV show and no one would notice. I bet you thought you'd be clever too, but you're just sad.

This is clearly impossible, and there are almost an infinite number of things that could happen to screw up the authors predictions.Second, if there really is a huge crash in stocks, real estate values will likely drop considerably. The economy as a whole will fall, rents will drop, and small businesses, which in the best of times, fail at a rate of about 95%, will go out of business in droves.So the advice to get ready for the stock market crash by opening a small business and buying rental real estate makes no sense.So, this book really has very little to offer from a practical sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little light on advice","review":"Kiyosaki does a great job explaining the decline to come.

A fake touching melody, this song was released on 3 different singles, of course, one of them with a filler DVD, that include \\"Vertigo\\". They knew this crap is even worse than that annoying tune, so they had to put something catchy on this single.How come some fans can't realise this is the most clear evidence of U2's corporate sellout?.

It's clear he just wants to win yet another Grammys for this lame effort.Even after several drinks and smokes, with a terrible hangover, I can sing better than Bono in this song. What a pitiful way to end a career Bono. Bono has become the new fat Elvis. Go home you sellout!."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2's songwriting is dead","review":"this lame ballad represents the U2 double standard: On the right hand we have a band singing a 'sentimental' and 'deep touching' rather cliché song for adolescents whom cry when they listen to any diva as Britney, Christina, J.Lo, Celine, Jessica, etc, with an 'epic' production worthy of multimillionaire Hollywood movies as Titanic. All that plus a predictable, boring and shameful video, pathetic and sissie. On the other hand we have an extremely arrogant, egomaniac, self-indulgent, sellout, liar, greedy, billionaire, empty, materialist band, as appears on the cover of the single, completely dehumanized, without any feeling nor emotion.Tragic. U2's songwriting is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Bush and U2","review":"This is my favorite U2 song ever. Although Bono wrote it for his father who passed on a couple years ago, it makes me think of my fiancee whenever I hear it. As usual, U2 songs have many interpretations ala \\"One\\" which was interpreted as: a standard love song/relationship trouble, to a relationship between a father and his gay son, to a call for world peace.Really love this song and it hits me personally and touches my heart. It reminds me of when my dad was in the hospital and how scared I was that I'd never see him again and tell him how much of a positive impact he had on my life. You can tell Bono felt as much with the lyrics of this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Use The Name of \\"U2\\"","review":"This is the worst ballad I've ever heard.

The other fan was right, video is even worse and more pathetic. Shame on U2, I can't hardly believe this is a \\"U2\\" song. This lame attempt at song is an absolute piece of crap and anyone with any musical sense would throw it out the window for being tainted by this bland, vanilla, and sickening commercial use of the name \\"U2\\".Plus all we are sick of \\"Vertigo\\", so we don't need any pointless remix, videos, etc.U2 should quit... after getting their 6-7 Grammies for this crap, Vertigo and their How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, and after being named \\"The band of the year\\", \\"Album of The Year\\", \\"Song of the year\\", \\"Video of the year\\", etc once again by Rolling Stone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happens when western philosophy meets the Dharma?","review":"In \\"The Emptiness of Emptiness\\", the deceptively simple philosophy of Buddhism is disected and discussed with the care and rigor that we expect from good academic writing.

But it does take quite a while to load unlike Eyetoy: Play it where it would take ten seconds it takes about 25 seconds.

It gives your arms an awsome workout mainly because you are swinging them everywhere. However, It can be quiet fusterating because it isnt so easy to select the buttons with your hands. It helps very much so if you point at the button you want to select and with your finger tip trace a circle fast and keep going. Looking at the video and pictures of you playing is all worth it. The songs are awsome, even though there is large varity from pop to \\"oldies\\". I'd buy this in a heartbeat.

Do not understand why this junk got such a big rating here.Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great view, great price","review":"These binoculars have good optical quality for a low price. The focus is a little tough to do because of the higher power. The focus lever is a little tight and it's easy to go past the focal point because you have to press so hard on the focus lever. The higher power makes it difficult holding these binoculars steady but that's not a fault of the binoculars but just the fact that this is probably the highest optical power you can use and still be hand held. Field of view is also pretty narrow but once again this is because of the higher power. On the plus side these binoculars have a big bright image. The optics is quite sharp and the price is very reasonable. I like them and use them for bird watching but I do realize the compromises I have to make to get high power at a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sees","review":"These are great for bird watching.

It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it.

Not so. They did have a great viewing capability but they would not focus. If you used one eye you could see ok but they never would adjust correctly to view through both eyes. Not sure if it was just a defective pair or what. I returned them and will get another pair of the 12x50 permafocus Bushnells. They work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargin Quality","review":"Was very suprised to find the quality in these binocular's for such a low price.

The optics are great:1) Porro prisms provide for a more realistic viewing depth of field.2) 50mm objective lens (superb light gathering capability).3) Good focus adjustment.4) Great 16x magnification (product of the light gathering ability)The unit is very well constructed and has a rubber outer skin. It also comes with a decent carry case and accessories. Make sure you want 16x magnification, as it will require steady hands.Lower magnification (10x, 12x) with a 50mm objective lens will provide a wider field of view. You may wish to take this into consideration depending on your type (preference) of viewing.BTW- I also own a $2000.00 pair of 18 x 50 binos."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could be wrong with a $99 media player?","review":"Well, it depends on what you are buying it for.As far as connecting to my network, it is hard-wired to my router and it popped right up.

However, I bought this unit to play back video recorded in MS-DVR format from 2 different computers. The problem is that it does not recognize this format so really, it is my fault for not researching this before buying this unit.

I had hoped it would integrate with the media center software, but it does not. It cannot access programs on the computer as easily as an xbox 360 which can also be used as a media center extender. While it is great for music, it freezes occasionally while watching video. I could not get it to play video reliably wirelessly with the wireless access point right next to it. Also with a LAN line it also would freeze up on video. I just changed the ethernet cable from CAT 5 to CAT 6 cable and the video has now been playing fine, at least for the moment. The device still does freeze for no reason when using the remote control and the fast forward buttons do not work on the remote. I would steer clear of this product for the moment.

It does contain quite contrasting styles of music so a lot of people won't like everything on it. I myself prefer the more lyrical \\"Lord's Prayer\\" as well as the stunning weaving together of the Kyrie and the Call to Prayer. The latter in particular evokes a visceral hope for peace and understanding between Muslims and Christians in Africa (a hope which I think is unrealistic but nice to envision anyway).I have to say that I find the present album cover rather unbecoming to the work ... don't be put off if you don't like it either.If you've gotten as far as to read these reviews, don't leave the page without at least sampling some of the pieces now that Amazon lets you hear before you buy.

I read Raw Silk and loved it, though I nearly fainted from the hot sex scenes. Incognito is even better. With Incognito Ms. Sarai has come more surely into her writing powers and provides the reader with an interesting and absorbing plot. Parallel lives, time changes, coincidences, synchronicities -- Ms. Sarai easily handles these often difficult themes. If you want a good read that just happens to have a lot of hot sex in it, read Incognito. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Smart","review":"I loved this book, I have read all of her books and think that I like this one the best. Like the heroine (and the author) this book is both hot and smart. The premise is, in and of it self, very interesting and shows the author's knowledge of literature, the sex is HOT and shows the breath of the author's other knowings.A really fun read, I have done so several times. This is NOT just a stroke book but an interesting story with lots of sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, entertaining erotic fiction","review":"Lisabet Sarai is one of the most talented writers of erotica and erotic romance out there. \\"Incognito\\" is fine example of work and well worth checking out.

Reed was a great agent doing his job getting a low life thug doctor off the street.Read Bowden's \\"Dr.Snow\\" for a balanced and fantastically written account of Dr. Lavin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the facts...no cohesive hook","review":"Mark Bowden's heritage as a journalist shows in this book. He goes into precise detail about Larry Lavin's (the dealer) life. The characters drift in and out of Larry's life just as people do in yours. After a while, I lost interest in keeping track who was who. I read about a third of the book before I stopped.When I think back, his book \\"Killing Pablo\\" was in the same style. The difference is that while I was interested in the history and methods used to bring down the cartel; I wasn't interested in the day-to-day life of a drug retailer.If you are interested in the facts about Larry Lavin's life or if you care about how to grow and keep a drug trade, this might be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"This book proves once again that even the smartest criminals are the dumbest people on earth.

I would like to point out a correction. 90% of parents in THIS country HAVE spanked. that doesn't mean 90% DO spank, and surely doesn't mean of all parents in the world. ( 10-15% in sweden still think spanking is sometimes necessary. This is a country where it is banned to spank. So obviously one of the countries is backwards...its the exact opposite over there ). 60% say they would not spank if there were alternatives in this country.Obviously this book doesn't do those 60% any justice because it gives in to spanking. Sorry folks, kids are just too sensative for a parent to feel principled in ever hitting them. Don't even consider hitting after age 6. Spanking can be equated to rape for many individuals, as well. It is risky business.Common Sense is not too common these days. Selfish passions are replacing non-violent intuitions.

Is it any wonder this man supports beating children? TEENS?? Geez...these nut cases crawal out of the woodwork and endanger children. He is no better than the other supportor of child beatings in the Christian world, James Dobson. Please, parents, run the other direction. This man has very little understanding of the love, and teachings of God. His own opinions is exactly what they are..his own. Having raised sons without ever raising a hand by TEACHING them self discipline, leading by example, helping them to make GOOD choices, giving them proper NON-PHYSICAL consequences, and holding them accountable in a non-physical way works wonders for your children.

This is pure sophistry aimed at excusing acts against children that we would view as horrible violence if they were done to an adult. Please people, read the scientific literature and it wouldn't hurt to actually read your Bible (the whole thing!) before you start using it as an excuse for violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cop out","review":"Every organization that understands child developement has come out against spanking. Why? Because all of the research has shown that hitting children is potential dangerous to their physical, emotional, and social health (and I would add spiritual health). There are many good books on how to raise children in non-violent ways. Anything by Jane Nelson or Dr. Sears is a good resource. I ask parents to please consider the future well-being of their children before being duped by somebody who is obviously only interested in making money, and not the well-being of our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosemond should be spanked for writing this book!!","review":"Sounds like Rosemond needs a dose of his own medicine!

For crying out loud, go to Miami or Las Vegas and have a session or two with \\"Mistress Elsa\\" or some other dominatrix. Don't express your repressed sexuality on your kid's bare butt! I read this book while browsing thru a Xian bookstore, and I felt like telling the manager that it really should be put behind the counter or not sold at all. If you, as a parent, think that your kids' behavior is so bad that you need to spank, then consult a qualified family therapist and see if something other than spanking can be worked out.

My fears were completely unfounded in this case.We did have one small issue when putting together the mounting for the knives: As another reviewer stated, it was necessary to use gorilla glue to do the work of the long screw, which was far too short for the job it was assigned. However, the glue works fine, and the knives look authentically wonderful.And you COULD really kill a cave troll with them; blades are quite sharp. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Theodore Case Book","review":"Simplistic and childish and lacking so much information about Case and the development of sound-on-film movies, it isn't even funny. This book isn't even worth $2.00.The fight with DeForest is totally missing in any detail, since DeForest tried to cheat Case and embezzled his funds. DeForest was a self serving liar, stock swindler, cheat and desperate for any publicity all his life. Claimed inventions, like Case's, as his own for stock sales purposes.Other books on the era, \\"Speed of Sound\\" and others, had the detailed information, why not in this book too? DeForest did not invent sound-on-film as his biographers claim, Case was far ahead of him with a superior system that gave much better sound reproduction.Photo content is the absolute minimum, should have had a lot more.A cheap sleazy book and does Case no credit at all.

This one was fairly low cost, so I thought it might be a good risk. It wasn't.* The sound quality is terrible -- very tinny sounding. I get better audio through the telephone.* The antenna is extremely sensitive to movement around it. Since it's designed as a shower radio, you are generally right next to it and moving, causing the signal to go from loud to scratchy to soft to loud again.* The dials cannot be easily tuned with wet fingers.In short -- this is a poor radio, and it's a TERRIBLE shower radio.

If I could find any fault in my old sandals, it was that the tread was a little heavy. So this new sandal improves on it.Also, this sandal seems to have a little more padded and sculpted footbed which is good.The only extremely minor quibble is that the\\"Brook\\" sandal has a slightly more simplistic leather upper. That's not a problem because this sandal is less expensive than my previous pair.So all told, I give this pair a healthy two thumbs up, and should be as good as, if not better than my last pair of Clarks sandals, which were fairly close to sublime perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROSZA","review":"There seems to be an amazing amount of film soundrack recordings done by second rate Euro orchestras of late.

It fails miserably. Listen to the originals and match them to this out of tune, out of phase recording and mourn the loss of any record company doing justice to the originals. This is a cheap cash in on the nostalgia craze and anyone who has a reverence to Varese, EMI, Chandos, Southern Cross or other labels that might still attempt to preserve original film musics (there are still several)--should try and revert to the originals.

Then I realized why. The entire show is a bit cheesy, and I love it for that very reason, among others; however this season takes the cake. I must have deliberately stopped watching the show to save myself from the inanity of the new episodes.For closure you need the first disk and maybe the second, but that is definitely where the show should have ended.

The only reason that I gave this show a second star is that there is one scene where one of the nemesis makes fun of lois not recognizing superman from Clark by taking on and taking off a pair of glasses going look i'm superman, no clark kent, no superman.

It would have been nice to see them find another way to end the last few minutes. (2) Special Features: There aren't really any.

Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and Bush have all extended the power of the Presidency in ways the framers of the Constitution would never have dreamed of. I agree with the reviewer who commented about the favoritism towards Kennedy and Roosevelt hence the four stars rather than five.

I purchased these specifically for watching NBA games from my third-level seats in the Rose Garden, and the field-of-view was about the size of the court. Unfortunately, the focus towards the edges is very poor, so I still had to move the binoculars back and forth to keep the action in focus. Also, either the fixed-focus or the lack of constant focus seems to force your eyes to do a lot of focusing work when you pan the binoculars. After following the players running up and down the court for about five minutes, my eyes had problems focusing without them for nearly an hour!I returned these and purchased the Bushnell Powerview 4x30's for about 1/8th the price. The Powerviews are smaller & lighter, and the view is razor-sharp edge-to-edge. You can't see as much of the court at once, but my eyes are much happier now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well - no problem with eye fatigue watching football","review":"Based on another reviewer's recommendation, I at first got the Bushnell Powerview 4x30 instead of these Xtra-Wide 4x21s. But I just wasn't satisfied with the field-of-view of the 4x30s (not only do the specs overestimate their ability, but they only apply to the width of view, not the height). With the 4x21s, the field of view actually seemed to be larger than the specs indicate, and provided a nice round image, as tall as it was wide. It was like the difference between night and day! Also, I didn't experience any eye fatigue as the other reviewer mentioned: this may be because I was watching football instead of basketball (less constant action and movement). But to be honest, if I get eye fatigue from these 4x21s, I would still rather use them than the 4x30s--I can take a break or let a friend use them if my eyes start getting tired (besides, I never like holding binoculars up to my head the whole game anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these ATI videos","review":"These DVD's are amazing.

But this book presents an agonizing subject, being in debt, and makes the reader at times really laugh at some of silly actions we put ourselves into without thinking! Of course this comes with youth (or new found wealth, like a credit card) and when we're young we really don't have a clue to the future until something like being in major debt shatters our dreams.I am no spring chicken but I found many of the insights the author presents workable and really makes you think about how you can really abuse your credit. The advice crosses the boundary of age and there definitely is something for anyone who is wanting improve their financial situation.It really is a good read and do to the humor, it makes the reading enjoyable on such a painful subject!Curthttp://www.101-credit-debt-finance.com/"},{"rating":"2","title":"trying to get debt free","review":"The book is excellent!

I don't buy Starbucks, I already know it's a waste of money.This book has several unnecessary financial \\"quizzes\\" which tell you nothing, and meaningless pyramid charts.

Q: What 24-year-old that has a social life would actually enjoy reading a finance book on a Saturday night? A: The one that has this one on their coffee table. I am a twentysomething who isn't in horrible debt, but I find myself mysteriously living paycheck to paycheck. Debt-Free By 30 doesn't talk down to me in the least to get a clue about some basic and not-so-basic money strategies, so that someday I may graduate to scary \\"adult\\" money (stocks, Roths, etc.) that celeb financial people are always writing boring books about. I'd recommend this book to anyone in my age bracket who is in debt or just needs to find ways to hold on to more of their hard-earned money.

So many people in their 20's are like those in the book -- over-educated, under-employed and in-debt as a result. This book speaks to us. My friend and I spent about 2 hours in the bookstore going over the advice in this book (we plan to buy it--when the budget allows). Some of it was common sensical but worthy of reiteration, and all of it was presented very realistically. This book covers taxes, car insurance, student loans, 401k plans, etc. I would definetely recommend it to anyone who is, as the authors put it, stumbling towards 30 one minimum payment at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being CONSCIOUS by 30...","review":"Like Anthony and Cluck, I too entered my 20-something years being clueless about the hidden costs of debt.

My advice to you, dear 20-somethings (or 30 or 40 or 50): read this book. It will help you become competent and AWARE of your financial past, present, and future! After reading this book, I started talking to my friends about money issues. We all began a huge dialogue, sharing hints, tips, and pooling information.

But although the songs are great, I found the performances - by the city of prague philharmonic - to be quite weak. There is very little emotion conveyed - and the emotion is what makes E.M.'s music so compelling. Even worse, the performance differs from what you remember in the movies - e.g. the good bad and ugly track had no chorus (no grunts); the mission soundtrack sounds like a symphonic rendition without the catholic power. Stick to the original soundtracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not original music of Ennio Morricone","review":"This cd represent a compilation of various tracks by Ennio Morricone and contains very popular themes.

This album is full flittering and frenzied \\"fractal groove\\" percussion (alliteration unintended!). The occasional trance-drone of the tamboura is another welcome addition. This album may not break a lot of new ground for Steve, but it is definitely one of his strongest releases of the past 5 years and one of his most percussive.The sonic analogies to the mechanics (reflection, refraction, etc.) of light is very accurate. One can almost visualize shimmering mirrors, prismatic rainbows, lasers and ghostly photons dancing to this music. Try \\"Tripping the Light\\", \\"Touch the Pearl\\" or \\"Realm of Refraction\\" for some serious persussive grooves.

The songwriting alone is vastly superior to the drivel heard on most commercial country stations today. It takes me back to a time when it was all about the song, not image or the repetious licks and production concepts heard on most Nashville recordings of the last two or thre decades. Gary's rich but slightly vulnerable baritone voice shines through the support group of some of the West Coast's finest sudio musicians, none the least of which are Albert Lee, Doug Livingston, James Cruce, Jerry Peterson and Howard Yearwood.

I'm quite sure that the band backing them was none other than the Country Bears, in fact I think Big Al sings some of the vocals.

The bouquet is wonderfully fruity. After steeping you have a ruby brew that tastes great. The flavor of pomegranate is very authentic without the bitter taste of pomegranate seed. Rooibos provides a healthful and mild base for the fruit flavor without any sourness or ashiness. Altogether a satisfying tea.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

The honey, paints on and transforms your lips to look like you just kissed a freshly painted BEIGE wall. It's awful. I've salvaged my purchases by blending some of the colors, garish bright berry colors with dreadful dull browns, mix to create a more palatable shade and then I top with C.O Bigelow menthol lip shine to make it look like it's a gloss.A lot of work to try and salvage the money I spent on these. I don't know how or why anyone who wears makeup of even the remotest quality could recommend a product like this.

Avon's Glazewear comes in a bunch of great colors (not of which are garish as their lipstick tend to be). The formulation is very nice--the gloss goes on quite thick and is a bit sticky, which I think gives it better staying power than the average gloss. I have this in Chocolate Fling and Blushing, two colors which are actually more similar than they appear in the above photo (the former is a bit more on the brown side, the latter a bit more on the pink side). They have a nice scent to them as well, sort of a slightly vanilla/cocoa butter combination.

It's a shimmery beige shade with some sparkle in it. Don't worry, you don't even notice that once it's on. It's great because unlike some of the pinkier shades, this one is very natural. It's not at all frosty, and it glides on very smoothly. I feel more dressed up with it on. It's shiny, has staying power (but not through a full meal), and a great deal when it's on sale.

I use lip balm underneath during the day for sheer color (also helps w/ the thickness) & just layer on more in the evening. Mixing colors on the back of your hand is easy, too, thanks to the wand.

I would have welcomed information about how he really felt about connecting to the \\"German\\" part in him that he had lost....rather than the same feelings so many adoptees have about not feeling \\"connected.\\" The difference between his international adoption and a \\"national\\" adoption were not apparent to this reader (and adoptee), who lived in Europe for many years.Here again, I felt his writing was not as explanatory and much was missing. I walked away from the book not fully understanding what he had learned from his experiences"},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey for the brave","review":"A story so compelling I read all night. The author holds nothing back. He bravely admits weaknesses and failures, broken dreams and broken hearts. He understates his huge accomplishments; accomplishments most only dream about. I admire his devotion and spirit. It is truly inspiring. I highly recommend this read for everyone as each of us can relate to portions of the author's journey...and learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking portrayal of the other side of adoption.","review":"Most people would like to believe that adoption is a lovely solution to the problem of an unwanted child. Taking a child from one world and immersing him or her into another without regard is as absurd as expecting a horse to live under water. Like Peter F. Dodds I was taken from my homeland, Germany, and plunged into another world. The shock and trauma that he went through is as honest and as real as it gets. What happened to Peter Dodds is what happens when trauma, (in this case the trauma of transcultural adoption), is not taken care of. As I read through this book I felt the chill of recognition at his questions as well as his confusion regarding his own identity. In many ways his struggle mirrored mine. This is a book that anyone involved in inter-country adoption should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"best freud yet","review":"I PURCHASED THIS BOOK LAST WEEK AND HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO PULL MYSELF AWAY FROM IT.

Each plays off the other in such precision that the result is a hypnotic dance which begs the proverbial question, \\"how can you tell the dancer from the dance.\\" The subject matter for most viewers is not literal enough to draw them in. But for those viewers interested in the mechanics of dreams and psychosis, the dark metaphors veiled by the surface plot ironically reveal a sentience very much like what Poe describes in \\"The Fall of the House of User.\\" Even if the central \\"meaning\\" escapes you, the final scene is worth experiencing. The dance between the two main characters, played by Leigh and Coyote, is classic. If you're looking for \\"meaning,\\" you'll find it in the expression on Leigh's face as Coyote whispers in her ear while the music plays on. I was so impressed by the performances of Leigh and Coyote that I dedicated my first novel to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"He said \\"reasonable\\", not easy...","review":"As other reviewers have noted, some of Mate's suggestions and exhortations may seem extreme. In that vein this may not be the best book to read first about \\"simplicity\\". However, it will be the most entertaining one to read if you are not afraid of being challenged or convicted of some of your own excesses. Part of being reasonable is to also be responsible and have some common sense. Of course you aren't going to go out and apply every single one of the author's suggestions. But if you think about doing one of them, I suspect he will have judged the book a success. I think you will find yourself laughing (usually at yourself) as you identify with what is being written in these pages.

Through numerous examples Maté shows us another way, a simpler way. He compares American culture to those abroad, in one example portraying the disbelief of a foriegn friend that americans use electric clothes dryers. In a humerous way, Maté pokes fun at all of us, in the hopes of changing the world a little bit. Making it a little better place. I highly recommend this book. It's changed the way I live.

It has changed my perspective, my outlook and quite frankly, my life! I might add I am in the process of tearing up half my yard to replace it with a garden.

I simply loved his songwriting in Uriah Heep. so when he made a solo album I was deligheted and surprised at the same time because the songwriting on \\"Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf\\" was so different form the stuff he was doing with Uriah Heep.

In retrospect, although it is pretty mellow, I like this album better than most of the Heep albums themselves. In fact, you could almost consider this just a more introspective Heep album, as Hensley is their main songwriter anyways, and Uriah bassist Thain is also on the album. Some great songwriting here, and Ken's voice is as good in its own way as Byron's. One of my favorite albums after almost 25 years! I just wish he were still putting out stuff like this and \\"Demons\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"harmonious and utterly gratifying folk - rock ballads","review":"Ken Hensley's music leaves one wishing for more. It does, however, seem to be singularly directed at afficionados, given the absence of the product at music outlets in this country. The airing of Hensley's music would currently be deemed inappropriate by most radio stations, as the mellow tone and style may not appeal to their fashionable listeners. No, Hensley's music would not be considered popular, far from it. Its allure lies in the honesty of its lyrics and the sheer musicality of the music itself. This is a fine piece of work that would attract a following from those lovers of music who have already transcended the borders and confines of peer pressure. Now if only Hensley would have a next, even more refined product see the light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real pleasure -- would recommend it","review":"I was intrigued with the title of this CD and thought I'd give it a try and was very pleasantly surprised. The music consists of songs from the turn of the last century, and there is a nice write-up in the CD of the songs that are sung with some background info. The singer has a beautiful soprano voice, very clear and pure in tone. Some songs I have heard before and others were not familiar to me, but overall I enjoyed most of them. I was particularly taken by the soprano's rendition of Bird in a Gilded Cage and found myself smiling throughout Pine Apple Rag. Also included is After the Ball and My Wild Irish Rose. If you are in the mood for something different, give this CD a try!

However, the book does not relate her growing up with experiences of being in a family still trying to come to terms and accept what happened in WWII. The Holocaust does not in anyway seem to play a contributing factor in the protaganist's growth. Instead, it details growing up pangs which is nothing different or significant from a person in any other ethnic or cultural group. Ursula Hegi is a good person to read on what it was like to grow up German in the aftermath of war. I was hoping Sucher would be a corresponding Jewish author who could tell the other side of the story, but the book was a major disappointment. Boring, predictable, and doesn't live up to its promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet and sublime","review":"Sucher touches the heart and the funny bone in her daring and truthful exploration of one woman's struggle to get out of the shadow of her family's past into the spotlight of her own gifts. Fearless and moving, her protagonist, Rachel Wallfisch, sometimes threatens to fall into sentimentality only to pull herself out of her own malaise. Sucher's portrait of women survivors is unequivocal. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching and honest portrayal of a contemporary woman","review":"What strikes me the most about Ms. Sucher's novel is that it makes no apologies for its bold and honest portrayal of a woman obviously torn between the role she must play as a child of Holocoust Survivors and her place as a contemporary woman in a society that seems out of touch with her experiences. How she must cope, relate and yes, over-come, the distance she feels in relatoinships without sacrificing the obvious pride and fierce love she has with her upbringing and the wonderful figures of her youth is the main crux of this touching and oft-time charming and very revealing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Portrait","review":"I found this book tucked away between bigger ones and was intrigued by it. I devoured it in just two days of almost non-stop reading! While having a few, and I mean a very few, slow points, it was one of the most moving portraits of a holocaust survivor family I have ever read. I wonder how much of this is really fiction? I found myself crying uncontrollably at the end as I realized how close the main character's feelings come to all people coming to terms with their parents, and how accentuated it was/is for a survivor child. Although written from a woman's viewpoint, it is not a story just for women. I cried as a man reading this story who has children, and who has a wife that it helped me understand better. I hope it helps her too. Thank you to Cheryl Sucher for such a well-thought-out story.I look forward to more from you. Read it.

How do we cope with our abnormal and difficult backgrounds in trying to live normal lives? How do we date, marry, have friendships, all the while trying to have the best relationships we can with our parents who went through such horror? But, unfortunately, the author did a very poor writing job in this book. She would start out with a simple and important idea to convey to the audience, then meander for several pages until I, for the life of me, could not remember what that idea had been. She needs to \\"streamline\\" her writing, so that the reader does not get lost, and also so that the reader can care about the characters.

Kenny has been accused of selling out, sounding too pop. I do admit that this CD features his best work--when he seemed more true to country, but he still has some great new songs.

Wise has spun a superlative tale that captures the reader from the opening page and packs a big whallop throughout. Intrepid Force is a futuristic tale of friendship, loyalty, and the age-old battle of good versus evil. Much of the incredible technology included in the novel has been so thoroughly researched that it is not only believable but inevitable. I found it difficult to put the book down and couldn't wait to turn each page to discover what happened next.

The \\"shoe garage\\" is the major selling point, since my shoes are disgustingly revolting (hey, it's what happens when you use them!). The outside water bottle slot is plenty big enough to carry your average 20oz bottle, and the 2 possible places to attach the awkward yoga mats = icing on the cake! Gorgeous bag, almost too cute for the gym. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

Go elsewhere!!!","review":"I noticed that some folks are reviewing a different album here. These are indeed the original 80's songs and artists for the 80's British Invasion collection with the British flag pumps on the cover (Culture Club, Billy Idol, Duran Duran, The Kinks, etc.). It's a bit confusing, I think, because the British Invasion usually refers to the music of the 60's (The Hollies, etc.). The real problem, however, is in the CD mixing...which is frankly horrible sounding and extremely high on treble. It almost hurts the ears to listen to this, they've pushed the treble so high. Awful. I checked this out from my local library as I was mildly interested in a few songs (I had the 45 of the Flock of Seagulls hit \\"I Ran\\" as a kid), but you'd be better to search out these songs somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"More pictures!","review":"This book did a really good job of explaining the life of ancient Egyptians, but it needs more pictures!

Baker held sway from 1974 to 1981 and while I've been clamoring for years that they do the obvious and release boxed sets devoted to the entire run of each Doctor, I must admit that Doctor Who: The Key To Time Special Edition ($99.98; BBC America) comes close -- it presents an entire season, which just happens to be one long story arc. A similar set was released (at a lower price) in 2002, but this one is jam-packed with all the extras of that one plus many more, including making-of documentaries.

I never had knives like this before and they are very easy to cut with. Because they fit my hand so nicely, I can hold on to them for a long time and don't have a problem chopping up a lot of vegetables. My hand doesn't get tired using these knives.The drawer is a bit tight to open and close, but I'd rather have it a little tight than too loose. It's probably something my brother can sand down for me to make it a little easier to open and close, but it's not really a big deal.Over all, I would recommend this as an easy to use and fun set.

I've turned it upside down, on it's side, have shaken it to get the drawer open.If I had paid the $15.99 price like others, I may have kept it just b/c of the cutting board and hoped some day the drawer would open.Since I paid the $29.00 price (boo), I am sending it back.After reading the other reviews I don't need to get a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"luv it!","review":"I found this when looking for gifts.

The durable surface of the board is standing up well to heavy use. I think these are a great deal - I've easily paid this much in the past for just the knives or just the cutting board.

I swear I get a better workout using this then the Olympic bench at my gym. When I am done on the body champ my chest is just pumped. Because I know the weight will not bee coming down on my face if my arms fail I can push harder. I also love doing shoulder presses on this thing. It does a great job. I gave it four stars only because the metal tubing could be thicker and the bench needs to be brought back a few inches. Doing inclines is almost impossible.

It contains some decent information on how to manage conflict in the workplace. What the book lacks is a step-by-step approach on conflict resolution or dealing with difficult people.

Frank Huyler is an amazing writer who captivates the reader with characters in the best and worst of situations. I had to put the book down twice only to get my breath and start again. \\"Maggot man\\" will catch you off guard but you'll go back for more. These are not bloody drive by accident stories just waiting for you to gape. Rather you are romanced into the heartbeat and atmosphere of the ER. Each chapter keeps you intrigued and by the time you finish you'll be wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling yet mystical story telling","review":"We are lucky that Frank Huyler has the gift of language so that he can express the inexpressible for those of us who work in medicine. The stories resonate authenticity but capture the feelings of our encounters with our patients rather than just what is visible or audible. I look forward to hearing more stories from Dr. Huyler. His youth is superseded by his wisdom and honesty"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"I just want to write a quick recommendation of this slim but stunning work, which mixes poetry and drama, emotion and restraint, wisdom and elegance. I can't urge you enough to read this--whether or not you have ever seen the inside of a hospital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but pithy","review":"The book is short and to the point, telling a series of short stories from medical school, residency and beyond about people the author knew. Most of them are quirky colleagues: the medical student who accidentally kills his roommate, the trauma surgeon on drugs, the other trauma surgeon who womanizes all the nurses, etc. Loads of fun but not for people who do not understand medical jargon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Each chapter is like a tiny moment of life written out in a few powerful pages. It was a wonderfully written book and although it often isn't appreciated as much as it should be, it makes incredible airplane reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and guts are not poetic!","review":"If you liked \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\", you'll love this one for sure; but my own experience working at the ER has taught me that poetry doesn't mesh very well with blood, pain and imminent death situations. I'm glad Dr. Huyler found a way to channel his stress in a positive way, but his somewhat empty prose leaves me quite cold. If you're looking for some good, interesting and serious tales about hospital medicine I recommend you \\"Extreme remedies\\" by John Hejinian. In this, his one and only work of fiction, Dr. Hejinian writes a story that reflects the unadorned reality of this exciting but scary world, and even when the novel was first published more than 20 years ago, it's still actual."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"I read this book from the perspective of a fellow physician who served her residency at an institution that prided itself on its trauma services. I think that the stories Dr. Huyler relates are common experiences of young doctors everywhere, and any of us could write a book about the patients and the politics we see. I recognized many of my patients and colleagues in these stories. I think most of the chapters were good starts, but most could have used more development. It brought back memories to me of a night on trauma call as an intern, on my parents 40th anniversary. An older couple came into our hospital, also celebrating their 40th anniversary. The husband had lost his way on the country roads surrounding the midwestern city where I trained. He was hit head on going the wrong way on a limited access road. Neither survived. I almost quit medicine that night, and I knew I certainly didn't want to do ER or trauma. The problem with this book is it seems to lack a soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well-written","review":"Dr. Huyler has some interesting stories to tell, but his writing style is very awkward and hard to follow. It does not flow very well. The stories don't seem to have any real ending to them; it's as if he just stops in mid-story and doesn't finish the tale for us. Also there are strange bits of information added occasionally that have nothing to do with the actual story. I felt like he frequently stopped in mid-story, shifted gears, started to tell a completely different tale instead, then stopped that tale just as abruptly to return to the original story, which in turn was ended without being properly finished. It's as if he tries TOO hard to be intellectual or poetic, and the story suffers because of his failed attempts at intellectualism. Being a doctor does not necessarily make someone a good author.Again, the stories themselves were interesting; they simply were not told very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deviate from the course","review":"I've read many books about ER, this one was the worst.

As another reviewer pointed out, there are so many errors, mis-statements, and outright falsehoods in this book that it's difficult to point all of them out. But perhaps the biggest clue that this book is no more factual than the historical manuals deemed \\"pulp fiction\\" by Kennedy is his reliance on the questionable \\"research\\" of Tang Hao. Tang Hao was a known communist (even arrested for it) and a shill for the newly formed Chinese communist government. Hao's research into historical martial arts manuals amounted to nothing more than a commie white-washing of Chinese martial arts history.

It's simple looking and that's really our style, so we ordered it. When we got it it looked like a cheap piece of plastic with a $10 mirror attached to it. After some trouble, because the cheap back end is just a piece of formed plastic, I got it hung. After a couple weeks the magnet that was attached to the mirror end just fell off, and the hinge is starting to look weak. This product is a piece of junk.

The author will describe a sequence of events, and then rehash the same sequence of events from another character's point-of-view.

My wife keep saying she felt like scratching her hair, and one of my kid say his body itches while looking at some of the reef patterns!Unlike other underwater/animal documentary, this one doesn't show the hostile / predatory acts until seeing sharks in action toward the end.The 2D movie doesn't seem as sharp, but 3D is top-notch. It's better than all other underwater 3D documentaries that I own (including IMAX Deep Sea 3D). There are good balance of in-screen and out-of-screen (OOS) objects.

My only complaint is that it would have been helpful to know the approximate size of the various life forms we were seeing. For example, barracudas and trumpet fish, shown in schools, looked to be about the same size on the screen, yet in real life barracudas are much, much larger than trumpet fish. It's a small complaint.The music soundtrack was just right; very pleasant.

The only good feature is the purge valve releases air to the side so it doesn't obscure your vision. Probably a good thing for shark visits.The mask is very wide and leaks through the top and sides. To get it to seal well, I had to really crank the strap tight. In that configuration, the glass presses uncomfortably against my forehead- intolerable! The nose piece is too small for my nose... AND No, I'm not the guy from that Roxanne movie!Just a horrible fit for a mask. I had two other people try it on, and they had the same problem. Is this supposed to be an Extra Large or seal against our wetsuit hoods?To compound the problem, the mask fogged within a few minutes of entering the water-- it started clean and dry.I say keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"good dictionary","review":"This dictionary was helpful for most of my needs. As a student, I have a constant need for a dictionary. Not only was the book informative, it's easy to find it because of its bright red color."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all have a place we fit.","review":"We are a little late with this book. It starts out sort of sad. None of the other big santas will let the littlest help out. They not only leave him out but also make fun of him. In the end he finds a job that is perfect for him. This book could be used for helping children understand how it feels to be left out and how to look for a place they belong when they are left out. While it was not a favorite of my 8 year old's, I felt it had a lot to say. I have it recommended for ages 4-8 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is better out there.","review":"I got this and to my dismay it is a smaller version of a bigger book that I already have. It has two translations one on each side. That is fine and all but the Greek translation is terrible. I am no Greek scholar but I have found so many flaws in the Greek that it becomes useless. The author just takes the same language for the most part of the KJV. So you will not learn anything about what a word really means. The Greek Majority Text Greek New Testament Interlinear is much better and worth the money if you are a serious student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"The review is making me give this product at least 1 star, if I had my way, it would get none. Purchased this thru Amazon. It caught fire today. Do not buy, it is a fire hazard. There are alot of complaints on this and Cuisinart has not recalled these coffee pots. Had my husband not been in the kitchen when it happened, not telling what would have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"First, let me say that the clock on this appliance runs slow, so I'm returning it. Even if it worked, I'd hate it. To make coffee, you must lift up the entire top, which means you have to pull it out from under upper cabinets. Inside, the water opening is very small and difficult to reach. At the same time you have to bend down and squint to see the cup markings on the outside. The stray coffee grounds are impossible to clean from the area around the cone holder and they end up in the coffee. The water goes through too fast and the coffee is very weak, especially for a partial pot. I find all this very disappointing because I used to be a product demonstrator for Cuisinart back when they made highest-quality appliances. They've really lost their way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"I echo the points others have made about this brewer: it regularly clogs and creates a mess, you can't take it apart to clean it, the design makes it easy for the coffee to back-up into the water tank.Regularly creates a mess in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after only one year","review":"I loved this coffee maker. I have owned only Cuisinart and this was my most favorite so far. Until one morning, after a long night with sick kids, it would not turn on! So sad. I could have just got a bad one but I expect a coffee maker to last more than a year! Yes, I am a little bitter. Also, I did order this machine off of Amazon but it may not be this exact seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"great for 8 days","review":"I was so excited to get this coffee maker. It lasted for 8 days and then died. I call Cuisinart to replace it and was given the run around and told to call Amazon as I had ordered it thru them. It was a holiday week and I had company coming in from out of town. This is our vacation home and shopping is very limited. It was the worst customer service I have experienced. Amazon was helpful but can only provide free shipping for the return. I purchased another brand of coffee maker from Amazon that cannot arrive in time for my guests visit. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISINART PRODUCT AGAIN! Unreliable and poor return policies."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great while it lasted","review":"I'm doing an update to my February review. After a whopping 90 days of making fairly good coffee our machine decided to take a trip to the coffeemaker graveyard this week.That makes three Cuisinarts that have lasted a combined total of nearly a year. Not great for hundred dollar+ machines. So to the reviewer who said that since it was Cuisinart it must be good all I can say is good luck.Oh yeah, after sending the second one back and being told that we'd have no warranty on this one since we'd gone through so many machines I don't suppose there'll be a Cuisinart anything in our home again any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"On the plus side: stylish, easy to program, relatively fast brewing.On the minus side: the valve on the \\"pause and serve\\" feature easily clogs with grounds, causing it to leak -- if you are making a full pot, you have to make the coffee weak (using fewer grounds) to avoid this problem. Also, you cannot pour a cup from a full carafe without spilling. Finally, the brew temperature is too low, and is not adjustable.I'll be looking for a replacement as soon as my budget allows."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy coffeemaker ... bad design!","review":"I bought this coffeemaker after doing a fair amount of research. The price was right, the company respectable, the features sufficient. Turns out that the coffeemaking is only so-so ... the design is terrible and makes the white model always stained on top and needing to be wiped down behind the carafe where the coffee always drips down. If you buy one, and a strongly recommend that you spend your money elsewhere, definitely do not buy the white one. It is downright unsightly unless you clean it up all the time. I wrote Cuisinart an email to complain about this model after only owning it a few weeks and got back a pat, unresponsive letter with no desire to try and accommodate my dislike of it and provide perhaps an alternative model. All told, I would not buy another Cuisinart coffeemaker and would think twice about buying anything by this company after my contact with customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious coffee","review":"I've enjoyed the coffee brewed in this coffeemaker. It is strong enough to taste rich and flavorful without being overpowering or bitter. I like the \\"ready\\" signal and the fact that I can control how long it keeps warm before shutting off. The temp is just right. It is easy to program and not so big that it takes up a lot of counter space.In addition, the cord is long enough to pull out from under the cabinet but not so long that it is in the way. I keep my appliances a long time so I hope to enjoy good coffee for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Dorm Room","review":"I purchased this for my newly-off-to-college son. The college required \\"auto-shut-off\\" which this has. My son likes that the machine is programmable and pours without dripping. I also got a permenant filter for him. His only complaint is that it is white, but the white one was almost $60 cheaper than the black one. I used the $60 to get him a printer, so no problem!The only real problem with this machine is that it is tough to see the water level when pouring it in the machine. As long as you use the coffee pot to fill it, you know how much goes in. It is tough to see the little guage inside the machine if you are using some other source, like bottled water. (We have a Cuisinart at home and it has the same problem.)Overall, a very nice machine for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are hot!!","review":"I missed these guys so!!

A few chapters into this book of wonderfully crafted essays there is the realization that he is trying to outpace his own neuroses. The essays are hiliarious and poignant accounts of the author trying to make sense of his own sexual, scatalogical and emotional foibles. I Love You More Than You Know is written in a smart prose style that, I feel, is without peer. I would highly recommed the book for a quick lighthearted laugh out loud funny read, that leaves the reader more hopeful than despairing on the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"More stories from Ames' wild life.","review":"Ames' third essay collection brings with it his normal hilarity (no one has misadventures quite as awkwardly funny as Ames), but also, too, pathos. An older and somewhat-wiser Ames seems full of regret -- over who he is, how he's lived, the decisions he's made, the kind of parent he can be to his kid -- and there's a real sense of melancholy undercutting all the laughs. But whether it's mentioning a bump on another author's head or getting lost after a boxing match or fencing against a hated rival as a teenager (my favorite piece from the book), Ames will have you laughing out loud. Ames, in his simple, easy language, seems to reveal all of his flaws so we can laugh at ourselves and accept all the horrible, embarrassing things we all experience and try to hide away."},{"rating":"2","title":"never over-bid when you're vulnerable","review":"If you're going to get shirty and try to speak from a superior position, you need to know what you're talking about.It's not \\"ad homimem\\" - it's \\"ad hominem.\\"Thanks for the laugh, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy other books","review":"Not as entertaining and not as well documented as many of the other books available on Bush and his lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST VIDEO FOR CHILDREN AGE 2 AND UP !!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS VIDEO IS A GIFT FROM JACKIE AND COLIN MOORE, WALDORF INSPIRED, VERY GENTLE, BEAUTIFUL FOOTAGE OF HAWAII, LOVELY SONGS AND IT MAKES YOU WANT TO MOVE TO HAWAII.SWEET PEA IS JACKIE AND COCO IS COLIN MOORE, AND THEN THERE ARE ALL THE LOVELY CHILDREN, .IT MAKES CHILDREN VERY HAPPY TO WATCH THIS VERY VERY SPECIAL VIDEO. !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"excessive salt!","review":"Just got these and tried them, omg there is so much salt it's practically burning my mouth.

Given that Carmine Coppola is conducting, the renditions are shockingly ersatz; as if the music was being performed by 101 strings orchestra or something. I find the rendition tasteless, alternately infused with muzak and bombast. In my judgment the feel of the music is way off. If you listen to music through a clock radio while doing dishes, fine. But if you are a connoisseur of fine music intelligently and tastefully performed, I don't think you are going to like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time Music Junkie","review":"I first listened to Swim as a downloaded MP3 (Fall Into The Sea).

Can't wait for the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid reference work.","review":"Good job - detailed plot analysis for those who are not familiar with the episodes, cast and characters, etc. Each episode has a critical evaluation that, if one does not agree with, has to admit is at least well-written.

The fights at the beginning are a lot better then the ones in the middle and end of the movie. The most interesting thing about the film is the great Fan Sui Wong is the role of the bandit Jin. He's clearly the most interesting fighter / actor to watch in the film. Otherwise, this movie starts out decent, but by the end of the film, you find yourself saying that the film is pretty bad.

I can't believe I paid for this....The movie reminds me of the 80s where every military action movies was about the Soviet Union and USA. This time it is China vs. Japan in a extremely boring story line. The actors' play is worse that any Latin Soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"def product","review":"The movie reviews on the dvd display/play ok. When the IP Man movie starts to pan foward it stops dead in its track. The display only shows IP Man moving foward and then stops. I went to Walmart and their movie did the exact same thing.

Beware buying the blu-ray version as it does NOT work on some blu-ray players. I had an issue when it would not get to the Main DVD Menu, all the trailers played but could not get to the Menu Option (Play etc.). I thought something was wrong with the DVD and returned it for replacement (great job Amazon). But when replacement had same problem I contact Panasonic as I thought it was bad but Panasonic WAS aware of th issue with that title. To get past the menu, ie, to play the movie I had to press \\"1\\" on the remote to play \\"2\\" for Special Features, etc. Otherwise movie itself is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"One of the best martial arts movies of recent times.

This movie was amazing, in every way...one of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot. The action is nonstop, the acting is superb, the martial arts moves are so good. It's a mix of both traditional old school Chinese martial arts movies combines with moves I have never seen. If you haven't seen it already, stop what you're doing and watch Ip Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, Awesome!","review":"This movie is AWESOME! This is a period piece film, about Japan invading China. Also, about the man who inspired and trained Bruce Lee. Donnie Y is a great fighter/actor. Very cool and he kicks azz big time. Every night I do the Ip Man moves on my man. All that's missing is him sliding down the pole after I punch him in rapid succession! Just kidding. My whole family LOVED this pic.

However, there is a lot of visual noise, especially in the dark parts of the movie. Not much different from the DVD release, frankly.Donnie Yen is in great form here. Somewhat restrained in his portrayal of Master Ip, he nevertheless displays a great range in both his acting and in his fighting. Top notch film....do not watch with anyone Japanese. Tends to get awkward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray version does not play","review":"Such a Excellent movie for a Wing Chun practioner, purchased the blu-ray collectors edition and it would not play on the player, requested an exchange and the 2nd one would not play.

Rather, it reflects how disappointed and annoyed I am that Amazon didn't specify that the original audio is replaced by English speakers. To me that just destroys the movie COMPLETELY, I mean what's the point in watching a FOREIGN FILM in English? Subtitles is perfectly fine I want to hear the original language. And I'm pretty sure since they specified you can't return an On Demand purchase, I will be stuck with wasting $12.99 on a file I will never open despite the beauty of the entire movie. Please be careful when purchasing this, I'm sure many have been ripped off making this purchase. Hopefully people decide to read customer reviews first unlike I did, however I didn't think I needed to, guess I was terribly wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solution to freezing menu","review":"Like many here, my blu-ray copy of IP Man freezes at the menu screen.

Robert Downey Jr. has made this art popular lately. I'm glad it's made available to the US by Wells Go USA. This is more of a biopic rather than true to life of IP Man (Yip Man ,'') it depicts the modern incarnation of the martial art during the Japanese occupation of China.Official website: [...]Wing Chun is an art that is unique as it descends from a Shaolin nun (Ng Mui) as oppose to a monk. It was passed on to Wing Chun.Ip Man 2 was premiered in Asia on April 29, 2010. A long awaited sequel that also stars Samo Hung. Samo Hung spared with Donnie Yen which was much anticipated since their duel in Kill Zone (S.P.L.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining movie, insulted at the end","review":"The movie itself was entertaining, and I enjoyed the fight scenes. The voice-over was a little distracting at first, but I got used to it and enjoyed it more than having to read subtitles.I was insulted at the end when it essentially gave China full credit for defeating the Japanese in WWII. I went on to read several reviews about the historical inaccuracy of the movie, especially the portrayal of the main character. Ordinarily I don't get too worked up over historical inaccuracy (I've come to expect this from movies, and generally I'm just looking to be entertained). Between the ending and the subsequent reviews I was overwhelmed/reminded of the horrible things the Chinese goverment has done with its heavy-handed propaganda. I had watched the movie for free, online through Amazon Prime, and was thinking of buying it for my movie collection until the end. I wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"IP MAN","review":"VERY WELL WRITTEN,PERFORMED AND PRODUCED MARTIAL ARTS FILM.BEST IVE EVER SEEN!THAT ENTAILS ALOT.IP MAN THE INSTRUCTOR OF BRUCE LEE,GIVES A EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE.STUNTS ARE REAL LIFE.NOTHING IS CHEESY.THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME MARTIAL ARTS FILM.YES I RECCOMEND IT HIGHLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best martial arts story","review":"I was always curious as to why this \\"unknown\\" movie was so highly rated.

I was skeptical about this movie. But, when I saw if from the opening scene I could tell that it was special. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. The story, (not sure if all of it was true) but the story was so engaging. The fight scenes were not too far out there like \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Wires\\". Instead, they were done very intensley and with great editing. The sound was great as well. Nothing too \\"Black Belt Theater\\" where everyone sounds like they are flapping their wings. The story was very well told. Drama wasn't too drawn out. You actually cared for the characters.I highly recommend this movie. Incredible.

This is his story, his struggle, the Japanese wanted to conquer that part of the world, China and expand from there. All the man wanted to do was teach martial arts to disciples...he tried to do this with people breathing down his neck at all times and challenging him to fight every 10min lol. I've never seen anything like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"Some awesome action in this movie. I want to fight like that :-) Definitely worth the purchase if you are a martial arts movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie","review":"This was awesome. An excellent cast and crew ensemble. The fighting choreography and frame composiiton was excellent. I haven't seen a movie like this that felt so good since maybe Bruce Lee's Biopic. It was definately worth the purchase on Bluray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Action and sound characterizations","review":"Although I was ultimately disappointed to find out that much of what is displayed in this allegedly 'based on a true story' tale is not, I thoroughly enjoyed the action and emotions portrayed by the cast.What I enjoyed most as I reflect on the film is that our hero is the best fighter out there and, unlike Rocky or Clint Eastwood or so many other superhero movies, we are not made to suffer through implausible scenes of our guy getting his butt kicked before he gets his. Donnie Yen as IP MAN is always the man and his being so takes nothing away from the drama or entertainment value of the film. This movie, I purchased just on the recommendations expressed here and I was very pleased. I would agree that it is one of the best martial arts movies that I have ever seen.Those who see the sequel Ip Man 2 will see the filmmakers regretfully return to the tried and true format."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie","review":"I like martial arts movies and so I was not surprised that I liked this one. The story is good and is only made better by it being a story about a real person. What is surprising is that my wife liked it too. She will tolerate a martial arts movie but she did not expect to like this one very much. At the end she said she wanted to see it again. She will give no higher praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ip Man's Fast Fists","review":"This is a very nice collector's edition blu-ray of Ip Man. The picture quality is great, plus the TrueHD surround sound you can hear every punch and hit that Donnie Yen lands on his opponents. The bonus features disc really is a bonus. Interviews and making of videos are fun to watch. Overall this is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best Kung-Fu movie ever made!","review":"I echo others who give this first Ip Man film the highest of ratings.It's really this simple:to live up to part of the legendary Bruce Lee's legacy, the producers had to get the best; and they did with Donnie Yen and crew.This movie has it all; tragedy, drama, romance, humor, humility, heroism, a great story and screenplay, and some of the best martial arts choreography ever.Unlike many Kung-Fu movie stories that are hard, if not impossible to follow; this is an easily understood, yet complex story that transposes cultures.If you're even the slightest interested in martial arts, Bruce Lee's origins or action movies in general, this is a must see movie that will uplift your spirit like few movies of this genre ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fight scene ever!!!!","review":"This movie is awesome! I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes martial arts and loves seeing it perfectly executed. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just....Just WOW!","review":"This was free for Prime accounts and I needed something to watch while I was on the treadmill. I expected this to be a mind numbing time kill, but I was amazed! The action was good and what I expected but the icing on the cake was the storyline. I couldn't stop watching. IP Man offers a unique balance between the cerebral rush and the adrenalin one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what?","review":"While IP Man has decent action, it represents its story as true-ish (based on a real story) and it barely reflects the facts of his life. This movie is pure revisionist propaganda backed and funded by one of the worlds largest governments. Watch it for the fights and skip on the false drama. IP Man 2 is an even worse film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!!!","review":"Just watched this movie and all I can say is...amazing!! It has a great blend of story, fighting, and history. I would rank it up there with Fearless, Drunken Master, The Protector, Ong Bak, and Enter The Dragon. If your a martial arts movie buff, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"IP MAN IS PHENOMENAL!!!","review":"I was never a big Donnie Yen fan until now. Donnie Yen is a great martial artist but I never liked any of his movies. Ip Man is his greatest performance. Being a Wing Chun practioner, I really was impressed with his skills, Donnie appeared to be a student of the art for many years. His acting has greatly improved also, he WAS Ip Man. He was the perfect choice to play this role. Asian producers always seem to use Jet Li to portray historical characters, I'm glad they choose Donnie. Fearless was a great film also, but Ip Man is by far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST see kung-fu movie!!!","review":"This is the best kung-fu movie I have ever seen in the recent years! It illustrates the life and the character of Bruce Lee's great master 'Ip Man'. I have been waiting for 2 years to have it formally released in the U.S. I am looking forward to this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Excellent movie.

If you even remotely liked \\"The River Turns The Wheel\\", you need to find and hear these first two, particularly \\"Disaster\\". It's as good as it gets. Bob would do well to re-release these albums. Also, saw Bob perform this year for the first time some twenty years after first hearing his music. It was just swell. P.S. If you've found Bob Martin you've probably already absorbed Bill Morrissey, Cheryl Wheeler, Guy Clark, Robert Earl Keen, Jerry Jeff Walker, Russell Smith/Amazing Rhythm Aces, Willis Alan Ramsey and James McMurty.

It doesn't sound like much time at all was spent on the production of this disc, although some of the mastering sounds pretty nice, I suppose with great equipment that is no problem. There is also some bad off time editing on track 13. I was in fact a large fan of Bass 305 back in the day, but I'm sorry to say, it doesn't seem as though David and Mark know what is going on anymore, nor really care.

Being so narrow it is not comfortable... having to hold my knees together. My package also included the \\"Mousitizer\\" which is also cheap and small - not really strong enough to support your hand. I guess it's still better than no mouse pad at all. I wish I could get my money back and get something else! I gave it two stars because it was made in the USA - otherwise a zero!

The allegory was obvious and the language better suited to children. The idea of not taking responsibility for ones actions is repugnant to most Christians. Even followers of reincarnation, believe that each new incarnation is meant to atone for mistakes and habits of the immediate past life or a way of bettering one's soul until reaching nirvana or the Christian heaven. It is disturbing to think that this message is being sent to people who might be searching for spiritual solace for the first time. The best I can say about this book, is that it is an amusing little fairy tale with a scary message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauthiful Spiritual Bunny Book!","review":"I ordered this book because it was about a bunny ... and fell in love with it because of its wonderfully spiritual story.

Beware of the hype on the cover of the book--this is not a spiritual adventure--it is an excercise in feel-good philosophy. A good story should have a sense of purpose and urgency, and this book has neither. Ramar and his friends are nothing more than thinly veiled disguises for the author and many others who have no definitive religious beliefs, and who then espouse their empty ideas in a book like this and label it \\"a spiritual adventure\\".

Another surprising song is \\"Are You Ready\\" by Nigel Martinez. It is upbeat and danceable yet smooth enough to mellow you out. Overall, the CD is a great blend of instrumentals and vocals.

This is fitting as Jim has shown that any situation, whether it be time spent with his family or even his daily commute, is ripe for translation and expression with his guitar.

It starts of with Death From Above which is an intro song that sounds like planes are dropping bombs. Their next album titled song, Resurrection, is a fantastic song with great lead vocals and back up vocals and some memorable riffs. Through the rest of the album the songs are what you expect from speed metal, powerfull vocals from \\"Lord\\" Tim are definitly the strong points of this album with great riffs and melodies. This definitly paves the way for A Rise to Power and One Step Beyond.

After the first washing, it lightened up much more than I had wanted, and in addition was very dry and unmanageable. I researched and read the reviews of this product. I used it for the first time this morning, along with Tresemme Colorthrive shampoo for brunettes. I am absolutely delighted with the results. My color is subtle and natural-looking, and my hair is remarkably shiny, soft, and easily styled. I admit I had little faith that the product would help significantly, so I am very, very pleasantly surprised.

It makes your hair feel good, and also makes your hair a little softer. Before I used the product I read some reviews online about it and I agree with some of the people who have said that they felt their hair became oilier after using it. I have found out the best way of using this hair glaze is by not massaging or rubbing it onto your skin. Just touch it to your hair and that's it. However the drawback to this method is you will still have to use a separate product to wash your scalp. So first you wash your scalp with some separate shampoo and then you use this hair glaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!

Over the last year or two I've started getting a few stray gray hairs here and there around my hairline and in my crown that really stand out a lot against the darkness of the rest of my head, so I bought this product, hoping to conceal the grays, either by completely covering them or at least giving them a hint of brown color, so they would not look so stark against my natural color. I used it everyday for almost two weeks and saw absolutely no difference at all in color of my grays. The glaze did make my hair feel smoother, but I have very silky, shiny hair to begin with, so for me, that is not a reason to buy it again.

I would also like to add that it smells terrible! I noticed another commenter stated that it made their hair more red, and I had the same issue, as well.

Years later, I came to know the song was written by Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, and I listened their live recording of the song.

You'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned that it contains many fish/shellfish recipes!","review":"Since the Moosewood Collective is probably the best-known source of vegetarian recipes and cookbooks, I was horrified by the number of recipes containing fish, shellfish, and seafood products (e.g., clam juice). Checking the index for recipes of certain types or using specific ingredients, I was not thrilled to repeatedly find that the recipe in question contained ingredients a vegetarian wouldn't touch.Obviously, this is not a problem for people merely eager to add more veggies and grains to their diets, or for those who eschew meat and poultry, but eat seafood as well as veggies/grains. However, for those of us who had come to equate Moosewood with vegetarian, this came as a very nasty surprise. I wish that the title had read \\"not strictly vegetarian\\" or \\"includes some fish/shellfish recipes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for young mothers who may feel overwhelmed","review":"Bounce Back Into Shape After Baby by physical therapist and exercise specialist Caroline C. Creager (Founder and CEO, Executive Physical Therapy, Inc., Berthoud, Colorado) is an energetic, authoritative health and workout guide designed specifically for new mothers. Individual chapters address exercise guidelines for mothers recovering from vaginal delivery, Cesarean delivery recovery, techniques for managing Cesarean scar tissue, ways to strengthen weakened abdominal muscles, balancing exercise with breast feeding, the value of working out on a ball, fitting exercise into a busy schedule and much more. Bounce Back Into Shape After Baby is a superbly presented and \\"user friendly\\" health and exercise guidebook and especially recommended for young mothers who may feel overwhelmed but don't want to neglect their physical well-being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Postpartum Moms or Anyone","review":"This book was required for the Cortiva Maternity and Infant Massage Specialist course I took in 2008. I don't really have a lot to add to the previous reviews. I think it's great for new moms or for anyone looking to work on their core, especially post-surgery or have other considerations that necessitate they be careful with their abdomen. It has a great explanation for how to reduce scar tissue for scars of all types--not just from cesarean surgery. The author also explains toilet-training for adults--which sounds a bit odd, but it's very helpful for anyone with pelvic floor weakness. The pages are 8.5x11, and since it's been a frequent reference for me I separated the pages from the cover and put them in sheet protectors which I organized into a binder--makes it very easy to copy or take out pages for my own exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee maker we've ever owned","review":"We bought this Cuisinart coffee maker because of the reputation of the manufacturer and it appeared to have all the features we wanted. The coffee tastes okay but the pot leaks. You can never pour the water into the reservoir without quite a bit of water landing on your countertop. Water also leaks from the space between the glass and the plastic water spout at the top of the pot. It is extremely difficult to determine how much water is in the machine after you've added it. You end up with a fine sediment of coffee grinds in the coffee due to the poor filter. We've had this coffee maker for about three weeks and I am about to throw it in the trash. Do yourself a favor and skip this product. I think I'm going back to the Mr. Coffee brand- never had a problem with those and we're big coffee drinkers in this house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, good brew,","review":"Tasty brew in a coffee maker with design that takes less 'visual' space on the counter--especially if used in a corner.

As an idea, it's great. As a play, the dialogue isn't very realistic. The baseball players talk like they're in a Woody Allen movie. Very arty, references to cultural things, a little neurotic. Pro Ballplayers do not generally talk like Woody Allen. The dialogue just took me out of the story. I couldn't believe that real people would talk like that. As a gay man, I bought it because the idea is catnip to gays, but the writing didn't really get me into the action, but took me out of it.

I swore I'd never buy an HP again after the trouble I had with my 970cse, but the most decisive factor was seeing the x83 copy yellow. We took a bright yellow circle (from an in-store promo) and copied it and compared to the HP. The x83 copy came out VERY pale yellow. Otherwise we compared normal colour copies of 3 of our own photos done on x83 and the HP 750. x83 was better in some cases, the HP better at others. The most important was flesh tones. The x83 flesh (white skin!) came out with pinkish hues.

So I reinstalled and it started printing again,for about a week, and then the communication problems again. Called tech support, Rachel told me make sure the printer was plugged into the wall and not a surge protecter. That actually worked, until the next time I went to print.I like the multifunctions of this printer and the pictures did print very good.

It is great for black and white file copies. But printing photos is disappointing 99.9% of the time. If you print on plain paper, they look great. But put in a sheet of photo paper, select the photo paper settings, and you get a mess. On the standard settings the print is waaaay too dark. Or you only get some colors, or you get an odd streak down one section of the picture. Adjust the brightness setting 10 different ways on the computer print window and it still never comes out right. You have to waste 5 sheets of photo paper for every photo that is remotely useable. When we first bought this I scanned a leaf that printed out beautifully lifelike. That was the last thing I remember looking good with this printer.

Contacted 'Support' and their suggestion didn't work.Fax: Not successful so far.Copy: This is the only advantage of this unit.

The third week was when I tried to enable printer sharing over my home network. This printer is not networkable (confirmed with Lexmark Tech Support) which means no printer sharing. It also means that you will not be able to use the new fast user switching ability under Windows XP (also confirmed with Lexmark Tech Support).

I've owned various Canon and HP printers over the years and never even thought that someone would market a printer with drivers incapable of being networked.

Its fast (fastest around for [its price range]), and has great features. The enlargement feature is amazing. You can enlarge to the exact percentage point (136%, 248%, ect.) and it englarges flawlessly. This copier is great. Another great thing is the ability to do standalone color and black copying, because some things like this have to be hooked to a computer to copy, but not this. The printing feature is nice to, I print photos on it and have no complaints, they look like I took them to a developer, when its just my little all in one copier thats doing the printing.

Turns out the power supply is OK, but the printer itself totally FAILED (this is what Lexmark' Techs - 3 different ones - decided) with absolutely no warning!! $186 for 360 pages is a little too expensive for me and that doesn't include the cost of the numerous print cartridge that it used.Of course now I'm stuck with three unopened ink cartridges as well.Nothing else from this company for me.

David Duchovny, and Gillian Anderson were pretty nearly my favorite episodic sci-fi characters ever ( though I also loved the FARSCAPE crew ). The writing on the X-FILES was always so crisp, lucid, and funny- no matter how far out the conspiracy, or how strange the creature, Chris Carter, and crew made me a believer.This boxed set does contain a few extra features, but I can't help thinking there will be yet another boxed set springing up in the near future with the newest movie on it. If you haven't bought all nine of the single season sets this isn't bad.

I can't believe I have to say this, I've been ordering from here for years and years and never had a single problem...until now. Not only was the box horribly damaged due to poor, inadequate packing, but most of the discs were defective. I ordered a replacement, which was sent promptly, and thought that was the end of my troubles. Unfortunately, the replacement was in even worse shape and had just as many defective discs as the last.

As many reviewers here have mentioned, the discs are prone to malfunctioning. Most of the discs I've watched so far (through Season Seven) have had issues during the last 10 minutes of the 2nd episode on each disc. I have a Sony blu-ray player. For those episodes, I moved the discs to my Phillips DVD player - and most of them played the rest. However, a few times I've had to resort to watching episodes on my computer (Mac) because even the older DVD player won't play them. It's inconvenient for me, but at least I have spare players to fall back on. So, I'd say fair warning: You might want to just get the individual seasons - or the bundle of them that Amazon sellsThe X-Files - The Complete Seasons 1-9rather than having to deal with crappy discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs are bad from the factory","review":"As other written the discs are bad from manufacturer.

Every time we start watching a new episode I start to get anxious praying we reach the end without a glitch and when it does freeze up I feel more frustrated by the minute.

The pages are glued rather than stitched, so the book does not open flat, and when force is applied to \\"wear in\\" certain pages, the glue does not hold and the pages begin to fall out of the book. Also some pages aren't printed very well, and the print has a \\"shadow\\".If only I could find this same collection with better production quality, it would be perfect; I regret buying this, however. It's cheaply made-- and I know you generally get what you pay for, but for this same price I got an amazing Schirmer's edition of Chopin's Preludes, Waltzes, and Nocturnes.

The first problem is, when you stick your hand in the unit, it slides all over the place (they should have placed suction cups on the bottom). The lid kept coming off, so we were constantly holding down the lid to keep the unit still. Another problem is that the cards do not stay in place because the unit kept sliding around, so I was rearranging the cards the whole time. When you are playing with a 5 yr old, it is best to use only half of the pieces. The price was not right for this game. I feel like I overpaid about $15.00.

Don't talk about conviction of sin, the need for repentance and obedience to our Lord. Instead talk about mistakes and how we are basically all good people. So many churches, sadly, have become post-modern by clinging to the ways of the world, and THIS is destroying the church. I hope the authors of this book have the courage to now deal with the 'fruits' of their recommendations.

The author has a bad habit of replacing all the \\"his\\" pronouns with the \\"her\\" pronouns -- I see what he's doing but it interfers with the reading of the book.The problems at the end of the chapters are not bad, but the author really gets into legalese and specialized language throughout his chapters that makes reading it a chore as I beat up a dictionary trying to get through it.The glossary is woefully incomplete.Aspen Publishing makes a much superior business law book.Paralegal's Introduction to Business Organizations (Aspen Law & Business paralegal series)"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken book.","review":"The book was totally broken. this person shouldn't be believed.So many writing, perfectly damaged cover.

She replaces the droning background noise with possibly the most incredible band I've listened to since the great days of \\"real\\" alternative. Sickened by the pop-culture infusion in all brands and names in the rock world, hearing something new, different and compelling drove me inside, away from the crowd, to sit in silence in front of the speaker. It drove me, it pulled me, the words richocheted around in my brain, spelling out memories, thoughts, dreams... allowing my mind to float around and still be so tied to my spirit that I knew I had to own it. Modest Mouse has impressed upon me their infinite talent - I know what the MM pixie meant when she said she didn't want anyone to know about them. Popularity still has the word \\"pop\\" in it. I'm down - the beauty of this lyrical, musical genius has magically captured me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat something","review":"I was really looking forward to this release, even though I was completley in the dark about it's nature. I had gathered little rumors and warnings about this band since 97 and had wondered if they could hold up over a whole album. So about 6 months ago I started listening to their albums and wow! I found something special. So when I saw this album coming out I was pleasantly suprised ( and a little tittlated). While good, the problem with this album is it doesn't have the great guitar work for the most part that I was expecting and the harmonies are definetly not working as much as in previous albums ( or more recent, depending on how you look at it). I still think it's a good foot above the heads of other artists, just don't get your expectations to high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bits and pieces...","review":"The Mouse has done us all a favor and a disfavor at the same time! On this album you will find bits and pieces from many of MM's hard to find eps, and all cuts are classics. There's only one new song (the first one) but then again... it's gotta be hard to make a living playing good music in the Northwest! You do get the feeling that they are slyly trying to get you to buy the albums the songs are off of... but man if it works... they'll be rich! And wouldn't you rather your money go to the Mouse for recreational purposes and lawyer's fees than to EMI and Warner Bros. fatcats. I say buy it... you won't be sorry and if your a MM fan you'll just have to drink a few more beers and say, \\"Damn.

The music is loud, screechy, and outright poor. If this is the first CD most people hear from Modest Mouse, than I can see why many people don't find it to their taste.I enjoyed Lonesome Crowded West, The Moon & Antarctica, Good News for People Who Love Bad News, The Fruit That Ate Itself, and many others, but this is just not up to par with the rest of it. Some might find it to their taste, as many reviewers here have, but I seriously recommend trying to borrow a copy and listen to it first before purchasing. This doesn't sound at all like the rest of their music, and I am of the personal belief this whole CD pretty much blows.So beware, and check it out before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"open mic night?","review":"mediocre bar band with an extremely annoying vocalist.all modest mouse music sounds the same to me. here in seattle they cant stop playing this garbage on the radio. its really sad. ineptitude is a played out style of artist statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Building Garbage (Something) Out of Hype (Nothing)","review":"I bought this CD for $1.08 from a church thrift shop and have listened to it several times. Conclusion: I grossly overpaid.This CD is filled with repetitive and consistently bad sounds. Calling this stuff music would be quite a stretch.... tracks 6 and 8 compete ferociously with one another as to which can be more odious and stupid. Track 11 has a few glimmers of quality but, like every other track on this disk, greatly overstays its welcome.Disregard those obscenely misguided 5-star reviews -- they are unforgivably tasteless acts which can only lead more people to buy this horrid record."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TO BE USED FOR CARPET CLEANING","review":"I purchased this steam cleaner ten months ago because I adopted a dog with bad habits, so the cleaner was mainly to clean and disinfect my carpet. Prospective customers of the DeLonghi clean steam cleaner should please take note that THIS DEVICE DOES NOT SUCK UP FILTH. THE DEVICE ONLY SPREADS AROUND THE FILTH WITH A HOT WATER SHOOTING SYSTEM. Please take note that steam cleaners, as I understand them, suck the filthy water back into the tank. Such IS NOT the design of the DeLonghi steam cleaner. It shoots hot water only, but has no sucking action to remove the sullied water. Therefore, this is not, despite many valuable uses--cleaning ovens, toilets, drapes--effective carpet cleaning. I wish I had known. At least I can pass on the warning to potential future customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"After hearing from a friend how wonderful this cleaner was, I purchased it.During the 1st use, I was getting burned by steam coming out of the area where the yellow button is. When I was done, the button was totally out and I was unable to fix it. I called DeLonghi and they said they had to send me a new wand but wouldn't deal with me directly. I called their recommended service center and they said it takes over 6 months to get parts from DeLonghi. It did a good job in the short time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a Real person with a Real Review!!!","review":"I bought this steam cleaner and it worked great on my linoleum floor, but didn't clean well in the bathroom!

I tried emailing him for information to send it for repair and never heard anything.

The setup was very quick and easy. The manual was very clear in instructing how to use the steam cleaner along with it's tools. I ordered this for my mom who saw something similiar to this on the home shopping network and nagged me to order one. The moment this thing was out of the box, she knew right away how to use it because of what she saw on the television. Being pessimistic, I didn't think this thing would clean out any carpet stains because it didn't have a vacuum of any sort like the bissel models. But using only a attachable towel or cloth of some sort, it was able to clean up some of the 5-10 year old stains around my home as well as accidents by the dog which were very difficult to get out by hand. To think I was planning to return it. But after using it myself and watching my mom use it with ease, I think I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT use this on Carpets or Upholstery","review":"Despite the category in which ... places this product, this is NOT a carpet or upholstery cleaner. THIS IS NOT A VACUUM. The unit spits out steam--it has no mechanism for taking up dirt. Using it on a carpet leaves your carpet soaking wet and turns the dirt into mud. Using it on upholstery is worse--how would you get the water out of the couch if there is no vacuum function on this product?The unit heats up water and produces incredibly hot steam. It also spits it out pretty well using the crevice tool. I have used this crevice tool successfully on my outdoor grill, bathtub, venetian blinds, and my car tires. Nevertheless, I still had to go over each of those surfaces with a sponge and soap to clean up the mess that this product leaves behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a difference between steam and vapor.","review":"I guess I didn't do my homework when I purchased this item.

I don't know about others, but buying a costly product sight unseen is a risk & I would like to know that I could get my money back if it didn't suit my needs. Vapor Systems offers no return policy (except if it's nonfunctioning). It also took numerous emails to get them to even address this question.

The Lexmark Z23 cartridges are no different. It is usually ineffective to use the Lexmark's software to clear a major clog. Better to simply remove the cartridge from the printer and set it in a shallow pan of warm water that just covers the nozzles. Soak it for at least an hour, dab off the water with a clean lint-free cloth and try it again.If you like to refill your cartridges and find them clogging more and more often, refill them with just water - you'll be amazed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every one is correct","review":"What all the other reviewers say is true. The cartridge prints nicely; you do get sharp printing and a very dark black. However, mine has clogged and become useless. It has not run out of ink; multiple cleanings cannot open up those clogged jets. For the price, you'd expect to be able to use the cartridge for a few months, but you can't.Advice?

It's a entertaining, colorful book with honest takes on the WWE, current and former wrestlers, and the everyday lifestyle of a sports entertainer on the road. Amy tells her story with candor, especially having to do with all the ups and downs of working in the WWE. She's no \\"company man\\" that acts an apologist for the company she works for. Yet her book is filled with positive stories, she has led an interesting life and is thankful for the experiences she's had. This is the most refreshing aspect of the book, compared to the Dynamite Kid's book, which was very bitter and negative. A highly recommended book, as far as wrestling books go, I rate it only behind Mick Foley's first book, and far ahead of every other one I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this even written?","review":"This is one of the worst books ever written in the now infamous wrestling autobiography genre. I don't understand why Lita wrote an autobiography. What has she done? Its like I broke my neck so buy my book. This is a useless poorly written book about some girl with a man tattoo who stalks punk bands across the story. It is a very painful read. I don't recommend this book to anyone unless you are a fan of punk band stalkers who write poorly.Seriously I understand that it is a new fad to write a book now. People change their socks these days as fast as they write books and some of them are just pure crap. This is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring? Great book?

She is someone who has done a fair bit of living and is prepared to follow her dreams whether it is travelling to Mexico to watch the lucha libre to being a role model on WWE.There is a great deal of anger in certain sections of this book, I think she wrote it while she was rehabbing the neck injury and at times, the pain from the injury became pain in words.This is one of the better wrestling books out there, it is not a classic read like Mick Foley's first two books or The Dynamite Kid's book, but Lita's book is very much worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good","review":"I got this book from the library and it is a lot better than I expected. I've read most of the WWE books and this one was up there. Even though I'm giving it 5 stars for being a great read and very interesting, it's not the same type of 5 stars Mick Foley's books would get. For one, he writes his own books and his life is just plain funny. \\"Lita\\" is a unique person who lives her life on her terms. That combined with the interesting back stage type of stuff makes this a 5 in my mind. I really enjoyed it and have a lot of new respect for Amy Dumas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look into the Xtreme diva's life","review":"Really in depth look into Lita's world before she even though of wrestling... and while she was in.

All the parts are easy to clean, and everything but the base can go into the dishwasher. Nice slippery, tough plastic that your food comes right out of without sticking. It cooks rice as well as anything else, so save yourself the trouble of buying a separate rice cooker. I had a cheap rice cooker that didn't cook the rice well, and broke after about 2 months. Do yourself a favor and get this instead, even if you only want to cook rice.You can also cook beans in a very short amount of time as compared to traditional methods.I would agree with the other reviewer regarding the safety factor; you should know better than to open a working steamer.

The Amazon Editorial Review does this CD no justice. His music, I think, surpasses the \`Stay' CD. The tracks I like most are #2, 9 & 10, but almost all of these songs could be put on the radio instead of the select few they do.It pumps the radio, the vocal chords, and the heart with the message he is singing about.

Just the kind of thing we need to remind ourselves of more often!The truth of the words sung with catchy semi-rock melodies pull you in and allow the listener to close their eyes and just imagine releasing all to the Lord Almight.The quality and sound of the music is top-notch, nothing hokey here. Great mixing.The few times I've dished out money for a CD I've had a rule that I need to really like at least 3 of the 10 songs on a disc.

The album starts out strong with \\"Restored\\" and keeps pushing through the next song. Camp takes it down a bit in the song \\"Even When\\" with a classy string quartet introduction. His next song, \\"Lay Down My Pride,\\" is again back to the rougher Camp sound.

To put it succinctly, it's like a long version of an article in Writer's Digest magazine. Each chapter offers a lengthy (yet basic) description of different specializations but offers little practical advice on choosing one and then breaking into it. (And what if more than one appeals to you? What if they all do?)If you're looking for an overview this book may be for you, but I'd suggest instead buying a book on either nonfiction writing or freelancing that covers specialization in a single chapter (\\"The Freelance Success Book,\\" \\"Starting Your Career as a Freelance Writer,\\" \\"Writing Articles from the Heart,\\" etc). It's all you'll really need and you'll get more useful information for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that's Right on Target!","review":"I have read and re-read this book - most recently with a highlighter and sticky tags. Now I have it front and center on my bookshelf for easy reference. I'm not a newbie writer (10 years as a freelancer), but I was all over the place, and needed to focus. Kelly's concepts have been a big help in that direction.The thing I like best about Kelly's book is that she walks her talk. I saw her byline five times in women's, fitness, and writing magazines during a 30-minute wait in my dentist's lobby. And these are publications that I know are high-paying. It gives me confidence in what she writes about the business of writing.She also has a helpful e-zine (sign up at her Website, www.KellyJames-Enger.com), and does seem like a very nice person, to boot.If you're not getting published as often as you'd like, or making as money as you'd hoped, I'd encourage you to give Kelly's ideas a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it claims to be","review":"Very disappointed in this book. Contrary to it's description, it does not help you develop a specialty of your own, but describes a bunch of pre-existing specialties. The book is really just a collection of magazine quality articles covering the only the very basics of each area. There are entire books written about writing in the subjects of the various chapters that are far more useful as books about writing than is this one. This book could only be useful to somebody who needs the obvious pointed out to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully melodic","review":"It is hard to describe the combined work of three such eclectic artists.

John Hartford always had severe limitations as a vocalist and someone on this album is even worse! This harks back to the days when mountain folk were either \\"pickers\\" or \\"singers\\" but rarely both. \\"Memphis\\" and \\"Maybelline\\" have vocals so primitive in style and so limited in vocal range as to be amusing rarities. I had hoped this talented group would start with great Chuck Berry material and give it scorching bluegrass picking. The treatment here is bare bones and the high point of \\"Maybelline\\" is a jaws harp twang. If this album isn't just self-indulgent, it is mainly for musicians and insiders in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone out there may like this,,,not me","review":"Long time Grisman fan, not a fan of this recording.

This age group loves to collect and compare things (like Pokemon, U.B. Funkeys, etc.) and these Giant Microbes fit the bill. As a parent, I see the toys themselves as relatively benign smallish stuffed plushes. The information tags attached to each microbe give interesting facts about the causes, effects, and cures for each 'microbe,' giving them some educational value. Parents be warned, however - some of the microbes represent ... ummm, mature ... diseases, so be prepared to either divert your child to the more innocent ones (such as Mad Cow) or to discuss with your child why he cannot take his Herpes to school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowabunga!","review":"These silly furry creations are fun for illustrating and talking about different diseases.

You can't read the stupid thing because the design is so bad it absorbs all your attention trying to ignore it. I would offer concrete examples of the design flaws, but there are so many it's overwhelming to even begin. Also, the organization of the book is haphazard.

She ended up buying yet another one when we thought we'd lost the one she had just bought. Both are unusable now, and the oldest one was purchased near the end of 2010, with the other being purchased in 2011. One had a leak where water would get into it (but wouldn't come back out), thus making it useless. On the other one, the bottom broke (though the part containing the mercury was still intact and attached), thus making it useless, also. They're convenient, but they're hard to read and obviously don't last very long. I wouldn't buy another one unless I couldn't find anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I bought this thermometer and after one use the inside fogged up and could not be read.

The illistrations are attractive, the story is fun, but what really got the boy's attention were the holograms. They were fascinated by the images they were seeing.

The reason I use them most is not to solve puzzles or have the game made easy for me, but for the MAPS of dungeons & cities. This guide however has none! I like to keep the map open next to me when exploring an area. It is the first RPG players guide I have ever seen that lacks them. It is not set up the way most are, instead they show a small picture with a paragraph telling you what you have to do in the picture. There are about 10 of these give or take on each page and that't how the whole guide works. I instead purchased a Japanese Grandia guide that may not be in English, but has full maps of each area and symbols next to key items. This is all I wanted in the first place and will work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The Presto works great.

It saves you approximately 15 minutes per pizza as you do not have to preheat an oven. You simply set it and forget it; it dings when the pizza is done. It also functions as a toaster oven for melts, wraps, etc... I recommend California Pizza Kitchen as they have the most diverse selection of Pizzas.

We use it for soooo many things, we even roast our hot dogs on this machine...the turn out just like they would on the commercial hot dog makers. Again this has been in use for 5 years and still is going strong. The pan gets discolored and the non stick wears off but I've still never had a problem with anything sticking. Our Machine started to make a buzzing noise that is very loud and annoying, this started about a 6 months after we received it but aside from the annoyance of the loud noise it's still working and hasn't affected performance.

How do they get the crust to be an even thickness?Second, the pizzas cooked terribly, esp the fresh ones. I followed the suggestions <cooking bottom first> but the inside of the crust was so mushy no matter what I did. The bottom crust was burnt, the cheese and toppings burnt, the inside crust mush...yuck!Even the frozen rising pizza came out similarly. I should have stuck with the oven.

THE DUAL OR LOWER SETTINGS MAKE NO DIFFERENCE.

You can buy a frozen pizza and really decorate it with lots of extras. Each person can customize his own section as it cooks. PLUS, You can make a frozen pizza without heating up your \\"real oven\\", which is great in the summertime. We throw it in the car and take it to our cabin in the mountains. You can even use it in your motor home. BUT, if you have many people to feed the Pizzazz can't keep up with how fast people can eat the first one. We consume pizza in 10 minutes and it takes 20 - 25 min. to bake the next one. HOT TIP: So, keep the first one in the worm oven whilst you cook the 2nd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 3 months","review":"I would have given this a 5 star review, because when it worked, it worked very well.

Am I missing something??","review":"I just purchased this item because my oven has been broken for ages + I prefer to make my own pizzas. The concept of this item is wonderful, but when I got it home and cranked it up I discovered one very major problem. It doesn't cook the center. I made a 12\\" + then another day a personal 6-7\\" and it doesn't cook the center. I tried to push the pizza a little off from being centered so the middle would cook, but then the tray ends up with a serious tilt/slant and that just doesn't look safe. When it cooks the pizza it cooks the first 2 or so inches from the outside very well, but the closer you get to the middle, the less it is cooked. The upper arm/heating element is just not long enough. It doesn't reach over the center of the pizza. So... It appears that I am the only one that just can't see how this will work. Good luck to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pizza w/ pizzazz","review":"i love this thing. This is my second one (only because i accidently broke my last one).

As we had never used it before, we followed Presto's cooking time chart exactly. It took about 22 minutes and we must admit, it turned out beautiful. It still tasted like a frozen pizza but there is no escaping that. I really do like the design with the 3 options for heating, giving us a lot of control of how the crust and/or the toppings turn out. That's something we just can't do with a regular oven. We agree with at least one reviewer in that it would be nice if it baked 14 inch pizzas. It worked great the first time and we look forward to trying other food types now. Based on only one use, we would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Still Works!","review":"I bought this fantastic little machine when they first came on the market about twelve to fifteen years ago. My son loves pizza and it was a convenient way to make a quick after school pizza without heating up the whole house (via oven). My son is now twenty-five years old and has had the Pizzazz Pizza machine all through his college years, four apartments and three cities. IT STILL WORKS! We have used it to cook pizza, heat tortillas, make toast, heat pies, make cheese on toast, and more. This machine is so easy to clean. Most of the time we wipe it with a damp paper towel and dry it off with another and that's it.

I have had 2 total. I used my original about 200 times and it finally wore out. this one is over a hundred strong. Works great for regular frozen pizza, with adjustment to cook on with top (for toppings or rewarm,bottom (for thicker and crispier crust), and both for standard pizza cooking. A huge suprise was how well it does with many of the self rising pizzas, and it may be me, but it tastes better because I think it cooks better. And finally, in the summer, you don't have to fire up the big oven to cook a quick meal.

All of the pizzas turned out great one after another. I knew then that I would have to get one for myself. It is especially nice in the Summer because you don't preheat an oven and therefore the house. It takes a couple of minutes longer than the directions on the frozen pizza box, but still less time than when using a conventional oven with preheating. everyone that eats pizza once a week or more should consider one of these. It allows you to add extra cheese or other toppings during operation to add your personal touch to a premade pizza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza Perfect","review":"I love pizza and as soon as I saw this item I picked one up. This oven cooks fresh pizzas as well as frozen pizzas from the grocer. Once you have one of these, you don't need to follow the individual frozen pizza instructions ever again. Cooking times are listed on the back of the Pizzazz unit, with 10 minutes being the average for most pizzas. Simply place the pizza on the oven, set the timer to 10 minutes, and watch the pizza cook as it rotates. If you want perfect pizza, this is the best way to do it because you have complete access to the pizza while it is cooking. The pizzas I've made with the Pizzazz have come out crisper and more evenly cooked then anything I've made with a conventional oven. This is mostly due to the fact that there are heating elements both above and below the pizza. If you love pizza, you'll love the Pizzazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never can be as good as bought in a restaurant","review":"The Pizzazz Pizza Oven has really improved the taste of frozen pizza. Both sides are cooked and if you want the bottom crispier then leave it cook longer then the top. If you prefer a bottom that is not crispy then keep cooking the top until the cheeze is bubbly but the bottom is also just as you want. To be honest, it will never be as good as buying from one of the well known restaurants but of all the things I've tried, this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energy, time, effort saved","review":"Wew have had our unit for 2 years and are very satisfied, use it more than our toaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my third pizzazz","review":"Presto has done a good job w/ the Pizzazz.

Finally got it & I must say it's everything & more than I'd hoped for. I absolutely adore pizza, all kinds. Frozen are obviously the easiest & often the most economical, but they lack what you want from a really good pizza. With this oven I get the crust just the way I want it & I always add extra cheese. In a regular oven it's very difficult to get the crust & the extra cheese cooked right. This does it effortlessly. Made the best home cooked pizza with a ready made crust & tons of toppings & cheese, it was superb!Haven't ordered a pizza since I got this several months ago, it'll be a long time before I do.

I can say with confidence that I have ordered my last home delivered pizza. Twenty three dollars verses seven, the math and quality of what this machine will do is a no brainer. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added some olive oil to the bottom of the cooking pan that made the crust crisp and added flavor. Here is my tip at no charge to you Ha Ha! throw away that wheeled pizza cutter and buy a pair of pizza scissors or any good pair of scissors and use them to cut your pizza. The scissors will not push your toppings around when cutting hot cheese etc. Gotta go I think my seven dollar, hot crisp crust, melted extra cheese pizza is waiting for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We like this Gadget","review":"Best Gadget we ever bought.

Sorry to dissapoint but many of the 3 star and below ratings are true. My \\"Pizza Oven\\" took almost an hour to warm a frozen pizza and all the cheese still wasn't melted. I think this machine/contraption is best used to warm food that has not touched a fridge or freezer.

We were very pleased to find it at Amazon as we know we can trust Amazon for safe and efficient delivery.

I like to cook DiGiorno's frozen pizza. I followed the directions for the Pizzazz but found that 15 minutes was far from enough to have it be done. It took nearly 20 minutes for it to be done.Compared to just using my regular oven, I like the pizza cooked in my oven. I thought the Pizzazz would be just as advertised but instead I found the inside of the pizza to be pretty chewy vs. crunchy with my oven.I'd save yourself the ~$60 and just have to wait a few extra minutes for your regular oven to preheat. And, you don't have an extra appliance to store. My two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"We liked it so much that we just bought one for our son and his girlfriend.

We couldn't be happier with it. Every pizza turns out perfect and we love the way you can watch it to get the pizza baked exactly right. You can even sprinkle on pizza seasonings and additional toppings as the turntable spins it around right while it's baking. Using the upper and lower element switch made the rising crust and cheese crust pizzas bake just right. There's a handy chart that tells you just how long to use each switch setting. We tried a batch of cookies with it and were just as impressed. They were perfect. She wants to buy one as a gift for others now.It takes little space on the counter and fits nicely into a cabinet for storage. I highly recommend this wonderful little oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot live without it!","review":"We are currently on our third Presto Pizzazz Pizza Oven, having used the first two literally to death. I kid you not when I say that we use this thing every day for one reason or another. Aside from doing wonders for frozen pizza (any kind, even french bread pizza), it is also great for reheating takeout pizza (I think it's better reheated on the Pizzazz than it is fresh). We also use it for making garlic bread, quesadillas, tater tots, french fries, fish sticks, etc. It even cooks frozen waffles better than the toaster. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I cannot live without it (I have a spare waiting in the wings for when this one dies). Here's a hint for reducing the cooking time of frozen pizza: thaw them for 30-60 (depending on the size and type) seconds in the microwave. And to cut down on cleanup, we also put aluminum foil under everything we cook (and we've never had a problem doing so)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza Oven Christmas present.","review":"I bought this pizza oven for my sister who is basically house-bound.

I got one about six years ago and I also own every Pizza contraption known to man. This is the one you've been looing for.Take abvantage of my years of playing with it. It works best with the rising crust types of pizza. You cook the bottom alone for 15 mins and then both top and bottom for 15. A cheap frozen pizza WILL taste like delivery (or really better) TRUST ME - I HATED FROZEN PIZZA before this.I've given a couple as gifts over the years and ALL are still being used (not collecting dust on the gadget shelf) I've bought backups, just in case the old baby breaks down.

Have cooked frozen french fries on it, and there were good. better than the oven, and no grease like frying them.Wish they made a ring to go around the pan, I cooked a hamburger steak on it, turn out really good, but made a mess.

It doesn't cook the pizza any faster than if you were to cook it in the oven, you save time and money because you don't have to wait for the oven to warm up.With the pizza cooking on the bottom, then on bottom and top, gives the pizza a wonderful consistancy throughout.You do have to watch that it does not over cook the sides while waiting for the center to get done.

So what to do until I decide on the stove I want?? This is the perfect solution, and frankly, may never use the oven again for Pizza!This is much better than the oven. We always were getting poor results, too done on the edges, while the middle was not done enough.

Pizzazz is by far the best way you can make a pizza and also to reheat pizza, because having a real stone and brick oven costs much more to make, maintain, and operate. Pizzazz fixes limp-crusted pizza too, because it heats from below. Pizzazz is versatile for many different foods, and far more economical to use than conventional ovens, and requires no preheating time or keeping a door shut. Pizzazz is the best and fastest way to make a pizza. We buy pizza dough very inexpensively at the supermarket and make it how we really like it with our own sauce, etc. and spread it on the pan and this makes AWESOME pizza. The problem is only that we will all want to eat pizza at the same time, so, we bought TWO, so we can make two pizzas at the same time, because the size of the pizza is like a medium. Pizzazz is one of the best purchases we have ever made. It is essential in our kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"Great product in lieu of waiting for oven or toaster oven to heat up.

Isabella and Ingersoll may have their hearts more-or-less in the right places, but they're out of their depth here. They aren't much good with descriptive prose, and without the more dynamic comic-book medium to help them along, they came across as two guys who have spent WAY too much time sampling their own internal atmospheres.And if they're so proud of their work, why aren't their names on the front cover?Nice pictures by long-time Cap artist Mike Zeck, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better.","review":"Call me a traditionalist. But I feel it was wrong to write a Captain America novel which deals with such topics as what happened in Waco, Texas in 1993 or the bombing of the Federal Building in 1995. It's a bit too controversial for my tastes. I wish it could have been a more traditional story with Cap fighting the Red Skull or Zemo, or any of his long time arch-foes. I was also hopeing that Rachel Leighton (Diamondback) who was once in love with Steve Rogers in the comics, would make an apperance, but she never did.

The fact that A&E is pressing the sets by the thousands is unconscionable. The 3rd and 4th episodes in disk 1, for instance, are mastered with offset fields such that they jitter and bob through the entire length. (episodes 1 and 2 are acceptable.) It is hard to advise even a fan of the series to waste their money on these sets. These are some of the worst mastered DVDs I have ever viewed in my life. Series 1 also contains gross technical issues. One can only deduce that A&E cares not a whit for the technical quality of their DVDs. If you can tape these from a TV or cable showing, you will have a far superior copy. It is sad. Not even suitable for viewing on a laptop computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"If you have doubts but loved the upstairs downstairs series do not hesitate to get this one.Very beautiful series.I watch it all the time and never get bored of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upstairs downstairs","review":"The movie was wonderful.

The last episode I watched had large yellow bands across the screen. It was just like watching it on a bad color TV set back when the series was released.

Once again Sarah and Elizabeth are the main players. Elizabeth is unhappily married to an aesthete who shudders at every day things like sex, which leads eventually to her humiliating return to Eaton Place with a baby in tow. Sarah renews her romance with James, the wastrel son of the house, but eventually finds love and true happiness below stairs. James continues on his rackety course and eventually gets packed off to India. Through it all Lady Marjorie remains serene and unflappable. The high light episode of this series is Guest of Honor, which depicts a visit to 165 Eaton Place by King Edward VII. Of course Sarah has to show up and nearly ruin things! This series ends in 1910 with the death of King Edward and the Bellamys and their staff hoping for calmer days ahead.

The book is clearly aimed at adult customers, whether they be Garbo fans, paper doll enthusiasts or students of costume design.As someone who fits into all three categories, I loved the portrayal of Garbo. There are three dolls showing her at different times during her career, and the first two in particular are very life-like. I also enjoyed seeing the development and growing sophistication of costume design from the silent era until the early 1940-s. The costumes from \\"Mata Hari\\" and \\"Camille\\" are especially lovely.My only complaint is a small one.

I was so irritated that I took them back to the store for a refund just to complain.They break right where the flutes turn in to the full shank. The flutes of the drill are not full-diameter, they've been reduced possibly to decrease friction or something, with only a little ridge full diameter. But that reduction in area, in combination with a sharp tip breaking through, snaps bits. I put an old dull bit in and drilled the rest of the barn-metal I was piercing for the rest of the day with only one bit.I'm also irritated that B&D; only makes bits in China now.

But wait, what is that odd smell? Is it the popper? The corn overheating bc it's not popping? Took it out, removed that batch, but another in. Smell became even stronger.So I checked reviews and found that somehow this popper is killing microwaves. Didn't try anything further as I am a pretty positive person, so I assumed I got a dud of a popper and would just return it.This morning I tried to make bacon in the microwave...nothing. It comes on but doesn't cook. And it started making a loud buzzing noise.Obviously the majority has had great luck with this little gadget, but it fried my microwave, which is under 2 years old.

Both of these new poppers got holes and scorched the concentrator cup and melted the plastic lid the first time we used it. This plastic bowl and lid is MUCH thinner than our original.

And you don't need that concentrator cup if your microwave is decently powered (yes, you'll end up with a few more unpopped kernels, but you won't have to wipe off the paper insert). Also, I love adding extra thin pats of butter during the last 30 seconds to get super-tasty buttered popcorn without dirtying another dish.

Less than an hour after using the popcorn popper (which takes a lot longer than the directions told me it would to pop popcorn), I tried to use the microwave again. It would not work. Once it did turn on, the lights in the microwave started flashing and it started making screeching noises. Even then the microwave would only stay on for a few seconds (a max of 7) before it would shut itself off. This popcorn popper destroyed my microwave.

So if you've got Amazon prime and free shipping, you're still adding at least 50 cents cost to each batch of popcorn. Doesn't seem so economical after all, huh?Also, you can't just run to your local store and get more concentrators, so you'll have to think ahead or stock up.

I emailed Presto and received a prompt reply. I thought perhaps lowering the power setting would help but this is the message I received: \\"I don't think lowering the power setting will solve the problem. The popper reacts differently with each microwave. I do have a different power base that I can send to you at no charge that usually gives you good popping performance and more uses from each concentrator.

Subsequent batches have gotten progressively worse, with up to 1/2 of the original kernels unpopped. I changed the liner after about 5 uses (the directions state that without oil it will last up to 20 bowls) and had a bit of luck with the first bowl again, but then the same rapid decline with more use. I'm quite disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto PowerPop","review":"I purchased this popper as a gift for someone who did not like the taste of air popped popcorn and who wanted to control the amount of oil used. This popper is just wonderful. It makes the perfect amount for 2 people and the taste is just great.

I ended up buying another one of these to be used as a Christmas gift because this one worked out so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!","review":"This was a purchase I can review with all positives. The popper delivers so much popcorn,that the cover practically comes off. The directions say to start with 5 minutes, but each microwave is different.

I gave it one star in error - - it doesn't deserve any stars.

It did not take long to figure out that evenly coating the bottom of the popper with kernels and using a fixed popping time resulted in all of the kernels popping almost every time. The drawback is that it uses a paper reflector on the bottom, and while not expensive, they have to be replaced every four to six poppings. One other thing.

I haven't found any way to use it that doesn't result in burnt corn.

I don't write many reviews, but I just finished a bowl from the popper and was wondering if they still made them. So here I am. I'm not sure what the little paper cups do, but I haven't had any for years. Maybe they actually make it better? I put a tablespoon or so of olive oil (or you can use butter or other oil) into the popper and 1/3 to 1/2 cup popcorn. Microwave for a little over three minutes. Amount of popcorn can be adjusted based on how efficient they pop and I suppose the microwave time can vary depending on the microwave. You can eat out of the bowl and clean up is easy. I wipe the bottom out and put into the dishwasher. I am on my second PowerPop. Seems like after a long time the plastic at the bottom starts to crack and leak oil and I may have to get a new one soon.

Going back to the store that had the air popper I orignally bought, I found the Presto Microwave Popper. I've seen commericals for these many years ago, and didn't know they were still being made. Long story short, this popper works great, with most of the kernels popping (very good popped to unpopped ratio). The popper comes with these heating discs that go on the bottom of the popper before adding corn and oil. One disc will last between 12-24 batches of popcorn, depending on whether you use oil or not.

She demonstrates that while women's participation in sports was in many ways beneficial to women, the Nationalist and Communist movements which set these changes into motions were not necessarily motivated by the desire to further the cause of women's emancipation.

In fact, I didn't even know that there was a new album out until yesterday, so I picked it up. All I can say is \\"Wow.\\" These guys still know how to rock. It's straight-forward, hardass rock and roll the way it was meant to be played. I love it. Anyone looking for something a little bit different than \\"Godsmack-metal\\" need look no further. Here it is. No industrial beats, no rapping, no bizkit riffs. Just loud, well written songs by an awesome band. I can't reccommend it enough. If you know the Cult, you know what to expect. If you're a newcomer who has never heard them before, it's more than safe to say that you will like it. You CAN'T go wrong here.

Ian Astbury is one of the chosen great vocalistsof Classic Rock. He still delivers on this CD, a rock siren who shattersthe air waves. I rank him right up there with Robert Plant, Ian Gillen,Bruce Dickinson, and Geoff Tate. Every song shows maturity, withoutstretching his vocal range-- Ian can still put it out there.Billy Duffy is a very under rated guitarist- he creates a wall ofsound, melodic or a metal undertow, at his beckoning. Beyond Good AndEvil stacks up with their greatest body of work, as good as Love orSonic Temple. This is a great rock CD, that deserved better air play.My favorite tracks are: Take The Power, Nico, American Gothic,Shape The Sky, and True Believers. The Cult made a come back albumwith merit. Other bands reform and fall flat on their backs, The Cultshow that they can still deliver the goods. Long live rock n roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album can't wait till the next one!","review":"Great album, heavy riffs, great enchanting lyrics and amazing vocals. GO CULT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STYLISH AND POWERFUL COMEBACK","review":"7 years after releasing the album \\"The Cult\\" - an album that at the time (1994) took me more than 1 or 2 auditions to finally get in to but then on became one of my top-preferences from the band, Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy came back (together with drummer Matt Sorum) and provided us with a new original record. I thank them for that! The album expresses creativity and strength - truly good reasons to justify the return of any band.Being a longtime fan of the band, I was not expecting anything less than good. But even those high expectations were over-passed. The Cult's trademark is here no doubt, but once again they create new and powerful sounding.The album is homogeneous from War (The Process) to My Bridges Burn. True Believers, the only one I heard on the radio, is genuine Cult. My highlights of the album: Rise (magnificent beginning), Ashes and Ghosts (written together with Bob Rock) and Nico, another beautiful song in the discography of this consistent band."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT ROCKS BABY!

It's probably fair to say that most Cult fans are fans by way of the \\"Love\\" or \\"Electric\\" albums. BGE expands the sonic melodies from Love and evolves the raw edge of Electric and blends them together into the 21st century with some modern crunch. It's a dark and loud album that pronounces \\"we're back to rock!\\" Purists of Love/Electric may not like the new sound. But, if you're open to Ian and Billy growing with the times, you'll like the new album. FOR NEW CULT FANS -- you probably like the Cult because of the movie \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\", and the hit song from the soundtrack \\"Painted On Me Bum\\"... I mean \\"Painted On My Heart\\". The BGE album is nothing like this song, and you should run for the hills in fear. I suggest turning to \\"Love\\" or \\"Electric\\", and then maybe you'll be able to handle the sonic crunch of BGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"passionflower","review":"I was trying this to improve quality of sleep and lower blood pressureAfter 2 weeks both things have improved.

When it FINALLY came (took longer than the other 2 items I ordered AFTER on Amazon, but things happen I guess), he read the ingredients and laughingly put it down. OK, so it's 'organic' grain alcohol, but they list it as the first ingredient, water, then passionflower extract (which, I believe, is how the FDA makes you list things, in order of highest percentage first).Not to mention, you have to take 50-60 drops 4-5 times/day.

Gone is the sense of mystery and struggle, in this third book Robinette seems like an annoying Richie Rich character surrounded by exotic Heechee toys and and annoying friends and helpers dredged up the first two books in the series plus a few new ones. Klara even makes a comeback, but it's disjointed, unbelievable and emotionless. Pointless, even; I'd say Robinettes longing and guilt for Klara is best left unresolved. I recommend Gateway (the best) and Beyond the Blue Event Horizon (quite interesting, especially when you figure out what the artifact is and its history), but then stop it there because this book is pretty much a loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the Heechee Saga","review":"\\"Heechee Rendezvous\\" is, for me, the strongest of the the four novels that comprise the Heechee Saga. In this, the third volume, all of Pohl's complex and ingenious concepts and rich characters come together to form a truely satisfying story, as well as set up an intriguing conflict for the final book, \\"Annals of the Heechee\\".

Suitable for both children and adults. There are references to characters from history, film and US politics that kids won't get, but which adults will, but the style is very child friendly. I now have a very happy 6 year old who has 5 DVDs of laugh-out-loud cartoon fun.Shame one of the disks doesn't work (even though new)!

A very good idea for a remarkable album. Unfortunately these are not the original scores, but a rerecording by Paul Bateman and the City of Prague Philarmonic. That's where the problem is. While some of the rerecordings are very good (Vertigo) others are a real shame (Rear Window and North by Northwest). Unfortunately (again) most of the films here presented are not available on their original recordings (like Rear Window or Psycho - two of my favourites).

With tunes like These Boots are Made for Walking, One Mint Julep and Lucille, this album covers a range of musical styles and if you have seen the movie, it brings back some of the scenes vividly.

What they failed to note is that despite the title, little of this is true macro photography - some of it is done with a closeup filter, but not much. Further, and in my opinion worse, is the lack of mention of the fact that most of the digital alteration in Photoshop is done with third party (read commercial and expensive) plug-ins. Sure, the author prefaces this by saying that you can try to get the same effect without them, but just try it - can't be done with most of the photos, therefore making this book worthless in terms of a tutorial unless you spend hundreds of dollars on Nik, KPT, etc plug-ins.

KRITZER TIME resonates on many levels: Benjamin Kritzer, our eponymous hero, progresses through high school, develops more of his talents, endures more losses and gains, suffers more humiliation and embarassment from his Martian family, learns to love, learns he is not alone in the scheme of the cosmos, and comes out a winner.

You're not alone; this beyond mediocre 1997 release directed by Zefferelli didn't have much--except this beautiful and lush score that has at last been recorded on CD. A wonderful, melodic return to '30s-'40s-style movie scoring from one half of the team that brought us the lovely (although not quite as accomplished) Tea With Mussolini score on CD this past summer. Listen for the pre-Titanic melodies readily apparent (and better) on this score."},{"rating":"2","title":"quietly beautiful and a little solitary","review":"The official amazon.com reviewer (Joseph Lanza) is unnecessarily uncharitable. This Vlad-Capponi score is a lovely and sensitive effort, with lush romantic swells interspersed with more delicate touches and an overall sense of very palpable melancholic yearning. And there are distinct allusions/similarities to the famous love theme (by Nino Rota) in another Zeffirelli classic, the 1968 \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\"But even as a stand-alone album, this is enjoyable and in fact quite cohesive. Jane's Theme unifies the entire score - as it should, since it is her story told in her voice. The order of the tracks (it isn't the narrative order) also makes listening to the entire score in one run really pleasant - no awkward/abrupt jumps that are sometimes unavoidable in soundtracks. Lovely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total joke","review":"I was tremendously dissapointed when I received this book.

They are hard to come by because the author is asking his or her reader to accompany them on not one but numerous tales. In some ways a short story collection can be more difficult than a novel, because one bad story might spoil the dozen. Such is not the case with Skin: Stories by literary novelist turned mystery writer, C.E. Poverman. These stories do not inspire, they do not entice, and they do not give any reason to continue on from page one to page two.

Everything But the Girl does a xerox of the original \\"English Rose\\" without out all the teenage passion and innocence to give it meaning. Ben Harper should stick to his dreary Hendrix pastiches, and Gene's cover of \\"Town Called Malice\\" is a travesty. Why I bet they have never even heard a Motown record in their lives! The good stuff includes Buffalo Tom's slowed down romp through \\"Going Underground\\", and Noel's acoustic kereoke of \\"To Be Someone\\", which gives a true sense to the burnout behind the lyrics.

Among the volumes on the bookshelf are, of course, dictionaries (plural), a thesaurus, books on medical tests, and others, but one reference I've found most useful is the NIH/NLM List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus. As someone who writes and edits several different types of medical information, you can imagine the sources of manuscript copy I work with.

It lacks detail in in describing materials and \\"How To\\" guideance. A much better choice is \\"Photovoltacs: Design & Installation\\". Very detailed instructions with examples.

The protective tape on both units I ordered was torn, the the lensor was scratched. Same tear, same scratch on both units.For a high end radar detector, this is unacceptable. I returned both. I strongly recommend you do not buy this radar detector for anyone that expects a new quality unit in new condition. If you would buy a new Mercedes with a scratch on the hood, then the RX-65 is for you. Do not buy this as a gift for a \\"car guy\\". They will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great Until it Breaks... and it Probably WILL Break!","review":"I had this detector for a year, and then one day it decided to stop working. I did a lot of research to try to fix it myself, and noticed that a lot of RX65 owners had the same problem-- it worked great for about a year and then died. I took it apart to fix it, and it is basically I thick block of coned-shaped lead (I guess, for gathering the frequencies) and a a basic PCB.

Yes, it will go off when it senses radar from automatic doors, they all do. Some other reviewers complain that they passed police cars without this detector alerting them but you have to understand that lots of times they're radar isn't on until they see a \\"likely\\" target. I LOVE the automute feature which automatically reduces the volume of an alert to almost silent after four chirps. This is especially helpful for those annoying auto door \\"false\\" alerts. I have experienced excellent range for speed traps especially the officers who just leave the radar on full time. I am very satisfied with this detector and would strongly recommend hard wiring it and using the visor clip. The clip does a great job of keeping the detector out of the way and hidden from prying eyes while I'm away from my vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from BEL.","review":"I have owned BEL detectors for over 20 years now and I was excited about getting the RX-65 to replace my older 985 series. The reviews on this were glowing and said it was tops in the mid-range price line. The features are good and typical and it does not take long to set it up with your preferences. It looks sleek and is simple to operate. But even at top volume, you may miss some signals with the radio on and windows down. This model has reliably picked up the pigs in motion and on the roadside thus far, but it has way too many annoying false alarms. It likes to chatter off \\"K1\\" at many intersections and shopping plazas. My old 985 did not do this and was better designed in my opinion. BEL has taken a step backward with this model and that is not good. It might be time to spend a few more dollars and change brand loyalty for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beltronics Real Road Test","review":"I love this radar detector!! I had a older beltronic model that was out dated but still worked,so I did my research on roadtest.com and bought this shortly after!! I put it to a test two days later driving from atlanta,ga to destin,fl. This detector picked off six hiding speed traps on the way down and eight on the way back!!

Take the pop mode off to reduce false alams/leave on autoscan around town(info from roadtest.com)-this one is a keeper!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Unit","review":"After hours of investigating radar detectors I purchased this one. I am not dissapointed. To be fair this is not my first Beltornics detector. I had a 940 several years ago. This one one has more features and seems to have fewer false signals. It still picks up automatic doors at CVS and Walgreens but with a little practice you can tell the differance between them and the real thing. I am satified with range. I was driving one night and the detector went off on KA band which is DPS in Texas. I did not ever see him\\\\her but I knew that they were there. I am not really a speeder persay but I do believe this device makes a safer driver.The blue LED is the best. It blends in with my dash lights really well so at night it does not stand out.

I bought the hard wire kit so it comes on automatically when I start the car. Well worth the extra money. There have been no false alarms and it does not go off when you pass commercial property alarms. So when it does go off you know that it is real! I would highly recommend over paying $500 for the Escort. Good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy on radar detection","review":"I was having trouble w/my old radar detector and the distance/response. I bought this one bc it had great reviews and had everything on it that I needed. The response time is amazing and it alerts you miles before you see the person causing it. Definately would recommend to buy, worry the cost. I can even hear the warning when I'm listening to my radio a little too loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beltronics RX65-BLUE Professional Series Radar Detector","review":"I have been very pleased with the purchase of the RX65 Blue model. I am running a Valentine-1 in my other car so I can compare. The benefits of the RX65 vs. the V1 is the customizability of the Bel unit, both in terms of sensitivity settings and personalization. I also like the ability to mute the unit using the button on the power connector, which is closer to reach than the unit itself. The windshield mount has been effective too. The V1 is superior in providing the directional signal for the radar being tracked, and the count of signals being received. So there is a tradeoff between the units, but for the approximately $150 difference in price, I would likely buy the Beltronics unit again vs. the V1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beltronics RX65","review":"The Beltronics comes very well packaged with a nice zipper case. The unit itself is very solid and well made, you can tell that from the moment you pick it up. The remote cord is very nice and allows you to mute from the plug in rather than having to reach for the unit itself.Very useful and flexible features for City, HWY and Auto mode. Love to be able to change the display to threat mode which identifies the kind of radar detected and assigns a number to the \\"threat level\\" or strength rather than the bar graph.Unit is very sensitive but not too so in the city. Not too many false alarms for doors etc., but this can also be adjusted to make it less sensitive to these alerts. Often has not given me a lot of warning when approaching a radar source so pay attention and react. Overall a very good unit. Glad I paid attention to the reviews and got one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"Unfortunately, the unit failed on the second day of use. It tries to self-calibrate every time it detects a signal, starts beeping and displays \\"Service required\\". That's too bad as it worked great if only for one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item can't be used after only 10 months","review":"The single star is due to the frustration caused by dealing with this vendor's so-called 'guarantee\\". After only 10 months, the detector will not stay attached to the clip with the suction cups for attaching to the front window. Every time I turn a corner or hit my brakes it slides off the clip and falls on the floor, which makes it pretty much unusable. I contacted Escort (who makes the Beltronics) and they informed me that even though I have had this unit for less than 1 year,I would have to pay to ship it back to them for repairs at a cost of nearly $10. What kind of guarantee is that? I will never purchase another Beltronics/Escort item that can't be returned to a store if it breaks. Thank goodness I kept my old Passport unit to use while I deal with this frustration. This is the last Beltronics I ever purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice messaging","review":"My wife replaced her Valentine 1 with the RX65, and likes the voice messaging better.

Other then line of sight, detection was poor before (I usually saw the trap at the same time the detector sounded).As a company, Beltronics choses to control their sales channel by punishing the user. I bought the unit through Amazon, but from a third party. Beltronics DOES NOT HONOR their own defective product warranty! regardless of where the product is sold - the resposibility for quality falls with the manufacturer, so be forewarned and stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will NOT Honor Warranty Claims from Amazon.com","review":"My Radar detector was purchased January 2010. One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on. I verified it was not the power source or the cable; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on. Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty. I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon.com!!! Even worse, they wanted $79.99 + shipping to fix the unit. Needless-to-say, I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site. I will not purchase another Beltronics product and would advise highly against it given their lack of professionalism in standing behind the quality of their own product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great, worth the price","review":"Never owned a radar detector before but decided to buy one for a long vacation road trip. Bought the Bel RX65 based on reviews here and elsewhere. Used it regularly for about 3 weeks and 4800 miles. Depending on how you look at it, this either saved me several speeding tickets or many extra hours of driving (if I had gone the speed limit). Did not take long to get used to and gave plenty of early warning on the interstates and flat,straight state highways in TX. Knowing limitations of technology, I did not push as much on state highways in mountains. Obviously can't compare to other models but a satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"the more info on the highway the better","review":"This radar detector is a great tool on the highway and in town it has already saved me from the pesky chp's hiding and scanning for fast cars. This unit was definitely more money than the cheap units you can buy at costco or walmart but the added sensitivity and information is worth it. I've used the different quiet modes that don't give that annoying start up every time you power up the unit. It isn't allowed to attach it to the windshield in California so I used a sticky pad and set it on the dash and it stays put fine unless I'm doing twistys at max speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beltronics RX65 RED Professional Series Radar Detector","review":"I'm happy overall with this product. This is my 3rd Bell detector over 25 years. One big disappointment, however, is with the power cord supplied. Instead of the usual \\"jack\\" power connector, this unit utilizes a \\"telephone\\" style plug on a coiled cord. If you want to conceal the power cord by snaking it under interior trim panels, you will have to buy a separate cord kit (around $28). Your only option with the included power cord is to dangle the coiled cord from the detector down to your cigarette lighter/power tap, not a clean installation for this caliber unit. There are some nice new features on this model, like the auto mute and vehicle voltage monitor, along with many user selectable settings. It's been only 3 weeks, but so far I am happy with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good piece of electronics","review":"I bought this one as a gift after 3 years of use (still going strong) with an older edition of the same model. The gift was well-received, and seems to work quite well for him.For mine, after nearly 4 years, the clip mechanism that holds it to the suction cup mount is not quite as \\"springy\\" as it once was ... sometimes requiring some tinkering to make it stay without sliding off. So far, this is the only issue. It has been reliable, functional, and incredibly useful. It has paid for itself many times over.Highly recommended! In the future, I would probably get a more expensive model that integrates well into a modern laser jamming system, since many of the police in my area seem to be switching to laser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile product...died after 6 months...Amazon not an authorized reseller???","review":"Like most of my electronics, I baby them.

Strait out of the box it would not hold the both of the knives in place at once. It will do one or the other, but not both.

For many years I had a cheapo Hamilton beach electric knife and the motor finally burned out but the Hamilton Beach knife was superior quality of the OSTER 2803 Electric Knife. Honestly only use it on holidays for turkeys, ham etc...I will list some of the problems:1. The dual moving blades while cutting will separate and food slices will get jammed in between both blades like the knife is trying to slice two pieces. Extremely poor design.2. The little I've used this knife blades are extremly dull. I work up a sweat just cutting a simple ham.3. Power button periodically will not work. While cutting the motor just shuts off.My daughter bought this for us and didn't know what to tell her after having it for several months in the beginning. Do yourself a favor do not buy this product. Shame on you OSTER ripping people off with this piece of junk. I will definitely go back to Hamilton beach electric knife.Susan G.Sewell, NJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable Enough","review":"With such a low price I was not expecting a heavy duty commercial grade product, however, the first use was also its last.Slicing through two (8 lb. Tri Tip) cuts was too much for it and the internal gears stripped and that was it. I used light pressure so the knife would do all the work too, but it just is not tough enough. If I can't use it to slice beef, I don't need it.I ended up with a $20 carving fork in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster disappointment","review":"I purchased an Oster 2803 electric knife based on the recommendations arising out of an America's Test Kitchen electric knife testing segment. I had previously owned a Cuisinart CEK-40 electric knife with the two sets of cutting blades but it was getting tired after a lot of heavy use and I thought the Oster would be the best choice to replace it. I was wrong. The Oster tended to tear rather than cut sour dough round loaves, a staple in my kitchen, and had great difficulty cutting through the bottom crust of the loaf. It was nothing special on meat and in fact I went back to using my regular cutting knives for carving meat and poultry. I bought another Cuisinart CEK-40 and discarded the Oster and have never looked back. The Cuisinart works great on meat and on bread and cuts the round sour dough loaves with ease, including the bottom crust. I would not recommend the Oster but I highly recommend the Cuisinart CEK-40."},{"rating":"1","title":"oster electric knife-not satisfied","review":"I had a Black & Decker electric knife for years, had I realized how bad the Oster knife cut I would have stuck to my Black & Decker.

Lastly, because I don't want to waste any more time on this night short of walking it to the garbage dump. Meat, regardless of the type (beef, poultry and pork) would get stuck , believe it or not, between the blades. I thought this might have been a special feature, YEAH RIGHT.

Pageant is a documentary focusing on the 2006 contest in Memphis.The fascinating aspect of Pageant is its people. It is always revealing to watch a person who becomes immersed in a hobby. These men have become so enamored of chasing the title that they reveal themselves unintentionally in many ways.The amount of time and effort that the characters devote to the pageant is amazing. Some of the performances in the contest are amazing. The film draws the viewer in so that the viewer feels for the men who do not place in the coveted Top Ten.Pageant is a fun look at a subculture about which most of America knows nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pageant","review":"Like the fact that they followed the performers from beginning to end.

What makes the book work for me is that it is a great story, accented by a superbly detailed world. However, when I say detailed, don't think that this means the book describes every blade of grass for the imagination handicapped, rather its detail lies in things like intricate political intruge and authentic seeming (I have no basis to say for sure) horsemanship. While the conclusion is abrupt, it seems to fit in with the rest of the book so I can't complain. But I still want more, which leaves me with mixed emotions. I know this book is successful bacause it tells a great story, but it also finishes the story and there a very few loose ends to create anything more than a contrived plot for more books. So I can only cross my fingers and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Dull and uneventful","review":"I have rarely given up on a series and I am the first to jump on the big book sets. This book just did not do it for me. I had bought the first 3 and took the other two back.The book is very uneventful and dwells on small details that do not advance the story and leave the tired eyed reader dazed. Way too many characters and location names to keep track of without keeping notes. Add on top of all that mess the story is written in lousy broken English and you have a mess. I opened to a random quote page 396. The very first sentence I read.. so I not looking hard for a bad line. \\"Ill guard your back from any enemy I can see wi' my two eyes and smite \`im wi' whate'er I find to hand, but, gods, I don't like this \`un.

The author's writing style is bad enough to decypher, and add that to the tedious story line makes for the most boring read I have read in a very long time.I got to page 333 and even though stuck in an airport with hours before my flight, I had to put it down and go buy some magazines.

This book from the beginning grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go. The detail is sometimes bogging-down, but waiting to see each Unfolding that Tristen experiences, and seeing how they all come together in the end-- that is this book, this experience.

I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and irrelevant for the most part...","review":"I really have nothing wrong with this book, but to me it seems as if most of the focus is on how this prince should conduct a war. I think it's way too much of a politically focused viewpoint. The whole story and mystery behind Tristen is very interesting, and going into his mind is quite fun, but when it switches back to Cefwyn and his problems, I just groan because it doesn't seem important at all. There is not enough action in this story, and when I sparely come across it, it is written vaguely. And another thing that just screams vague is when Tristen enters his special \\"gray place.\\" It is nearly impossible to visualize anything.I ask myself: is it worth it to read the sequels?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes a bit of patience","review":"Although the story was great it does take patience to get through some of the slower scenes in the book, particularly the first part, in which there are few characters.

One thing I think a lot of readers will wonder about in this book is, Why did Warhol and his successful friends put up with Halston's side-kick Victor Hugo? Victor Hugo was merely a male prostitute that Halston used, then befriended and lived with. And Hugo became part of this fashionable group, but all he ever does is sponge off Halston, insult people and be rude and destructive...But still no one kicks him out of the group? Why did Warhol and his friends put up with this jerk?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at a bizarre world","review":"For anyone interested in viewing celebrities as deities, this book isn't for you.

There is no requirement that an author create likeable personalities or nice interactions, and Barthelme demonstrates that here. Actually, he has gone out of his way to create disagreeable characters, chronically drifting and unskilled. The dialog is banal and jittery, reflecting speakers' shallowness and irrelevance. Characters talk past--not to--each other.Sequences are unpredictable and implausible, as though lives are completely out of personal control. Needing a plotline? Invent your own.

Buy \\"Riddim Warfare\\", buy something else...On the other hand, for what this album does, it is amazing. You take an art-minded DJ in Spooky and mix them with a pretty progressive group that is into art-music and electronic stuff. And you end up with a genre bending brilliance, that eventually becomes enmired in your soul. What does a cello have to do with a turntable? What does orange juice have to do with vodka?

The CD opens up with one of the best tracks on the CD, with a nice bouncey bass line and very nice samples and layering. You might even notice the reference to an old-school drum n bass track, <aka: jungle>, \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\", which is on Speed Limit 140+ BPMs.Then the album degenerates into a mish mosh of ambience and noise with beats that flitter this way and that. After repeated listens, I was able to dig up 2 more tracks that were acceptable. They didn't blow me away and this CD remains basically an EP to me. A CD with 3 tracks and filler.Only the true abstract fan can enjoy this, because there's very little to grasp on to when listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"is there anybody out there?","review":"beautiful, and disturbing; I hope Dj Spooky collaborates with Phillip Glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"um yea","review":"I would review this item, However, after ordering and PAYING for it, SILVERMOON never sent it to me!!!!

But \\"In the Big Band Mood\\" faithfully recaptures the music in new recordings by Michael Maxwell and his orchestra, and their rendition of what I consider to be one of the most perfect pieces of music of all time - \\"In the Mood\\" - is excellent.

Murali Coryell (the son of famous jazz guitarist Lary Coryell) has it all. I'll match his voice with anyone and his guitar playing's right up there with Stevie Ray and Buddy Guy. If you're into the blues, you MUST get this CD. If you're into soul, check out \\"Sexual Healing,\\" Murali's cover of the Marvin Gaye classic. No hit or miss tracks here, they all pay off.

This is all new material, so you'll be getting familiar as you go along.The voice is pure gold...I am not a country fan, but Allison is not really a country singer, though she is billed as such. She is too rock for country, too country for rock, and has more than a hint of jazz/blues thrown in. (All true of her big sister, Shelby Lynne, as well). Therein may lie her problem; she's tough to classify into one genre, thus isn't better known in any.I'll make it simple; grab this record and fall in love.

After listening to the first 3 or 4 cuts I thought they possible had labeled the CD wrong. I then continued to listen the whole CD 3 times trying to like it but instead liked it less each time. The song were sad, depressing and did not lend themselves to showcasing her voice. Those of you who know this artist will agree she has one of the most beautiful voices ever recorded. Maybe she needs to get out of the Big Apple for awhile and return to her roots in for inspiration.

Margaret Allison and Mariah Stewart tell fairly ho-hum stories about creative, artsy types going home and falling in love, one with a (supposedly) unconventional doctor and the other with her first love, with whom she had lost touch through a lame misunderstanding--don't you just hate it when these people don't TALK to each other?The star goes to Stef Ann Holm for \\"Jolly Holly\\"; though not a total classic, this story does introduce a handful of very memorable minor characters, especially an intriguing couple of \\"elves\\" named Yule and Tide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Hot Hot!","review":"This book was nothing less of what I expected from Ms. Deveraux.

Charecterisations that Narayan weaves for Rosy and Raju are just brilliant. The high point of the book is I think the transformation of Raju, unaware to himself, into a sort of hermit from the guide at the railway station that he used to be.This has come off so beautifully in the book. Quite worth putting your money into. The book was also made into a highly successful movie by the same name staring Dev Anand.

She kept pushing it over the side, and I couldn't get it positioned well so that she could reach it. Even when it was on the floor, though, she didn't play with it. I finally put it up in the closet. A few days ago, she discovered it again (she's 21 months now) and wanted to play with it. She looks at it for 3-4 minutes at a time and then is through with it. It was a pricey toy and definitely was not worth the money for us.The one good thing I can say about it is that if you can get it positioned well, it really could be a good car toy because all the pieces are soft.

I thought it was a great idea for in the car seat. The product is not designed for car seats or any stroller I have come across yet.

I got it to help entertain him in the car ~11 months but it only frustrated him with the poor attchment sites. He kicked it off quickly. At home, as he has gotten older, he occasionally picks up the phone to \\"talk\\" on it but since there are few noises, he got bored quickly. He's almost two and it just kept collecting dog hair and dust on it. I tried attaching it in his crib which secured better but he ripped it off too.

This flooded the walk and washed out the garden bed underneath the waterfall.Bought these from Amazon b/c the local big box hardware store only had the product in the color brown - we wanted white.

I asked my brother and he said a spring had broken. And I wasn't even doing any thing rough with it! Kind of strange. Maybe I should have rated it less, becuase it doesn't have a hat, can't twist and only has 4 buttons (plus the little precision button).

Difficulty was experienced loading the software. After being on hold for about 1 hour on a non-toll-free call, a technician solved the problem in minutes. They obviously were familar with the bugs I encountered. Then, in scanning a 35mm transparency at their stated highest optical resolution of 1200dpi only mediocre quality was obtained. When enlarged on the screen in photoshop to 100% these scans had unacceptably poor quality. Soon thereafter additional scans developed multicolor streaking which rebooting the computer and scanner failed to fix. This problem is not mentioned in the manual or on Umax's web page. I'm returning this scanner to the store where I purchased it and looking to another scanner mfgr in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boasts more than it does","review":"We returned the UMAX 3450 because it (the company) boasts more than this scanner can perform. First, as we found and as website reviews confirm, the UMAX 3450 CANNOT SCAN negatives. Every attempt produced horrible results! Second, reaching their technical support is a joke. Our guess is that the company must be on the brink of bankruptcy. After waiting OVER 1/2 hour on a NON-toll free call accompanied by continual promises that \\"the wait will be no longer than 3 minutes\\", that \\"only a moment longer\\", that \\"someone will be right with you\\" we finally hung-up.

I have sent pics to websites, I can scan photos, magazine articles, negatives, etc. An added feature is being able to make copies.

You are not going to find JRR Tolkien depth, but enough story and character to make it worth watching, expecially if you have children to watch it with.

No extras, but for less than 20 dollars you get a few hours entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent brief book.","review":"A great concept for a series, I have read several of these album-books, and particularly enjoy the diversity of prose. \\"Ramones\\" is one of my favorite albums by one of my favorite bands. Nicholas Rombes describes the zeitgeist of the mid-late 70s with his book. Unlike so many boring books and films about the era, Nicolas does not default to hyperbole about punk saving the universe. Instead, the author paints a picture of why The Ramones were an interesting band and how they fit in to the cultural landscape of the 70s. I started reading this on a plane and found myself devouring it within a couple hours and wished that it kept going. I got the sense that the author has a deep appreciation for this simultaneously perfect and flawed band, and put a great deal of heart behind each paragraph. I don't know anything about Nicholas Rombes, but I sure hope he continues writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1-2-3-Poor","review":"There are so many wonderful books in the 33 1/3 series. This isn't one of them. Crushingly repetitive, this essay about the 70s punk scene offers little beyond name-dropping, back-patting and self-indulgence. To paraphase a quote from the book: \\"There's nothing going in, there's nothing coming out.\\" Oh, and did I mention that maybe 20 percent of the book is actually about the songs on the Ramones' debut album. You'll find out just as much about Lester Bangs. May as well put him on the cover. Just rancid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emm Gryner Makes Me Proud to be Canadian!","review":"I cannot promote Emm Gryner enough. Sheer talent has propelled her and I am bewildered why her songs aren't given more airplay. Her songs are beautifully crafted and on her latest album, \\"Asianblue\\", she incorporates techno beats on top of her excellent piano and vocal skills. Her lyrics are very catchy, her melodies highly emotional. In fact, it was this very album that got me through a very disappointing break-up.My favourites on this album are Symphonic, Beautiful Things, Lonestar, Christopher, and East Coast Angel, although I love all of them. While there are techno dance beats on some of the songs, Emm has many songs that are happily reminiscent of her previous delicate songs with just her voice and the piano. She is an artist that never ceases to excite me with her music. As I said in another review, Emm Gryner is Canada's \\"Hidden\\" Gem. I can't wait until her next album!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you want real gangster rap skip this","review":"scc, scargface, wc, mc eiht, spice 1, brotha lynch, c bo is hard but this is just morte trash get this to hear akon, and t pain sing the hoks if nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strickly Hood Music","review":"i listened to the reviews, the samples, and wasn't impressed, but until you have the CD and listen to the songs, he literally put his life on a CD..... i been in similar situations, and this cd hit home wit me, especially the \\"runnin ma momma crazy\\" track, simply put, everybody is entitled to their opinion but if you haven't been in a position like what he talking about or been around it, I think you could'nt truly appreciate the lyrics..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad poetry to bad music","review":"the only talent demonstrated on this album is the artist's unique gift of being offensive and angry.... bad poetry to bad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"EHH..DISAPPOINTED","review":"With all of the hype around Piles i thought that this CD was gonna be hot.

This movie is missing about 2 fight scenes that add nearly 10 minutes. Two fight scenes mean too much missing. Some of the action in the finale was deleted also. Where would a Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Hong Kong action film be without numerous fight scenes? Some of the music has been changed or taken out that enhanced the mood of the scenes.

They play brothers in the film, not much unlike Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in Rainman. There is very little action in this movie, it is more of a drama. In fact, I don't even think Jackie cracks a smile once in this movie- it is kind of a tear-jerker, relying more on acting than action. If you are looking for the typical Jackie Chan comedy and action, look elsewhere. It is worth having if you are huge fan, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a good action movie, but good all around.","review":"This is a poignant look at the relationship between two brother of which one is mentally handicapped. I thought that Crime Story was the only movie that showed Jackie's acting talent until I saw this one. Sammo Hung is very good also. Basically Jackie plays a cop whose aspirations are put on hold by his brother who he must look after. Eventually his brother gets mixed up in his work ends up being held hostage. The story is exceptional and still leaves room for a mesmerizing fight scene at the end, in which Jackie take care of his brother's kidnappers.

Bill Elms' liquid guitar lines create a mood that's languid and elastic, like a hot summer afternoon. Not a bad evolution for a band that originally formed with the intention of playing weddings.The opening track, \\"A Place in the Sun,\\" is elegant and lazy. \\"Siempre Que,\\" a lovely, lyrical offering, is artfully peppered with subtle percussion. The CD overall is gorgeous and retains FODM's characteristic eerie howl, but I do kind of miss the rough exuberance that infused their first album.In general: marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transition","review":"Transitioning from the loungy Burns/Convertino era to the melodic Semple era, this album (along with its immediate successor Wichita Lineman) represents the band's short-lived heavier phase. Despite a couple of gorgeous tracks (\\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Broken Bell\\") A Place in the Sun comes across as a post-rock album, reminiscent of Explosions in the Sky. The opening and closing tracks tend to ramble a bit, forsaking their brilliant main theme. With too many composers, the album is a patchwork rather than a cohesive concept album, and a couple of tracks (\\"White Lake\\" and \\"Summertime\\") should have been left off entirely. Nevertheless, it's worth getting the album just for tracks 1, 4, 6, 8, and 11. It's worth getting for \\"Broken Bell\\" alone.

Though the premise was interesting (Mooney is very knowledgeable about technology), Mooney falls short in the psychology department. His characters lack convincing depth and detail, and I felt like I was reading a novelization of a Hollywood movie. The fact that he took a couple chapters to describe a parachute jump didn't help.

She was smart in that respect.I found her writting skills to be not very pruient or exact in their emotional tone. I had the impression she was someone who did not have much of a sex life herself. The cover is excellent and again i was disapointed in her skills in this material as i have been with other writters in arousing interest.This field is very difficult to write on due to the wide range of views on the subject of erotic art.

In fact it makes me sick. Are you that twisted to think that an old man exposing himself to little girls is erotic?? Or the father 'caressing' his little girls. That's not erotic, that's a parent molesting his child. Disgusting!!!!!! Don't waste your money, or your time with this book. It's rather quite disturbing, unless you're the sicko that likes incest and petaphyles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative erotica","review":"Well this is a collection of erotic tales, a fare share of them circulate around lesbianism and impotence themes. In the books introduction Nin describes how she is commisioned to produce these writings with her friends and thus become a madam of a literary house of prostitution. Well the books daring words doesn't help to make it much interesting, on the contrary it reveals a stunning lack of imagination and talent. One really gets the sense of that the sole reason why Nin rose to intellectual fame, was her good looks. And thus she was able to arouse the interest and patronisation of lewd partners in intellectual Paris and New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"fancy porn","review":"How on earth Anais Nin got to be so popular is beyond me. Her storytelling skills are poor and her style self-indulgent. (Unbelievably, her diaries are now being \\"taught\\" in some college courses. Go figure.) If you like stories about incest, pedophilia and sexual arousal at public hangings, then Anais is for you. Call this erotica if you like, I call it porn. Look elsewhere for hardcore jollies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegantly sensual","review":"I adore this book. It's really erotic, but tasteful and refined; it also is cleverly written and sensual, so much that you'll be transported into the stories.

I also reccomend Anais Nin's diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"This is a very compelling collection of short erotic stories.

These cats are several brothers, as the title suggests, led by Pablo Lebron, one of Salsa's best voices.The earlier works by this band are mostly boogaloo tunes, oftentimes \\"Latinized\\" covers of rock songs. This is the sort of music that is nowadays coveted by record collectors and addicts of \\"Northern Soul\\", but it has surprised me who often this group has ignored one of the more important groups of the Boogaloo era.For fans of salsa, I recommend some of this band's later albums, such as the spectacular \\"Salsa y Control\\".

It is a contemporary story about Joe, a young teacher, living in Nebraska, who decides to take a short vacation to South America. It is there that a simply cup of coffee changes his life. While enjoying a cup of coffee in a small café Joe learns that this remarkable coffee is grown in the nearby mountains. It is the journey he takes up into the mountains that that changes his life. There he meets Miguel, a coffee grower, who teaches Joe the old way of growing coffee. Joe, after learning that the people who reside in the mountains can not read or write uses his ability as a teacher to help them. There are beautiful woodcut illustrations, by Belkis Ramirez, through out the book that enhance the story. I enjoyed reading a book set in South American; it was interesting to read how the coffee was harvested in the old way to maintain the outstanding flavor. Overall it is a short and good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a novel?","review":"I guess I really don't get this book. It was meant to be a \\"go green\\" story about how coffee is and should be produced. That part I get. But the writing seemed simplistic and offers no insight whatsoever into the characters. It is simply a Dick and Jane book. Now I have read another book by Alvarez and enjoyed it immensely and I realize this simple style is what the author intended. But the language is not creative in any way and just seems cobbled together to lead to info at the end about the plight of Dominican campesinos and merchandise info at the end that sell the organic brand of coffee beans the cooperative owned by Alvarez and her husband. The story in and of itself is not literature in any way. had alvarez used her considerable literay skills to craft a 300 page novel on this topic with character depth and advanced plot, I would have loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Der Zug war Puenktlich","review":"Dieses Buch war sehr kurzweilig zu lesen!

Allison Moorer's rendering of \\"Back street affair\\" is simply awful. Dwight Yoakam sounds like he is doing a parody of.....Dwight Yoakam, and about half of the other singers just try to mimick Webb Pierce's (unimitable) singing style. Most have chosen songs that do not fit their voices, and even George Jones has lost his \\"soul\\". There are few instrumental efforts that deserve any notice - even Weldon Myrick's steel playing sounds uninspired. And so on...

As others have stated you have to read some paragraphs several times to understand what the author is trying to say. It is obtuse to the nth degree. An example: he uses the words \\"Anatolia\\" and \\"Levant\\" without defining them anywhere in the entire book. I learned more from looking up these words online and reading about them in a miniscule fraction of the time I've spent reading the book. The maps are atrocious.

It gives then game a life like expeiriance when you say something to the Seaman and he either back talks you, compliments you, or even asks you a question. Athough the graphics are very good the perspective is that you are raising a flying fish that floats in space, but with the cons there are many pros.

Everything you tell them, you pretty much have to repeat a few times and it can get annoying. Also at first you tend to run out of food causing your fish to die off a few times but you will get the hang of everything after a bit.

This was true until I downloaded the software from their website. It works perfectly now with the 32 and the 64 MB smart media. I didn't give it five stars because the file transfer is slower than I thought it would be. It takes about 15 to 20 seconds to copy 1MB. Still, this is much faster than the serial cable, and much more convenient. No cables lying around, and you can turn the camera off and not drain the batteries while you transfer the pictures to the computer.

No remastering, no officially manufactured product--and something that collectors hate most of all...a format that has a very limited lifespan. All at the inflated price of the real deal. Based on the titles this 'archives' series is releasing, the studio clearly knows people are searching for these titles, but they just want to take the cheapest route to make money off them--selling you something you could make yourself if you have an old copy on VHS and a recordable DVD player...Even more insulting is the fact that, now that the remake has been released, WB has re-released this as a 'special edition'.

I can easily see how this film could stick with people, especially if they saw it when they were young.I didn't get a chance to see this on television, and in my pursuit of decent creepy movies, picked this up. It won't be staying in my collection. The bulk of the reviews here are based on nostalgia and not on any real content.There is very little, if any plot, no explanation for what's happening and it simply lacks the depth of story that I would have expected with such strong reviews.I thought this dvd would sit next to Burnt Offerings, Legend of Hell House and others in my collection.

Save your money!!","review":"This is so regularly incuded in lists of the best/nost frightening horror movies ever made that I HAD to see it.Having watched it now, I can only assume that those people raving about it are indulging their Inner-10-Year-Old.Bad writing, bad acting, a really laughable premise, silly voices and little critters that look like wooden dildoes in bear suits might have made for chilling TV in 1973 (although I suspect the TV news at the time was way scarier) but they simply can't cut it today.Sometimes cherished childhood memories should stay that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proves that you can't go home...","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I saw this movie as a teen and thought that it was really something. After viewing the remake, I wanted to go back and re-visit this original version. What can I say? It would have been better to have left this in the past -- it was 110 minutes of pure boredom! There is no story here; in the remake the film explores what the creatures are, where they came from, etc. In this version the homunculi are in no way explained. In addition, the writing is poor, the acting is even worse and parts of the movie are so dark (color-wise) that you might as well be listening to the radio!The remake of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is in every way superior. Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Re-Make is superior ... in every way.","review":"I was at odds after watching this film. I bought it based on how much I loved the Re-make that came out in theatres this past year. While not that well written or acted the film felt creepy and had a beauty to it that only certain films ever obtain. This original film has none of the elements that make the re-make worth watching. I was let down by all elements of it and was quite sad to see that I had believed to much about the hype of this film. ... Mind you I am a lover of Seventies horror films, so don't believe for a second that I'm just some punk kid that \\"doesn't get it\\". The Original Wicker Man film, The Blood on Satan's Claw, Don't Go In The House, The Devil's Blood, The Brotherhood of Satan ... these are masterworks which I cherish! ...

DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is yet another example of fantastic 1970s TV horror.

( also the other TV movies we were terrified of being, Lets scare Jessica to Death, and Gargoyles) I know that when you see these movies now a days they seem a bit dated, but the movies didnt have the computer generated special effects they do now, which in essence means everything is fake or false. back then you had to create things with make up, lighting, mood, music and good acting. This movie delivers on every aspect. It scared the heck out you, with those demons coming to get the poor victim, and knowing how shes feeling with no seeming way to get out. Dated or not, I think younger and older viewers alike will appreciate this creepy little psychological drama, it still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, so I say give it a watch, and remember how movies SHOULD be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Years Since I've Seen It","review":"I haven't seen this movie since it's original airing way back in 1973. And I didn't even see the whole movie, just bits and pieces. But to this day, I cannot sleep with any part of my body hanging over the edge of the bed, for fear that the little guys were gonna get me.While I do have this movie on video, I'm hesitant to watch it, for two reasons.1) That it'll creep me out all over again, and I'll never be able to sleep ever again.2) That it'll fail to live up to what my memory has it being, and that a great (albeit frightening) memory from my childhood will be ruined.But judging from others reviews who've seen it recently, it sounds like it will still stand up.Not really a review, I guess. But I wanted to post my feelings and memories on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky Fun","review":"I saw this movie on television when I was seven and it stayed with me all these years. I just had to have it so my son, who is 12, could see it. I thought that he would think it was \\"cheesy\\" since it was made in 1973, but it not only held his interest, it spooked him almost as much as it did me some 29 years ago.

It is the silliest film I've ever seen. No scarey bits, I even laughed when they revealed the antagonists. This should be in comedy not horror. Also the quality of the film is really bad on a plasma screen. Sorry guys if you are after a good horror film this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"I just saw this movie and thought I had seen almost all the 70's horror flicks but this one must have slipped by me. I'm sure that when this movie was made it would have been scary, especially to a young child but at my age I just recognize it for what it is, a classic genre horror film. I am envious of people who saw this as a kid because that's when these types of movies are best and they do stick with you. I have a friend who saw this at age 10 and he said it scared the heck out of him. However being as I saw the Excorcist at age six I can't say this one was anywhere near that experience. Overall I thougt it was a good flick for a stormy night. Thumb's up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor DVD quality","review":"I was very disappointed when I watched this DVD.

What a great classic, and bound to become one of yours! This is not a B movie but a class A of it's time of making around 1973. An absolute must for a horror movie lover like myself. 10 popcorn kernnels or 2 thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, if half-hearted DVD release","review":"This movie does hold up as long as you remember it for what it was, a creepy, gothic, B-movie. It is very atmospheric (got to love the creatures angrily whispering that they HATE \\"her\\"), and it doesn't try to do too much (nothing too over-the-top, flashy or violent, which i hope the remake holds true to.) A very unassuming, pleasant surprise of a horror flick. If you don't expect too much from it (a good rule of thumb for any movie), and you are into this genre, you should enjoy the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPOOKY","review":"This is a classic horror film you must have in your collection. An unsuspecting new owner releases the little onion headed demons walled up in the basement. They desire to take Sally Farnhem into their dark world and wont stop haunting the house until she joins them.Good old fashion cinematography prospective gives the tiny demons a grainy mysterious feel. That's the extent of the special effects here basement bargain but relies more on suspense and tension than tricks.Haven't seen the new version with Katie Homes (who cares) but I find it interesting that no-one has any imagination any longer, they just remake a classic and don't care whether it is good or bad just as long as it makes a profit. Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Ten on the Scare Scale","review":"I remember watching this movie with my older siblings back in the late 70's. I was mostly terrified because the lead character \\"Sally\\" shared the same name as my mother AND we also had a very creepy basement.

For that alone, it gets 5 stars, it messed this kid up good."},{"rating":"1","title":"**1/2 stars for this '70s Guilty Pleasure","review":"This had some creepy moments when new, but even then I found it hard to ignore that '70s made for TV \\"cheese factor\\"; lousy sound, poor plot & dialogue, hideous wardrobe...stop me at any time! I have to agree with the reviewer who said most of the reviews here are based on nostalgia rather than content. This one did look a lot better back in the day. Still, I would recommend DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK to those who yearn for 60s and 70s Horror. You could do a lot worse. Note: This is an on demand product. The picture quality looks like someone burned it from a grainy old VHS copy. A remastered version may elevate the rating to perhaps a shaky *** stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - DO Be Afraid to Purchase.","review":"We were so excited to get this movie in the mail. With great anticipation we popped it into the VCR to show our children 12 and 15 an important piece of our childhood. The quality was so horrible that you could barely see the image. It was dark and washed out. Any scenes that were in low light (most of the movie) were not visible. I understand that this is not going to be high quality tape and certainly not hd!! This was just not watchable. It almost seems like it was a tape...of a tape....of a tape. There was no label on it and the case was just a blank black one. Almost seems a little shady. There is no way this was a video made by any studio. It said that it was in \\"great condition\\". Hardly.

The sound kept getting high and low.Very annoying.As I read further reviews, I did notice that these dvd's are copies and they pay little or no attention to quality and detail.

For the most part the print is very good, and there are a couple spots that could've been \\"restored\\" with a little effort; but it is completely watchable. If you want information about the film the \\"audio commentary\\" is a complete waste of time with very little info and way too much juvenile chatter so my advice is to avoid this; it is so bad I wonder why they bothered to pay those involved. So just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the flick and skip the \\"audio commentary\\" as it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie has scarred me for life!","review":"So being an 8 year old at the time this movie was shown on TV, I probably should have listened to my older sister and gone to bed, but being an 8 year old I knew better.

I was scarred out of my mind but couldnt tear myself away. after the movie ended i crawled back to my room and got into bed, of course I couldnt sleep and then I felt the strangest thing. The covers were being pulled off my bed!!!!! now after watching this movie you all know that these little creepy guys do that kind of stuff so i let out a scream, sat up and found my sister had crawled into my room and was doing this to teach me a lesson. Well all these years later I'm very close with my sister but have never forgotten this movie or what my sister did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Afraid of the Dark - Too dark","review":"I remember this movie freaking me out when I first saw it many years ago and I know that when revisiting stuff from childhood as an adult, things aren't always as scary or as good as one remembers. Having said that, I felt that even though it still had some of that creepiness that I remember, this copy was so dark that you really couldn't see the creepy crawlers unless the camera closed in on them and in some scenes could not see Kim Darby at all.

Thankfully the folks in Europe have partly helped the situation with this issue of his early Columbia sides. This is Tucker at his freshest before the mannerisms that inflict most singers started to take hold of him. Here is hoping that the folks at Preiser Records will also issue his fantastic Cav/Pag from the early 50's and the English-language MET recordings he was involved with. As for sound, I was rather surprised. It is the typical slightly constricted early 50's mono sound, but no pop, crackle or obnoxious tape hiss to detract from the performances.

What does matter, unfortunately, is the stiff, unyielding conducting of Leinsdorf and the trumpet-like bawling of Tucker. both are so bad that it is hard to listen to this set anymore, especially with so many fine alternatives around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Elemental Masters Book","review":"My favorite book of this series, which is why I replaced it when my first copy wandered off. Particularly appreciated the reminders of how women were treated in the not so distant past and of the courage many of them displayed in demanding changes. Don't worry, you won't be preached at! It's part of the story, but there's plenty of adventure, suspense and some light romance. OK for teenagers, but too scary for kids and anyone afraid of snakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medicine and Magic - A suffragist's cup of tea","review":"I was a bit surprised by the negitive comments on Lackey's latest. Maya's character - a female physician treating London's \\"ladies of the evening\\" to make ends meet and still minister to the poor - is quite new. I thought the crew of animals was a bit overboard but I enjoyed all the other characters. I felt the bias and conflict within both the London magical and medical establishments was well portrayed and accurate - for a fantasy. The Sayers reference and the incidents of the deaths of suffragists due to forcefeeding strengthened the book. Development of the romance was a bit weak but otherwise a good effort. I would be interested in a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"I'm a huge fan of Misty. I loved all her Valdamar books so when I saw this book on the shelves of my nearest book store, I was more than excited to buy it. Being from an Indian background myself, I thought I would love a story from Lackey that combined Indian and Western beliefs together. I never thought I would hate this book.I don't understand how any publisher can let someone publish a book without checking to make sure that there is accuracy in the writing. I can't believe she would write about Indian culture without having done any research. Examples: The language Indians speak is Hindi, not Hindu which is a person who follows the religion Hinduism. Surya is a male god in Hinduism and no Indian would ever name their daughter that. That's just two but I could go on and on. The whole story was very inaccurate and it stopped me from reading any farther.This book by far was the biggest waste of my money ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Going Down Hill","review":"I have been reading Lackey for years now. While I have enjoyed her Valdemar Series (at least the first six books of it) and the first couple of her Bardic Circle series she seems to have run out of things to say. Her previous effort involving the 'elementals' The Fire Rose was very entertaining. I find this one contrived and wan in comparison. I had high hopes for the 'second' book in the series, figuring she would still make the effort to tell a good story, but I think she's getting tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Books...","review":"I think that the other books in the \\"series\\" are The Fire Rose, The Black Swan and The Firebird, but I am not sure. This is a great book, as are the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book she's written","review":"I really luv Misty, but this book was a real let down. She has 3 novels running @ once, and doesn't have enough space to finnish them all. The sufragettes are on once, she is taught once, and she falls i luv w/ Peter after the 4th time they met. The end was pretty exciting, but it came to a stop when you didn't even know why the goddes closed her eyes to Shivani. It also contradicts the Suffragette theme that Maya declares herself her man. I really didn't like it. But the person who said the events were wrong, Misty said in the inside cover, some of the events were going to be not the write time, look at the inside cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Miserable effort...Couldn't the author do better than using thinly veiled half truths and lies about Hinduism in order to write an original novel? As a Hindu, this book is offensive because by inference it links Hinduism to negative and evil actions - even in a fictitious setting. Taking Hindu diety names and tailoring them by hypenating them and changing a letter or two is just plain lazy...Looks like the Wellspring of originality and creativity may have dried up for M. Lackey...This one really stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a low 4 stars, but a nice read","review":"This book is just slightly under the quality of Fire Rose which is set in the same 'world'. But it is not as good as the Magics *** series although it is better than Brightly Burning. The setting and concepts of Serpents Shadow and Fire Rose as retellings of classic faerie tales is nice but there were some inconsistances between the two books (two firemasters in the same house?!). It is a very nice read, light fantasy with a touch of romance, but over all this book just does not have the impact or punch of Misty's truly great books. Read it, especially if you like Misty's work. But if you are just starting to read Misty's stuff start with the Heralds of Valdemar: Magics Pawn/Promise/Price or Arrows of the Queen/Flight/Fall series - they are the best work she has done.my ratings: 1-don't bother, 2-get it from the library only, 3-read it, 4-buy it, read it, 5- a must read, BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misty Lacking","review":"I've been a fan of Misty Lackey's books for a long time, but this one fell short. The Sayers references were altogether too blatant, for one thing. What annoyed me the most is Peter's reference to Ankhsenamun, wife of Tutankamun, and the four lovely goddesses with her face that guarded his tomb. The tomb was discovered in 1922, and this story is set in 1909. Since the suffragette scholarship was so sound (a good point for the book), how did a huge anachronism like this get by?? It colored the story for me badly enough to spoil my enjoyment. She needs to write about some more interesting villains as well, not just ones who are bad because they are bad. Shivani had some promise in that regard, but that aspect of her character was never really developed, just hinted at. She could have been far more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errors Or Alternate Universes?","review":"I found this a good read with interesting characters. It's not high art, but no one expects it to be--do they? I'm reading the notes about \\"errors\\" with some amusement. The quotes from Saint-Exupéry and the references to King Tut can be taken as sloppy research--however, since in our world Elemental Masters do not exist, this must be an alternate universe, and who's to say that in this alternate universe that this historical event and that author didn't happen/exist earlier? (Jack Finney uses the Dakota Apartment building in his fantasy novel TIME AND AGAIN, which takes place in 1882 and it wasn't built until 1886, something he admits. It just works.) No one is writing a straight history story here! As for Misty's Lord Peter character, he is not Lord Peter Wimsey, so why all the fuss about him not being the correct age? He is indeed a homage to Peter Wimsey, but he is not the same character (for one thing he mentions he has three siblings, not two)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector's Encyclopedia of Fry Glassware","review":"This is one great book!

I constantly have problems with it reading documents and please, don't tell me it's my computer,it isn't. It's not too bad with photos but certainly not the quality you'd expect. The support, is there support? I've never had a response to any of my inquiries. All in all I would never purchase another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulb Burnout!","review":"I didn't use this scanner much, but after out of warranty, bulb burned out, can't be replaced by the customer. Replacement costs twice the cost of scanner itself. Given so many other people have had this problem, wouldn't buy it again.The ScanWizard software is very good, and keeps this from getting a one star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"short bulb life","review":"The scanner worked fine for the first month. Then I accidentally left the power on for a week, and the bulb burned out. Not completely, but the light is no longer bright white, but rather a dim neon red and all scans are so dim and noisy as to be unusable. I guess the bulb can't be replaced. What do you expect for [the price], I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you run Windows 2000, don't bother","review":"This scanner was hooked up to my Windows 98 system previously and I had no complaints. I recently had to move it to a Windows 2000 system however and things have changed.I had to download a new software version to support Windows 2000. The new software version 5.12 includes a check at startup for a \\"Go Button\\". This scanner does not even have a \\"Go Button\\". So basically you have to keep the scanner powered on day and night or be forced close an error message everytime you restart or turn on your computer. Very annoying. Unlike the previous software versions, there is no way to disable this startup function.Keep shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems Since We First Got the Scanner","review":"We have had many problems with this scanner. Please be aware that they do NOT have a toll-free phone number, and when we called their \\"technicians\\", we had to pay the long distance phone bill. Not to mention that the \\"technicians\\" told us that they didn't know what was wrong, but we still have to pay a 30 min. phone bill. Plus, if we want to get it repaired, the product must be shipped to California and THEY WILL NOT PAY SHIPPING. Also, in order to get the light bulb replaced, you have to send the scanner to California. The product does not allow you to replace the light bulb yourself. We will never own another Microtek scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"repaired once, and now broken again","review":"I bought this scanner about 15 months ago. The bulb broke after 8 months of light use, and was replaced under warranty. (I paid shipping.) Now, the bulb has gone out again, and the product is no longer under warranty. Microtek says it will be $80 - $100 (plus shipping) to fix. Might as well buy a new scanner. I don't recommend buying this scanner.I do like the software. All settings are customizable. The software has many more features than HP scanners I have used in the past. Plus, it is switchable between basic and advanced user interfaces.Bottom line, don't buy this scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bulb Burnout!","review":"I got this for my birthday 2 weeks and 1 year ago (just outside the warranty period). Luckily for me, it was a gift, so I didn't have to pay for this piece of fine craftmanship. Anyway, after over an hour of tearing this thing apart, I finally found the bulb. Can you believe it? The problem is, as it has already been stated in older comments, the bulb is not replaceable. It's actually attached to a circuitry board (the one that is below the sticky cover) on the bottom side. It is easy enough to take off, so why can't they send a replacement part? Why do they have you send it back in? My theory is that they receive your scanner back at their factory, and then they switch out the old part with a new one, put it in a brand new box, and resell it. Talk about a way to make a profit. It's too bad that the geniuses behind this plan didn't think about how mad their customers would get about it. I will never use Microtek again, as long as I live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your reciept","review":"i bought this scanner about a month ago it worked fine for two weeks. then after that my computer wouldnt reconize the scanner. i tried to find help online (microtek website). i could not find any others with this problem. i wasnt calling a 900#. so back to the store it goes. i'll pay the extra cash for a better scanner next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulb burns out","review":"Like many other uses, I have had nothing but problems with this scanner. The first one I had the bulb burned out after just 2 months. Although under warantee instead of just shipping me a new bulb (they are easy to access for replacement) Microtek insisted I ship the entire scanner to them for fixing at my cost. On my second bulb now, it only lasted about 6 months, this time with me always turning the scanner off when not in use. Replacement is more expensive than the scanner itself when out of warantee, and customer service leaves a LOT to be desired. If there was a source to purchase replacement bulbs I would recommend this scanner, when working it's a nice product. Since I can't locate replacement bulbs I would never purchase this scanner again, or any other product from Microtek, due to their horrible customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulb Blows","review":"I received this scanner with a new computer purchase bundle. Thought I got a good deal but the bulb burned out less than 30 days after I got it and I had only used it twice. Called Microtek and they replaced it for free. Haven't had a problem with the replacement yet. Also, I have had to uninstall and re-install it several times. The program consistently locks up and fails to function. Decent scanned images and fairly easy to use for the newcomer. Slow speed and not a lot of reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality -- nice images","review":"I'm torn on this product.It has very nice software bundled in. It does scan nice images.However, the lamp burned out less than 90 days after purchase. I sent it back to Microtek at my cost, they replaced lamp and it burned out again...just outside the one year mark.Not worth the headache. and Microtek's RMA ... for this product. I had a cheaper scanner that lasted much longer.This product should have last at least two years before the lamp went out...if not longer.Don't waste your money on this company, if this represents their quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"I too purchased a 3600. It was inexpensive when I bought it so I should have known better... The inside of the lid is black. That translates into photo copies using a LOT of laser toner. Also, the power switch is a small toggle on the back. Turning it on and off is a hassle. Leaving it on will burn out the bulb in short order. (Which is exactley what happened with mine.)Turns out the bulb is some sort of special Microtek only bulb. Even if you are a technician, you can't get the bulb. If the printer is out of warranty, getting the thing repaired will cost more than the original price. My suggestion?Spend a little more on a different brand with a common bulb and buy the extended warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"superman seasons 5-6","review":"the dvd arrived in good time and great condition.

There should be storylines devoted to Perry White, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Inspector Henderson and even Ethel, the secretary, as well. The Adventures of Superman's color episodes were very well written and essentially living comic books. The Perils of Superman was especially one of the greatest episodes which should be remade for the new series.
