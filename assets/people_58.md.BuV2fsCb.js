Until today.Forty seven days after purchase (with one or two drop offs in between that time) the router stops working. So, I do what I've done for years -- unplug it, wait 20-30 seconds, plug it back in. Once plugged back in...nothing. No power light. No buzzing. Nothing. I now have, in essence, a $94 brick that is 17 days beyond Amazon's 30 day return policy.This router is mediocre when it works and if my experience is any indication, is nothing more than a paperweight in training.

It's not a problem with just one Dlink DIR 655 router since BOTH routers would not connect to my Lenovo computer, but the DIR655 had no problems with my older XP machines. Specifically the router could not see the computer, much less connect to the LAN or internet. One could blame the Lenovo for not connecting to the Dlink but it connected to a Netgear router without a hitch. Otherwise seems to work fine but the range is not as wide as my previous Medialink router, which failed after just 6 months, and should be avoided at all cost even though it too has a very high rating.

I disliked D-link for 2 big reasons: (1) The wifi signal would disappear and only a hard on/off would make it work. Exploring forums showed many folks have the same issue. I also reviewed the router logs and there were definitely internal software issues with the router. (2) Each save of a setting required a 20s router reboot which makes it very tedious to administer.

I have had nothing but problems since I first set it up. As a Mac user, the manual set-up is a little more difficult, but it's still relatively easy, so that was initially encouraging. Ever since then, my roommate and I have had to reset it at least twice a day (there are absolutely no problems with the internet connection).

All of the dysfunctional units put themselves into an endless loop of reboot, rendering the unit dysfunctional. This generally occurred after working for 4-5 hours. After leaving the product unplugged for a couple of hours, you'd be able to get another 4-5 hours of use before having to repeat the unplug cycle. Compounding that problem...D-LINK CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST EVER!!! My combined total time spent on hold with D-Link was well over 4 hours. You talk with someone briefly (generally to retell your situation for the umteenth time because they are too lazy to look at the problem ticket), then off to transfer land where you get another prolonged hold time before you reach the next incompetent technician. AVOID D-LINK...they are horrible!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, incredibly hard and confusing setup","review":"I've had a lot of linksys routers and netgear routers which were basically plug and play, so to speak. No hassele setups. So when I heard about all the positives on this router I decided to upgrade. Big mistake! Out of the box, this router did not work at all with my desktop comupter; it was broadcasting a wireless connection for my laptop, but my desktop's connection was completely dead. After numerous hours of trying to tweak it by both CD install, and both manual installs and checking the Dlink site by rehooking my old router back up, I gave up.As other reviews note, initial setup can be tricky for this router. I've had lots of routers in the past and none of them required the amount of tweaking I had to go through and even then, it still didn't work correctly.

I thought I did well when it started working fairly decently until last month. It started requiring reboots couple of times a day. Now the internet slows down after couple of hours and WiFi signal becomes unavailable after 2-3 hours. When I tried to reboot, it did not come back live. I tried to hook it up directly to my laptop and tried to upgrade its firmware. It became live again and now it disappears after 2-3 hours requiring reboot. I am very frustrated with all of my router experience and am still looking for the one that works very reliably without any frustration of hourly reboots.Others have rated it well but please do consider my feedback.

Ever.","review":"This router throttles my 20 megabit per second (Mb/S) cable modem connection significantly, and it gets worse over time until it is unusable.Initially the speed drops from 20Mb/S down to about 16Mb/S. As time goes on it gets slower and slower, eventually ratcheting down to dial-up speeds (~50Kb/S).Bypass the router completely (i.e. plug directly into the cable modem) and the 20Mb/S throughput is still there. The problem is definitely the router.A reboot of the router will get you back to reasonable performance for a while (although never what it should be). But it does not last for long.Firmware updates haven't helped.Avoid this router!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm going to keep this relatively terse.The USB port did not work with my Western Digital 1TB external hard drive, which was a primary reason I chose this router. Connecting to a storage device plugged into the router's USB port requires the use of a D-Link application. Only one client can ever be connected to the device at a time, which is pretty disappointing. The client application did not ever work properly on Windows 7 64-bit. However, the worst thing about this router was the speed. I fired up my bittorrent client to download a Linux ISO. Over the course of about 30 minutes I was averaging around 150 kb/s. I decided to unhook the D-Link router and plug back in my old Buffalo router (with Tomato firmware). I averaged 750 kb/s for the rest of the download.My biggest regret is that I was out of town when the 30 day return period expired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Performance","review":"I've had this router for over a year and a half and have had only great performance.

I even tried replacing the antennae on the router with some high gain 9bi antennae, which improved the coverage only marginally. The router was fairly easy to setup using the setup disc. There is the possibility that the problem, however, was not with the router but with my dsl signal. I finally gave up and ordered Roadrunner.

It set up quickly and easily enough, and worked ok at first. The router was faster than my old b/g router. However, within a few days the problems started. I would wake up in the morning and the router had disappeared from my computer's network detection. Horrible latency spikes would plague my online gaming experience. Power cycling the cable modem and the router would fix these problems temporarily, but the reboots became more and more frequent. When the network started dropping inexplicably and all of a sudden, I had had enough. I'm returning this router, and never buying a D-Link ever again. Maybe my problems were a fluke? Well, then this would be the only negative review D-Link gets. Maybe I just didn't set the router up properly? Well, then maybe D-Link should have made it easier to set up.

The DIR-655 has great reviews and a bucket load of features (including ones I'm never likely to leverage). The most important thing, however, would be for the product to work and work simply.Periodically, the wireless radio will turn off. This is guaranteed proximate to power down / up (e.g. vacations). But happens less frequently without obvious associated event. Secure, yes. Intended use case, no.Unfortunately, there is no \\"turn radio on\\" toggle via the management interface. So, I could follow DLink advice and re-accomplish the wireless setup wizard from a directly connected workstation. Or, I could wait until the mood strikes, and the radio is restored. In fairness, this creates about a 10-20% downtime scenario. And, I'm sure my perception is inflated from reality.

It really solved my problem. Reception is strong (54 mbps) and video streams from basement to living room just fine, even to my MacMini, which has a fussy location for its internal antenna. Setup was counter-intuitive. Normally, you stick in the disk and follow the directions. Not here.

The second one has been functioning......like garbage.I have a 900 sq ft loft (meaning that its pretty much open), and I lose wifi reception 30 feet away. The power socket on the back has to be taped to the router in a certain way in order for it to power the device, and it needs to be reset on the reg.This was my first kind of expensive router, and I am really disappointed. I had a $20 netgear that worked much better.Oh and if you want to plug a hard dive in this router......its a colossal pain. You have to pair the devise that you want to access the HD with, and then when you are finished, you have to un-pair it. If you don't un-pair it, you wont be able to access the HD with any other devises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Problems","review":"When connected directly to my cable modem, I have no problems, except that I have no WiFi.

Then, it started to happen more frequently as time passes, and now everyday I have to restart it again. More than that, now even after clean restart, and re-install, and upgrading the firmware, the wifi is so slow and has a huge lag to the point that it is unusable.

I suggest they quit saying Macintosh Compatible until they give some instructions for Mac users.Come on D-Link. . . . put a few instructions somewhere for Mac users!

It turns out that the problem lies in the router firmware v. 1.21.It turns out that in some instances You *must* use the router's virtual server to forward ports. The firmware supports direct port forwarding, but direct doesn't work under some scenarios. The only default setting I changed was the router IP (changed from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.1) and I also reserved two IPs.I'm still leaving my rating as a 1.

But if I try to download a huge service pack, use it for torrents, or watch a lot of Netflix streaming, it locks up completely. When it's locked up, networked computers cannot access each other and nothing can access the Internet.

Fixed, but time consuming.Then whenever I connected with the extender it would drop its internet connection. Another call...lots of rearranging of equipment.

But eventually, both women rebel, refuse to be regarded as less than complete human beings, and dump him. Thus his chauvinism receives its just punishment. But to have shown him utterly destroyed would have left the audience sympathetic, and would have weakened the moral rather then strengthening it. Instead, he makes amends of sorts to both women, and is punished less severely than he could have been, which is an appropriate twist for a comedy. And it is a comedy, and a hilarious one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Ealing But Enjoyable Nonetheless","review":"This screwball farce must have been quite provocative in it's day but would be considered tame by today's standards. There's still alot to enjoy here even though the film doesn't attain the classic heights of Alec Guiness' Ealing work. It's kind of a departure for Guiness to play such an amoral heel and he seems to relish it. And he does a mean flamenco as demonstrated in his scenes with Yvonne DeCarlo. Speaking of DeCarlo, she's a revelation here as the saucy Spanish vixen that Guiness' captain has holed up in Tangiers. She not only smolders onscreen but she has a deft comic touch. Celia Johnson is good as well as the proper English wife that Guiness assumes is content with the role he prescribes for her. On the whole a consistently funny film. Watch for a clever twist at the end that took me by surprise because there is no way it would have passed American censors at that time and took me aback that it passed British censors."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Alec Guinness dance flamenco!","review":"I don't think he dances hard in any other movie. This is the equivalent for him of Greta Garbo laughing and joking in Ninotschka. It just shows off the breadth of his comical and tragic abilities.For a not tall, not conventionally handsome man to achieve so much, you know he has got to be very talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best","review":"In my opinion the best recording of this opera. I saw Franco Bonisolli in Cape Town in the 1980s when he was the reigning Trovatore and have never heard a better one, even though Corelli matches him in passion. Price is still in very good voice, before she developed the huskiness that plagues her latter recordings, notably the RCA with Domingo. The rest of the cast is excellent and who can beat Karajan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replica Mini Football Helmet","review":"Great product at a great price. Service is top notch!

I hope to see more of this kind of book in the future - Star Trek lends itself well to the short-story format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Everything It Could Have Been","review":"Some of these stories were really good, but some were a disappointment. As a long-time fan of the Trek universes, I expected more. It is hard to believe that of the many submissions the editor had to choose from, better choices were not found. I have not yet read the second volume in this series, but I hope it is a better and more consistent collection.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The fans take over","review":"Fiction based on TV series can explore topics that would never pass the artistic and political gauntlets of a production studio. Fans have a distance from the creative orthodoxy that probably arises among the professional writers and producers who must come up with stories that uphold the conventions of the series and also meet with approval from the higher-ups at the studio. \\"Strange New Worlds\\" is an anthology that takes advantage of these facts to present some innovative stories.Many of the straightforward problem-solution stories are fun, but the most interesting work takes place in odd little corners of the Trek universe. We learn what goes through the mind of the paralyzed Christopher Pike. Kirk has one final adventure in the moments following his death. With its crew unconscious, the emergency protocols in a starship's computer take over to save the day. There is no great prose here, but plenty of fresh takes on familiar material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans Put Some Modern Writers To Shame","review":"I was initially dubious about the concept of getting fans to write Star Trek stories for an anthology as over recent years the quality of Star Trek both on television, and in print, has been quite erratic. However this first volume of stories proves that there are a number of fans out there with great ideas and writing skills, and I agree with some reviewers who claim that this book should be a wake up call to so-called \\"professional\\" writers, whose modern style doesn't sit well with older fans like myself. Star Trek is many things to many people, which this collection reflects, but it should NEVER be just a soap opera in Starfleet uniforms, which is often the modern trend. A thoroughly enjoyable collection, and a worthwhile endeavour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Watch","review":"Received the watch a month ago from JustBrands.

I won't say it didn't take some persuasion to leave my comfort zone and delve into a different perspective on the rapture but I am so glad I did. Questions that had been nibbling at the back of my mind were finally answered: Why does the Bible keep telling us to watch for the return of Jesus, but \\"people\\" tell me we won't know when he's coming for the church (check out Chapter 3).They will never make a movie out of this book; it was not written to be a people-pleaser and entertain them. But I think it is a significant book--it answers questions; explores ideas; correlates old and new testaments; has understandable charts; is fully backed with scripture. To me one of the most important things is that it made me rethink ideas that I had always accepted but never put to the scriptural test. Once again--I dare you to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Drawing Toy!","review":"Buy this toy if you want your child to draw quietly for hours!

It is useless and expensive! While I don't consider my instructor particularly adept at teaching, he is a valuable resource in understanding many key points in the book. Whatever language the author writes in, it's not the language of math nor the English language. Any points the author tries to emphasize get lost in a garbled mess of words.

It comes from a time when movies had morals, values, and always a good lesson to be learned. This movie does not disappoint. It shows a respect for hard work and teaches that money can not buy everything including respect and love.Also from a time when actors could really act. Not an actress or actor today could get me teary eyed, but no matter how many times I watch this movie, I'm grabbing for the tissues by the end. All names you'll reconize: Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney (at their best), Lionel Barrymore and John Carradine.

The story is beautifully told through the superb acting of Tracy and company. Although it's a few decades old, the moral of the story is as valuable today, perhaps more so, than it was decades ago. I originally rented the movie, but am purchasing a copy for my own video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite!","review":"This is my favorite film of all time!I am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it -It was an Acadamy Award winner, so I don't understand why it's not gotten much attention over the years...I find it superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than Captains Courageous.I don't know why this is the case, but I am it's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it...It is a wonderful and moving story, that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as \\"It's a Wonderful Life Does\\"...If you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you!Do not miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best version of Captain's Courageous","review":"Rudyard Kiplings beautiful novel, Captain's Courageous, is about the experiences of a rich, spoiled 15 year old boy who must adapt to the working man's life on a fishing schooner after falling off a luxurious ocean liner. The part didn't really fit Freddie Bartholonew, who was about 13 at the time and looked no more than 10. But he was a very popular child actor with lots of box office draw, so Hollywood destroyed the character of Harvey Cheyne in an effort to make it fit Freddie Bartholomew. It wasn't Bartholomew's fault, but it spoiled the film. Another version was released in 1977 starring Karl Malden, Ricardo Montalban, and Jonathan Kahn as Harvey Cheyne. This is an execellent version, and the one I would like to see made available on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kipling rewritten","review":"In my opinion, this is the among the worst movie adaptations of a great novel!

So the German Jews have Brit accents. The story opens with some modern-day tourists entering Auschwitz with a tour guide, but the body of the story is back when the camp was an active work camp and death camp. A group of prisoners decide they are going to hold a trial for the person they feel is most responsible for their misery: God. At first the charge was murder, but eventually they decided on breach of covenant. There are both accusers and defenders, including some very scholarly arguments, some very poignant testimony, and eventually a decision by the court.It is artfully done, and no clear bias is expressed. Therefore, I'm not going to tell you either the verdict of the court or what happens next. Let's just say I liked the film quite a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I thought!","review":"This film definately was not what I thought it would be. I expected a sappy, sentimental production, and was surprised with an intelligent, thought provoking discussion among prisoners in the camps of Germany. Very well produced, very well acted, and made me sit back and think about the questions posed from a Jewish perspective. It made me marvel at the perseverence of a people who notoriously have suffered at the hands of others, and yet, still maintain a devotion to God rivaled by few. Makes you re-think your relationship with God, and makes you wonder, in the face of such adversity, if ones faith would be so strong, or if you would feel abandoned by your Creator.I would recommend this to 13+, because of the graphic conversations between prisoners, but all in all, an excellent production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another day camping destroyed by Holland Companion","review":"Wife does cooking I was asked to get Companion out of front compartment of 5th wheel and set it up.

This is not my only grill. I bought it for traveling in the fifth-wheel. If you like your steaks cooked in an oven on low heat, this grill will meet your expectations. You'll go through a lot propane with this slow cooker. If your a true griller, you'll hate it. 18 minutes with the lid closed to bake a ribeye medium rare doesn't cut it with me.

I tried a different hose, different propane source, both the small disposable and large tank with hose and had same problem with it going out in the most gentle breeze. Called the company and they sent me a new regulator and it worked slightly better. When I use the grill, I have to set it up and surround it with plywood to protect it from the wind and even then, a wayward breeze will blow it out. Today, I've had it. This is the last time I will use it and it's going into the trash and I'll purchase something else.

The main problem was that it was disjointed in its plotting and pace. It felt like they had the basic book together and then created a separate plot line (or two) and wedged it in there. It broke up the main story and created a lack of cohesion that was bothersome. Sherman and Cragg have pulled off parallel plots before with great success, so I know they can do it. They just seemed all over the place in this one.(Minor spoiler alert)This is also the first book where the major campaign was not completed. I'm not adverse to cliffhangers per se, but there wasn't really any true build up and the termination seemed arbitrary.I still loved the characters and the writing itself is as exciting as usual. I hope these fine authors can get back on a more cohesive track with the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 4.75 stars","review":"The book was very well written. Maybe even better than the one before! There were a few typos with who did what in what book. And the ending! That is a really well done cliffhanger!

Harry Potter fans - mail your magic spells!","review":"I like this postcard book. These are tear out postcards which are my least favorite way to get postcards from a book. Most perforations are less than stellar at being able to cleanly tear one card away from the others. The content is what really makes these cards shine so I'll ignore the fuzzy perfs.Postcrossing has a lot of Harry Potter fans. This out of print books are great for satisfying the need to get a \\"different\\" postcard in the stash of typical postcard holders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Law of Survival","review":"This is an excellent conclusion to Smith's SF series. It returns to the complexity of the first volume, and so the plot isn't quite as clear as it could be -- but it's an interesting one with plenty of action. Worldbuilding is strong, and characterization excellent. Few writers could create Lucien Pascal and make him a sympathetic character and a sociopath at the same time. Pierce has become less dangerous, which saddened me a little, but I still find him wonderful and wanted to see more of him. Jani herself remains an especially vivid creation. I recommend this series to people who like emotionally powerful, vividly realized, intelligently conceived fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great minimizer","review":"This bra minimizer does just what it is supposed to and minimizes grat.

Being a Cyclops fan they did the worst job for Scott Summers (the original leader of the X-Men)The animation still looks 1990'ish. Stiff and robot-like.The storylines get old fast especially if you've read the X-Men since the 1970's through the 90's.

I know that some liberal, artsy-fartsy Canuck snobs roll their eyes if Red Green's cult TV show is mentioned, but the man has a marvellously wry sense of humor that keeps hitting the mark without ever being offensive. Yet the ugly utilitarian snout of Political Correctness gets smashed to bits too. It's amazing how just the plain old common sense arrived at from the real life observations could make you roar with laughter.This is the populist humor at its democratic best.Well, yes.

The book is easy to read, has supporting graphics and is a execellent way to learn the generalities of the brain processing. However, don't expect all questions to be answered.

It is a clear and basic introduction to the wisdom of Kabbalah. I have read many books on Kabbalah but this one offers a clarity that is almost crystalline in its approach. There is purity, an undiluted explanation of the science of Kabbalah minus all the new age gimmicks that lately seem associated with it.I was able to follow the rationale of why it is truly a science, why the world is in its current state (egoism) and what Kabbalah has to offer with regard to that (methodology to altruism).

Also teaches excellent stretches and lower-back releases for runners and anyone who does strenuous exercize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emphasis is on the stress release","review":"The emphasis here is on the stress release rather than the conditioning, only a few of the poses require much strength. A great beginner tape, it's made a real difference in my tension level.

I began doing this tape about 2 weeks and I feel the difference.There are two instructors so the positions are done either modified for for advance. The instructions are spoke well. It is best to watch the tape at least once before performing(this is best with all tapes).I am sleeping better and the back pain is easing up slowly. This tape is really for stress release.

The instructors who demonstrate the poses seem to be enjoying themselves. They make it look easy, but the instructor always reminds you that it will be easy for you one day. I highly recommend this video as a first yoga video. Because it's so relaxing you'll immediately feel the benefits. You might even get hooked like me!Yoga Zone primarily makes videos for the beginner for different aspects of yoga like the back or flexibility and toning.

I'd rank this one as one of the best ones. Instead of two 20 minutes sections, this one is a full length 40 min+ session. One of the nice things is having two poses demonstrated by two teachers (Michelle, and Lisa Bennett). There are times I'd do the easier pose because I am not that flexible. This video did address some of the key points in Yoga practicing which is easily overlooked as something simple. For those that what a fast/sweating workout, this is not going to be what you are looking for.

I have a great interest and much knowledge of how to feed diabetics and this book ain't it nor is the food pyramid the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to stay fat and confused buy this book.","review":"I bought the book for the use of its glycemic index, but was put off by their diet suggestions which run counter to my own experience, and those of my friends who have had great experiences with Dr. Barry Sears \\"The Zone\\" diet, and other 40-30-30 books. A year ago I weighed 229 lbs. (I'm 6'4 1/2\\")and my cholestrol was over 200. I lost 33 pounds in 3 months, and have stayed within a few pounds of my low to this day. My bad cholestrol dropped down to 181 while my good cholestrol went up over 50 for the first time. I personally challenge these diet gurus to publish a picture of themselves in a bathing suit to see just how great their diet really works. I've got my pictures ready.. and my blood results as well. How about it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in the whole picture","review":"I agree the glycemic index is a useful tool, but the attiudethat low fat diets are best remain in this book which I do not whollyagree with. [The book discusses] the media driven view that all dietary fats are harmful to health. This is not true. Some are (excess saturated fats, trans/hydrogenated fats.) but the health benefits of the good fats/essential fatty acids are not mentioned. I suggest picking up Udo Eramus' book \\"Fat's that Heal, Fat's that kill\\" and put the two books together to complete the picture between carbs. and fats. Eskimo's get 50-60% of their calories from fats (rich in omega 3/6) oils and don't get heart disease. The view [of this book] is still too skewed for me to justify this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book, hoping to find some really good diet information. What I found was inconsistent, and rambling. Perhaps there could be some good information for diabetics, but you have to look for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $40 I paid","review":"The flyer in the mail looked provocative and full of valuable information. The book cost $40. I can't believe I ordered it. Hardcover, yes, but low quality paper and printing, no photos or color, so why the high price? The information inside was not presented in a readable or interesting manner. I haven't tried the recipes. I have a wheat allergy and this book doesn't have gluten-free recipes, just sugar-free. I plan to try out their claim that this book comes with a life-time guarantee and can be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Control Your Type II Diabetes","review":"I have Adult Onset (Type II) Diabetes. At the end of February, 2001, my blood glucose was at 288. In less than three months, the advice in this book allowed me to drop it to 96. My glyco-hemoglobin went from 9.8 to 6.4. I've also lost more than 20 pounds, and my blood pressure has become normal. This is an important, life-saving book. I didn't want to end up as a blind, impotent paraplegic on dialysis waiting to die from heart failure. I haven't felt this good in years. Perhaps you can take control of your health, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off reading something else like \\"Insulin resistance diet\\"","review":"I was excited about reading this book. However, it's was infuriating.I had high expectations because of the qualifications of the writers, but was severely let down.The book is contradictory. It is not clear about how you should eat, since some of the recommendations it makes seem to go against what it advises.It's hard to read, and is not easy to follow. There is so much detail and no clear way for you to know what is right to eat without the GI book. They have now come out with a book to answer questions from this book. It's just not a good read for someone trying to find a better way to eat. it's hard to understand and is not enjoyable. I ended up reading this book, the Insulin resistance Diet and really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book!","review":"I found this book to be encouraging. After struggling all my life with a weight problem, finally something that works! It's easy to stick to, doesn't feel like a diet, and best of all, you can have things like frozen yogurt! The only criticism I would have is that the glycemic index provided in the book doesn't cover enough foods. I see they have a glycemic index book for sale, so maybe that is why it doesn't include as much as we would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, just terrible.","review":"I'm taking a Geometry class at BCC and this is the required textbook. It's one of the worst textbooks I've had to use. The overall format of the lessons is okay, but everything is just...yeck. The point of a textbook is to be a learning resource but the exercises in the book are almost entirely different from the lessons and as the book gets to the more advanced level, it completely stops explaining theorems, just offering \\"You can provide the reasons.\\" I've managed steady Bs on the tests throughout the course but for the life of me I can't figure out how to do any of the problems inside. If you're stuck with this book, BE SURE TO GO TO EVERY CLASS, because this useless stack of papers won't be offering any help.Also, the design inside the book is depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring.","review":"I need not say more than those two words, but I will -- this book is just awful. I was expecting a real memoir, and this is just a piecemeal collection of boring anecdotes and pats on the back, combined with crabbiness about modern life. Dreadful! Give me Nancy's or Jessica's books, any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"insipid","review":"I could not sustain any interest in this book.It is supposed to be a diary of the Duchess of Devonshire.What she does is not very interesting, and the constant name dropping with asterisks at the bottom of the page to explain who they are is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood by Americans?","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Addressing some of the negative reviews that have appeared below, I feel that the Duchess of Devonshire would be the first to say that she doesn't expect to be placed in the pantheon of Mitford writers with Nancy and Decca. So much of Nancy's charm is period charm after all, and Decca appeals to readers because she is fearless, outspoken and a rebel.\\"Counting My Chickens\\" is great fun to read, and just because one was personally unacquainted with Harold Macmillan or any of the other people thoughtfully mentioned in footnotes is little reason to judge the book itself as 'insipid' and 'boring', adjectives that could so well describe life in a world dominated by the delights of Macdonalds and Coca Cola, and restricted by the application of just four adjectives - cool, great, nice and neat - to every possible situation.I, like another reviewer, delighted in the Duchess' use of mitfordesque descriptions of the mundane - 'a septic handbag'."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"Well this mouthguards cheap and its a boil n bite so it fits good , i would recommend it to budget shoppers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes and Pattens and Stepping Through Time","review":"Shoes and Pattens is one of THE two great books using actual finds to show footwear in the English Middle Ages.

The plot was boring, slow and I was glad when I finished it. If I have to skip a couple of pages to get a book done...that is a sign of a problem. One is the lowest score, but if there was a zero, that would be my vote. :( sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the BEST YogaZone series!","review":"I bought this collection on VHS back in...well, the late 90s. At the time, I was in a serious (ie, disabling) Fibromyalgia-myofasial pain syndrome-complex. All my life I've been active, an athlete, etc. and suddenly here I was struggling to get up the stairs of my building.This series gave me the kind of activity I needed-- and the encouragement to let my body just go as far as it could *that day*, and not push too far.I still use these programs in my daily routines, and although I have several other YogaZone dvds, this collection is still my favorite!If you're looking for \\"power\\" yoga, however, you won't be happy with this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"I bought this series of DVD's and Yoga for Dummies. I return to the 3 Yoga Zone discs again and again. Each DVD includes two 20 minute workouts that focus on either Power, Conditioning, or Abs. The sessions show two people - one instructor and one student. The instructors give excellent directions to keep you focused and into the movements with variations offered where appropriate. Breathing and posture are emphasized often.Some of these workouts are tough while others seem easy but overall a good mix. The only issue I have is that at the end of each of the first 20 minute sessions there is a meditation which is nice if you end there but if you continue to the second 20 minute session it seems to interrupt the flow.The instruction takes place in two locations in Jamaica - one on the beach and another under trees near a duck pond. This is very refreshing.You have the option of turning off the instructors voice but not the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Set!","review":"I own MANY yoga videos, and I have to say that this boxed set is one of my favorites. Alan Finger is a great instructor. His voice is calming and he gives lots of instructions. You will find that the first 2 or 3 minutes (explaination and prep) is the same for all the tapes, but that's not really an issue. The poses are simple enough for a beginner, but I have found that with time and as my comfort level increased, I'm able to \\"advance\\" the poses myself. I would truely recommend this set to anyone. I also enjoy Candlelight Yoga with Sara Ivanhoe. Another wonderful instructor. Even though my yoga tape collection is probably about 50, I always return to these tapes, because I find them so relaxing and enjoyable to do. I actually look forward to doing them every evening Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor picture quality.","review":"Reading other reviews I did not find the content of the DVD to be a surprise. Thus, even though the presentation is very slow, the content met my expectations. HOWEVER, the picture of quality of the content is mediocre at best. As a result, rather than offer 4-5 stars, I can only justify 2-3 (closer to 2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"These DVD's are for people who have never ever done any yoga. They are very simplistic and they are broken into too short of segments. A 20 minute session is just not enough. Also, the poses are so simplistic it is as though you are just stretching instead of doing yoga. I feel that these tapes are too easy even for the most novice of yogis. For a better more complete introduction to yoga one might want to try Crunch yoga DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I bought this product because of the glowing reviews. I used it only once. The pace was really slow and there was a lack of energy or enthusiasm to keep one going. I understand this DVD set is old but the \\"look\\" and \\"feel\\" of the program were not very inspiring. I thought I was going to fall asleep. I would not recommend it even for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I was so excited try this yoga set - due to all of the very positive reviews I had read here on this site. I am thoroughly disappointed though. I found it to be very difficult to follow along - I knew absolutely nothing about yoga and I felt the instructor did not familiarize me enough with the basics of yoga before beginning. I have to say too, the instructors heavy accent made it very difficult to follow this as well.I can't recommend this to anyone - I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for those who are out of shape","review":"In my late 40s, I was terribly out-of-shape and had already taken two months of yoga classes. I realized I needed to do yoga more than once a week to improve my aching body so I asked for this DVD set for Christmas. I started with the Intro to Yoga and worked my way through, saving the meditation one until last. Each CD was very do-able and varied enough so that I didn't get bored. My favorite one is the Conditioning and Stress Release (teal cover). I didn't think I would benefit from it because I don't consider myself stressed, but it helps relieve muscle stress, too, which I suffer from because of long hours at the computer. It has really great neck/shoulder workouts. I'd definitely recommend this set, and I was happy to hear that my yoga teacher thought highly of it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I purchased the boxed sety of yoga zone for my HUSBAND's Christmas gift, mostly because of lack of time he didn't start doing the yoga till 2 weeks ago.

I like the instructor and his voice. Postures and not difficult for beginners but help to improve flexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I got these for Christmas last year and they're so great. I never thought I would be able to get into yoga, but now I'm hooked. The movements are so gentle and help relieve so much stress, I really can't believe yoga is considered a form of exercise! I have tried other yoga tapes in the past - Kathy Smith, I'm looking in your direction - that were too focussed on things like keeping a faster heart rate, but yoga shouldn't be like that. If you can't breathe comfortably, you're not doing yoga right. It's great for beginners and for those of us with a few extra pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best workout video I've ever tried!","review":"After receiving my Yoga Zone tapes, I did the workout twice the day I got them. I had never tried Yoga before using these tapes and had no idea that you could get such a total workout not only for your body, but your mind as well. I am a firm believer in the power of yoga now! Alan Finger, the instructor, does a wonderful job of helping out the viewer at home feel at ease with his calming and assuring voice. 'Even if you can't make it to the ankles, the knees are just fine!' I highly recommend this set to anyone who is curious about yoga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The box set has such potential with the best of their works included... When we opened the first on - HMS Pinafore we were shocked at the poor quality of the recording. The sound was of such low standard that we had to turn up full ball to hear the words at which point it started distorting. The picture quality looked like it had been through the mill and back - very grainy and like it had been recorded back in the 70s.

Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable. It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking. It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated. The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit. Everytime he moves, it pops out. The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him. He loves superman and loves having a cape. He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with.I suppose we got what we paid for. Cheap prices doesn't equate to quality.

There are many texts in the field that can be very complete yet tedious for use. The physics are presented in a straightforward manner with smooth transitions to computational methods that easily translate out of the Fortran the text uses (I convert all mine into Mathcad).As a ballistician I refer to this text often, the set-ups are simple to put into the full range of question asked of those in the art.

We love the look of it and the fact that it heats water quickly and retains the heat a long time. However, it can be DANGEROUS on a gas stove. If you look at the design, you'll see why this happens -- if you put too much water in it, it won't whistle, it will instead boil over without warning; the water will boil out through the spout, run down the side, then under the kettle and douse the flame underneath. So the FLAME IS OUT but the GAS IS ON. This has happened several times. If you don't overfill it (above the spout), it's perfectly fine, but it's hard to keep reminding other people like guests and family. We've decided to replace it with a kettle that has a higher spout and a flat bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly whistles. Cheap rivet hinges.","review":"I was surprised and disappointed that something by Le Creuset would be cheaply built.

The folding action of the handle eventually sheared one off, though the handle is still held in place with the remaining bit that's in the joint.The whistle isn't attached which means it can get lost. Not only that, but the the kettle doesn't always whistle when the water boils which another reviewer observed might be due to too much water in the kettle. Even when it does whistle, it's barely audible. In any case, the lid does not seal tightly enough. If I push down hard on it while the water is boiling, I cut off the steam leaking from the lid's seam and get more of it moving through the whistle.

Once attached to the helmet, the adhesive separated from the the foam on the other two and the fixture came off the helmet. To correct this problem, I had to scrape away all the foam layers on the fixture and use epoxy to glue it to the helmet. Once this was done, the fixture stayed and the mirror works great. Be prepared to have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted $20 - Poor Design!","review":"The mirror attaches to the arm by a small ball joint, which is very loose. It was stiff enough to hold the mirror steady while riding, but it was loose enough to very easily pop right out of the socket when lightly bumped with a hand while wiping my brow. It popped out several times, and each time, I was lucky enough to find the mirror part on the ground and pop it back in, until this morning. I have no idea where the mirror went to when it popped out, and now I'm left with a useless $20 plastic arm attached to my helmet. Very poor design. I wish I had read the bad reviews before purchasing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent design, materials are poor quality!","review":"This mirror is quite effective in that you can see behind you without having to turn your head. The problem is, the sticky pad where the mirror attaches to your helmet, doesnt' hold up. Then, the mirror, after a few century rides in the sun, seems to \\"oxidize\\" to the point you can't see out of it anymore.Conveniently, Cycleaware sells a \\"mirror replacement parts kit\\" with a new mirror and new sticky pad. What a scam! If they would sell a quality mirror in the first place, you wouldnt need a replacement kit. You can see it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TIKSBS/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00It's also worth mentioning that I've only had the mirror for about 3 months, and I've already had to buy their replacement kit. If you can find another mirror that works for you, I suggest you go with that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 miles, fell off twice, being returned.","review":"I used this mirror for all of 9 miles and have decided it's not for me. I bumped it twice and the mirror fell off both times. I can't imagine how much it would fall off while riding regularly. This one is a great concept but it's going to be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it","review":"I have used this mirror for many years. With the adjustable wire arm the mirror can be positioned to just about anywhere. Care must be taken in removing the mirror from the helmet mount. Removing it too many times will cause the adhesive to become loose and the mirror to potentially fall off. For me a helmet mirror is much more desireable because I don't need to take my eyes of the road in order to look for traffic like is needed for a handle bar mirror. I have become so dependent on a mirror that I never ride with out it, even on a bike path. The product has become a little pricey though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money...","review":"Bought this from my local LBS for a longer ride this weekend. I spent more time trying to adjust it than I did enjoying the ride. When I removed my helmet to stop for water, it was readjustment time again.

I'll just consider it a $23 donation to my LBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functionally OK, but flimsy construction","review":"I've had two of these and both failed in the stem area after 3-4 months of fairly heavy use.

This would be a good product if the mirrors stayed put."},{"rating":"1","title":"loose socket","review":"This is a terrible mirror. It stuck to my helmet well enough, but it often pops out of the attachment. My biggest complaint though, is that the universal ball joint is way too loose. It requires constant readjustment- the slightest head wind, down hill or road vibration and the mirror moves, rendering it useless. My husband has the third eye, and it's much better. I'm getting one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice mirror if you have the right kind of helmet","review":"It's a great little mirror, but won't stick to my helmet.

It's definitely an interesting story, but I found the writing of this author to be soooooo boring! So much so that I even though I'm more than halfway through, I doubt I'll bother to finish it.

It put everything into focus and make me re-think my views of alcoholics.

Same old stuff, I thought I was different. Perhaps it is because I am also a sober alcoholic - once you get past the details, the stories are all pretty much the same. I have been helped over the years by so many recovering alcoholics who have shared their stories, experience and hope with me - for free. I guess I have a bias against those who are making money/receiving fame from it.I would suggest that anyone who wants to really learn about alcoholism read \\"Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How Many Thousands of Men and Women have Recovered From Alcoholism\\", and those who have family members who are alcoholic may benefit from literature from the Alanon Family Groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman and man should read this book","review":"Caroline Knapp is a gift from the universe to us all. She has the best perspective on appetites and needs. She understands the human condition fully and I believe in my heart her book can help everyone. The world is at a tremendous loss for loosing her at such and early age. If you know anyone with a drinking problem or have one yourself you must read this book. This woman and her words are a life saver. Bless her for the good she did while she was on this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinking: A Love Story","review":"I thought this book was a beautiful and honest portrayal of the progressiveness and destructiveness of the disease of alcoholism, especially as experienced by a woman. As a substance abuse counselor, it is not often that you come upon stories of alcoholism in women from upper-middle class, well-educated and highly respected families, or at least those that are nationally shared. I applaud Caroline Knapp for providing us with an inside view of alcoholism and the havoc it wreaks on the lives of many. It is a shame that she did not live to tell us her story beyond her first year of sobriety."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everyone Can Relate\\"","review":"I found this book to be not only honest, but cleverly written---I loved the way she wrote it-- as if alcohol was the lover that she felt that she couldn't live without. No matter how degrading or awful it made her feel. For I feel as a woman in society, we are judged by whether we have or have not landed a man. For my addiction has been \\"needing\\" a relationship with a man. That means at my expense, no matter terrible he made me feel--I felt as long as he was around, I was accepted and acceptable. This book is not only about addiction, but also how we must learn ourselves and teach our children SELF ESTEEM. Feeling good about yourself is priceless and the possibilities are endless. Thank you, Caroline Knapp, for sharing such a raw experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully written - gets better each time I read it","review":"I loved this book. I reread it every once in a while because it's so intelligent and beautifully written. It gets a alot of attention as a memoir of addiction (and it's the best one I've ever read), but it stand on it's own as an exquisite piece of writing and a memoir - time spent with a brilliant and nuanced mind, a sophisticated and sensitive person.

I came to reading this book through my local library. I have had family members who had and some still have an alcohol problem. I found the book easy to read and down to earth. Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. However, it now gives me an insight to inside an alcoholic's head - how they think, how they blame everything and everyone else around them instead of the drink and how they dismiss help so many times before getting help. At least the author of this book DID EVENTUALLY get help. I think that takes the most amount of courage. To admit you need help and to face up with the fact of being an alcoholic. If you have an alcohol problem, or know anybody who does, I recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requred reading.","review":"This wonderful book was instrumental in getting me to rehab and a life of sobriety....it described my drinking to a tee, and helped cut through my unbelievable conviction that I, who drank to get drunk every other day, kept thinking I could drink! For every woman who is an active drinker, but has the gnawing wish for help, this is required reading! As for those who are long in recovery, may be it is not so helpful....but if for those unhappy drinkers, who try and try to stop, but can't, this may be the proverbial hammer that will deal a fatal blow to the vicious cycle of \\"...just one little glass of wine....\\" Thank you, Ms. Knapp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"This book was a selection for our book club. It seemed like a promotional book for AA. I forced myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, I get it.","review":"Although the book is very insightful and makes one think about his/her drinking habits, after you have heard the same points made over and over for 120 pages or so, you think, \\"OK, I get it, now get on with it.\\" What the author took almost 300 pages to say could have been done in considerably fewer. Augusten Burroughs book \\"Dry\\"makes many of the same points, but is much more interesting. Maybe its just that his life was so much more bizarre, but he certainly doesn't beat you to death with the same statements throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blah book","review":"The book is interesting because the author writes well about the subject, but then it just keeps repeating the same point over and over...shes a closet alcoholic and its so hard to stop drinking and so on and so on. I didn't even bother to read to the end; the ending was so predicatable, she would stop drinking. Maybe I wasn't so keen on the book because I do not know what it feels like to be an alcoholic and I can't relate, but this book lost my interest after the first 70 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book as part of a requirement for my masters program in psychology. I was expecting yet another dull read, but the book is quite amazing, illustrating the struggles that the author and main character suffered during her life as an active alcoholic. I truly had a better understanding of alcoholism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, but true","review":"Hard to say it was \\"a fun read\\" when the subject matter is so sad.

It did give me a clear picture of how a woman who is sliding down that path thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent story of a horrific addiction","review":"The author is an excellent writer describing her affair with her addiction. The honesty she shares with the reader as she describes her love affair with her drinking also exposes the reader to the same emotional despair as she plummets into the abyss of alcoholism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains more than a shot of courage","review":"Recommended to my by a recovering alcoholic when I was struggling in a relationship with a high functioning alcoholic, this book contains more than a shot of courage. For anybody who has suffered from alcoholism--whether directly or indirectly--this brutally honest book offers insights that only a drunk and only a writer as talented as Caroline Knapp could present. Sadly, Knapp died young. She had a fierce talent, and this book will enlighten anybody who cannot begin to grasp alcoholism. For drinkers, they might recognize themselves in this foxed mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confirming my own worst fears","review":"I found out about this book while watching Oprah one day and eating bon bons. I was mesmorized by this woman and her story because it was like watching myself sitting there on that stage. I went out the following day and purchased this book, voraciously reading it all in one gulp. For anyone for has ever thought they may have a problem with alcohol, this will confirm or deny it. For me, she is telling my story in a different town and state. And because of this book, my life has changed.A fabulous read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most insightful book about addiction I've ever read","review":"Knapp if a gifted stylist in the evocatively brittle vein of Marguerite Duras (good) or Kathryn Harrison (not so good). But what makes this book so compelling is her deep insight into the nature of her alcoholism and, by extension, addiction in general. Thus, the deeply screwed-up life detailed in these pages becomes much more than a sideshow attraction - i.e. Elizabeth Wurtzel's supremely tawdry \\"More, Now, Again\\". It becomes a valuable object lesson in the traps we set for ourselves. This is wisdom that anyone, addict or not, can benefit from."},{"rating":"2","title":"so worth the money","review":"This was a great read of an alcoholics perspective on life.

She makes it all seem so real and so OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"frighteningly realistic","review":"this book truly captured my drinking years for me and helped me to remember the horror and insanity of that time. almost as hypnotic as the mental aspect of alcoholism itself. whenever i am tempted to think things were not so bad, i hope i remember to pick this book up and reread it. helped to recall some things i thought were long buried. if you have no idea what this disease does to people, this book is about the most vivid i have ever read, especially about the alcoholic woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous, Whining review of a downhill slumping life","review":"It might give us a peek into the life of an alcoholic, but there are much better books that do so. Knapp goes over, and over, and over, and over what went wrong without elaborating. She glosses over important facts like her subsequent anorexia. Knapp writes really well when it comes to her fictional Life of Alice K. or anything she contributes to magazines and the Boston Phoenix, but, hey, if you want to learn about alcoholism, find a better book. Any one of them would do. Reading this book (I had to for a Psychology Class) was utter torture. Don't put yourself through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"From one alcoholic to another ....","review":"There are certainly better books to inspire or encourage a person with the disease, (A Drinking Man's Life, etc). This book was laborious. With due respect to the author, this seemed to be therapy for her vs education or help for others. As a recovering drunk, I feel there are SO MANY ways to explain the problem and the solutions w/AA. Very little offered in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drove me to drink","review":"I'm sure Knapp's problems would be juicy and interesting, if she would just be a little more direct in telling them. As it is, she relies too much on phrases like, \\"Most alcoholics will tell you\\" and \\"When you're an alcoholic ... you do this and that.\\" We've all heard what alcoholics do and don't do by this time. Knapp does a wonderful job in tiptoeing around the specifics of her own problems and incidents. I hope she is more open than this at her meetings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinking = A Love Story, Boooring!!","review":"As an adult child of an alcoholic, I bought this book trying to get insight into my father's alcoholism. I didn't. I kept reading and reading, trying to absorb what the writer was saying and I got nowhere. All I read was a litany of occasions where the author drank, what she drank, who she was with and whether or not she slept with them.There were times I felt I was reading an advertisement for cognac or other alcoholic beverages. I really wonder how this book should be catergorized, biography, self-help, or perhaps a skinny door stop.

This book is in direct conflict with the traditions and intent of AA, and thus, I suggest no one buy it. I wish I had not purchased. it, as a respectful, recovering alcoholic.

It was these Carthagians who had the sailing fleets - doh!! As for ancient Egypt, exactly what amazing sailing fleets did they have? Do you know some \\"secret\\" that only you \\"know\\"? Somehow I doubt it.... Anyway, the point of Van Sertima's book is to claim that West Africans colonised America. Forget about \\"opening your mind\\", \\"being receptive to new idaes\\" etc - where is the EVIDENCE??

It simply defies logic and all historical and archaeological evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book presents a theory that deserves open-minded study","review":"I read Mr. Von Sertima's book shortly after its original publication. At that time, the earliest Olmec presence in the Americas was thought to be later than 1200 BCE. Subsequent excavations have called that timeline into question, and may have extended it substantially backward. This, of course, does nothing to alter the basic premise: that black Africans were in the Americas long before the Columbian Europeans. The stone heads provide striking, and, in my view, incontrovertible evidence of that presence, the absurdist Europhile description of them as \\"baby face\\" notwithstanding. It may ultimately prove to be the case that Mr. Von Sertima has been too conservative in his dating scheme, and that older, and more powerful, African dynasts are involved. Whatever the case, this book, and its argument, merit our attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicious attack","review":"If I was a native American, I'd be *really* upset by this book and its essential attack on their history. It has no merits simply becaues there is NO, repeat NO evidence to suggest that Africans made oceanic explorations.

I think the evidence is out there, but he does a poor job in conveying it.

For the low price, it's just fine and (at least for now) it looks like it cost more. How sturdy is it? Sturdy enough... I definitely wouldn't jump up and down on it, but it's solid enough to hold me (a normal sized male) without any problems. Others have sat on them too, no problems. I bought two and I'm happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad quality Chaise Lounge. I don't know how give 1 star :(","review":"Very bad quality in all way.

It arrived in about two days in one large flat box. My 8 year old son asked if he could put it together. The assembly instructions explained everything so well, that it took him just about one hour. It looks awesome on our patio and it is the perfect place for morning coffee, I love the slide table. It looks to have a painted-type stain so this winter I will have to keep it out of the rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems Here!","review":"We almost didn't order because of the different reviews---we had only minor problems putting the two chairs together (it isn't a ten-minute task). They look great, are sturdy and well-made. We haven't had any orange leakage like others reported, and they've been through four or five major rains as well as spraying them down with a hose. While not as wonderfully designed and sturdy as grade-a teak, they also didn't cost $800 apiece. Awesome quality and style for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Lounge, huge pain to assemble!","review":"The chair is very nice. Sturdy and beautiful. My only complaint is that it was a huge pain to put together. I am pretty good at putting furniture together, but this was a horror! The instructions are worse than IKEA. None of the holes lined up easily, it took over 1 hour to assemble just 1. I bought 2, but the next 1 will have to wait for another day...I am exhausted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chaise Lounge","review":"Very impressed with the quality and price. Like the pull-out table. Great for holding drinks, books, glasses, phone within easy reach.

It's not rocket science but requires patience. One of the screw holes was slightly out of place making it impossible to put a screw there. It was at the foot end and has not been a problem (so far).One caution, it is a bit narrow for a medium to large sized man. No room to lay arms next to their body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice wood but insufficient hardware","review":"I purchase two chaise lounges for my sister's birthday.

They were easy for me to assemble myself. They looked good when I first put them together and still look very nice. It was a rough winter, but with simply keeping them covered they still looked good when I finally got to uncover them again for the summer. the sliding shelf sticks a little (but I expect that from wood in my climate) So far I am very happy with the purchase; I think they were well worth the money.Two year update:I left these lounge chairs out on my deck (w/furniture covers) over the winter again. It was a hard winter -lots of snow. These lounge chairs still look good accept for one of the wooden wheels cracking. I used wood glue and zip ties to fix. Once the wood glue set up.

I'm on my 3rd attempt, this time with the assistance of a POWER DRILL (no thanks, Allen wrench), and I STILL cannot get some of the screws to tighten all the way. At the rate I'm going, summer will be over and I will never get to actually sit outside in this chair.I recommend anyone considering this chair stay far, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution STAIN runs!","review":"I purchased two of these lawn chaises.

I received these within the past 2 weeks and since delivery they both have left stained marks on my BRAND NEW flagstone patio.

It is as sturdy as when I bought it.The other chair had no hardware and it's laying on my deck table. I cannot find an address for the manufacturer to get the hardware. Can anyone help?

The stain problem some people had i hope i remedied by putting a coat of teak oil on it and i bought nice covers for the chairs when not in use. I had all the hardware when delivered, the chairs were not damaged, and they went together like a dream. I would tell anyone to buy these chairs for their yard or patio."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but broken","review":"I just finished assembling this product and will probably figure out a way to repair the back adjustment bar that arrived with a split and broken dowel. The instructions were not always clear, but intuition kicked in and I got the job done. I recommend sorting out the various bolts ahead of time, so you can save yourself the aggravation of trying to match the bolts to the task at hand. The assembled product looks nice, but beware: besides the crushed dowel end on the backrest the wheels arrived with some cracks in place which will eventually cause product failure. I noticed that some folks have returned the chaise lounge to Amazon because of the same product problems.

After the first rain storm we noticed that our pavers were stained underneath the chairs. The stains became a deep rust color and we had to power wash and scrub the patio but the stains didn't come out. We then had to replace many of the damaged pavers and eventually placed a rug under the chairs to prevent any more damage. Any water including morning dew causes the chairs to bleed. We tried to return them but because it was longer than 30 days we were unable to get all our money back. I would not recommend these chairs if they are to be used on a patio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to beat for the price","review":"Simple to assemble, this wood is very hard with a fine, tight grain. Basic construction is pretty good with downling and good joinery. I'm a little over 200lbs and there's no creaking or flexing when you lay down on these. We'll see how it holds up (I'll have to leave them sitting out all through the New England winter because of space), but I figure even if I get 2 seasons use, it's less expensive than cheap plastic junk that blows around all over the yard, cracks easily, and is impossible to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruined my deck","review":"I bought 4 of these in 2005 and had them on grass.

The product used to stain this wood will completely wash off and destroy whatever is under the chair. We have tried power washing to no avail. Seems we will need to replace the entire section of patio stone that the chair was placed on. There is NO warning that this item will not hold up in rain, just the opposite, manufacturer claims this item is completely weather proof and only requires an occassional teak oil rub in order to avoid the \\"over-time weathering look\\" of exposed hard wood.

When the recliner arrived, I put it together WITHOUT tightening the screws - then tightened them all at the same time. Everything fit perfectly, all holes were perfectly aligned as they should be to create a very sturdy recliner. After reading many complaints about the stain running, I grabbed a can of clear matt polyurethane and painted the entire recliner. This took approximately 30 minutes and enhanced the stain on the wood. Now I have a water-proof, beautiful recliner that will not lose its stain no matter where it is. What a bargain!!! It took me approximately 1 hour to put it together and protect the finish. Well worth the tremendous savings I have enjoyed by purchasing this recliner!!! Very, very easy to roll around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strathwood chaise lounge chair","review":"Read other reviews before purchasing and almost didn't get this chair.

But the customer service was great.I did seal the chairs as some other reviews suggested. They look awesome!

I have a concrete pool deck and these chairs have never stopped bleeding and still stain the concrete. It's very unsightly, so I have to go through the trouble of moving them off of the concrete before it rains. My wife used an oil sealer on them to try to stop this and it did nothing. I am looking forward to replacing them but we need to try to get through another season or so.I'm giving this product 2 stars because I think they might be fine if they were located in an area where the staining wasn't a problem and also because they are inexpensive (you get what you pay for)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ever let it rain!","review":"The strathwood chaise lounge is probably a fine lounge, as long as it is not exposed to the elements. When it rains, the stain on the wood runs off and stains patios. The slide out table also warps everytime it rains and it takes several days before it will once again slide. I had reported this problem when I bought this lounge and was offered a replacement lounge which I took, hoping the first one was a fluke. Unfortunately, the same thing happened with the second one. The lounge was easy to assemble, seemed to be sturdy construction, and rolled easily on large wheels. So, if you have a covered area for the lounge, it is probably a fine product.

What is NOT appealing is the stain it leaves on the concrete when it rains. The stain used for these chairs run and create puddles under the legs, which I have not been able to remove using my power washer.

I have now thrown them away. They are completely trashed. The slats fall off if you even touch them. The screws the manufacturer used are miniscule. If you move the chairs, slats fall off. Maybe they would hold up if you kept them indoors at all times. It really annoys me, because I believed all the PR about these being sturdy and made out of a solid wood. What a piece of garbage and a hassle since I had to haul them out to a house in the middle of nowhere and then had to find a way of disposing of them two years later!

When they arrived, they were absolutely beautiful, comfortable, and exactly what we wanted. Then the wheels came off the bus. Literally. After only 2 summer months outside, the veneer on the wheels started to crack and pop off. We glued them back on, but they kept falling apart. After 6 months, the wheels completely fell apart, the finish on the chairs was flaking off, and the pull-out shelves wouldn't pull out anymore.

I have read plenty of the reviews concerning this chair. I was very amazed at the solid construction and materials used for the price. I will however plan to roll the chairs under a covered area if it looks like rain.. not only to prevent the stain transfer issue that many have mentioned, but also to help preserve the wood of the chair.

Neither of these things happened. The chairs were in perfect condition, and assembly took about 30 minutes total for both lounges. They look great and are very sturdy. We have already wheeled it to and from the other side of the pool, and it moves very easily. These are pretty much the identical chairs we priced at World Market for $200, so getting them half-price was a steal. The only drawback is the length, but we knew that going in. I am 6'3\\", and my feet will hang off the end if I rest my head at the top. But hopefully some decent cushions will ease that problem.

I couldn't find anything even close to this price when I was looking to buy. They are easy to put together. I did it myself without any problem.

I can't really speak to the issue of the color washing off in the rain. I live in Phoenix & it doesn't rain much! I got nice cushions for them at K-Mart for about $35 each.

Graphics get a 10 out of 10. The sound is great too. Other than that, there are way too few tracks and cars, gameplay modes, especially multiplayer, are severely limited, and a ten year old would do better driving a real car than the controls on this game, which are nearly impossible to master. Now don't get me wrong, I own many racing games and am not saying the above just because I dont like the genre. True, it is a great game. However, Sony had the capabilities of making it an outstanding game. In other words, save your money for Metal Gear Solid 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"GT3 A-Spec Review","review":"This is in the top 3 of the most highly anticipated games for the PS2 system. Being in the top as follows: (Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec.) GT2 is the most realistic and graphical racing game in the world. Now with GT3 for PS2, It will smash GT2 and be way over the top of anything. GT3 promises to bring to a new level of graphic sophistication to the sim-like racing experience. The car models in GT3 are exact replicas of the real thing. A first in the series, rain and othe weather effects will be seen in GT3. If you're looking for a good reason to buy a PS2 and haven't been impressed with what you've seen so far, this is definitely a title that'll change your mind. Gran Turismo 3 A-spec is a system seller in every sense of the word. The only real limit is the number of systems that Sony has on the market at the time that the game comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay. Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about? When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation. The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring. This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want. If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love GT3!","review":"I got this game last year but I forgot to review it on this website.

Although it'd been out there for a few years, I just picked it up and am glad I did. I like the \\"fun\\" arcade style driving games, but I get bored with them after a while. GT3's realism keeps me playing the same track over and over and over, trying to beat my previous performance. I spend a lot of time in front of this game, bending the sticks on my PS2 controller, much to my wife's chagrin.If you like fun driving games, but are looking for something with more of a \\"self-challenge\\" feel to it, try GT3."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kicks the @$$ outta the other driving game!","review":"Alright this is yet so far the best realistic,simulation driving game in the whole entire world yet so far!Move over X-BOX graphics (Im no X-BOX hater since I have it) and come in Gran Turismo3!GT3 is yet far the most impressive simulation ever seen in peoples lives!-----------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay= This is a great game for all your peeps that keeps it realistic..but I hate the fact that its too real..The cars really dont move fast as far as other racing simulation but this beats the heck out of every realistic driving!-----------------------------------------------------------------Graphics= Even thou the X-BOX has a better processor, Gran Turismo is the best graphiced game ever!

The Porsche Turbocharger, RUF, is on the game with some boxsters, a 911, and a 959. No Ferrari or McLaren. The Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Grand Vitara is the best on the game next to the F/868, F/896, F/090/, and the F/094s Formula One Cars. I love this game because I'm a car nut. I love all cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Ok, to start off this game is really awsome! It features THE best graphics that I have ever seen in my entire life. The visuals are just absolutly breathtaking! Also, this game is the best racing game of all time. It includes real life physics, excellent AI, and of course lots and lots of real life racing cars! Prehaps the only drawback to this game is the fact that there are no crash effects, so your car never gets damaged. If you really would like to show off the power of your Playstation 2, then just pop this game in and you will be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well made game.","review":"This is a VERY enjoyable game. With over 100 different cars (even though less than the 400+ cars in GT2) but every car is rendered very realistically and performs very realisticly. I enjoyed playing this game a lot and the replay value is pretty good (not as good as some other games like Grand Theft Auto 3) but I have played this game a good few months now and I am still playing it. The maps were very realistic and very fun to play, I am a car lover and I had a great time playing this game.Too bad they left out some cars like Porche (sp?) but still has a good selection.Note to beginners: When getting your first car, don't upgrade it because after you do, you will probally still lose the races. That was my mistake and it took me a while to gain enough money to get a better car that was worthwhile to upgrade.If you want a racing game, this is definitely the one.Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"non-stop speed","review":"I have been in love with the title Gran Turismo since it came out. If you have played the other Gran Turismo's than you know the deal buy it and sit in front of the television (hopefully you have a 36\\" WEGA) all night long trying to get all the licenses. Well other than that the game is beautiful in graphics, the controls are easy to remeber and the soundtrack is off the chain.

If u like ur games to have a little more substance then u won't like this. I will admit that the built-in rumble feature on the controller really adds to the realism.

The first two weeks I owned the game, I stunk. I couldn't get licenced, and was driving into walls, grass, other cars, etc. So I decided to read the directions (hey, I'm a guy, we don't read directions!). There are very good driving techniques written by Skip Barber (whose racing school I attended) and from that point on, my skills increased.The cool thing about the game, is that the more you win, the better cars you can buy, and the better modifications you can make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"GT3 is a really good game, period. The graphics are very good except for a few race tracks where buildings appear out of nowhere and very fuzzy grandstands. This license exams are very challenging and take great skill to even pass the tests, so dont even think about getting all golds right away (took me forever to get all golds on all licenses). There are some unrealistic factors though. If your car is the same car as a computer racer, there car is way more faster, so on races where only one car is allowed, modifications are needed on cars. It is definately a good game and has excellent replay value. If you dont have this game yet, get this before you get Resident Evil Code: Veronica X or any other hot new game out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still haven't finished playing it.","review":"This game is unique in every way. First off, the graphics. That is what got my attention in the first place. Second, the cars, my favorite of all the Chrysler. Third, the courses, all liscenced and realistic. There are many features in this game like, Sunday Drives, Championship races, Classic Car drive shows, Rally and tune shop. More and more are available to say but i ain't got that much time. Well, if you liked this game or you're thinking about buying it, get GT4 instead. This game is great as far as i'm concerned but GT4 is the advanced version and has twice the features this game has. Plus it claims to have ferrarris motor bikes and drag racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st place game!","review":"GT3 A-Spec is the coolest racing game I've ever played!

The soundtrack is awesome!

Don't expect much action with Gran Turismo 3 as you will be spending all your time trying to qualify or unlock tracks to race. The game is not fun because of all the requirements and things you have to do with menus and licenses before you can even race some of the levels. The game's one BIG plus are the graphics. You will be amazed at how smooth and well presented everything is.GT3 has all the same tracks as the previous GTs. The interface is very confusing. I got lost in all the menus. The game was not clearly thought out as far as game play enjoyment. This is the only racing game that prevents you from racing. Try Need for Speed, R4 or one of the Wipeout games if you want to have racing fun. I would skip GT3. If you are serious about purchasing it, rent or borrow it first.

I didn't like cars that much before I bought this game, but now I'm getting into them. The physics are pretty real (although I've never driven at 150 MPH) except for the crash physics. There is no damage physics in this game. If u hit a wall, the car slows down, but it escapes unscratched. I though this was weird, and it does detract from the game a little, but then I thought of what the game would be like if there was damage. Crusin down a straight away in your 2 million dollar car when the CPU cuts you off, sending you into the wall. There goes a couple of weeks of work. Fortuneatley this never happens.

Its a lot of fun even though I'm not very far yet and have only driven a coupl eof the cars. But, this game does have a couple of flaws:1. There are way too few cars. For whatever reason the number of cars has greatly diminished compared to GT2. Not only that, but there is less variety. Instead of putting in different cars they put in a bunch of different types of the same car. There are like 6 Lancer Evolutions and no Honda Prelude, for example.2. There are only 2 possible camera angles you can use while playing the game. The in car angle is Ok, but you cannot see the front of your car which is kind of weird. The other angle is bad because your car blocks your view of the track ahead of you making it hard to drive. I liked the farthest zoom out angle in GT2 but it has been eliminated in GT3.Other than that its a pretty good game and i definitely well worth the $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"the racing game","review":"This is THE racing game for PS2 - great for parties or just playing alone - and can teach one about physics.....a solid purchase - worth the money -"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but flawed","review":"Fun game, but it's not realistic in the sense that the cars don't show damage.

The game is great but has some mistakes sony entertainment shouldn't have done.1. They got rid of used cars so you have to buy a new car no matter what even though they stopped production years ago (ex.1990 Mazda Rx-7 Efini III.). 2. when you start advancing in the game you go to professional leage it isn't professional its the same as amateur leage but has even more laps (15)and after a while gets boring. 3. Predictable AI. and Lastly they could have made the licence tests a tad easier ( Super Licence is extremly hard). Sony should make the cars body panels be changeable and the spoilers as well. You should be able to change the cars color as well. If you don't mind this stuff or you just started playing GT3 you'll enjoy it.

With custimization options galore and over five licenses to attain simulation fans will not be disapionted either. The graphics are the best on the Playstation 2 with no fog or clipping. The soundtrack is decent as well with Lenny Kravitz Judas Priest and the late Jimi Hendrix among those contributing. GT3 makes fine use of the Playstation 2's many ports. The Logitec steering wheel uses the USB ports and is a must have accessory but the usage of the I-link ports is what makes the game really special. Connect up to three PS2's and up to six players to one game. This is the only racing game that matters"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Time's A Charm","review":"When I first rented this game I was sceptical about how great it was going to be, espically after Gran Turismo 2. But this game really impressed me. The graphics are very close to being reality. 2 Weeks later i bought the game. If you have the money, but the game. The wost part of the game is that there are American made cars. Nobody should buy an american made car unless its the dodge viper. there are many other good car companies like Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, TVR, Aston Martin, BMW, and Subaru just to name a few. There is even the mini cooper. You can win An IRL car and even race rally. there is factory sponsored cars such as Tom's Supra. The computer uses Aritfical Intellegence to make the game more realistic and more fun, i would give this game 10 stars if i could, because it deserves every one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal game for hardcore racing fans.","review":"GT3 is the amazing sequel to the criticaly acclaimed gran truismo series. GT3 features amazing graphics that are still impressive today. The graphics are just the tip of the iceburg however. GT3 is one of the most challenging racers ever made and has the highest review for any PS2 game on IGN.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice game if you don't want a realistic racer","review":"Don't get me wrong. The cars look great. The parts upgrades are awsome. But there is darn little realism in the racing. Got a problem with the guy right ahead of you? Just smack him into the wall on the next turn. Sure, you'll slow down some, but he will slow down a lot and you won't do ANY damage to you car. Nope, no matter how bad you screw up and hit the wall, you still have a factory clean race car with no mechanical problems. I prefer there to be some sort of realism with collisions, but that may just be me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but nothing great.","review":"It offers a wide array of cars, but lacks some of the best ie Ferrari, Porsche, and Lambroghini.

Sure they speed up and slow down, but sideways drift cannot be initiated to slide the car to the proper line around a corner. Real racing involves pointing the car at the curb then using the gas pedal to just force the car out from the curb. Throttle input with this game actually does the opposite, and tightens the corner. Drifting wide in real car? just lift the throttle a little and car comes closer to the apex. Not so here, drifts are impossible to stop without the brake pedal."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not that great","review":"This game is very challenging.

Like the other person who says GT2 and the original (which I only have a demo of) get boring is right. This game is only fun for about only 1 min and the licenses are TOO HARD! TOO HARD! Well don't buy it it is dreadful. Garbage controls. rubbish handling and very hard races and less cars and only a few more tracks makes this game a real loser.

The game has turned into a massive menu maze in which you must navigate and modify every little aspect of your car. The licsense module is also a pain to use. You must complete and sucessfully pass all the different course tests etc, in order to race certain tracks and events. The racing courses are the same ones from the previous GT's. This is part of the problem of the game as well. If you have played both GT1 and two, there are not many new courses for you to race on. The couses are just from the previous versions with upgraded graphics.The graphics are superior, but the game drags on and on with the menus and upgrade screens. This game is no longer a racing game as much as it is a game dealing with menus. At it still would be a waste of your money. You would do better to just rent the game and save yourself, yet another game, that will just sit on the shelf collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!!","review":"Why do people have to have realistic games. The whole point of a video game is just that. It is a game, which is meant to give you a feeling of fun.

I'll admit that the graphics are pretty good, but the gameplay stinks! There are way too many cars, and so little levels. I had the game for 1 day and I already wanted to return it. The handling is also extremely horrible. Every time a played it I wanted to put a frickin' axe straight through the TV! This game is just a big copy of GT2, and that's all.

This game is down right good but not great. I think the graphics take all of the credit (which they do). This game is awsome but the races can get boring fast. Then if you wanna race more advanced races you have to get a licence, and that is not fun. I like the replays and the way everything looks in this game. The controls are very good and I like the analog botton use. This game is not the best but is good. If you like racing games I would rcomend you get this game or Vanshing Point for PSone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars if you never played GT","review":"Great game, the graphics are out of this world, the feel of the car while driving is second to none...after playing this game every other racing game seems like a bad version of Pole Position.If you're into racing this game is definitely it, there is nothing on the market that even comes close.

The graphics are just fantastic, the sound is good and the music aint bad.When I first sat down to play it I did find it fustrating, as an veteran GT & GT2 player I did find difficult. But after a good hour or so I started to get used to it, and it's not so bad.Overall I would recommend this game, probably not for younger players."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best game I've ever played!","review":"The best racing game availible right now is Gran Turismo 3. This game has it all. I enjoyed playing it but I found the gameplay sucking up all of my time. I got a little tired of having to constantly save my game to a Memory Card and there are way to many races to be completed in one sitting. I've thought about this, Arcade mode took me 6 hours alone to complete, so I have a very simple solution, the Playstation 2 designers need to develop a hard drive made only for PS2. That way, I could enjoy the game a heck of a lot more without the hastle of saving every minute. but overall, Gran Turismo 3 remains #1 on my list of favorite games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"Just my second PS2 game (Madden 2003 was the first) and I was immediately hooked.. great graphics, realistic driving, great variety and an all-around extremely fun game.

The first and only time I used this tape, it put my 18-month old son to sleep!

If this is the best Nick Lyon could do while in film school perhaps he should have taken up carpentry instead. To everyone in the film industry worldwide: \\"PLEASE NEVER LET NICK LYON NEAR A MOVIE CAMERA, EVER, EVER AGAIN!!!!!\\" SHAME ON THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT!!! The only reason this DVD was released is to shamelessly try to cash in on Xenia Seebergs popularity and sucess with \\"LEXX\\".

Xenia seeberg is an ok actress with a nice body. She couldn't do anything to make it worth watching. I gave It a star because I liked the music video \\"Here comes the pain\\". If you are a hard core Christian don't watch it. It has Chist on a cross cursing. It has a music video with a remake of a Depeche mode song \\"never let me down again\\". I never thought I would see Xenia seeberg singing never let me down again in a wild west saloon wearing 1800's atire. The man singing with her has a very annoying voice. Like nails to the ears.

Every time I try, I get an \\"unexpected file format\\" error, and I have tried on a couple of different computers. Of course, since I purchased it so long ago, I can't even return it. I am upset that the publishers didn't make an effort to make sure the files would work for everyone. There is nothing anywhere in the book that specifies if you need to be using Mac or Windows, and I can't even complain to the publishers because their Web site is all in Korean. $30 wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations!","review":"I really had high expectations before receiving this book. The author is known for creating books that show really cool tutorials (i.e. Photoshop). This book really disappointed me. When I saw \\"Accelerated\\" I pictured a book that explained the secrets behind what you see on the web. Instead it's a pre-school style book that takes you through the most basic steps. Not in any way meant for the intermediate to advanced user of Flash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash mx 2004 accelerated","review":"This book is not what you want, you don't learn much as most of the guides are half done on an enclosed CD. Also, it does not cover much on action script, which i believe is one of the main aspects of Flash Mx. There are better books out there that teach you to create flash objects from scratch (meaning you won't end up in a confused mess thinking, how did they do that). on the plus, the book is clear, well presented and a few of the projects are easy to follow. in my opinion there are better books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just shoot me in the foot...please!!!!","review":"With the word \\"ACCLERATED\\" I thought it would mean atleast at little bit above average.

I believe the plot and the research stand on their own. I do recommend this novel to any adult reader. I do so believing that the reader will come away from his experience with a new opinion about the second amendment, individual responsibility and the unending assault on freedom that must have moved this author to pen such a passionate (if over-long) book.I have recently added a similar treatise on freedom to my library-just as thought provoking and entertaining but less, much less to slog through. \\"Transfer\\" by Jerry Furland is a gem of a novel that will snap your notions about where we are headed as a nation like a dried twig."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO WONDER THE BATF WENT AFTER JOHN ROSS","review":"Great book. I couldn't put it down. If the government doesn't get its act togather, and if history is any indicator, John Ross's book might be more then a Historic novel.

It is the primere sorce for second amendment information."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of John Ross's best novels","review":"This is a well researched & written story. It gripes you right from the start and keeps you on the edge till the last page. Not many books have kept me reading page after page just to see what was comming next.

Well worth the time & price.Unintended Consequences"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book Entertaining but Frightening","review":"I liked the book. Definately too long but I also understand why it is. There is so much history that goes into the telling of this story. The terrible things foretold in this book could one day come true. Our govt is currently not a servant of the people as intended. It is however reaching into the lives of every citizen in this country and many times with negative results. I see this book as bringing all these intrusions to the attention of the public. Not just intrusions into gun ownership but also into business and all areas of private life. The govt has no business in many of these areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading despite the trashy sub-plot","review":"A ham-fisted and sexually perverse approach to a vitally important subject. A good editor might have made this a classic. This book's worth reading, but it's not a classic nor is it second only to the Bible. Ignore the hype and you'll find the substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most informative and compelling books I have read","review":"In writing Unintended Consequences, Mr. Ross has broached a subject that has been veiled from many people by the veil of the media. This is a necessary read for all Americans who care about their freedom and the their rights. I have grown up with guns, and the people who love them. I am also familiar with the unnecessary strong arm tactics of the employees in the BATF. A family in my hometown was raided under the auspices of conspiracy. The only evidence that the BATF acquired before sending their troops in was a tip from an informer. The results of the raid: no contraband seized, no laws broken ( except by the feds ), and small injuries to the residents of the house due to the rough treatment the troops gave them. Mr. Ross has done an exceptional job of exposing the injustices done by our federal government. My strongest fear that comes up is the fear that the events described in this book could become reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent if somewhat overworked","review":"Wow! If this book had been written more tightly, it would be a 10. As it is, it's important enough that you should read it. The long-winded discussion of specific guns and the history of certain firearms is boring after a while, even for a gun-nut like myself.If this book was maybe half as long, it would be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb story - a bit wordy","review":"My husband and I are not big gun owners and I really don't have much interest in guns. We do have a gun in the house and we do support the right to keep and bear arms.Now that I've established my bias up front, please urge everyone to read this book that you can. The debate is not over. Complacency will end it if people do not understand the issue. Unfortunately, this is a niche book that appeals and is known to a niche audience. I recommend Claire Wolfe, Jerry Furland, Vin Suprynowizc, and of course, John Ross to anyone I can get to listen. You can forget any major media exposure for these authors. It ain't gonna happen! We have to make it happen. We came, we read, we spread, and hopefully, we will conquer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking look at the decline of individual rights","review":"As an avid member of the \\"gun culture\\", who has been witnessing the steady decline of our individual rights relating to firearms, I was intrigued by this novel. Loaded with factual data relating to actual events and policies, as well as a large amount of very interesting gun discussions, this book grabs your attention from the start.I was particularly interested in the portrayal of the Bureau of Alchahol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), as I have long held the notion that this agency was unconstitutional from the word \\"GO\\". John Ross has done a remarkable job authoring a fictional novel, complete with good character development and plot lines, that opens our eyes to what is happening to our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"For real troopers only","review":"If you can navigate through this 1,000-pound book, you're a better man than I. You'll encounter jargon galore about shooting and be encumbered with details that only serve to slow down the book's tortoise-paced plot. The book's views on liberty and freedom are worth reading, but I wasn't able to digest this format. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ideas, bad novel","review":"I agree with the principles that Ross shouts throughout this book, but I can't get past his lack of literary skill. From reading the reviews, I gather that people who enjoy the gun culture forgive the amateur writing. But those who come looking for another Atlas Shrugged had better look elsewhere. Unlike Ayn Rand, Ross won't win over new converts. He simply amuses those who think like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book, it's not really about freedom...","review":"...it's about sex, Sex, and more SEX.I found the main plot with the firearms history, loss of freedom, fighting back, etc. interesting and compelling; however, the authors took this good and informative story and poisoned it with tons of sex. I can take some sex in a book, but this was all pervasive and sick. It has everything including rape, homosexual rape, lesbianism, and oral sex, often in great detail. The two main female characters are lesbians, one was kidnapped as a teenager and became a mistress/prostitute for a crime boss, and one (I think it was the same one) becomes an exotic dancer at a topless nightclub.Some reviewers have compared Unintended Consequences with Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, but there is no comparison. Atlas Shrugged is a great story and a great piece of literature, read it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the word novel","review":"If you want completely unbelievable characters, twisted history, and awful writing this is the book for you!To start with, this book does more to harm \\"gun culture\\" than it could ever possibly help. It caters to the most extreme fringes of those involved in firearms. Any one who isn't as extreme in their views that happens on this book will be solidly put off.On top of this is some of the worst pacing and characterization I've had the pleasure to read in years. LITTLE DID THIS AMAZON BUYER KNOW IN THREE DAYS HE WOULD RECEIVE A TERRIBLE BOOK pretty much matches most of what I loosely call foreshadowing. Every main character is a carbon copy with superhuman skills and one minor and utterly unimportant flaw to differentiate them.I can only recommend this if you believe the government will overthrow the Constitution in the near future and you want to know how to use non-existing ammo to kill ATF agents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Especially good for firearms enthusiasts.","review":"One characteristic of this book is that it takes a while to get to the more exciting parts. However, the early wind up is very interesting for people who have some technical or historical interests in firearms and the shooting sports. So, for the firearms enthusiast, the book is good all the way thru. For the average reader, the book has more of a build up.The last third of the book is electrifying - I could not put it down and stayed up late nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it's scary...could easily come to be!","review":"Fantastic for its research and accuracy, I learned more than a few things about the illegal nature of the present gun laws and how they got to the point they are today.

I do feel it might have been added to by having foot notes indicating the 'facts' mentioned. Other than that Mr. Ross did an wonderful job of research in every aspect of his first work. He truely should be applauded for his efforts. Every Congressman, Senator, and membor of the legal community should be sent a copy and it should be required reading in every history class in every school in this Nation. I am looking forward to a sequel, maybe in the non-fiction section"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book but ....","review":"John Ross did a great job with the facts and history associated with guns in America within his story. It started off somewhat slow but picked up speed quickly. The use of facts to set the tone of the story ran the gamut of happiness, to sadness, and ultimately to anger. This book is a fascinating walk through America's history of gun ownership with an ending that is too plausable to think about.The only drawback to this story is John Ross' seemingly fascination with sex. Using whores, to the rape of a male, to group sex. I would not allow my child to read this book because of what he put into the story and sadly, put this in unnecessarily. John Ross went beyond the need to \\"add\\" spice to a story that would have better without the additives. Hence, the reason for two stars. If he would have left most of the filth out of the book, I would give it 5 stars. It is too bad that John Ross did not realize that his story was good enough to stand on its own without the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions, unintended consequences","review":"First off, I'd like to say that I am an avid gun enthusiast. That being said, I jumped into the (rather voluminous) pages of Unintended Consequences expecting an interesting and well-versed story about gun culture. What I got was a history lesson for about a quarter of the book, followed by some filler, which decided to devolve into masturbatory murder fantasy for the obvious Mary Sue character. The plot was somewhat enjoyable for around 300 pages, but completely stepped off the literary diving board after a few oddly placed rape scenes, involving both a female side-character and (strangely enough) the main character. And no, the main character in this case was not the perpetrator. Scenes include shooting helicoptors out of the sky via anti-tank rifles, mass explosions, and a ludicrous American insurgency scenario. The author, John Ross, is quite literally everything that America pictures as the typical \\"gun nut\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I thought this book was great in content, story and writing. I didn't see hardly a single flaw & have read many hundreds of books. I read it straight through in about 3 days. I did have two complaints: 1) This book is huge! Not just 800 pages, but 800 pages of small type hard cover edge to edge pages! 2) About 3 times there was sexual material. I'm far from a prude, but each of these were way to graphic and seemed very out of place in the book. For this reason I can't let my kids read it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 'frog being slowly boiled'...","review":"I am not sure what I expected when I started reading this HUGE book, but I came away with an education and a sharpened perspective. Unfortunately, I fear the book is too long for most people to read, and it contains some unnecessary sexual and violent content rendering it mostly unsuitable for use in schools.I grew up in the 'gun culture' here in Texas in the 60's and 70's, and while I was aware of the ever increasing federal encroachment on our rights, I am sad to say I was the 'frog being slowly boiled.'

My original hesitation stemmed from the book's size and cost. The truth is that this book *is* extremely long, but not due to the author's lack of skill or editing, but rather due to the massive database of verifiable information he presents within the context of his fiction. The scope of this work is stunning, but also stunning is the fact that the book is filled with compelling characters and believable situations. I have learned a tremendous amount from the discussions of the American \\"gun culture,\\" from the dissertations on the events surrounding existing firearms legislation, and from the perspective Mr. Ross gives seemingly disparate events. I am buying copies of this book for friends, I believe it is that important.

(I'm a merchant seaman). The novel was so well written in a literary style that I couldn't put it down until I finished it (in between my required 8 hours of work aboard ship). The novel inspired me to learn more about the Second Amendment and the gun rights debate. The more I researched, the more I learned. Which in turn, lead me to more research until I learned enough to put up my own personal Web Page with the theme \\"Defending Freedom\\" through legal knowledge.

It is truly a wake up call to the loss of our rights as American citizens. I have told many of my friends and readers on my political list to READ this book. It tells about gun issues and more. We need more of Henry the hero in REAL LIFE. We need to get Big Brother OUT of our lives and get back to the basics. Thank you.

I'd love to see a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Faint Hearted","review":"A long read and a little slow at the beginning, but once Mr. Ross got moving, it was excellent. The troubling part is the accurancy of the depiction of the government. This book isn't fiction, it is a prediction of our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintended Consequences","review":"Bad.

And negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Are Known by the Company You Keep","review":"Those of you, and there seem to be many, who have endowed this book with five stars should be aware that Timothy McVeigh, the convicted Oklahoma City bomber, has embraced it totally, calling it his \\"New Testament.\\" (See \\"American Terrorist, Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing.\\") Perhaps you should be more careful whose ideas you choose to espouse. This book is the manifesto for every delusional paranoid who honestly believes the government is about to knock on his door and take away all his guns before enslaving him and selling his wife and daughters into white slavery. It was this very same set of delusions that led McVeigh to take the lives of 168 innocent people, including 19 babies, on that April morning in 1995. It sends shivers down my spine to know that Timothy McVeigh has so many kindred spirits out there, some of whom probably dream of carrying on his \\"work.\\" View this book as the paranoid trash that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book on the disaster called \\"gun control\\"","review":"A recent post to talk.politics.guns (UseNet) described individual BATF agents hassling vendors at gun shows.

I still recommend this book to be in anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, whatever the cost.","review":"This is honestly one of the best books I've ever read. I wasn't really into reading much until after the ar15.com guys said this was a must-read. At nearly 900 pages long, I figured it'd take me a couple months. I was done in a week and a half of telling myself \\"I'll read until midnight and then go to sleep.\\" That'd end around 3AM when I was finally able to force myself to put it down. I've loaned it out to two other people, both loved it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gun Control Meets \\"Term Limits\\"","review":"This book was like reading \\"A History of Gun Control and Gov't Oppression\\" meets Vince Flynn's \\"Term Limits\\". It's L-O-N-G, but the reader is given a pretty accurate lesson in the history of gun control in America. Part fact, part fiction, the book touches on how much freedom we have lost and how much gov't. control over our daily lives has been incrementally instituted in America in just one generation. If you're looking for Pulitzer Prize winning character development and plot, this is not the book. However, if you enjoy any of the shooting sports, own a gun, or cherish freedom, you should read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read and a thought provoking book","review":"I'd highly recommend this book, not only is it a great read, but it also addresses both history and current events. The background on gun \\"control\\" legislation is very complete along with a good description of various firearms.

How many of us can say we are \\"that frog slowly boiling in the pot\\", not realizing that our Freedoms are being chipped away little by little. If this book were allowed to be required reading in all high schools and colleges it would have a definite affect on this country. This book will never get the attention of a Stephen King or Tom Clancy novel even though it is written by a man from St. Louis who shows he has as much if not more writing ablility for his first novel! Mr. Ross, when you get tired of plinking, this country could still use your talent to bring more of these issues to the peoples attention with more great books like this one.

I only wish that the legislative and media talking heads were required to read this damn near biblical work as a condition of office or employment.

You will not be sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"When is the Movie coming out?","review":"This book is and will likely remain my all time favorite. If you are a FREEDOM loving American this book will excite you. The books leads you into a web that will catch your emotions and heart. Depicts a culture that will soon be history . I would love to see it as a movie to get more exposure. Starts out a little slow and relaxed but gets going nicely. I was disapointed at the end that I had finished it. I wanted more. Should be required reading to see how much we have lost and how much we have to get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro-Gun or Anti-Gun Must Read","review":"Wow. What a great read! If you are pro-gun or anti-gun you will be amazed at this. Ross presents historical facts wrapped around his story line in a very intriguing fashion that shares how government can be the abusive force our founding fathers were afraid of. As you read Unintended Consequences you will ask or question if this can this really happen? The answer is yes and based on the historical information it has happened... and it can happen again. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"All I can saw is wow. A very interesting look into the \\"unintended consequences\\" of over-zealous gun control. The lines drawn between modern day and Nazi Germany of WWII vintage is downright scary. Many different types of readers may enjoy this however those who are in the \\"gun culture\\" will appreciate it most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unintended Consequences","review":"One of the best researched novels I have ever read. The scenarios are too real, the information to clear, the message is plain. We need to wake up if we wish to remain a free society. I commend the Author for being brave enough to use his real name, the Government is going to be very unhappy with the light he shines on their rape of our Constitution and Civil Rights. Read this book, tell your friends to read this book, tell your neighbors. It is not just for the \\" Shooting Population\\" it is for anyone who loves being free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Read and a sad commentary on the state of our Rights","review":"Wonderful book, could not put the thing down. I notice that most who have ranked it poorly have done so because they disagree with it's philosophy rather than it's merit as literature. Some will go to great lengths to squash things they done agree with. The book was very long, but after reading it I did not feel like there were ant loose ends, all subplots were explored to length. I thought the sex scenes were PERHAPS a bit overdone, but not enough to warrant a lower rating. I loved it, and agree with it. Do yourself a favor, READ THIS BOOK>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic but the ending is a bit rushed.","review":"Most of the events listed as historical did actually happen. This book details the tyranny that our government has become but thru a novel. Very good reading. You flat out won't want to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This book is a blessed work of art. I have never read anything that put so much information about guns, technical and historical, as well as the history and danger of gun-control laws, into one package that was so non-boring to read. It is in the same class with the classics by Frederick Forsyth, Tom Clancy, Ken Follett, and William Diehl, in grabbing your attention and not letting go. On top of all that, it has an emotionally satisfying ending. (Not something I can say for every novel I have ever read.) Don't be surprised if you see a bumper sticker on my car that says \\"Henry Bowman For President.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest book I have ever read!","review":"Unintended Consequences is the most engrossing work of fiction since Atlas Shrugged. While the mainstream media refuses to recognize its existence despite its large sales volume, word of mouth is spreading fast. This book will go down as the pivotal work of fiction for generations to come. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom in not free","review":"An absolute must-read for all firearm enthusiasts. This work is nothing less than life-changing. Historically accurate in detailing the atrocities of our governmental \\"jack-booted thugs\\": the BATF, FBI and in particular their slaughter of innocents at Waco and Ruby Ridge. Mr. Ross vividly describes the relentless erosion of gun rights by the socialist left leading up to a fictional but realistic conclusion.I recommend this book to all who believe an armed citizenry is the lynch-pin of this nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is an invaluable treasure!!!

I am mexican I came here to the University of Michigan to study my PhD in Signal Processing. Due to the fact that in Mexico the education standards are lower than in the USA I could not pass the qualification exam for my PhD degree in the first chance that I had to fullfill this requirement. Before I take the qualification exam in my last and final chance to pass it, I found Shakti's book. I applied crative visualization to pass the Qualification Exam, and in fact I PASSED it in my second and last chance to present it. Now I am sure that the book is an invaluable treasureof information and that everyone can achieve miracles in their lives!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Learn how to live for yourself\\"","review":"An inspirational read.

Several of my friends have also read it and it seems to have worked miracles for them. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this book will work for a certain strata of society (mainly overly educated upper middle class liberals)! Everyone I know who has experienced success thru reading this book was already living an extremely comfortable life. This book simply helped them succeed further in new areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power of Visualization","review":"Our minds are visual machines. And the images that we hold and replay in our minds guide the direction of our life.This book shows you how to change your internal images so you can improve the quality of life.It is a great book that not only talks in depth about the power of your inner mind but how to use visualization to create the life you desire.Another powerful book on the subject isThe Art and Science of Visualization: A Practical Guide for Self-Help, Self-Healing, and Improving Other Areas of Yourself. It also has a lot of practical techniques to help you manifest, change, and improve yourself and your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This book helped me to realize what's important to me, and what I would like to strive for in the future. The exercises in the book are especially helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to better themselves or their lives and relationships. It's well written and easy to understand. I've bought it for a few friends who are also benefiting from it immensely. I would especially recommend this book to anyone who feels stuck in their life / lifestyle and is looking to break free from a rut. It's an inspiring, uplifting and empowering book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Visualization Manual","review":"I wish I found this book years ago! I know visualization has become more mainstream since \\"The Secret\\" was released years ago, but this book is an invaluable resource that focuses on using visualization for living a wonderful life in all areas.I know a lot of people were focused on the creating wealth portion of visualization which I think is great, but the point of wanting anything from money to relationships is happiness. It's refreshing to feel the wonderful intention from this book of creating an inspiring, full life. Acquiring money is great, but as many rich people will tell you, what is money if you don't have health, peace and happiness.What you will find in this book:Creative Visualization BasicsHow to Use Creative VisualizationMeditations and AffirmationsSpecial Visualization TechniquesLiving CreativelyA wonderful book by Shakti that has made a profound difference in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the last book you need on visualization...","review":"Just about anyone who has read a self-help book with any kind of spiritual or meditative bent has been touched by book. Many people feel that it has never been surpassed in its simplicity and focus. Gawain takes time to explain the idea and process of meditation and visualization and then uses the information to look further in to concepts like flow, prosperity, healing, and self-image. Her writing is simple and the concepts are easy to understand. The book is surprisingly non-religious or spiritual unlike so many other books on the same topics. Might be the last book you need on visualization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always inspiring","review":"Ms Gawain has been a source of information and guidance for me since I read the first Creative Visualization book so long ago. At that time I used her ideas and methods to make myself a stronger runner and athlete. After I used it to become more knowledgeable and energetic in my job. Now I am using it to write my own books on motivation.In this new book she has taken the labor out of applying the new knowledge to real life. This will speed the process and make it easier for the reader to use the great knowledge and power that is contained in visualization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakti Gawain already knows The Secret","review":"Recently I picked up my copy of Creative Visualization and noted that I had written four big goals in March 2003 onto pages in the back of the book. By October 2004, I realized that three of the four goals were already complete and the fourth is still ongoing. I was so impressed with this that I have written two more big goals into the back of the book and I will order her Creative Visualization Workbook to enhance this experience. I don't know how it works, nor, according to Gawain, do we have to know -- just let the Universe manifest the details ... and it does. Easy to read; easy to understand. Shakti Gawain teaches, like the Buddha, with an \\"open hand\\" and no \\"secrets\\" held back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing/motivational book!","review":"I have read Shakti's \\"Creative Visualization\\" and \\"Living in the Light\\". Both were fantastic works of art that reinforced my life long thoughts that we all create our own future.

It has helped me to love myself more, and to realize the power of positive thinkng. It also has techniques to meditate and relieve stress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"If you want to acheive a goal in your life, give this book a try! The methods that Shakti describes are quite simple, and its almost like putting in an order for something and having it come true. Spiritual mail order, perhaps? This book is really handy, and you can change both a lot of things about yourself and a lot of things in your world with it. For further reading, her book \\"Living in the Light\\" is a good way to continue this process, but its a little harder to get into, especially if you're not a really spiritual person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lengthy and informative","review":"Since I am into manifestation subjects, I bought this CD and listened to it. I like it at first but as my listening went along, I noticed that Gawain's voice was getting tired or should I say boring. It doesn't diminish the value of this book though. I should know because I've already read her Creative Visualization book before.It's great for listening while working and driving. I just play it again and again. This is the same thing that I do for The Science of Getting Rich which is still my favorite manifestation CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Starting Place For Transformation & Healing","review":"A friend suggested this book to me when I told him I was feeling \\"stuck\\" and hindered in life. I didn't know what to expect, but I am so grateful I took his suggestion and bought it. I have learned so much about affirmations, meditation and the \\"clearing\\" process. This has helped me to get to the root of what is making me feel stuck, and also it shows me the way to actually do something about it. There is a flipside though: It does take work and consistent effort. You shouldn't just buy this book to get a feel-good buzz, read it once, then let it sit and collect dust. Creative visualization must become a daily habit for it to work. If you're someone who is trying to better yourself by understanding yourself better, and you're willing to put effort into your betterment, then this is definitely the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic book","review":"This classic is an excellent introduction to fine tuning your own reality from the inside out. The exercises will open and strengthen your heart and mind. The positive power and potential of visualization is made accessible and real through Shakti Gawain's gentle simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Visualization","review":"I have read a lot of self-help books and this one is the best I have read. This book takes you through techniques of relaxation and visualization successfully. I am now practicing visualization because of this book, and I can tell you that within a few weeks after I started I have been seeing solid results. I now practices the techniques everyday. It makes you welcome each and everyday of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine","review":"A lot of these reviews say that they've read this book and it's \\"done wonders\\" for them and everyone they've recommended it to. The book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things Gawain suggests. It's not a miracle cure-all book - it's about giving you the motivation to do something about your life instead of sitting back and watching the trail roll out behind you. I read this book in college when I was going through a little bit of a rough patch, figuring out what I wanted, etc. Now that I've graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world, I need more positivity in my life so I'm re-reading it in the hopes that I can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again. I highly recommend it to those who are open-minded enough to give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step by step visualization","review":"This book walks you through various visualization excercises.

It is a false belief that it is somehow inherently 'wrong' for me to desire wealth for myself.2.

For some reason, however, Source Naturals (a company I have always considered to be reputable, so I'm assuming this is just an error in someone's judgment that will be corrected sooner rather than later) has elected to add 400 micrograms of folic acid to each 300 mg tablet. Why do that? How does such a large amount of folic acid contribute to the metabolism of N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine? Other manufacturers add B-6, but SN is the only company I can find that adds folic acid. Given that high doses of folic acid are now implicated as a cause of lung, prostate and colon cancers, I cannot fathom why anyone who takes a multivitamin or a B-complex (because most contain at least 400 mcgs) would add to their risk by taking this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"Terrible product!

Thankfully I have more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got rusted and hurts by tongue.","review":"Previously I had good experience with steel tongue cleaner. But this product was horrible.

The shipping charge is $9.99 but the shipment notice indicated shipment via USPS and shipment showed a postage for $1.30. It arrived 10 days after placing the order. The seller should clearly indicate in the item description that it will arrive via snail mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look Inside the Vatican","review":"This is a look into the Holy City. We are shown how Pope Pius XII lives and works. And we also get a look at all those who work for and with him. So through vivid descriptions accompanied with photos we tour what daily life is like within the Vatican during 1949. Even though out of date today, this is a very interesting look at all facets of the operation of this small City State."},{"rating":"1","title":"The narrator seems to be ignorant about basic facts of Egypt history","review":"The whole set is a random collection of videos.

No complaints on the seller and the matching wrench racks are working well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"There's a reason pop music doesn't cross the Atlantic to the United States anymore. One, we learned our lesson from the Spice Girls. Two, it is sappy and overly packaged. These probably aren't even real people. It sounds incredibly generic and simple minded. The lyrics aren't great either. The album is a bunch of love songs for 12 year-olds. Anyways, I don't recommend this album. Ethically speaking, don't support this. They'll stop putting out this trash if we don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the BEST of WESTLIFE","review":"This band has sold millions of copies all around the world, breaking numerous records whilst at it. They are in the Guiness Book of records for being the first band to ever have their first five songs go to number one. This cd is a collection of their greatest hits...my god then how did they come up with the title? These songs are soulfull, melodious and they are just some of the best ballads and pop that I have ever heard. I deffinatly recomend this to anyone who has been in love, fell out of love or just plain likes to listen to good music! Best of Westlife means the Best of the Best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"supergroup\\" (snigger)","review":"Pop music nowadays is really known for being simple minded, but this band take that to a whole new level. A supposed \\"supergroup\\", because 11 of their singles got to number one, DONT be fooled, they only got there because of young kids who know no better. obviously i didnt waste my hard earned cash on this [stuff], unfortunately one of my friends did. After listening to some of it, i soon realised that track 1, sounds exactly like track 5, which sounds just like track 12, which has the same vibe to it as track 7 etc etc. Westlife are just another boy band, nothing special, just following in the footsteps of nonces like boyzone etc. If you are from the usa, consider yopurself lucky that you don't have to put up with this \\"band\\" as they for some unknown reason, failed to break america, wonder why......? If you want to listen to some real music try early metallica or the foo fighters, or anything really but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great collection of their hits...","review":"alright these guys are great...they are mostly known for ballads..but they have some few great up temple songs...westlife is a great band..and i love alot of their songs...\\"swear it again\\"\\"If i let you go\\"\\" up town girl\\" a cover of the billy joel hitall and all they are a great boy band....more sugar pop..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Westlife really are unbreakable","review":"Westlife's greatest hits album is a good overview of their careers. It also includes 6 new songs that I personally love, my favourites are Miss You Nights and Unbreakable. The boys continue with their heart warming ballads and the amazing vocals that fans have grown to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and sexy","review":"The play is now extremely politically incorrect, but this brilliant production is hilarious, and EXTREMELY sexy. This is the role that established Marc Singer, as a Petruchio who just CAN'T keep his shirt on. If you think Shakespeare's comedies aren't funny, watch this one and see how wrong you are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!! Love it!!","review":"I saw this years and years ago on tv so I got into Shakespeare.It was so much fun to watch it and it was the first time I sawMarc Singer in anything and then he went on to star in \\"V\\". SoI was really excited to see this performance available so I canwatch it any time I want to. Its still a great performance soif you enjoy fun performances as well as Shakespeare, watch/buy this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare meets commedia dell'arte","review":"This is quite possibly the best adaptation of \\"Shrew\\" ever performed. It's faithful to the original material, but performed in an energetic, comedic style that has to be seen. So many productions of even Shakespeare's comedies are performed in a stiff, boring style because He is The Bard, after all - they're forgetting that he was a hack writer who just wanted to make a living writing plays.This doesn't completely fix the misogynistic, sexist source material (hey, Shakespeare lived during the Sixteenth Century - you want him marching for sufferage or something?), but it manages to suppress it to the point that it isn't nearly as bad.If you need to own a copy of the Shrew, this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!","review":"Too bad you don't have a rating less than one star. This was a clown show, not Shakespeare! If you like acrobatics and seeing Marc Singer's bare chest, then go for it. But if you're looking for Shakespeare look elsewhere. This tape will be a major candidate for taping over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best version of this play!","review":"This is the play that began my love of shakespeare! The exceptionally funny wordplay is mirrored by fast-paced slapstick which never fails to elicit gales of laughter. Marc Singer is the quintessential Petruchio and the chemistry between the leads is as good or better than that between Burton and Taylor in the more well-known version. This is terrific!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids who hated English loved this!","review":"Since it was first produced, I have been turning students on to this exceptional version of the play. Drama kids loved it, of course, but so also did my \\"regular\\" English students, who were so enthralled and entertained that I would watch their faces instead of the show. The bawdiness and the sheer energy of the production, plus the sharp, clear interpretations by all of the actors, make the show unbelievably easy for all audiences to understand and enjoy. Shakespeare wrote for the masses, and this proves it. Only someone who is completely intolerant of all slapstick could fault any aspect of the show. It is not the 3 Stooges--it is biting, literate comedy of the highest order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all Michelangelo multimedia titles","review":"I have 4 CD-ROM multimedia titles concerning Michelangelo and this one is the best by far. The interface and graphics are superb. You can access information on this disk in a number of ways. For example you can step thru his life, year by year, or access specific works of art. Also, there are many pieces about other famous historical figures that had an influence on Michelangelo's life. It is very well written. I find myself popping the the CD into my computer from time to time and drifting back to the 1500's."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit better than shave secret, but still doesnt work well","review":"i bought both this and shave secret they both blow but this ones a bit better i tried one on each side of my face less burn with kinexium but like i said still no good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I bought this for my husband and he loved it.

I like her suggestions about exercises and they are practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have been looking for a history and filmography of Hammer Studios films for awhile now. This book turned out to be very disappointing. Half the movie stills didn't have captions and the plot summaries had glaring errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you always wanted to know about Hammer Films","review":"This reference book provides excellent behind the scenes looks at not only the films in Hammer Studio's famous Dracula and Frankenstein series, but all their other horror films (e.g., \\"Quartermass and the Pit\\"). You will read about Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, of course, but also of Terence Fisher and some of the other directors the studio employed to lesser degrees of success. I especially like when Hunter talks about how the studio decided to approach the Dracula series (you know I have a soft spot in my heart for the undead). It is amazing how well I remember so many of these movies and I know I have not seen them for years. Fortunately, AMC has been running a lot of Hammer films on Friday night's this year. Not a scholarly work, \\"House of Horror\\" is a treat for fans, not academics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in the extreme","review":"This book had a couple of big flaws. One was that much of the material was superficial and obvious. The other was that it was terribly written, and must have had an unskilled editor. After reading a particularly incoherent \\"case study\\" that barely supported the book's thesis, and may have mildly undermined it, I just had to stop reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Can't Tell A Fairy from an Angel, This Might Help","review":"This book contains 53 important facts about fairies that a lot of fairy friends probably already know, at least in their hearts, but it will prove valuable as a resource for the poor challenged souls who cannot tell a fairy from an angel. It's a real treat for those of us who know fairies well. It is clever and humorous and also offers invaluable aids for the spotting of fairies if you don't already know how. The illustrations are wonderful and show fairies with complex fairy wings that look as though they have grown from an actual fairy and not from a butterfly or some other insect and certainly not from a bird! You will also see a dragon, fair lads, and fairy homes and gardens. Leslie D'Allesandro Hill has truly captured fairies in this cool book, but as she points out in fact number 22, \\"Fairies can be caught, but there are no containers to keep them in.\\" Catch this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the fairy lover","review":"Every fairy lover needs this book, adult or child. It's magical, funny, has great fairy art. I am waiting for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great toy","review":"I got this for my 2 year old as her first puzzle. She loves playing with it and wants 'puzzle time' at least twice a day if not more. She loves identifying the tail of each animal and lets out a thrilled \\"I did it myself\\" each time she successfully puts the pieces together. She genuinely enjoys playing with it - finding the tail each time and putting the pieces together. I am so encouraged by this toy, that I have just ordered 2 more infantino puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puzzles","review":"I bought this puzzle for my 2 yr old niece as a Christmas present.

I would Highly recommend this puzzle set and I will probably by the same set for my other niece as soon as she is old enough to enjoy them.Infantino Where's My Tail Puzzle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item received is different than pictured and not as good","review":"This puzzle is adorable and my son (at least from age 18 months - 2yrs) absolutely loves it - the one pictured that is, with the monkey, squirrel, and \\"Nemo\\" among others. He loves it so much I ordered one for a gift. Problem is the item is wrong, it's an Infantino puzzle that says \\"Heads or Tails\\" and has strange cartoon animals. Very disappointing. I contacted Amazon customer service and they apologized and sent a replacement which just arrived - again it's wrong. Be careful if you order sometime around the date of this review, you might get the same, lame version of this puzzle. -- Otherwise, the pieces are strong, it's well made for what it is, and my toddler loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 2 year old loved this","review":"Great for learning animals. I also used it as a matching game. The pieces were a little hard for my child to get together at first but once he had it down pat he was good to go. He loves these puzzles. Would highly recommend this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile puzzle","review":"Bought this for my 20-month old son. They're a bit too hard for him right now, but the pictures are very visually appealing, of good quality (not thin, but not superthick either; thick enough that they should withstand typical use by a toddler boy), and very educational. Looking forward to playing with them more in a few months time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price..","review":"I got the Infantino \\"Where's my tail\\" delivered last month, I opened it but was disappointed by the quality of thin cardboard animals.

This whole show is Cheesy. The music and lyrics are dull and boring. There are some cast members that are pretty good, but the show is bad. This is not one anyone needs to get. If your a collector of musicals, then by all means be my guest, but get the cheapest deal you can. Favorite song: \\"Hollywood Marriage Sham\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and Unuseful","review":"I bought four paperbacks on youth sports from Amazon recently and this was the worst. First, the printing of this paperback looks like a 2nd generation photocopy, the physical production quality is poor. Although it was lightly updated in 2001, most of the material is clearly from the original 1993 edition. If the author is deceased the publisher could be excused for not having updated it significantly since then, but otherwise this book is not worth selling or buying for more than about $3-$5. The advice is common-sensical, avuncular, milk toast quality, the usual points are made about kids just wanting to have fun and parents needing to calm down, etc. You'll likely learn nothing new here about how to grapple with the critical issues surrounding youth sports, there are no great insights or innovative approaches. The material is dated, tired, and uninspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Peterson","review":"THis book is a collection of songs that Oscar Peterson approved himself. These transcriptions of classic songs such as \\"Hymn to Freedom\\" and \\"Oscar's boogie\\" are in it however these transcriptions are for real. They are seriously hard to play because they literally are note for note. Only if you are a seriously good pianist should you get this book. The master of jazz has it hardcore here, no simple stuff. Its the real stuff. On the up side, its magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great drive - just dont use it to store data","review":"This was my fourth and possibly last LaCie drive.Loved the spec, size, footprint, speed and yes its fairly quiet.Unfortunatley however, and mine is not the first story, the drive is rather inept at actually storing data.The drive was partitioned into two drives and worked well untill it started not opening folders. Instead it returned error 'unformatted drive' messages. This then spread to the whole of one drive before the next.From reading other reviews the problem is the power down which wrecks the drive. Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"it fell apart","review":"On mine, one of the FW400 ports fell off because there is so little solder holding the port onto the circuit board.

Unfortunately, however, after I got it out of the box, attached, and working (which, as it's Apple-friendly, was as easy and simple as all the other reviews say it is) its operating noise was so piercing and annoying I eventually unplugged it, packed it back up and ate my $17.49 restocking fee. Not that everyone might be bothered by such a minor technical issue as this, but paired with a virtually silent 20\\" iMac, the run noise of this hard drive made me feel like I was using a 7500 all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all cost","review":"absolutely awful. Do not buy if you have a PC, comes with no software to allow you to backup your data, the tech support insisted that it is sold solely as an external hard drive. none-the-less they do have software for scheduled back-up for MACs. why? who knows.the drive itself vibrates so strongly that i had to take it off my desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check your cable...B4 connecting with SONY i.Link","review":"I bought the hard drive from amazon.com and a firewire 6-pin to 4-pin cable from eBay. I hook up the cable through i.Link port of my laptop. At the time,my computer couldn't detect the hard drive. Later, I found out the problem and then bought a new cable (Belkin #F3N401-03-ICE). Now, I can use the drive without any problems. I use the hard drive with my laptop,SONY FG-430, through S400 i.Link port OS/Windows 98SE. The drive works great. The process of installation with Windows OS is a little bit complicated. That's all...I can complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Quiet, Sturdy, Elegant","review":"On a Mac running OS X this drive is a breeze and a joy. Attach the base (if you are going to use it in a vertical position), plug in the power supply, plug in the firewire connectors, and there it is on your desktop. It is quick, relatively quiet, has a sturdy case, and it looks good next to my G4 Cube. I can't imagine a product meeting my needs -- storing photos, doing backups for our 4 Macs, holding music -- any better than this. I have owned LaCie products before and have never had a problem with one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable failure rate","review":"I have had two failures of this model in as many years. The same-model warranty replacement was as bad as the original. I would avoid this drive and vendor until they have reestablished a reputation for a modicum of reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never order a LaCie product again","review":"I own several of these drives, but I would never buy another product from LaCie again. I ordered directly from the company. When I didn't receive notice that the drive had shipped, I emailed the company. The reply I received from the company was shocking. It was an email making fun of my name, and how funny it is when you glance at it. It was then followed by another email stating they weren't laughing at my name, but merely commenting on it. This is unprofessional and immature. LaCie has lost me as a customer forever. I ended up purchasing the Maxtor 5000 dv. The Maxtor drive works better, and is a better value. From now on I am sticking with Maxtor, they don't insult their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing rocks","review":"I use mine to transfer video footage between a Power Mac G4 and an iMac G3 for use on FInal Cut Pro. It works without a hitch. You don't even have to turn it on because it does it for you when you connect the firewire to your computer. It's solid too. I haven't done it yet, but I bet you could drop it on cement and it would still work. I wouldn't try it either, but I bet it could take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable and fast","review":"I purchased this drive from an Apple store last year. Originally, it had a problem restarting after waking my Powerbook from sleep mode. At first I thought that it was a problem with OS 9, but I decided to contact LaCie's technical support anyway. They told me that some of the first shipment drives had a problem with a faulty board inside the casing. LaCie's tech support arranged to have the drive shipped back and repaired at no cost to me. Within a few days, I had my new drive repaired. It has been working perfectly ever since. When I upgraded to OS 10.2, the drive still worked perfectly. It is very easy to install and it is very fast and reliable. I use it mainly for recording audio, which requires speed and data integrity. The design of the case matches perfectly with my powerbook and is very compact and extremely solid. Although it is very quiet, it does make a soft, high-pitched whine while running, which can pick up in audio recording situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"For the price (which was a little high), I fully expected to get what I ordered. .......16 ounces of fresh Vanilla tootsie roll midgies.

Although the characters included are reminiscent of cartoons, the theory and suggestions provided can be applied to anyone creating characters for books or other needs. Although I haven't done it yet (and to be honest, probably won't) the project included in the book that you are supposed to do as you advance in your reading seems like a great excercise of the mind and pencil.

It's well recorded, with minimized audience sound. Beck displays his signature guitar work over the rockin' rhythm section of Appice and Bogart. They had been playing together as Vanilla Fudge, and then as Cactus for years before joining up with Beck finally, after he recovered from injuries from a car wreck. If you haven't heard the two Cactus \\"Live and Unleashed\\" double -CD\`s, seek them out immediately. I think Rhino has some of Vol. 2 left. That band rocked!Beck is understated here, but does some nice work. There is use of the dreaded \\"squawk box\\", but it is a more understated use of it, compared to say.... Peter Frampton or Joe Walsh. His sound as always is wonderful.Tim and Carmine's vocals are very much like their soulful Vanilla Fudge sound.

My favorite vids on this dvd (that remind me of oldskool rave loops) are #5 by Benton-C with Always (A Permanent State) by David James playing in the background and I love #7 by Madame Chao with Benno/Bodo by Darshan M. Lopez playing in the background. Props to Andy Ling for an awesome job with the progessive house/trance mix as well.

First, the neck rest is uncomfortably tight on me and two other women I have had try it. A man would have an even worse time. It should be at least an inch wider. Second, the arm strap is too short and isn't adjustable. It has no buckle so it has to go over the patients head. Upon putting one's forearm through the strap as the instructions say, the back of the tray flips up in the air. The patient has to get in an awkward arm position to hold the tray so it slopes down into the sink, and if the patient lets go, the strap goes around his or her throat. If the patient's arm fatigues and drops but they don't let go, the tray flips up, causing the water to dump on the patient.

Then you have to right-click on the Quicktime installer, the setup.exe installer and possibly the Autorun.exe file and change the compatibility property settings to tell XP to run it as a Win95 application.

Once we cut that away, no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, mediocre quality","review":"After having worn these slippers for about 3 months, I'm less than satisfied. When I first put them on, I was amazed by how soft they felt on my feet. It was like stepping onto a cloud. However, now the inner layer of cotton is completely smashed down and flat. I might as well be wearing thick socks. The threads are also fraying. They are also bigger in size than they should be. I normally wear a size 12 shoe, but I decided to get a size 11 slipper just so that it would fit snugly. But even that is too big on me! I guess I should've gone all the way down to a 10.

It is a fine sample of the Nueva Trova movement, which sought to revive folk traditions with new political and social statements. Bravo's voice changed dramatically in following albums; here the words just float from her mouth in a bright, sweet tone, with a gentility of diction that evokes instant nostalgia. This album is a great, accessible introdution to the wealth of Venezuelan music."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful music","review":"For those who don't speak Spanish, the first words sung on the album say \\"To sing makes sense... singing makes sense, has understanding and reason...\\" which although it loses something in the translation, tells the listener straight away that this is an album dedicated to Venezuelan song, from African derived work songs to folk tales, protest music and romantic and at times tragic poetry. Soledad Bravo pays tribute to the treasure trove of folk with her beautiful emotive voice which is variously angelic and earthy and her guitar, accompanied only occasionally by other folk instruments.

The inner camera is very simple and has almost none of the features you usually find in modern cameras. It offers you to turn digital zoom on/off from the settings menu - unfortunately there is no digital zoom at all. You'd think, since the camera is customized for the housing, you could at least access all the features , but not so. All the housing offers is access to the power button and shutter release. If you want to change any settings, you have to open the housing. If you take out the SD card, the batteries are disconnected which resets most of the settings to default, so you'll have to reconfigure the camera frequently. Sealife DC300 claims to be a \\"dedicated dive camera\\" which it is most certainly not. You'd be much better off buying a housing for your existing camera. I ended up returning it to Amazon and went for the Aquapix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap flimsy plastic camera.","review":"I have had this camera for a few years and gotten lots of good shots with it on dry land.

Asheru and Blue Black are conscious MC's, but they don't get overly preachy in their lyrics. The backing, done largely by Asheru and DJ Bolex is awesome, jazzy stuff reminiscent of a lot of the Native Tongues stuff of the nineties or some newer underground stuff, especially Five Deez' Fat Jon or Lone Catalysts' J. Rawls (not too surprising, since he actually helps out on a couple tracks). Favorite tracks: Soul, This Is Me, Dear You (with a really cool Chill Will freestyle), Truly Unique, and the title track.

It's simple, well-organized, caters for the need of the beginners with chapters that progress from easy to hard and covers most of the main aspects of coin magic. Coin magic is perhaps the most accessible (for magic performers) and most ready to perform and in that way, this book can even serve as the first book in one's education in general magic.Personally, I'd love to see more coin box magic and stage magic and some of the newer coin sleights covered in the book. Then again, perhaps this is meant to be the starting point and as such it's given me more than enough to continue on to more advanced and modern books.Please note that there is a newer version of this book which have a fair bit more materials in it so I strongly recommend you to check out that one first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price of admission for a fan.","review":"This box-set is a really good deal, considering what you get: TOXIC AVENGER, TOXIC AVENGER 2, TOXIC AVENGER 3, and TOXIC CRUSADER THE MOVIE ....)This set would get a 5 if it weren't for the stereotypical cartoon(an above average show, but nothing special) and the \\"me-too\\" TOXIC AVENGER 2.

As you can see from the list of song titles most of the set comes from his last two CDs Pieces of the Sun and Waters of Eden. The performances of these songs are infinitely better than the originals propelled by the crowd's enthusiasm and band synergy. In addition to these truly smoking performances, their are great versions of Genesis' Back in NYC and King Crimson's Sleepless and Elephant Talk with Jerry Marotta not only supplying brilliant drumming but a terrific vocal for Back in NYC.

Han Solo, enslaved in the Spice mines of Kessel? Come on, Get real. And of course we have to have ANOTHER super weapon? It was really impossible to tell which was worse the unexplainable increativity of the novel, or the redundent references back to previous occurances.

If anything, the book reads a lot like a Cliff's Notes version of the movies.The only reason I gave this book a one-star rating is that there wasn't any lower rating to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this printed?","review":"This book, hands down, is the worst Star Wars stuff I've read.I wonder to myself why it was printed, and since it was, I wonder why it was not printed under the \\"young adult\\" category.If you like the silly things in some of the movies, like fuzzy little Ewoks destroying a whole Legion of the Emperor's best troops, or Jar-Jar taking out several war droids because he got his foot stuck in the wires of a downed droid, then you'll probably like Anderson's work. It's more along those lines.I found the book very hard to read (in keeping my interest), and there is one non-plausible situation followed by another.His basic idea for the trilogy is pretty cool, but he destroyed it in the telling. I would have liked to have seen these same ideas brought to us in the hands of a better writer.Skip this book (and the trilogy) unless you like \\"silly\\" Star Wars stuff. If you do (and there's nothing wrong with that), then you will love this set.Kenneth."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"I think this is one of the best staw wars books in a while, dont get me wrong, Zahn's Thrawn trilogy is the best and Shadows of the Empire is my alltime favorite and the New Jedi Order is also great, but this Trilogy is in my top 3. The plot is awsome, especially Han and Chewbacca geting shot down over Kessel and the battle with the Lava monster on Eol Sha was terrific. Im just wrapping up this one up and im planning to read Dark Apprentice and Champions of the Force which looks equally as good as Jedi Searce, maybe better. So,I would recommend this to anyone who wants to now what happened after the original Star Wars trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is AWESOME!","review":"When i read this book I was hooked. I read this like mad! I found out Luke went to the Darkside, and how he escaped. They acted just like they did in the movie. Those who say this is bad [stink]. My only problem is the Sun Crusher. And he based some of this on his comic book series! C'mon, something original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a really good book. When I first got this book, I couldn't stop reading it. I have read some other Star Wars books by authors such as Aarron Alston, Michael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn and Kevin J. Anderson. This, by far, is my favorite Star Wars book because the plot is fast paced.It was really exciting when Han was trapped on Kessel. Meanwhile Luke is gathering Jedi students to restore the Jedi Knights and Leia's twins Jacen and Jaina just came back from the planet Aanoth. Han, Chewie and their new friend, Kyp, escape from Kessel and go into the Maw, a cluster of black holes. They find a hidden imperial laboratory and find a new enemy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anderson and Dr. Faustus are birds of a feather.","review":"Anderson wrote these in worship of the almighty dollar. Sure he may rationalize it as being because of his love for the movies, but this is realy written for the green gods. You see Anderson is a hack. If he had any literary ambitions he would at least try to write more original stories than media novels. That's the reason this novel is poorly plotted, with cardboard characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun in the spirit of the film trilogy.","review":"Kevin Anderson opens his Jedi Academy Trilogy with Jedi Search, set seven years after the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi and two years after the the events of Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. Many classic Star Wars Trilogy characters have returned, including Luke Skywalker (who is seeking to open a new academy for training a new generation of Jedi Knights) as well as Han and Leia Organa-Solo, Chewbacca and droids C-3PO and R2-D2. And we are also introduced to a new villain in Admiral Daala. Anderson manages to recreate the spirit of the classic Star Wars film trilogy in his books, which are nearly as good as Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. I recommend Jedi Search, as well its successors Dark Apprentice and Champions of the Force for anyone who enjoys the Star Wars films, or enjoys reading good science fiction in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Jedi Fans.....","review":"If you are a Star Wars fan you will delight in the first of the Jedi Academy Trilogy dedicated to Luke Skywalker and his attempt to re-establish the Jedi order.There is a lot of classic Star Wars action and characters with the scattered remains of the Empire thrown in just for fun.The events in this book, and all three books, take place after Return of the Jedi but before the New Jedi Order series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"i loved this book! it was the first book that was ever able to catch and hold my attention. i thought i hated reading books but after this one i realized that i only needed to find the right ones. at first i was only skimming but something about Han Solo caught my interest because he was always my favorite chracter. i read that chapter and became so intersted in the story that i had to read the whole book. i highly recommend this to any star wars or sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"It was a good book I think.

Don't you think Luke would be slightly ticked when Gantois tried to KILL HIM! want to see the characters at their peak? Read Vision of the future. LANDO GET YOUR EYES OF MARA! IT IS HER AND LUKE! BACK OFF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, For Zero Stars","review":"It's this sort of book that we need a Zero star rating for. Jeez. KJA wastes perfectly good pieces of blank paper by putting his writing on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, it sucks","review":"This is some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen in any novel. Not to mention that the plot formula is EXACTLY the same as the movies. Take a death star; only this time make it smaller and indestructable. Instead of blowing up planets, why not have it wipe out entire systems, (so much for originality) and you get the Suncrusher. And its up to none other than Han Solo to save us (once again) from the (defeated?) empire. My bottom line here is that the plot is VERY predictable and the corny dialogue is an atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iffy, at best.","review":"I've read many other SW books, and don't find Jedi Search up to snuff compared with a number of others. The characters who are known from the movies are not \\"themselves\\" in this book, and the excuses don't really make it believable. Slightly original, I have to give to KJA, but if you're looking for the real feel of the Star Wars universe, I suggest A.C. Crispin or Tim Zahn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite.","review":"Ok I read this book. I'm not a Star Wars freak, but I enjoy any good Science Fiction out there. But this book simply didn't do it. Terrible characters, badly written plot and cliche's that make you laugh out lound are only some of the bad aspects of this book (and indeed the entire trilogy). If you want a really good Star Wars trilogy then read the Heir to the Empire novels by Timothy Zahn. At least they sound like they have been writen by an adult instead of a ten year old kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rather Depressing View of the Star Wars Universe","review":"This book marks the opening of a trilogy that should be left on the shelf to gather dust. The characters that we've come to love in Zahn and The original Star Wars Trilogy, are virtually unrecognizeable. KJA goes way over the top with not one, but 2 superweapons!!! Not only that, his villian, Adm. Daala is a worthless, incompitant Admiral to say the least. KJA overuses the powers of the jedi to do impossible feats. This book is dumb, boring, and completely uninteresting. Don't waiste your time on this one, or any of the other in the series for that matter. If you're looking for a good author who captures the flare of SW, go buy all of Zahn's books, he's the only one who has the right feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good!!!","review":"I like this book. It's fast-paced, and you wouldn't be wasting your money if you bought it. IF you like political stuff, don't get this book. But if you like fast-paced action, then GET THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Kevin Anderson is the best Star Wars author. He made excellent character development and the idea of Luke's Jedi Academy is superb. It was about time that happened. I love this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a great trilogy!!!","review":"This book was great, in that it laid the foundation for the next two books of the trilogy very nicely. If you are a Star Wars fan, get the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn and then get this trilogy. You won't regret it! And to all of the people who are bent out of shape about Luke starting a Jedi Academy: First of all, this is how it was done thousands of years before. The only reason Luke trained with Yoda by himself is simply because there were no other known Jedi at the time. Sure, training each Jedi one-by-one would have given each more attention, I have no problem with Luke training them at an academy. It was the only way for Luke to set up a Jedi core of the New Republic quickly. Anyone who has a problem with this should open up their minds a bit more and should just go with the flow. I'd like to see them write a better Star Wars novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs. Your time is too precious to waste.","review":"Kevin J. Anderson proves abundantly why his books are reviled by the Star Wars fan community. Everything Anderson attempts to write comes across as being unoriginal and a rip-off of some other part of the Star Wars saga. The Imperial Admiral, out of touch with the fallen Empire (Daala as compared to Thrawn), the superweapon (the Death Star prototype), Luke on some bizarre Jedi spiritquest. All these elements might work in a more skilled writer's hands, such as Timothy Zahn's, but in Anderson's prose the ideas fall flat. I would recommend staying away from the Jedi Academy trilogy, but unfortunately, the trilogy is the keystone of the Star Wars novels that follow, more so that Timothy Zahn's trilogy. Take my advise, get a friend that suffered through these novels to summarize them for you and then move on. You'll feel better in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"don't buy this star wars book it is no good.The only thing goodabout this book was it's cover( nice painting)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Star Wars books I have read!","review":"I really liked this book. I liked the part about the Maw installation best. Qwi Xux added a lot to the book. She steered it away from a typical Star Wars \\"bad guy, good guy\\" routine. Too many books get into that cycle. I also liked how you get to meet the twins of Han and Leia for the first time. Kids are always a welcome addition to a book. Anyway, I think this is another success by Kevin J. Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ech.","review":"I was so looking forward to this book. I've read most of the others since, but these ones are still near the bottom of my favorites list. The writing seems shallow and rounded, not the sharpness that Zahn brought to the feild. And what's with the characters always repeating their lines from the movies? Prehaps a good book on its own, but in the context of Star Wars, not the best told story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Star Wars bust!","review":"Kevin J. Anderson destroys what a colossal image Star Wars has become. Though his book has its good side in plot, it would better be used on an entirely different theme. Anderson takes away the spirit of the characters. Twisting them into something beyond what we saw on the big screen. Turning them into characters bigger than theirown shoes. The plot was intriguing, I will give credit due, but the wrong image of the characters comes out. They are almost unbelievable, even for this vast universe of Sci-fi. I'm sorry, but this book doesn't uphold the spirit of such a great epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype...and then disappointment","review":"I remember being so excited to read this trilogy after reading the masterpiece Zahn trilogy. Unfortunately, the excitement ended after I began the 1st page of this book. I've read the whole trilogy, and I must say it was very disappointing. I don't remember exactly, but I don't think Mara Jade was in this trilogy, was she? If she was, she probably showed up for like a page. Disappointing not to see Anderson use that complex, wonderful character from the Zahn trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ!! TRUE STAR WARS","review":"This was one of the firdt books I read and I was impressed. Everything that's going on is full of action. I think the idea of a secret Imp operation in the Maw is cool.

This sure lighted up my kitchen and I really liked it when I got it. But after a couple of month I found some rust inside bottom of the kettle. No way! I did't abuse my kettle at all. I have no idea how I got rust inside of it because I used it as I had used my old stainless kettle. So I called the Customer Service and they promised me to send a new one if I send my kettle to them. Although I haven't got my new kettle, I am not sure if I want to use that kettle again. I don't want to worry about rust all the time. I think I need to find a different kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but not one of your tougher lift the flap books...","review":"This is an attractive book that combines lift-the-flaps with textures. The combination is appealing to my young toddlers, but I have to say that it is not the sort of book I leave out for them to play with unsupervised. I've had others constructed like it and the flaps just don't stay attached (if you know what I mean).The story begins when an adorable baby mouse in diapers starts to seek his friends: a pink salamander behind a bowl of smooth cherries; a brown mole behind a pot filled with scratchy sand; a butterfly behind silky flowers; and a black skunk behind a watering can of shiny water. The story ends when his friends seek him and find him behind a rough basket.These are all elements that small people can relate to and I would say that if you are looking for a sweet non-Barney, non-commercial kind of gift that it would be a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for fans of this comic strip","review":"lhj distills all the great farley episodes into one volume from his early galumphing self thru his heroic death. if you ever loved a dog, pick up this book -- you will laugh and cry, and sometimes do both together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Missing Farley","review":"This book will make you cry.

In a clever turn, nanct willard had turned the more famous characters from Blakes poetry into guest and attendents at his \\"Inn\\"\\" Angels make the bed, Dragons bake the bread,Tiger,tiger loses its strength,all adorned with gorgeous illustartions from alic and martin provensen. In the brief introduction,Ms willard explains how she became attracted to william Blake,then what led her to this book. My children even at a very young age have love this book. It's poetic scheme is simple yet elegant, which makes it also fun for the adult reading and challenging enough for a early grade reader.A wonderful, funfilled chidrens classic.And, Ms Willard is correct:poetry IS the best medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willard captures the essence of Blake's poetry","review":"This book contains a collection of poems written to honor poet William Blake. The setting is an inn run by Blake and Willard captures the style of Blake in her poems. Two dragons that cook and bake, two angels that do the housekeeping and a rabbit that escorts the guests to their rooms manage the inn. Illustrations accompany each poem and they are excellent, the inn is a splendid place to spend the night. The guests include the Man in the Marmalade Hat, the King of Cats and sunflowers who request a room with a view.This book is subtitled, \\"Poems for Innocent and Experienced Travelers\\" and in it we are taken on an imaginative journey that will delight all readers. An image of Blake appears in nearly every illustration and he is clearly enjoying himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inn is glorious","review":"William Blake's Inn is a wonderous world of Dragons baking and going to the Moon. The delightful romp holds the attention of the youngest children, but will be enjoyed by any age reader. To paraphrase Ms. Willard, a good children's book is written for all ages. This book proves that statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best inn ever","review":"This book is so funny because of the character's attitude. It even has strong words, like \\"makintosh\\".But I like it best because it has poems that rhyme."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I don't care if this book won both the Caldecott and Newbery - it was a bland and insipid personal view of the poetry and spirit one of the gratest poets alive. I cannot imagine giving this to a child to read when they could be given the REAL Blake, which children are fully capable of enjoying (as the author herself did). The author tries to incorporate some of the original rhythm in Blake's poetry, but that's about all I recognised, aside from the name dropping of some of Blake's most memorable images. Fine, if you don't really care about exposing your children to Blake. The 2 points are for the pretty illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Turnaround","review":"Very pleased with this product! My 7 year old son started having panic attacks and depression. Went to a Dr and they wanted to put him on Paxil and Xanax. Tried the Paxil one night and he had major side effects.

Thought we would give it a whirl and it has become a miracle worker for our son! No side effects and we have our child back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be DANGEROUS on gas stove","review":"We've had this kettle over a year. We love the look of it and the fact that it heats water quickly and retains the heat a long time. However, it can be DANGEROUS on a gas stove. If you look at the design, you'll see why this happens -- if you put too much water in it, it won't whistle, it will instead boil over without warning; the water will boil out through the spout, run down the side, then under the kettle and douse the flame underneath. So the FLAME IS OUT but the GAS IS ON. This has happened several times. If you don't overfill it (above the spout), it's perfectly fine, but it's hard to keep reminding other people like guests and family. We've decided to replace it with a kettle that has a higher spout and a flat bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great read","review":"I really enjoyed Calculated Risk! The story didn't get bogged down with technical details. Denise Tiller really focused on the crime, the characters lives, and how these factors interacted together. If you are a mystery fan...buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not risky","review":"A great read! I loved Liz with her enhanced fingernails and smart mouth. The backchat with her teen-aged sister is right on target. Well paced; plot follows through nicely. Mixes search for killer with new-technology religion with dysfunctional family with realistic romance. First in a new series and I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One out of Three isn't very good","review":"This book is actually three short romance stories about the same town, but written by different authors. In the first story, a woman who visits a fertility clinic accidentally gets the wrong man's sperm. His wife died before they were able to concieve a child together, so he goes in search of the mystery pregnant woman. Of course he falls in love with her the minute he lays eyes on her... and he doesn't even now if she is the right girl! The second story is just as far fetched, even though in this one they wait almost two weeks for the marriage proposal. The last story by Allison Leigh is the book's only saving grace. It's a clever little tale surrounding two children who set out to play matchmaker for their mom, including a very cute personals ad. A nice uplifting note to an otherwise horrid little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get some other compilation","review":"...one with the original themes.

I felt like Charlie Brown at the mailbox on Valentines day. Zero, ZILCH, Zip!Is this a commercial DVD? Issued just to get you Googling for more...only to discover you can't rent it, you can't buy just a \\"best of\\", or even any individual seasons... NOPE! You have to buy the whole series for $140.00 plus shipping and handling!! $150.00!!!! Give me a break! It was good, but I won't pay that much.

If you were a lover of the show I highly reccommend you get this DVD for your kids to see. I so enjoyed sitting down and watching this with my Mom as she told me about all of her favorite sketches.Now I can surely agree with the other reviewers that this is much to short.

Intense obsessive fans ask question after personal question of the cast--creepy. Musical montages are compiled of dumb stuff such as Bob Mackie costumes--painfully boring. All of this fast-forward-worthy, just-change-the-channel television junk is interspersed with less than 10 minutes worth of quality skits.I think this stinks, that Ms. Burnett is being greedy for charging so much for this teaser and for charging higher for the recently-released full-episodes set advertised on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carol Burnett Show - Show Stoppers","review":"A little disappointing because it is really a TV special/retrospective with Carol, Vicki, Tim and Harvey years later.

Minimal snippets from the original show. (Though there are a few bawdy moments that are good for a laugh.) Most of it was question/answer with the audience and some tribute song/dance routines. If you are a hard-core fan you might enjoy this walk down memory lane. I would have preferred to see more of the original show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"There are two groups of people for which this DVD is not recommended: those who are fans of the Carol Burnett Show and those who are not. Too much of the 40-something minutes are compiled of new material that's weak: questions from the audience, two songs, a tribute to the show's costume designer, and patter among the stars. The rest of the disc is outtakes, which are funny for about five minutes. I don't recall there being enough time devoted to a single sketch to allow you to appreciate the humor of the sketch itself. So if you're a fan, you already know that it's easy to get Harvey to crack up.

The DVD consists of nothing more than the CBS special aired a few years back. My wife and I watched the special at the time and roared, but we thought a DVD could contain a lot more than just the bare 42 minutes of that show. CBS has really missed the potential of DVD with this one, and sad to say, this entree turned out to be a big waste of money. There were enough Carol Burnett episodes over the years to fill a 4-disc pack just with bloopers, let alone representative sketches shown in full!

NO STARS. Columbia House sells what I believe to be complete episodes, but it's also a rip-off because there are only something like 2 episodes per disc and they are WAY over-priced. My niece and I love the old shows == she invested in the collection, which at the time had 9 DVD's ... and she paid dearly for them. Now they're inviting her back to buy MORE! Unfortunately, \\"They\\" capitalize on desperate fans by putting only 2 shows per disc and charging outlandish prices. However --those discs are definitely better than THIS!

We love to laugh and we like variety.","review":"I enjoyed this reunion special as I enjoyed the other a few years ago. Thanks to CBS for allowing the most daring and adult outtakes and bloopers to be shown. It was so much fun to see Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway and Harvey Korman back together again and able to laugh at themselves as we laughed with them at home.

I disagree with many of the reviewers who only gave this one star because this show gave me all I could have wished for.Tim and Harvey could always break each other up but the revelations that each of the others could be broken up too was a scream. Of course some great sketches were omitted and I wish this could have been longer but one does not get what one wants all the time.

What I got was a 40 minute television special which spent most of the time introducing the cast and fielding questions from the audience. The comedy sketches that were shown were just edited snippets of the cast trying to suppress their laughter at a joke the producers of this DVD didn't feel was necessary to share with the viewer. It was terribly disappointing. Even the famous \`curtain rod Scarlet O'Hara' sketch was edited down to only a few seconds of the audience laughing at Carl Burnett's attire. It's like telling the punch line of a joke without the setup. It is obvious that absolutely no effort was put into this DVD. I doubt very much that Carol Burnett had any input into this product. If I were her I would be mortified. A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reunion Special But The Original Show Should Be On DVD In Complete Seasons!","review":"The Carol Burnett Show is a classic variety skit show and it's very funny. Now I remember waching this reunion show on television a few years ago and while I wish they had shown more skits and had less talking about them it was interesting to hear Carol, Vicky, Tim and Harvey talking about how much they loved doing the skits and all of the fun they had and you could really tell how much they all liked and respected each other so I actually enjoyed watching their Show Stoppers Special but what would really be wonderful is if they put the Carol Burnett show on DVD in complete seasons. They show this variety skit show on TV on a couple of different TV stations including TVland but they only show 30 minutes and that is just not enough! A complaint I have about this special is that they didn't include Lyle Waggoner, He was just as funny as Carol, Vicky, Tim and Harvey and should have been included!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I thought this dvd would have at least scenes lasting more than 30 seconds. Most of it was the actors on the show sitting around and watching how they cracked each other up with laughter or talking to each other.

I've learned my lesson, I will only buy actual seasons on any of these tv shows from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Carol Show Stoppers Show","review":"This was a big disappointment. It was short, only 42 minutes long, and did not contain any of the funniest skits that I remember watching when they originally aired.

My niece is anorexic and very ill and this book gave me an inside view on the condition - something I very much needed as it turns out. It is written with honesty and simplicity and I would recommend it to anyone needing guidance into this frightening condition. I learned that it IS a disease and as such has to be treated as you would treat illness- not just as a destructive whim of a teenage girl. I have passed it on to my sister so that it may light up a very dark space in her life and give her some strategies to deal with her daughter, some grace to cope with the uncopeable and some hope at this dark time for her.

Eli's website says that there is a new edition coming out soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, frustrating, confusing","review":"I found this book interesting and at the same time extremely frustrating. There were many times when I wondered what the author meant by descriptions that were unclear. She often skipped important information and sometimes added it later. It seemed as if she wrote from a perspective of being currently immersed in her eating disorder, rather than it seeming like she was looking back with insight, even though she was over it when she wrote this book. I wanted to know what her various symptoms and behaviours meant, but mostly she didn't explain them. This book seems to have been written from a New Age perspective (despite the author claiming she was a Catholic). I found her writing style a bit mystical and confused. A worthwhile story and a page-turner, but it needed a lot of editing and re-writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I loved this book. Its that simple.Elizabeth writes with honesty and in a straightforward way about the hell she suffered with her eating disorder.No waxing poetic - just realistic look at her life and the chaos she caused the people around her.

Using engaging prose and lively vivid descriptions that place the reader inside Japan as the Europeans enter, struggle against political and economic upheaval and eventually as the men leave Japan a defeated lot.

This is a wonderful book that encapsulate an era of exploration, the first halting attempts of economic empire-building, and the dawn of the Shogunate. And while Adams' personal story is not quite as dramatic as James Clavell's pilot, it is certainly more interesting and entertaining. Especially remarkable was to watch the speed of navigational developement and international operations over a period of a mere thirty years. One forgets at times that Jamestown and Plymouth were established within a few years after Adams' arrival in Japan, and by the time of his death, the Eastern Seaboard was almost entirely settled.

FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka Bloody Girl, Malenka the Vampire, The Niece of the Vampire and The Vampire's Niece) is hard to follow and probably not worth the trouble. I think Ekberg's grandmother Malenka (also played by Ekberg) was a dabbler in the black arts, outed and burned at the stake by irate villagers just after she'd brought Uncle Max to life, or undeath. Anyway, she's burning while he's fluttering his eyelids and wiggling his fingers. You figure it out.In any event, there's a spooky castle, a creepy vampire uncle, busty barmaids, a gallant fiancé and trusty sidekick, and bunches of garlic hanging in every innocent window and doorway. This may well have been a satire that will appeal to fans of the genre.

One gets the feeling that the film's creators were trying to reproduce the feeling of the Hammer vampire films but failed. The characters' motivations and emotions jump all over the place with little or no consistency. When done one can only wonder who would enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to deliver","review":"This movie started out with lots of potential but went downhill fast.

This book seems to be another promotion for someone who has so many fingers in so many \\"professions\\" that he can hardly call himself a full-time artist (whatever that means). I don't know if his art is any good or not; I've never seen it. But I do know that each artist makes their choice about how to run their life. I know lots of artists whose art has more energy, cognative depth and artistic merit than many of the so-called great artists who equate marketing with substance. Though there are some aspects of this book worth ruminating about, a better tale could have been told - that might be of help to other artists - if Rudd kept his ego out of this book....or is ego the name of his game?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"I bought this item on a recommendation as part of a front sight replacement for a glock 17.

It is written in easy to understand, and humorous language. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spending Like Lynn","review":"This book may be helpful for women who have never travelled alone, but note: bring your credit cards! Suggestions such as hiring a driver to take you on a private tour of the city and taking cabs everywhere not only tend to insulate you from the very culture you travelled so far to experience, but are also simply not practical/financially possible for many people - women or no. Hotel and restaurants are also mostly in upper-moderate to expensive range. The tone is not that of an empowered female traveler taking care of herself, but more that of one seeking to protect herself from all possible mishap by playing it safe. Finally, I found the content extremely skimpy for the price. Guess if you have the money to travel as Lynn does, this would not be a concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I like this product. I think that for the money, it was a good investment. Whenever I have problems with the scale shutting off it is because I have not prepped my ingredients so that I am adding them too slowly. I like the look of scale and its size. I actually store mine on top of my toaster. I use my scale almost every day and I am pleased with the results.My only complaint is that the grams are in increments of 5. I have some recipes that call for 62 g or 19 g of something, but being off by a few grams hasn't hurt the results.The only other scale I considered before purchasing this one was the Soehnle Futura. The comparable model is $30 more and it's a pain to switch between ounces and grams.As another reviewer noted, this scale would be perfect if you could use an AC adapter or disable the automatic shut off feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to problem of scale automatically shutting off.","review":"I am in my fourth year of teaching a culinary arts class at a local high school and I have used this scale extensively during that time with excellent results. A reviewer wrote that the scale will automatically turn off while measuring. This will only happen if you add very small amounts too slowly or if you pause for an extended time before adding an ingredient. For the price I do not think there is a better, more versatile scale on the market. I would rate the scale an overall 5 rather than 4 if an AC adaptor option was availabe that allowed continuous operation without automatic shut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps shutting off - in the middle of pouring ingredients!","review":"This scale would be great if it didn't shut off in the middle of pouring ingredients. I have followed recommendations of other reviewers and poured more quickly, didn't pause, etc. and it just doesn't matter. The scale shuts off as flour is hitting the bowl, so if I need to measure 7 oz, I'll get to 3 oz and then it will shut off. It is VERY frustrating and the help number on the manual is now going to AT&T;, not Salter.If you use 2 bowls to measure everything & constantly start over, it works. But it makes twice the mess and is four times as frustrating. I can't recommend this product, and wish there was a solution to the shut-off problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caillou and the holiday season","review":"My 3 year old daughter, Rachel, loves this video.

Itself? The filmmakers provided themselves with mad scientists, lesbian bikers, midgets, blind kids, and zombies...but they forgot the screenplay. Billy Bob and Martha Quinn should provide some entertainment, right? Well, Martha tries, but Billy Bob is just dull. Don Calfa is in it...he's usually good for a larf or two, right? Nope.

Why the Goforce 4800GPU was not included in this phone is beyond me. Also why is there a measly 66mhz processor in this when the V3xx/Maxx have a 247mhz(Arm9)? The screen is a smaller resolution QCIF compared to the QVGA of the V3xx too. I mean the only upside I could see it the 2MP camera on this phone. It also only supports EDGE which the V3xx supports the much faster 3G HDSPA/UMTS. If you are big on fashion and not specs then this is the phone for you. A much better phone would be the V3xx 3G phone or wait for the Krazr K3. One last not why is this thing still called a razr? It is not thin and that is the point of the razr phones.Look at the jbencmark comparison's[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommend To Buy This Phone","review":"I ordered the phone last week, and it came this morning. I was very happy for the fast delivery. However, when I opened the box, it looked really cheap to me. The phone was in a old package. Even the phone looked old, and there're scatches on it. Inside the package, there're only a phone, a battery, a back cover, a charger and a old Cingular manual. The phone looked like a refurbished one because the tiny screws on the back was loose. I had to use the screwdriver to fix them. It cost $145 plus tax last week, and it dropped down to $139 plus tax this week. So I already got $6 lost!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy Bueno","review":"Este teléfono tiene un gran estilo, es sencillo de usar, tiene buena calidad de sonido, buena cámara, y otro montón de atributos que lo hacen una muy buena compra, sin embargo, es un poco lento al iniciarse, procesar imágenes, etc., quizá un procesador mas rápido lo haría una mejor inversión. Además si le pudieran agregar algunos campos a los contactos, para adicionar información, seria excelente y por último que al colocar el cumpleaños de un contacto este se sincronizara automáticamente con el calendario.Por otra parte el Software Motorota Phone Tools que vino con el teléfono, no reconoce este modelo, ese si creo que fue un cabezazo de parte de esta gente, tremendo pelón."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK IN THE US","review":"This phone DOES NOT work in the US.

I also have a MOTO RAZR and have been comparing the two. So far the main thing I don't like about the KRZR are the voice dialing.With the RAZR, you can train each person with a Voice Name in the phonebook. Then press the right button and say the name, and it automatically dials that person.The KRZR has no such feature (at least I haven't found it yet) and does not seem to recognize names, and if it does, you have to press several buttons before it will dial the correct person. Not exactly what you need if you are trying for hands-free dialing.The other negative feature when compared to the RAZR is that is actually feels heavier and the controls are smaller and harder to use with my big fingers.Other than that, probably a great phone. I'm still trying to figure out what it can do, so am having a learning curve issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly defective","review":"I needed a cheap phone to tide me over till my contract expires.

I was skeptical at first. I read a lot of reviews before making the purchase. When I received the phone, I tried my AT&T sim card and it worked. When I arrived China, I put in the local sim card and it worked like a charm. My second stop to Hong Kong, the local sim card again worked like a charm. Now that I am back in the US, the phone works like it supposed to. Also, the phone charger is the same as the Razr V3, so I can use my own charger instead of the European charger with a US adapter which came with the phone. The only negative is the user manual is in German. I had to find an English one online. I have not figured out all the details on the phone yet.

I just received this phone yesterday from Amazon.com, only to find out that it cannot take the 1GB MicroSD Card from my Motorola V360. It just keeps blinking !Removed Memory Card! when the MicroSD Card is in there. It blinks so much that it is nearly impossible to maneuver the buttons through the phone book or other menu options. My V360 accepted the MicroSD Card just fine when I checked to see if the problem was just my MicroSD Card. The KRAZR won't even recognize that there is a card when you check the Storage option in the phone settings menu. It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device. If it wasn't for the MicroSD Card issue, I would not have any problem with it.

I have never been able to use a wire headset with it. There's so much static noise with the wire headset connected that people on the other end can't really hear me.

This is where it shines. When you close it, it feels like a luxury car door. Very solid; lightyears ahead of the RAZR.- Sound quality is top-notch. Excellent reception.- Camera is actually very, very good. I was very, very surprised.- Works with all my old RAZR accessories.Cons: (barely justifiable to even call them that)- A couple of the included games/java apps were in Chinese.- The phone language. \\"Centre\\" instead of \\"Center\\", Personalise instead of \\"Personalize\\" - Not really a big deal.

Then the battery completely gave up. I would charge the phone over night and after making one call in the morning, I'd be down to two bars. Another call over 1 minute long and the phone starts beeping \\"low battery\\". Note that the exact same issues were happening on both of these phones so it is not my bad luck on one particular faulty phone.Owning this phone past 1 year has been a torture and Morotola customer service didn't seem to give a damn.

His account, a collection of observations about Vietnam under the Diem presidency, is refreshing while at the same time shocking in its findings. While many observers insisted that efforts in Vietnam were progressing so well from 1961-63, Halberstam sees the light. His expose of all the failings of the system includes candid words about the inept south Vietnamese leadership and the American advisors who grow increasingly frustrated with their mission.

I couldn't tell whose story it was and I found the dialog unnatural and at times comical.I was disappointed that Ms.Miller did not portray the relationship between Daisy and Duncan for what is was-A predator and a victim. I was equally disappointed that when Daisy's father finally is aware of the relationship, he does not share the information that Duncan is a pedophile, thus allowing Duncan to get away with his behavior.All in all, the book misfired on several levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulled in two different directions","review":"If you can get past one of the more disturbing storylines (a 15-year-old girl entering into an affair with an older man, who happens to be a family friend), then this novel is such a fascinating study of people and their motives. There are so many circumstances that change our entire lives as well as those around us. Here we have divorce, remarriage, death, emotional distancing and sexual awakening as some of the topics explored so wonderfully by Miller's skillful writing. Keep an open mind, and you will be treated to a hauntingly provocative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Father","review":"There was amoment late in this novel when I set the book down for a moment and said, \\"Wow, what I would give to be such a wonderful father for my daughters.\\" We are so lucky to have a wonderful, compassionate novelist such as Sue Miller amongst us. She embraces us with all our flaws, and she describes us with an amazing capacity for bulls-eye zingers. Wow.This is a great read, and a real achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Beautifully Written","review":"Excellent story that was beautifully executed by Ms. Miller. Her style made the reader feel truly like a fly on the wall observing the actions of the characters as they happened and made the reader more involved in the action. The characters had depth - none of the main characters was \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" - they were more complex and had both good and bad traits.Some reviewers have expressed disgust with the book overall due to the erotic way Ms. Miller describes the relationship between Daisy and Duncan. The first scene is truly disturbing in its eroticism, but lends to the book's character of having complex feelings about complex issues and the feelings and relationships of a teenager. It was uncomfortable to read, but I found it to be a good choice on the author's part to write it in that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored in the Forest","review":"I just finished this book and was surprised when I logged on that so many people really liked this book. There were so many times during reading this book that I just wanted to abandon it, but I am of the philosophy that there is at least some satisfaction from finishing the book and then looking at it as a whole. Upon doing that, I was very disappointed. I felt it left so many issues unresolved- but even worse I didn't really care if they got resolved or not. Yes, there was the attempt to summarize everything in the final chapter- but it still didn't satisfy. This sounded like such a great book to me but I just felt like everything was so rushed and I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Going There.....","review":"I was hoping for a good read from this author but I will not be reading this latest from Ms Miller.

Why I finished this book is beyond me. The characters were shallow and not fully fleshed out, the story was beyond depressing, and the scenes with Daisy and her lover were way too graphic. In fact, I found that part disgusting....and I am no prude, believe me.A better, deeper, and more realistic book about the same subject is \\"Good Grief\\" by Lolly Winston.I think Miller is a good writer, but she seems to gravitate toward writing stories that do not showcase her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perpetuation of child molestation","review":"As a \\" molest survivor\\" I found this book offensive in it's disregard of Duncan's molestation of Daisy. I could not understand Mark's not telling Eva; reporting Duncan to the police nor could I understand why He,in a sense, protected Duncan by keeping \\"the secret\\".

I'm amazed that only one reviewer found the abuse of Daisy to be just that, not \\"seduction\\" or an \\"affair\\" but a crime, and one in which the criminal isn't punished or even embarrassed. The descriptions of the \\"collateral damage\\" of divorce were well done,but, as many reviewers have pointed out, the ending failed. The adults in Daisy's life failed her, especially the father who suspects that she has been abused but never confronts the abuser. I had hoped that the ending would find Duncan in prison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dark, disturbing and decadent!!!","review":"Sue Miller is, I believe, one of the finest writers in the fiction world today. Her insight into the human psyche is unparalleled. \\"Lost In The Forest\\" is a fine example of her craftmanship. The character development is stunning, drawing the reader into the midst of this whole sad familyThe seduction of Daisy is dealt with in a rather offhand manner, leading the reader to believe that the author finds this horrific relationship ,although lifechanging,somehow helpful to this child. The fact that the father knew and did nothing is incomprehensible. To allow the perpetrator to escape without punishment or even chastisement is shocking. Where are the moral valus of the author?

I started this book anticipating a lot, but once I got to the graphic scene with Daisy and Duncan (who creeped me out), it was downhill from there. I did not appreciate the very graphic imagery. I understood that the point of view was from the third person, but I wasn't sure if a certain emphasis was supposed to be on Daisy. I was just confused throughout the majority of the book. I think that the death of John could have been some great rich material, but the best this book could evolve to would be a Lifetime movie. I didn't even finish it, I was so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, but I liked it!","review":"I thought the story was quite believable. Miller's writing style softened the abject offensive relationship Daisy had with Duncan somehow and allowed me to read thru it.

I had read good reviews of this book but couldn't get past the sexual filth in the first few pages. The story concept sounded so interesting that I continued past the sprinkling of nasty language.

They provide entertainment and quality character development. While the setting in this book was interesting, the plot was lacking. I thought I would be reading about a coming of age girl, yet this tended to be about sexual abuse. I found it disturbing especially because there was not enough information provided to find any sympathy for the characters. This book did not live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid start to asp.net","review":"Hi allGreat book to get you/me started in asp.net.

It will teach you the basics of ASP.NET 2.0, VB (No C# here) and some basic programming constructs.There are some errors in the book, which is why I did not give it 5 stars. One example of an error is on page 310 dealing with a HyperLinkField and the DataNavigateURLFormatString; this is something that apparently changed from the beta version the book was written with and the final release. (you need to convert this to template for it to work correctly). The book also touches on web parts but the code did not work, no errors just didn't work.If you know some programming and want to get beyond the dummies I'd recommend ASP.NET 2.0 in 24 Hours by Scott Mitchell, a very good book without the smarminess that comes with the dummies titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creates learning path for more advanced book","review":"Even though I had a reasonable background in using vb.net, I just couldn't put all the pieces together for ASP.NET when using Microsoft's ASP.net with VB .net (G.

It's viscerally annoying and completely spoils the flow and rhythm of the dance. Joby Talbot's score is also dreadful - filled with tinkley effects rather than memorable melodies and recurring themes. The only redeeming aspects--and they aren't redeeming enough--are the sets, stagecraft, and special effects. If you love dance, you won't love this.

The cat stopped eating and became lethargic right after receiving the medication and rapidly deteriorated. The vet couldn't tell what was wrong with her but assumed it was old age, since she was 16 years old. However, the timing of her sudden illness right after being treated with this medication seems very consistent with the negative experiences being reported by other reviewers here.

He presented a strong case for being tagged scapegoat of the decade.Fuhrman leads the reader through his investigation techniques and discoveries. Evidence never brought to light in the trial, now clearly points a bloody finger at those guilty for this failure in our justice system. His voice shouts a message clear and strong that no one is perfect and we all carry a dark side"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat repetitive, but essential to understanding the case","review":"Furhman is not perfect, but he's not guilty, either. The best part of the book is the author's walk-through of his own investigation of the crime scenes. He also highlights a little known fact, that Judge Ito had to be VERY biased, and therefore should have recused himself. The down points of the book are that Furhman used too many of Vincent Bugliosi's arguments and words from the book _OUTRAGE_, and that Furhman's thoughts, although powerful, are at times disorganized. He goes over the same ground a few times. However, to me, this kind of repetitiveness convinces me that here is a man who is speaking the truth, but feels that he may never be believed again. For arguments about why the trial was lost, try OUTRAGE. For a more personal look at excellent detective work and the inside scoop on Furhman, read MURDER IN BRENTWOOD. Reading about the terrible miscarriage of justice made me angry about the verdict all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all know OJ left a map of his DNA all over","review":"Mark Furhman did a great job explaing this case.

They sure could use him on the Ramsey case."},{"rating":"2","title":"MURDER IN BRENTWOOD","review":"Mark Fuhrman has a wealth of information regarding the O.J. Simpson case. He presents the facts in a clear and concise manner. The reader gains an insight of the politics of law enforcement - the self-serving actions of some so called public servants. His writing educates the reader on the exacting manner of how an investigation should be conducted.He was placed in a frustrating situation - his colleagues failed him - the presecution team failed him - and the justice system failed him. He became the sacrificial lamb of that entire farce of a trial. He can hold his head high and be proud of the way he conducted himself--he was treated most unfairly. The system lost an intelligent and conscientious detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is compelling.","review":"I have always believed O.J. Simpson to be guilty and this book only confirms my belief. Mark Fuhrman was a very decorated police officer and would not ever do anything to hurt or damage his reputation. I could not put this book down until I read it completely. My heart goes out to his family, Nicole Simpson's family and Ron Goldman's family. It is hard to understand all the injustices done by the defense team, even the prosecution and others mentioned in the book. How the defense and even O.J. Simpson tried to make a mockery of this trial. If you want to know the truth you need to also read O.J.'s words in the book \\"If I Did It.\\" I believe it is his own confession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark strikes back!","review":"Mark Fuhrman was not to blame for a double-murderer goingfree. He was a victim (albeit not an entirely innocent one) in thiscase. I believe that while he may have had some problems for whatever reasons (and he admits this in his book), he was a good detective who was very conscientious. His meticulous notes included in the book are evidence that he was on top of the case when he was at the Bundy crime scene. I believe if he and his partner had remained on the case, Simpson would have been convicted on the evidence alone. The things he stated about the judge, the prosecution and the defense resonated with me and every one with whom I have discussed this case. Mark Fuhrman became the fall guy for the LAPD and the LA DA. Thank you, Mark, for writing this book and I hope you become rich. I hope you will write more about your experiences.

Unfortunately, 'they' made him the scapegoat in OJ's murders and ruined his police career but those that are aware, realize what the truth is. Mark Fuhrman has made a great life for himself and his family, in the second chapter of his life. I am so grateful to him for writing all these books (check out \\"Murder In Greenwich\\" book, it is awesome too). This book about the slaugher of Nichole Brown and Ron Goldman goes into minute detail as to the forensics and all the other evidence that should have convicted that murderer. It is sickening to see how badly the other detectives bungled the case and it is more than sickening to see how Mark got blamed for it. It is a MUST-READ book for all who care about the Truth. Thank you Mark Fuhrman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder in Brentwood","review":"I have read all of the books, by Mark Fuhrman. This is by far the most interesting. It lays out in exact detail how the investigation into the murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson should have been conducted, and would have, if he was allowed to run it from top to bottom. I couldn't put the book down. It opened my eyes to a lot of details that I, like the majority of America were not privy to. A great eye opener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like any other book -- Mark makes YOU the detective.","review":"This book is a \\"MUST READ.\\" I often wonder what would've happened if Mark had been in OJ's place (accused of murdering two blacks and then being set free) simply because OJ had used the \\"W\\" word in a play-act years earlier. Who would've been labelled racist then? Society is in a shocking state when a lie becomes of more importance than two extremely cold-blooded murders -- and isn't it ironinc that although OJ and many others were guilty of perjury, only one person was charged for it? Yes the trial was racist, but you certainly couldn't call it black racism. This books should be read by the WORLD. It portrays a justice system that has gone awry to a degree that it could threaten the future of all of those who testify and grant freedom to those who are accused"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute MUST read","review":"Detective Fuhrman's book is a no-holds-barred look at the Simpson trial. I applaud the author's courage in speaking up and encourage everyone to read this book. Not only is a double murderer walking free, but a GOOD cop's life was ruined. You'll be amazed to learn just how badly the prosecution and LAPD handled things and from a detective's view, what SHOULD have been done. You'll also learn just how Mr. Fuhrman was scapegoated. A lot of what you THINK you know is far from the truth.Even those of you that think the worst of Fuhrman, be open minded and READ this book. I think you'll have an entirely different opinion when you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Review of the OJ Simpson Case!","review":"I backed into this book. That is, I read Mr. Furhman's other book \\"Murder in Greenwich\\" first. AND LOVED IT. GREAT BOOK, CHECK IT OUT! This is the first OJ book I read. Like everyone else I was OJ'd out-big time. But Mr. Furhman does a fine job in his first book. Alot of the evidence he mentions was brought up at trial but there is alot of things he noticed/discovered that was never brought up. He really redeems himself, showing that he is an excellent detective, hung out to dry by OJ's manipulative defense team. I'll be reading all of his books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time, money or brain cells","review":"Luckily, I got this book from the library and did not waste my hard-earned cash. I know other may, however, make this mistake and I want to warn them: do not buy this book! I sympathize with the other Americans who put up with endless pages of whining and denying. The entire book was trash. On every page, Mark Fuhrman either endlessly denied perjury or blamed. In his mind, he made it very clear, only HE was right, and every one else was wrong. As stated so boldly in this waste of paper, he was the only individual involved in the Simpson case who did everything right. Every one else (Marcia Clark, the other investigators, etc.) made a series of mistakes that Mark himself would certainly have avoided. I have three words for the guy: GET A LIFE! I got this book to read about the investigation and trial, not to hear him complain.

Simpson fiasco continues. Have we all heard enough about this legal disaster? No, those of us who followed the trial from its beginning cannot get enough details, and finally Mark Furhman speaks out to let us hear his side of the story. Here is the cop that discovered some of the most important evidence, a very competent cop who put his life on the line daily for the people of LA. It is an important book that lets the public see the other side (the real side) of Mark Furhman. He does not excuse his past behavior but rather clearly questions what any of that had to do with the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson. His career has been ended through no fault of his own - but rather by the \\"Scheme Team\\" as he calls the defense team.

I usually have 8.5\\" x 11\\" sheets I clip to the screen for adventure specific reference, but with this screen I cannot do that easily either.

The package it's in is even book sized, leading me to believe, logically, that the screen is book sized in height also. However when you open it up you get two screens, each only half as tall as a book (roughly 5 inches tall). You get one screen for d20 modern and one for core D&D. But because of their miniscule size the first time I used it everyone noted that they could see what I was doing behind the \\"screen\\" before we started, even the person at the opposite end of the table! I taped one on top of the other which does make it larger but I shouldn't have to do that!

Things like various item and material hardnesses, common modifiers to AC, various types of actions and whether they provoke Attacks of Opportunity, skills, movement penaltes, light, and auras for both magic and evil/good. The creators were thoughtful enough to include the book and page number for various charts in case you need to get more info. On the downside, as other reviews mentioned it is surprisingly short for a screen, and pretty high-priced considering what you get. Yeah, yeah; you get a bonus D20 modern screen. Wow.

This is also a disfunctional family drama of deceit, death and the corruption of innocence.

Michael Kimball has crafted a thoughtful and unpredictable story while avoiding the usual over-the-top or unlikely scenarios. The characters ( especially Ellen Chambers) are well drawn and Kimball demonstrates an excellent grasp of dialogue. This novel is a plausible and carefully constructed portrayal of a mother's unrelenting worry and intricacies of family politics. Mouth To Mouth is also a suspense story of the highest order, but the author has cleverly produced a socially diagnostic and compassionately written cautionary tale. As with his last book,Undone, Kimball takes chances and busts open the suspense genre with something quite different and very worth while. Fans of Thomas H.

The work is a \\"must read\\" for studentsof government, history, world culture, city planning and ahost of other academic specializations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked the energy of the real thing!","review":"The book was entirely lacking in juicy anecdotal \\"grab you by the shorts\\" storytelling. It focussed too much on an endless parade of minor political figures who were neither interesting or compelling to read about. It actually bored me with it's endless city hall dealings and backroom political machinations. Where were the stories of all the ordinary, yet colourful men and women who painstakingly built the city brick by soot covered brick.

There was a lot of hemming and hawwing about this and that without much clear, concise instruction. I think that readers would be much happier with Bill Phillips' 'Body-For-Life.' The one thing that I did like about this book was the idea of a 21-day goal-setting time period. I find that the shorter-term goals with an aim at a longer-term goal seem to work the best. With all of that said, I still think that Montel Williams is a fine example of a human being and a wonderful role model for anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived plot and lack of imagination.","review":"The plot of this novel is contrived. There are a few moderate surprises, but overall, the story is quite conventional. It would seem, also, that imagination ceases outsie of the mind of George Lucas. Can we really expect everything to be \\"as angry as a wampa ice creature on fire\\" and \\"slow as a bantha?\\" Can we really expect people to ride around on rancors and tauntauns? Can the authors of these cheesy novels not create any substantially new creatures? The creation of new characters in the novels is noteworthy; however, even here, it would seem strange that the very leaders of a struggling new republic would be sent into dangerous situations every time you turn around -- is there no one else in the universe who can \\"save the republic\\" but han solo and leia?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues the great story of the first book.","review":"This book is even more exciting than the first one in the series was. Luke starts the actual training of his students and meets some problems. Admiral Daala comes out of the Maw installation and causes damage to the New Republic. The Sun Crusher is also introduced and is very exciting to read about in action. Just a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book was wonderful. the story was really intreasting. I also liked how the students think they know everything and even more than the teacher. I saw this in Kyp"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent work by a brilliant author","review":"This book is the best bridge from the first (Jedi Search) and the third (Champions of the Force). Kevin Anderson is a wonderful writer who follows the Universe of Star Wars beautifully and without contridiction. The characters, Kyp, Luke, Daala, and many more make the story come alive. Definately recommended with the other two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you back to the origins of the Sith","review":"Massasi, Sith, Exar Kun...wow!The only dissapointment was how Luke was under Exar Kun & Kyp Durron's spell. Making him pretty much useless in the New Republic's struggles against the still remaining factions of the Empire. But you see how Exar Kun is who he is, and the mad rage dark Jedi face within themselves. Hence Kyp.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Ones","review":"There have been at least 30 Star Wars books released since 1991 that have continued the adventures of Han, Luke, and Leia. This is one of the better ones. The 2nd part of a trilogy, it has a cliff hanger ending, similar to Empire Strikes Back. The story continues from Jedi Apprentice about how Luke is progressing as a Jedi Master at his newly created academy. Two of his students fall to the dark side and create interesting confrontations for Luke, the second of which is the cliff hanger. Han and Leia, with the New Republic, are involved in battling the rogue Imperials who had just recently discovered that the Emperor had fallen. Character development and back ground information was well done. Overall, this story isn't just an adventure of the month that was relased, it was a true continuation of the Star Wars saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Jedi Academy?! Get a grip and get this book NOW!","review":"When I learned that Kyp had a lot of Jedi potential, hey, I was happy for him. He deserved it, and after a life of mining spice for ten damn years, well, who wouldn't? But I started to get a little concerned when that idiot Exar Kun twisted Kyp's mind. Hey, the kid didn't know any better, did he? Man, I was angry. But I knew that's what he would want so I just cursed under my breath and kept on reading. I always wondered what Kyp looked like, though. They give him a well fitting descripton in the books, but I wish that he had his own story and elaborate on where he came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jedi student of Luke Skywalkers' turns 2 the dark side.","review":"I thought the book went into some really good details describing the setting and the plot.

It really keeps you on the edge of your seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Amazing Book: READ IT!","review":"After you read Jedi Search you can't and won't want to stop. This book continues the exciting trilogy. I think it's even better than the last. It is exciting, fast- paced, and there's no way you'll ever be able to put it down. And when you do you'll be mad if you don't have #3 in the Trilogy right next to you because you finished the book and you need to know what happens next... fast"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Space","review":"This applies equally to the other two parts of the Jedi Academy trilogy, but Dark Apprentice was perhaps the nadir. Where have the characters been all this time? There is absolutely no growth, most noticeably on the part of our supposed Jedi master, Luke. Emotionally, and in terms of his understanding of his powers, Luke's character seems to have weakened and regressed even 7 (?) odd years after ROTJ (not to mention, over the course of this trilogy). Perhaps this phenomenon is a function of the author's desire to help readers relive the glory days of Star Wars. Or maybe, the author has no concept of what it means to be a Jedi knight. Sadly there is more character development of the twins than any other characters. On the other hand, the basic idea of a jedi academy is fascinating. I only wish the trilogy had spent more time on taking us into that world and not on a cruise through endless rounds of sitcom-ish plot devices and one-dimensional characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"Does it get any more boring than this? I hope not. I've read a multitude of the Star Wars novels, and along with Courtship of Princess Leia, I was totally disinterested in this whole trilogy. I have issues with Lucas creating a second Death Star in Return of the Jedi, but I got over that. When Anderson created a third Death Star Prototype, I got annoyed. I know the Empire is cruel and all, but I seriously think there's only so far an evil empire can go.This trilogy was hard to fathom, even for a science fiction book. It was hard to buy some of the situations that came about. I should have read I, Jedi by Michael Stackpole after this, just so I had the satifaction of reading something spectacular, instead of something I forced myself to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Very good book ended a little abruptly but over all was very good addition to star wars. Looking forward to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Jedi Academy Trilogy. That's not saying much..","review":"This book is the worst of the subpar and ouright terrible Jedi Academy Trilogy. Middle books usually tend to lag, and this definately lags. The story was terrible to begin with and just drones on and on. I get bored just writing about it. I have read every Star Wars book ever written so I do have a grip on what makes a good Star Wars book and Dark Apprentice is just terrible. Anderson has no coherrant plot, his characters are way too powerful and really his writing style is juvenile. In about 6 days Kyp Durron (aka Luke if he had met a 4,000 yar old dead Sith master) is able to learn more about the Force and in another 6 defeats Luke Skywalker, last Jedi Master? Come on! It took Stackpole's I, Jedi just to make this trilogy work. The story has so many plot holes that it is amazing the book is solid. Overall a terrible effort and the worst of a terrible series."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawnnnn!!!!!!!!!! i went to sleep.","review":"after reading the thrawn trilogy by timothy zahn i was inspired to pick up this series what a disconnected effort , how many super weapons are there in the starwars universe what a copeout another apprentice turns or flirts with the darkside are there no original stories left maybe kevin j anderson and richard hatch could compare notes on how to write really bad prose because the effort here is substandard to say the least dont waste your time get a life and enjoy the sun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish in a Barrel","review":"It's a shame that many of the titles, have not translated into Spanish, and not even subtitles.

Watch 60 Minutes' Under The Influence to see how he forced through the Medicare Drug Bill that prevents Medicare from negotiating drug prices with the pharmas. Very shortly after the passage of the bill, he took a $2 million a year job with the pharmaceutical industry.What kind of politician votes for a bill that (by forbidding price negotiation) forces up the price of medicine?

The problem is that his party stands for nothing in particular. Yes, they have their tendencies, but they don't have principles.We have a republican majority, but we don't have republican agreement on anything important. Nothing's more significant that our income tax problem. Having a graduated income tax was not an idea ever promoted by our founders. It came from Karl Marx. It punishes achievement. It was invented to crush ambition.So Tauzin will go in and argue for this NRST, but he'll leave out the step of first repealing the 16th amendment, so then we'll get the worst of all possible scenarios: an NRST and income tax running at the same time-total slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warrior: The Legend of Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen","review":"An almost uncritical biography of the subject, and a shamelssly uncritcal preudo-autobiography of the author.

My basic observation is the juice does not taste, nor smell bad. It is pleasant to wake up and take my dose of Goji, versus choking down bad smelling vitamins and supplements. Score 1 for Goji!Secondly, I do have more energy with the Goji supplement, however: It is no substitute for a good night's sleep. Also, sometimes it takes more than one dose to keep me going throughout the day. Granted, I've only been taking it for about a week. Lastly, I notice that if you take the supplement on the higher end of the dosage, you will not get a full 32 days out of it, which is something to keep in mind if you're watching your budget.

There is very little information about this woman (especially to write a book over)and it was a guessing game at what she did or did not do. Without Cecila and her family information this book probably would have been 10 pages shorter and still given the reader a look into life in a medeival town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...and beg your prof not to include it","review":"This book was on my medieval history course's required reading list...and it was dreadful. I'm not sure what was hated more...the fact that the author never ONCE cited her research or that she attempted to give her subject a personality without any basis in fact. If you want to know what life was like as a peasant there is a future professor, I would have severe doubts about using this in any course except perhaps historiography. If anyone had turned this book in as a senior thesis, no professor of mine would have accepted it; they would have ripped it to shreds for the lack of citing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eudcationally sound, not for fun","review":"This book was recommended summer reading for Advanced Placement European History. I think it will give the students an excellent understanding of Medieval Life for the majority of the population. It was not however an easy read. The organization is by theme rather than chronological and the author references many other texts that high school students and many teachers are not going to have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So ungodly boring!","review":"In addition the utter failure to make the text interesting by centering on a character who we have hardly any information about, the writing is horrendously repetitive. Each section will focus on a different aspect of medieval lifestyle but the same information is often restated in a different context. The actual writing is full of repetition and needless filler as well. With more concise writing and efficient organization of information this book, at only 138 pages which seemed to drag on longer than the entire Harry Potter series, could've been shortened to a single chapter in a regular textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus: One Hundred Years Before Christ","review":"Ellegard forcefully puts forward his theory of the mythical Christ, and defends his negativity about the human Jesus.

Freeman suggests that chaos, transistions, and repeating patterns have something to do with memory, learning and meaning, and that context is important, but so what. Those ideas have been suggested before, and I didn't find any highly compelling new arguments, either theoretical or experimental, in support for how or why these particular ideas should be correct. There are some interesting tidbits here and there when he explains some experiments in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent, disorganized, and unstructured","review":"This book, although clearly on a very interesting subject, is extremely difficult to read. It is not organized in clear chapters, the writing more like streams of consciousness than organized thought. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"Historical fiction can be a slippery slope for some writers. Bright and Cavanaugh did a very good job with this book. Unlike some Christian novels I've read, this one seems true-to-life. It's not all sugar-coated and the dialogue reads true. There are a few minor historical gaffes, but overall this was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Although I have tremendous respect and admiration for Bill Bright, this book is very poorly written. The villian is delicious, but the other characters are weak and simply chase each other around through most of the book. The \\"Holy Spirit on Trial\\" part of the book is short and incidental to the plot. The conclusion is totally predictable. While the first few pages of the book are engaging, that's as good as it gets. Take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is a real page-turner. Cavanaugh & Bright shine in this tale of a poor young lawyer who is smitten with the rich lawyer's daughter & must prove that the Holy Spirit exists to win her hand. Highly recommended.

The liner notes describe how the master tapes used to make this album were in terrible shape and had to be put through some kind of baking process in order to be usable. Frankly, I don't think it was worth it. The best recordings are the ones featuring the Alleycats, and I like this band a lot -- their music has a New-York-punk kind of sound. Next in recording quality is the F-Word performance, incuding the classic \\"Do the Nihil.\\" The problem with the X recordings is that they are such a great band that listening to their performance being defiled by this terrible sound quality is almost painful. For a much better live X recording, get \\"X - Live at the Whisley A-Go-Go.\\" The Zeros tracks are problably the worst in sound quality, which is also a shame since they too were a really good band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"I purchased this study guide to help prepare me for the American Government Clep Exam. Though the guide was fairly thorough in covering the topics that it outlined, I believe that it failed to cover the brunt of material found in the exam.I was disappointed to find out that even though the guide touched on most of the topics in the exam, it failed to cover the material in-depth enough to properly prepare someone to answer most of the questions.With that being said, I did pass the Clep Exam, but I only passed with a 58 (a score of 50 is passing, 80 is perfect). If the exam had not been packed with almost 20 questions about graph and chart interpretations, which had little to do with politics, I am sure I would have failed. Thank God for the easy questions.Anyhow, I would recommend that anyone searching for a comprehensive American Government Clep study guide search elsewhere. Good luck with your tests, and I hope you find a better study aid than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"I bought this book hoping it would be the only thing I would need to pass the test.

Don't waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much worthless","review":"This \\"book\\", which is really only a couple dozen pages, was written by a University of Phoenix employee and quickly runs through the core of US Government. Many of the main facts are mentioned, though nothing essential is explained; detail is far from the manuals forte. There are lists of the Amendments, all abbreviated, and so too are lists of some of the major Supreme Court cases. This means that you'll have an idea of what is/was entailed, annnd that's about it. I received a stapled printout practice exam with this that appeared to have once been a part of the manual (or was being added). In it were several questions on things not covered nor hinted in the rest of the materials.

Half of the movie is the snowboarders of the Burton team complaing how snowboarding is a chore and how life is hard. The other half is stock footage from the olympics in incredibly boring slow motion. Yes, Shaun White can rip with the best. Yes, Jeremy Jones can shred things that probably aren't supposed to be ridden. The riders in this video are amazing. Unfortunately, this video is about as fun to watch as atrip to the dentist office. They didn't even have DCP in there. If they did, it was bare minimum. I would Suggest any Mack Dawg video or better yet the Think Thank videos (ie; Thanks, Brain).

About half the book is made up of articles that talk about how illustration used to be, how illustration should be and how illustration is now dead (back in 2001). A lot of the articles are redundant I felt. And it wasn't constructive about how to become a successful illustrator in the new digital age. Mostly this book is too old, a little over ten years old, they mainly talk about how the computer and the web destroyed the illustration world, but the kinds of things they were saying were developments of the late 90s and early 2000s. Technology back then and now is vastly different and I'm sure the illustration industry has completely changed again.Only reason this is 2 stars and not a 1 is because I liked looking through the sample syllabi.

Because someone pissed in their Kool-Aid?) they decided to cut certain lines out of this pop masterpiece, a song that certainly should not be messed with. On top of that, several cuts on this album are NOT the originals, but are crapola re-recordings by choice members of the original bands and a mixed-bag assortment of session hacks. Caveat emptor!

Although, I have since begun buying things that are used in some of the other recipes in here. The stretchy dough is similar to playdough-I think it's better, myself. But, the author says kids won't eat it once they have one bite because it's SOOOO salty. My daughter, however, tried to eat it several times-and said yummy after her first bite.

As another commeter said if you can do anything besides FM mod do that instead. That said this is by far the best FM mod I've used. It doesn't have the static of other units I've used in the past but being FM modulation the sound is still \\"muddy\\" (but when you're in a truck blasting down the interstate at 80 mph the road noise covers up a lot of that). I like that when you switch the unit on it seems to totally cut the external signal with a bandpass filter. That way it doesn't matter so much which frequency you choose (of the two available on the unit). Also it includes a groud loop isolator which you usually have to pick up separate to eliminate engine whine.

It actually sounds better than my stock aux input in my brand new car. And from what I could tell, the radio still caught radio stations very well. Only grief I have with it would be that it comes with a less than attractive switch, which I replaced. Also there's no mounting plate or anything for the rca inputs.

Newman transcended his leading-man looks -- those blue eyes! -- to become a very fine actor with an appeal that endured well into his later years.

People may find their favorites are not on this collection, but this is a great cross-section of the 3 different eras: his early days (The Hustler), his strongest middle age days (BC&tSK), and his elderly days in which he played older people with great flaws (The Verdict). There is no sense in reviewing these 3 classics, but suffice it to say, if you have not ever seen a Paul Newman movie, this is the collection to have. Once you have tasted one of these classics or pick one out that is your favorite, then you will have a direction to go in that era for more movies of his to watch.

He is not just any writer, but the great Gombrowicz here, because he is filled with a terror that is obviously being cooked up for the world to see.

There are numerous purported \\"facts\\" stated by the authors, as well as statements intentionally designed to appear factual, that are anything but factual and subject to debate depending on the perspective undertaken while studying the issue. The title of this book would be more accurate if simply called In Conflict.

It seems weird watching these episodes now since the boys on the show are so much older these days, but that's not bad in any way really because these are deffinatley some of the best episodes. My favorite episode out of the set would have to be \\"Krelboyne Picnic\\", that one was hysterical and also one of the first that really started to have more of a feel for what the show evolved into. I liked some of the special features on these discs such as the bloopers, however the guys who do the commentary on the discs are pretty annoying in my own opinion. The main drawback to the set is that some of the episodes really aren't formatted in great quality like you'd expect in a DVD, but whatever. Basically, get this if you're a fan of the show. There's hours and hours worth of stuff on here that you'll deffinatley enjoy watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Television Show - Poor Quality Discs","review":"I pre-ordered this title as soon as I became aware that it was to be released - Malcolm in the Middle is a great show and always provides laughs.Unfortunatley I, like others who have reviewed this title before me, have encountered problems with the quality of this title.

I immediately went to Amazon.com and ordered it. At first I thought that the book was a bit expensive - but after reading it, I must say that the information included is truely invaluable!The authors not only give examples of EVP, but they also provide detailed information to help other's get results via this method (as well as methods using a video camera & TV).This is an excellent read for anyone with an interest in the \\"paranormal\\" - an open mind is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is No Death and There Are No Dead","review":"From experience I can not tell you how healing it is to once again hear the voice of a loved one from the other side of the veil.

Powerful, vigilant and able to take great amounts of enemy fire. Not get killed by a few pathetic tau pulse rifle shots. If the book had more balance to it, Kais would have met his bloody end on his very first encounter with the renowed Ultramarines. Just shameful how weak the Space Marines are in Spurrier's book.

He's only spoken to a couple people in his career (I'm one of them), and only done one interview, but has become a legend and inspired a couple tribute albums and this very watchable and respectful film. This successfully captures the singular Jandek vibe, as it unfolds like the mystery story that it ultimately is.

My deck was the best illustrated deck in our class and everyone admired it. while It did take a little getting used to to shuffle the cards (they are quite large) once you get the feel for them there is no problem.

Somethings changed for her. Like the way she dresses and even the way she ete at a table and this book tells you about how to's of a princess.I got a lot of boy advice from this book because it is true.

It teaches you a lot about proper etiquette. It almost makes you feel like you are going to an etiquette school. Health, beauty, taking care of yourself, and just the right clothes and jewelry really do make a princess. This book keeps your attention the whole entire time you read it. My favorite part of this book is when Paolo (one of the stylists for Mia's hair and make-up) turns her into a real princess almost right \\"off the street.\\" It was a lot of work!

The songwriting is dark and moody, with incredible guitar and drum work. There is a Latin influence on the drums in some tracks that reminds me of the band Puya.But mainly it's Bruce's vocal performances that have me listening to this disc over and over again. Some of his goose-bumpyest.Mainstream reviewers didn't like this cd, I think because they were expecting something that sounded like Iron Maiden. This sounds more like Seattle grunge with a classic metal edge. And I have to admit, the first time I heard it I was unsure what I thought.

The description here led me to believe that this book would be pertinent.I did not find it helpful. The author excludes outboard motors from discussion. Six of the ten chapters don't pertain at all to boats like mine: Engine Basics (because outboards are excluded), Freshwater Plumbing, Marine Toilets, Stoves, Sinks, and Refrigeration, Sailboat Rigging, and Getting Ready for the Big Trip.Relatively few new boat owners begin with a boat of a size that typically includes such features. If the description had more accurately described what one would find inside, I would have saved my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"need to know information","review":"This book is very well written and fun to read. Great illustrations and some very relevant and informative sea stories.It's a great cover to cover read and then keep on hand for reference.Probably the best thing about this book is the philosophy of being self-sufficent and learning how to handle problems that arise all on your own. (Because sooner or later, you're going to have to!)This book does a great job of getting the reader started on the self sufficent path.Great book for begginer boaters, but good for intermediate and advanced boaters as well. Even the saltiest of dogs could learn a few things here.To me it seemed equally suited to motor boaters and sailors.Lastly, it's a lot like talking to the friendly guy down at the harbor who seems to know everything and always gives you good advice, insights and pointers when you ask him.Pays for itself and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Big Boat Basics","review":"Will be appreciated by fans of John Muir's ubiquitous \\"How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Guide for the Complete Idiot,\\" without the Eastern mysticism.

The map, vehicle and kit variations are a ton of fun to use in strategic ways. From C4 explosives, to MiG fighter jets to Abrams Tanks, there is simply alot to like about BF2. Yes, there are some balance problems. The chinese J-10 jet, for instance, has always been much more powerful and stealthy than all the other planes.

Even now with Battlefield 3 available, I always come back to this on because of the HOURS of fun and mindless shenanigans my friends and I experience throughout our time playing. There are a few points that should be mentioned before buying the hard copy of the game. The first is that, currently, you are unable to play online because of the the serial numbers linked to this game have not been registered for use by Origin (Origin is a game launcher which allows you to connect online with all current EA games). This means that you would want to buy the virtual download for the game from the Origin site directly (Found here: [...]) if you want to play online. The issue will hopefully be resolved soon.

One of the neat things about this game is that it tracks your stats, i.e. kills, flag captures, medic heals/revivals, etc. Your stats are easily accesible through the game and over time, as you gain experience points, your soldier is able to gain access to more advanced weaponry.This game just offers so much that it is difficult to describe all here.

I don't think it's as good as Counter Strike, but it makes up for it being able to fly, drive and all that.Anyways, the problem I have is updating. It will not update to the latest version. So my options on which servers I can play on are pretty limited. I've tried reinstalling, re-downloading the patch. Nothing in the KB has worked. EA won't give any further support on their game, I'm guessing because of the 2142 release. Which, even with the spyware, I'm kinda regretting not buying that instead.

The color codes are easy to figure out and marked on the package and the connections do exactly plug into the Honda wiring. The mount is also a little different, the Honda signals have keyed indents on the shafts to align the signals and prevent rotation if they become loose; not an issue these signals tighten down and will not rotate. Took about one hour to replace all four signals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Includes Excellent Detail on Plank-Joining Methods","review":"This book discusses how wooden boats and ships are built, and relates them to situations where such vessels are still constructed. For instance, there is a photograph and description of the building of a wooden boat in Bangladesh (p. 40).A unique, and in my opinion exceptionally valuable, aspect of this book is its detailed set of illustrations of shell-first plank-to-plank attachments (p. 60). Numerous techniques are illustrated, including their geographic origins (e. g., Norway, India, etc.). The diagrams show how the planks are abutted against each other, what kind of fasteners are used, how the fasteners actually connect one plank to its neighbor, how the fasteners are fixed in place, methods of stopping leaks at plank-to-plank junctures, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The recording is professional.

The only thing here that is superior to Universal's Frankenstein is Peter Cushing. His performance as Dr. Frankenstein is uncanny, with the right amount of both evil and good. Sure, he's a [bad], but you still end up liking him! Christopher Lee's Creature, on the other hand, isn't as iconic as Boris Karloff's, and the look is pretty forgettable. There is no sympathy felt for this monster. At least The women are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Bucks???!!!!!","review":"Here is where the Hammer legend was born. It all started with this delightful slice of mild horror. And, as we all know, the name Hammer stood for sumptuous, low budget horror that always had grand style, visual opulence and fine star performances. Better was to come but this is a full-blooded, full colour feast with Cushing and Lee in their heyday. My main reason for adding this soft focus review was to have a go at the despicable folk who are offering a copy of this DVD for close on $1,000.00. Oh dear, such bare-faced greed is beyond comprehension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow ........ very slow !","review":"I have never liked this extremely poor version of the 'Frankenstein' myth. Made by Hammer Films in 1957 this is such a watery story. The acting is great from all the cast particularly Cushing. For me though the story just fails completely. For one thing it takes a good 40 odd minutes to get going, with lots of thumb twiddling moments to endure. I know that people love a good story and well most horror movies from this era certainly have this (See Hammer's 1958 Dracula), but this lacks any sort of build up and when the Creature finally appears it is a complete let down (Looking like the result of a custard pie fight!), and for me the whole film is a really dull anti - climax. Much better and with a heck of a lot more atmosphere is Hammer's version of 'Dracula', which is spot on with suspense, story and genuine horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Classic Halloween DVD","review":"The Curse of Frankenstein is something I used to watch as a child on televison usually on a local midnite televison show called Creature Feature.

I normally buy it directly from my stylist but as I was running low between appointments I decided to buy it from Amazon instead. This particular shampoo seems quite different from the product that I normally use so I'm wondering if it's a fake. This is surprising given that it's supposedly sold from L'Anza.This shampoo that I bought from Amazon is much runnier and the smell is a little different. It seems almost as if it's been watered down. Also, and more importantly, my hair doesn't feel as conditioned with this particular product. I recommend people buy direct from a stylist or a more reliable source. I certainly won't be buying this on-line again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much \\"wrestling\\"","review":"This should not be called backyard wrestling.

There are overdone painted lashes, and no upper ridge to make the eye look three dimensional. Also, there is too much pink and purple paint around eyes and cheeks. Please go to EBAY, and type in a year from 1967 to 1979 with the word Barbie in order to look up the dolls from those years, and you will see more normal sized heads and less obnoxious face paint. These newer dolls have not recovered from the outlandish and foolish looks of the mid 1980's.

But the one thing that I will say here is that the group(s) associated with the Watch Tower Society over the years made a huge metamorphous shortly after 1916 and the death of Pastor Russell (it is ABSOLUTELY not the same group), and from then on have been in a continual state of change (Proverbs 4:19). So trying to draw a continuous line of change, as relating to ONE particular group (the \\"Jehovah's Witnesses\\") is misleading, and a trap that many ex-JW's and others fall into. That appears to be the case with this book. It is not as simple as demonstrating \\"contradictions\\" that have taken place over a hundred and some years."},{"rating":"1","title":"quotes are wrong","review":"Well, I have not read this particular book, but I looked up the supposed quotes, and they are not reputable. Just a small example was listed by someone stating that the book \\"Insight on the Scriptures\\" says that the men of sodom will not be resurrected. None of those words appear on that page to even come close to that thought. If you are looking for errors, try the 1611 King James bible with its 22,000 errors. At one time people thought the world was flat, but time and human growth found that to be an erroneous thought. We all make mistakes and with time we correct them. In God's own due time, he will force everyone on earth to know exactly who he is. Those who are obedient to HIM will find themselves under his protection. Those who disobey will not see life.

I guess the thing that strikes me most about this book is that the authors could not find one positive thing to say about these Jehovah's Witnesses in their entire publication.While some may have different beliefs, a more balanced viewpoint is definitely needed. These authors were not balanced, they were out to discredit the witnesses at all costs.Don't buy this book if you want to hear both sides, but feel free to buy it if you are interested in a one-sided view."},{"rating":"2","title":"ERRORS ?

Among the more insightful data collected through this divine endeavor are these, two of my favorites:\\"Rev. William Draper, once black, is now white in answer to prayer.\\" (Watchtower Magazine 10/1/1900, p..2707)\\"White people living in China eventually produce Chinese offspring -- without intermarrying -- due to the influence of soil and climate.\\" (Watchtower Magazine 7/15/1902, p.3043)Okay, with a track record like that you've got to know they're \\"SERIOUS.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Buy!","review":"This book is a must own for any library.

Lee Cullum offers glib, shallow, journalistic analysis. Every cliche you tune out when it appears on The Evening News or Charlie Rose is trooped out here. A litmus test of what the middlebrow thinks. Or rather what passes for thought with such a middlebrow. It's really a truimph of recycling.

She samples breakfasts (never giving up a preference to donuts for the traditional rice and fish, which makes her gag), Japanese medicine (no advanced orthopedic surgery, surprising in a land with great health overall.) Pauline has a good way with descriptions and is not afraid to state her opinion. For example, she didn't like Singapore much (I found it about the opposite of everything she said and I DO like Japanese breakfasts a lot.)The fun details like toilet slippers, kimono customs and the reactions of everyday people make this worth reading. I enjoyed a vicarious visit back to Japan, comparing my notes to Pauline's. A fun read and would be good for anyone who is curious about daily life in Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antiquated ideas","review":"Pauline Hager writes a very concise report of her stay as an Expat in Japan. As a fellow expat that lived as an Expat, I could relate to Ms.Hager's experiences. However what struck me was her consistent faintly condesending way of describing her interactions with her friends, specifically her 'dear' Japanese friends. Here is one of her many dispariging remarks: 'If you have a chance, ask a Japanese to pronounce Mark McGuire'', writes Ms. Hager, after hearing one of her dear friends excitedly describing her sighting of this famous baseball player.

Now as for my review of this CD. I know ICP's true sound, and this sure is not their true sound. They have started their unfortunate downcline here, as if they're trying to get softer on us. I do like a few songs, but I can't say I love ICP anymore, I simply like their older stuff. I don't love any songs off of here but I do enjoy a few if I hear them.

A real ICP fan might want to cry. I was so dissapointed that I gave the CD away.What a cop out. How can ICP create such a huge following, encouraging them to become juggalos and get tattoos, and then betray them by turning their backs on everything that they ever stood for.Unless you want to hear ICP try to convince you that all the old music was just a big trick and they real message is holyness (and set to very, very ...heavenly music), avoid this like the plague..."},{"rating":"1","title":"it stinks!","review":"this album was a major disappointment, its pretty bad, only a comple of songs are even listenable, i dont know what happend here, but this album is a total abortion, maybe too much time off between albums or something, just seems like they were not even trying.just makes me all the more the eminem fan, he never disappoints his fans, unlike these has-beens"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the World Come to an End Yet?","review":"This band is terrible!

I've been down with the clown for close to 7 years, and this album was supposed to be Shangri-La, the summation of everything else.

It's amazing to believe that in all these albums that there were positive messages laiden throughout them, but it's true. YOu can hear them if oyu listen carefully.

Oh well, thats why ICP doesn't sell half of what they use to and can't even get signed to a major label anymore, so they are getting what they deserve.

There would be six Joker's cards in all and the sixth one would mark some apocalyptic event. The apocalyptic event? The arrival of the worst album I've ever heard in my life. For years and years ICP amped up the sixth Joker's card. Once I listened to this album, I finally realized that being a \\"juggalo\\" was moronic and infantile.

A new ICP CD!\\" I get home and put it on and to my surprise the music was very different. No cool sample work and the beats just weren't as catchy. Sure, Shaggy and Violent J still got mad skills as lyricists but the whole thing just sounds flat, with none of the spark they had on Riddle Box, The Great Milenko or even The Jeckel Brothers.Mike E. Clark was half the band and this new (Mike P. or whatever-his-name-is-try-to-fool-people-who-don't-really-pay-attention-with-a-similar-name) guy just can't replace him.

Why? because ICP decied that what they were doing was morally wrong, and dedicated there live to Jesus Christ. bringing there off the wall \\"insane\\" dialog to a complete halt.this is what happend. this is this cd. this is NOT insane clown posse.

I calmly listened to the whole thing twice, took it out of the cd player, and threw it away. It's just absolutely un-listenable. If you have never listened to ICP I suggest ringmaster, riddle box, and great milenko, as they are great albums and represent the high point in the Insane clown posse's short career.

With the exceptions of Bizzar/Bizaar, and Mirror Mirror. When the Great Milenko came out it was by far the best ICP cd of it's time. The Amazing Jekel Brothers was even better. Bizzar/Bizaar was a letdown, as ICP's style was changing. Gone were the semi-rap songs, if you could even call them that, and were replaced by songs where these 2 CLOWNS were trying to sing. Ahem... trying to sing. Now lets talk about the Wraith. Or not. You might not even want to waste ur time on a cd like this. But in case u already dished out the 20 bucks for it, it makes a great frisbee!!! By far the WORST ICP cd of ALL time. The music sounds horrible. And again ICP is trying 2 sing.

This album is sad, I can only hope Hell's Pit (which is late, by over 4 months. \\"Exactly one year later we will release..\\" BULLSH*T Violent-J!) if it even comes out, will be better than this disgracing album. If you want good ICP, get anything from Ringmaster up to Bizzar Bizaar, and leave this on the shelves.

Is obvious why they had to give it away. No features or menus usually available on DVDs. While the audio is poor it is sufficient to expose the very poor live musical quality of the concert.If you own all other ICP discs, sure buy this one too. Otherwise this should be your last choice. Amazing Jeckle Brothers, Great Milenko, and Tunnel of Love are much better values than this CD.

I either have to jump ahead to chapter 6 to figure out what in the heck the author is talking about and hope I could understand that chapter without reading previous ones (I couldn't), or simply skip it for now and hope it wasn't important (it was). I tried both, and neither method worked.I keep asking myself why other reviewers praise this work. Why does every computer book written in the past couple years have at least 4 1/2 stars?

But that's not what this movie is. Rather, these directors have invented their own religeon and labled it Christian, and from what I can see, simply to denigrate Christians. Which means that it's not a movie about a crazy Christian woman beating and murdering her family: it's an insult pointed at a particular religeon. Sad.

My problem is with the story. Telling about a bunch of stuff that happened is different than telling a story. One of the reviews referred to \\"rebellion and redemption\\". What redemption??? It would have been much better if there had been any redemption included in the novel. I will summarize this book so you don't have to waste your time. -- A bunch of disillusioned people get involved in a rebellion. Some die, some don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unruly self-important novel","review":"Whence all the 5 star reviews? One of the great political thrillers? Seriously? A cross between Malcolm Lowry and Dostoyevsky? I must have missed something. Stone is capable of some very fine writing, for sure. He's also capable of some very incoherent writing. And if the incoherence was meant to serve as a metaphor for the incoherence of history or of American foreign policy or of anything else, then it's a metaphor that fell flat early on in this very very over-long novel. I've read many a so-called great novel that was richly deserving of the moniker. This one struck me, after the first 200 pretty compelling pages or so (hence my second star), as a bore from then on. A long, painfully slow, and highly pretentious bore. I couldn't wait to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good event, terrible version.","review":"If this was the whole event it would be 4 stars but this is just a hacked up 1 hour video with only 4 matches, and 1 of those matches doesn't even have a finish, it just cuts to the next match. Basically your missing out on 6 death matches and a few more undercard matches. The videos \\"king of the deathmatch\\" yet they only show 1 out of 7 death matches. Whats worse is that this hacked up piece of garbage costs the same as other 3 hour XPW events. The only good Baptized in Blood video is the second one. This one is obviously too short and the first one is just garbage. Try to pick up the full 3 hour version of this tape and you'll love it, if your in to death match style wrestling. But stay away from this version, and any other edited 1 hour XPW videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book provides almost no information about designing VFCs despite its title. Rather it is a collection of manufacturers data sheets and application notes about how to use a limited range of prepackaged VFC/FVC chips.Even Chapter 6 which was billed as describing \\"a number of discrete-component VFC and FVC circuit approaches\\" is only a rehash of circuits from the National Semiconductor linear handbook based round their IC implementations.I could not recommend this book to anybody. If you have had little or no exposure to use VFC/FVCs circuits then I would recommend reading the Analog Devices etc. data sheets and design guides rather than wasting money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must DVD On Buddy Rich","review":"Buddy Rich was a complex and extremely talented, gifted man.

It's like reading two-thirds of the novel with the last third missing. I know that David Sherman is developing the series but he's trying too hard to develop the world concepts and history in one book. It's almost like a pre-book in which it prepares the reader for the rest of the series.

He should stick to the Starfist novels and concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT COVER - BORING BOOK!","review":"I have always noticed these 2 writers and have tried the 1st of the STARFIST series - and just like this one, quickly lost interest.

The main character is a leftist private detective, who dislikes the incompetent and corrupt police (but is the daughter of a senior Prefecture of Police officer), who has a weakness for bad boys, Couture fashion and cigarettes, and is possibly the most annoying character I have read. The author has no clue about criminal investigations, French law enforcement, weapons, or forensics, but besides that...Also the author besides her socialist leaning drivel and improbable plot lines, has the charming ability of making Paris the City of Light, seem as drab, grimy and nearly appealing as Detroit."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Third And Last of the series","review":"Having enjoyed Cara Black's debut novel, I proceeded to read the next two. Having read the third one, I can say with certainty that it will also be the last. What starts off as charming and interesting very quickly turns formulaic. It's as though the author has a specific plot outline that she follows for each book, and while her detailed depiction of Paris remains interesting/unique, everything else is the same old, same old. Each book begins with an unexpected event unrelated to the protagonist's real line of business, and against her best judgment, she takes on the challenge. This leads to twists and turns, with the 'regular' recurring characters hovering in the background, and then ends with a heavy-handed and unrealistic action scene where the protagonist emerges, injured but alive. Key protagonist Aimee's character remains undeveloped, as well as those around her. Too bad, it was off to a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for the atmosphere","review":"Aimee Leduc is drawn into the Sentier, home of Paris's Rag and Shag trades, now its Silicon Valley.

When that woman is murdered, Aimee takes up the search for the mother and her terrorist past. Was Aimee's father a dirty cop? Is Mom still alive? Uses flashbacks of an old terrorist who returns to reveal info. The plot is a bit too jumpy--someone has information and the phone goes dead a few too many times.

The number and variety of recipes is appropriate for the age range of the intended audience, and boiled dumplings are included, by the way. Recipes for this crowd need to be simple and straightforward. It also offers a glossary of cooking terms and a list of more unusual ingredients and where to find them.

There are a man and wife who own a Nevadan brothel, various working girls, a cretinous boxer, etc. The plot requires one to accept premises that are hard to swallow--for example, the \\"affair\\" between Ms. Mirren and the Argentinian boxer. The writer got things into such a state of affairs that the only way to end this was an event akin to a deus ex machina.

Helen Mirren looks like she hates being in every scene and her innate dignity doesn't fit the low-life character she plays.

Reading the second edition, I can kind of see that -- occasionally there will be a stretch of 5 pages or so that is wonderfully clear, concise, and informative.But overall, this edition is a disappointment. The explanations tend to be mechanical and unhelpful, and are sometimes confused or just incorrect. New sections on mathematical foundations and applications have been added, but there isn't really adequate space devoted to covering either topic, and the results are so rushed and lacking in context that I can't see those sections being useful to anyone who would need them in the first place.

It contains numerous mistakes, some of them in the presentations of key proofs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book is an exercise in frustration. The format, which is inexcusable in a text for nonexperts, is 'Provide example, then dissect example into pieces organized by theory.' I personally find this approach very hard to follow. I would much rather have the relevant theory discussed first, then, once I know the rules, have examples.Additionally, there is a vast insufficiency of examples and exercises in this book. Repetition is learning, and to be able to leave with a functional understanding of the concepts, students need to have a variety of illustrative problems available. The exercises in this book are weak at best. Solutions to all exercises must be provided if there is to be any benefit to working through them in the first place.The fact that this book is the best available introductory text for this subject only shows that there is plenty of room for some ascendant computer science faculty to write a well written, well organized, and amply illustrated, replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"As a student using this book, I simply found it a little too difficult at times to grasp what the concepts were.

We need to believe in the power of Lettieri's imagination, not whether he accurately remembered the color of his fax machine and what it sounded like at 4pm. The writing tends to be melodramatic and awkward in spots, giving away too much of the author's emotional history. Subtlety, sir, mystery, suspense, brave soldier!

As soon as I opened it I didn't like the feel of the paper used. Not like Bobby Flay's cookbooks or Tyler's Ultimate. There were no pictures of the finished meals, which I love to look at. I guess I need books with lots of pictures. LOL.I spent plenty of money on a paellera and paella burner and was hoping to get recipes to use with that type of gear. I will not be putting my paella in the oven any time soon. How will you get that delicious socarrat? Might as well watch YouTube and get ideas from there.I will give it two stars because the recipes Ms. Casas gives us are still useful. At least it gives you a list of ingredients and you can go from there. Just don't put it in the oven.I would have purchased Paella Paella instead, but I'll wait for someone like my sister to buy it for me because it's not cheap. I will probably get her Tapas book though.I'm bummed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an authentic colection of recipes","review":"As a professional my self I do not advice to buy this book, the reason is simple: People who are involved in mixed paellas (meats & seafood) do not understand the true soul of this dish. Ask anyone in Valencia what he thinks about mixing shrimp with meats, Its a herecy! I recomend you buy the book \\"100 Paellas & 1 Fidehuá, this is the closest you will be to the real thing but is in Spanish only.

Cock-fighting is \\"traditional\\" too. At some point we all have to wake up and stop being so \\"traditional\\". I'd like a vegan paella book but I'll tolerate a seafood one. But bunnies?

It is keeping disconected and short distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This product does not stay in your ear w/o the ear hook as it claims. Kind of flops around. The buttons are difficult to manage. You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not. It goes into sleep mode after a short amount of time but doesn't reconnect to the phone unless you request it to do so, sending calls to voice mail. The ear pieces are difficult to change out to smaller or larger. The part of the ear piece that goes into the device breaks easily.Not going to buy another bluetooth product that goes in my ear. They don't fit small ears well and they're not comfortable with glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try, but missed the basics","review":"The sound quality is average for a BT stereo BT headset. I really like the idea of combing the standard mono cell phone headset with the stereo capabilities, but it basically misses on both fronts because the ear pieces do not stay in place and are painful. I am an earbud fan, and these are the worst I have ever seen. I have had this for several months and neither I or my wife ever really use it because it is too uncomfortable and the earbuds do not stay in place. It does not stay in place on the train. I would never even consider it for working out, even with no motion and they do not stay in place. Unfortunately, I have not seen another attempt at this, because I love the concept. I will take it on international business trips where I can use the one piece with my WM smartphone to skype. This is the only useful application I have found. Buy the Motorola Rocker S9 and a decent hands free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons make this unusable.","review":"Only use this a couple of days before returning it. The call button is so stiff, it's next to impossible to press while the headset is in your ear. Even when I held the unit in one hand and pressed the button with the other, you were never sure if the press registered. The volume buttons were not this stiff though.The one PRO I can give this headset is that I was surprised at how high the volume was. I never had problems hearing what I was listening to, whether it was a call or music from the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek but only decent overall","review":"This thing is quite sleek and compact but overall it's performance is only fair.

I am very disappointed because the fees to ship the product back eat up any savings from good prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Static-Returning it!","review":"I was not happy with this product. There is just way too much static. The only thing I liked was the ear bud, which fits my ear just fine because I have small ears. The pairing was difficult, sometimes it will pair on it's own, most of the time I have to pair it manually because I use it for both my computer on Skype and on my cell when I go out. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAY THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE 655, 665, OR 925","review":"This headset did not work well at all. Although the unit was loud enough, the people that I tried to talk to on the phone had trouble understanding me and I also had trouble understanding them. The noise cancellation feature of Plantronics more expensive models mostly cures this problem. Also, the headset's bluetooth connection to my RAZR V3 dropped almost every time that I was close to another cell phone or a computer system, sometimes for thirty seconds or more. This was very annoying. I returned this headset and replaced it with a Plantronics Discovery 655 from DBROTH through Amazon.com which I am was very happy with until I got it soaking wet and ruined it.Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Ultimate Bluetooth Headset with DSP for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones-RetailPlantronics Discovery 665A Bluetooth Headset (Black/Silver)Plantronics Discovery 925 - Headset ( in-ear ear-bud ) - wireless - Bluetooth 2.0 EDR"},{"rating":"1","title":"First impression has failed","review":"This is our first ever Plantronics wireless earpiece.

When we open, charge for three hours and try to pair it for the first time, the light does not open up to go on pairing mode. I have called customer service and they walked me through a couple of troubleshooting steps to conclude that it is a defective unit. I need to send it back to Plantronics and they will ship me back a replacement.

I had a small and medium and neither one felt good in my year and the headset would slide down while i was talking and I'd have to readjust which meant pushing more in my ear and bottom like is, it just doesn't wear good at all. After two months a light came on and wouldn't go off. Tried going through tech support and because it wasn't under warranty, they couldn't help me :(.

So far, I have been so unhappy with this bluetooth headset that I have not taken time to explore its options. The charge barely lasts 8 hours. In addition, the charging device is cumbersome. The ear piece sometimes falls off. All in all, I feel like I wasted my money. This is unusual for a plantronics bluetooth headset. I have owned several. All but this one were reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"I bought this because I thought it was a good price and was able to pair with more than one phone which would be perfect. It works ok but doesn't work with the advertised distance from the handset and the reception/transmission quality is not very good. Most people on the other end of my connection complain about my words being cut off and also static."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"Short & sweet. I bought this because it was a good deal and the reviews were decent. The headsets I owned before this were... The Jawbone (Original) which had great audio and battery, but was uncomfortable and unpocketable. Then, the blueant Z9 serviceable comfort, bad sound and lost, due to the unstable built in clip. Moving on to the next victim.In it's defense, this headset is the most comfortable I've ever owned. Bad news? The battery life is unforgivably short. The audio is mediocre. If you're in a quiet place, it's fine. Add ambient noise and the party is over. Also, should you lose the cleverly designed charging case, there is no longer a way to charge it.

It fits comfortably and securely in the ear, and if you have trouble getting a fit you like it comes with an over-ear loop for an even more secure fit. It has great battery life, reasonably fast charging, and more than adequate talk time and volume. The volume is easy to adjust, and it is a very user friendly device. It even can be charged with a AAA battery if you are out and don't have a vehicle charger. (If only my cel phone could do that...)

It helped me shed pounds when I needed to, and has prevented me from becoming really overweight, despite the fact that I love to cook and eat! I love Groger's common sense approach - don't eat when you're not hungry and sensitize yourself to the different levels of hunger. Learn to trust your body. This isn't a \\"sexy\\" or trendy diet book, and Groger doesn't give you excuses or mince words. Instead she explains why people develop weight problems and what to do about them.

I am only on the third week of the six week challenge but so far it has been extraordinary. I can eat WHATEVER I WANT and enjoy it. I just have to pay attention to what I am eating and eat only when I am hungry. You'd think that wouldn't be hard but it has been challenging (what? eat without reading?). The payoff?

It actually has a list of words not to say to people. The author includes multiple ads throughout the book promoting his other books, which I seriously doubt are any good if this one is any indication.

So I went back to my old dryer to finish the job, and checked the dryer afterward, and still did not turn on. Amazon was quick about sending me a second blow dryer.

(I honestly do not believe that it was meant for this particular one) It doesnt make a huge difference due to 2 of the 3 attachments are basically the same thing (one just has a little bit of a larger air way.)

I decided I could live with that because it was merely cosmetic, BUT over the past 10 days or so, the handle has become unbearably hot to hold if drying my hair or my daughter's hair for more than 5 minutes!

The main character, Rose, seems to be almost incapable of real feeling or emotion. She is loved but does not seem able to love in return. I kept thinking that at some point, the viewer would be given insight into why Rose behaves the way she does.I was assuming that there was a reason she was so damaged, but there wasn't, or at least we are not told if indeed there was. Perhaps Ann Patchett, the author, is simply saying that some people are this way and they should just be accepted. The acting was ok, and it was nice to see Clancy Brown in the role of Rose's almost-too-good-to-be-true second husband, but it all just seemed so pointless.

For one thing there is no Ruby Wilcox, and I for one really missed her, as well as other eccentric citizens of Pecan Springs. It was interesting to look back at China's early life, and the mysitical theme was actually quite well done. This wasn't a mystery though in the true sense of the word. It's more a search for the past in China's mother's family. I still enjoyed the book, but I do want to get back to the main storyline in the next book in the series. We also see China getting softer and more feminine in each book. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope she doesn't get too soft since her toughness is part of the appeal of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangled Family Tree","review":"This is the first Susan Wittig Albert book I've read.

The family history was confusing especially when the author kept referring to them differently -- one sentence a character might be referred to as Great-Great grandfather and the next it would be Leatha's grandfather. Also, I was confused as to a character that had a different name than what was on the family tree so I had no clue what was going on -- I did go back and re-read portions after I had read an except of a diary entry and the light went on but reading 120 pages for a light to blink... well, 'nuff said.Once I figured out who the characters all were, the plot was so obvious it hurt and to have to read China being braindead with her questions to figure out the truth was less than thrilling.Had I not had the prior history of this series, I would have never made it through this book.Let's hope the next one get's back to the roots of China (and McQuaid)."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOWTIME DOES ROCK","review":"I DONT UNDERSTAND THE DOWN REVIEWS ON THIS CD.

Each Kix album is distinctly different in sound, but even this die-hard fan has to admit their final effort misses the mark. 9-1-1 is probably the best song on the CD, and captures the sound of their previous efforts. The majority of the album is almost a dismal, tired attempt at something between blues and rock. Several tracks I can't stand to listen to.

The thing that I can tell when i love a film is when I feel jealous when other people have seen it. It's like, \\"How dare you see this film, it's my world!\\" I didn't want the film to end. Some more picky people might have spotted some minor flaws, but I thought it had a nice blend of romance, comedy and a good deal of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how you do it !!","review":"This movie is awesome, it delivers three times the value of most other movies. It is longer, more interesting, more scenic, and more impressive.The casting choices bordered on perfection. The scenery was spectacular. Best of all, the movie is a good influence for children. I find this to be extremely rare for a Hollywood product.Too bad we have to wait a year for the next part. I'm pretty sure I will see this one at the theatre again.

And I think the movie was great. The acting was good, the costumes and props were well made with great attention to detail, and unlike other movies, the hordes of badguys are not all CG. Although, there are a few things I hoped would be in the movie from the book that are not. Examples: Tom Bombadil is missing, some dialogue between Gandalf and Saruman was changed, and there are other small things changed or taken out in the transformation from book to movie. Although if the movie were exactly like the book, it would be long enough to warrant an intermission. Still, it was a very good movie overall. I suppose 4.5 stars would be a more accurate reflection of my opinion, but I apparently can't do that. From what I hear, the DVD is going to have more footage, so I might not be disappointed after all. Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT.","review":"If you were kind of ho-hum about the theatrical-release version of \\"Fellowship\\", then you absolutely MUST see this version.

The movie is not like the book word for word but I think that's what makes it so good. The spirit of the book was there and that was what made it great. I have already gone to see it three times and I'm going to go again when I have the chance. I love all of the characters and I love how Sam stays with Frodo even though he is scared most of the time. But it shows that Sam is maybe the one true friend that Frodo has on this journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"What a movie! True entertainment!

I really enjoyed it.p.s. not suitable for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly perfect!","review":"I read the Lord of the Rings years ago and loved the books, but I never thought someone could successfully tackle such a large undertaking. Peter Jackson did and he created a masterwork of our time. People from all walks of life were excitedly talking about how amazing this movie was as we left the theater. I have not seen such a strong reaction since viewing Schindler's List. The movie is approximately 3 hours long, and people were complaining that it wasn't enough...they wanted MORE. Excellent acting and wonderful effects which simply enhance, but do not overpower this production. PLEASE see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Let's go hunt some Orcs!\\" -Aragorn; The Lord of the Rings","review":"This is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen!

But why is the first release of the VHS in full screen only? I don't want to wait until November for a two tape extended version which will be widescreen.

Widescreen is the best way to view any movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One Movie to Rule them All!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is definately the best movie ever made. It has absolutely no flaws. The special effects are spectacular, and they did a good job with making middle Earth look like Middle Earth. This is the first part of 3 movies. It is about Frodo Baggins who has got the one ring to rule all rings. Sauron is the villan and he is trying to take that ring from him. Frodo must journey to the Cracks of Doom which is located in Sauron's Lair! Along the way he faces Orcs, Goblins, and other things.

I own the extended and theatrical releases already. BUT, I had to buy them to see the \\"Never before behind the scenes documentary\\". To be honest, I wasn't impressed. A few funny things, but all in all...I could have lived without it. It's just a bunch of stuff slapped together with no rhyme or reason. The Extended version extra material is so far superior. That's my opinion.But like me, you may just have to have it! Shame on the greedy movie companies for doing this to us!If you don't own the movies and are generally not into the extras, this is definitely a good way to go, You get both versions and in a very smart package."},{"rating":"1","title":"got 2 of the same disk","review":"I bought this some time ago, but decided to watch it before the hobbit came out.

Couple that most of the extended scenes are in Gladrial forest (which I felt was grossly underdeveloped in the original movie version) and this is far superior to the original movie versionMy only disappointment was of the additional 37 minutes footage, 19 minutes was a list of all official LOTR fan club members. I am sure there are quite a few people who could have thought of a much better way to use those extra 19 minutes! I don't object to the fans being listed, but I do object to them being marketed as over half of the 'extra 37 minutes worth of footage!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I think this movie was best movie I've ever seen.I love all the action and how the costumes and make-up were done,it looked so good.But the part of the movie I liked the best was the young elf Lagolas (I think that's how you spell it),he is so hot in this movie,I mean he is just so sexy.I love how he does the bow and arrows,it just makes him look even sexier.I can't wait to see the rest of the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR is the BEST!!!","review":"Fellowship of the Ring is one of the most excellent first chapters of a trilogy i have ever seen. Unlike the overall disappointing Star Wars:Episode 1, Fellowship's anticipation was well deserved. I was not a big lotr fan until i read Fellowship and saw the movie in its opening weekend. LOTR is now my favorite series!! Gandalf is perfectly played by Ian McKellen. Infact almost every character is perfectly cast, especially Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn. There are some characters that dont belong in some of the action sequences (ARWEN!!!!!!!!!!) but other than that this movie is great. The story is of course excellent. And the direction, acting, scenery, detail, and special effects are great as well. But the action scenes (weathertop, Bridge of Khazadum, Amon Hen) are the best parts of this, my favorite movie. But, I have a big feeling that The Two Towers, which opens wednesday :D, will top it in almost every single way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even a fan...but LOVED the extras","review":"OK, so I bought this for my wife as I am not (was not?) really a fan of the books or the cartoon Hobbit movies. I thought the movie was \\"good\\" but its the technical mastery of this DVD that I appreciate.The volume of special features, \\"making of\\" shorts and wonderful cast commentaries make for a truly wonderful \\"geek fest\\".As a movie I rate it as good, as a pure technical achievemnet, it gets 5+ stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings -The Fellowship of the Ring (Extended)","review":"Hello. I must say, that any true fan of the newest LOR trilogy movies, must have the extended version of the first film. The extended scenes add a little more insight into some of the characters, and also adds more enjoyment in watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better blu-ray than expected.","review":"Audio/Video is a hobby of mine. I follow a few websites that rate the quality of blu-ray releases. The video of this blu-ray was rated only as fair with the other two ranking higher. When the series went of sale for $7.99 each, I bought all three with no expectations, especially for this one. Well, was I ever surprised to see the quality of the video on this blu-ray. And the audio is even better yet. Much better than the audio/video of the dvd version, which I watched repeatedly. So, while not the extended version, I still think this is an exceptional blu-ray that will provide a lot of enjoyment for fans of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate to say this, but...","review":"I actually like the theatrical release better. For TTT, the extended version has a much better flow and just makes better sense...but in Fellowship, those extra scenes feel like just that - extra scenes. The flow is weird. The \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" sequence would've been better off as a separate feature...it's a half an hour into the movie before anything happens!! One scene (when they are captured in Lothlorien) was filmed before the costumes & makeup were even finalized, and it really sticks out like a sore thumb. Many of the lines in it are redundant, as well, and it seemed like they threw it in there \\"just because\\". I do enjoy the rest of the Lothlorien extensions, but mostly b/c that was one of my favorite parts of the book.I gave it 4 stars, though, b/c on the whole, it is a very good movie, and having it split into 2 discs is very helpful with the whole \\"bathroom break\\" issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I am giving this film 4 stars based more on its asthetic qualities than on the storyline. The story of the film was interesting and at times riveting, but it was not the full story of the Tolkien book.Can you enjoy the film? Yes, regardless of whether or not you have read the books. You must however release the story of the book and go with the story of the film. Characters have been developed or cut back in order to improve the flow of the movie, but you may find that one of the less well developed characters is one of your favorites from the book. Worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says it didnt fallow the book???","review":"Like many other LOTR movie fans, I am sick of hearing people say that the Fellowship movie didn't fallow the book. IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH! I have read the book, and everything they left out in the movie was just a bunch of fluff that did NOT really effect the story at all. I suggest you buy the movie AND read the book, that way you get the best of both worlds. Peter Jackson did an excellent job, because if he had added all that \\"fluff\\" in, the movie would have been 4 hours long, and half of it would just be boring. So love the movie, and the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","review":"What a crime. This is probably the worst transfer of a movie to DVD in that last two years.

The colors are bad, the encoding is blurry and full of artifacts and the sound is imbalanced, uneven and just plain bad. I was really looking foward to this dvd and had high expectations.

I was thrilled to have read so maney reports on P.J (Peter Jackson) saying that they will stick to the book as much as he can.

Someone like Sean Connery when he was young, etc. Just his entry to a scene should make one think that he is a king."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Of The Rings kicks Harry Potter's butt!!!!!!!","review":"This film was fantastic it was always exciting and there was always something happening all the time.

Even though the film was 3 hours long it diddn't bore me- because i thought at first i was going to get bored sitting for 3 hours watching this film but it did not bore me at all because there was always something new happening and i thouroughly enjoyed the film.This film is loads better than Harry Potter because Harry Potter is mainly a kids film as this one is for kids and adults.

If you've ever read the LOTR by JRR Tolkien, you will know that the producers followed the book very closely. For once, movie producers did not change the characters nature or go for glitz over substance.At times the movie can fall off into melancholic sullenness, but the story is profound and deep. The entire LOTR series is a classic story of good versus evil. The evil here is well-entrenched, but somehow the hero seems to get by.It is a long movie and sometimes the characters may be hard to distinguish from afar. Have a seat and join Samwise Gamgee, Frodo the Hobbit and their adventures through the menace of Middle Earth.Would not recommend for young children, the action can be a bit gory, sinister and violent; but these times are scattered throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"People like this movie!!?!?","review":"This movie, was the most boring piece of [trash] I've ever seen!

This movie was so terrible that we turned if off after the first hour: the only reason I subjected myself to that much of this drivel is because I love Ian McKellan's acting, regardless of what part he plays. He's the only reason I even gave this movie 1 star--that and because 0 stars is not possible with amazon.com's rating system. Elijah Wood is beyond irritating as Frodo, the villian who forged the ring is utterly impotent, and the Golum character who terrified me when I was a child and first exposed to this story was completely pitiable in this hackneyed version--getting my money back from the video store for this rental was easy; where do I go to demand a refund of my time is what I need to know now."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Bad Movie","review":"The first half of this movie is very good. I love to listen to story and there are people telling the story... physically... in the first half of the movie. It really draws me into the plot. However, story telling disappears very quickly in the second half of the movie. The second half of the movie is filled with cheap special effects that don't do anything to the movie in my opinion. You see people running around smashing this and that mindlessly. There is virtually no dialog... no story telling... The second half is so bad that I actually want to leave the movie theater. If I have to compare this movie with another movie, I will say that the movie Princess Bride is a much better 5-star original. I have never read Lord of the Rings. So, I will go see the rest of the movie when it comes out just to see how it ends. If the second movie is bad again, I will skip the third and go buy the book and read it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish claptrap for the Star Wars crowd","review":"I can't believe I wasted three hours on an orgy of childish, quasi-mystical good-vs-evil claptrap, only to have this poor excuse for a movie end with a cynical cliff-hanger designed to lure everyone back into the theater for the sequel. An embarrasment for otherwise fine actors like Holm and McKellen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings? More like Bored of the Rings!","review":"I'm a big movie buff, I've seen Citizen Cane and I love Castleblanca, but I can not see why this film has gotten so much attention! It bills itself as a historical drama, but none of the history books I've looked through mentioned any great war or things like Hobbits or Elves. And talk about a long movie! They think we need another half an hour? ...I recomend Pearl Harbor, it's a much more historically acurate and the love story is more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A STUPID MOVIE!","review":"omg, thought this movie was an unbelievable film. I mean who would watch this dork flik!?!? this is truthfull, i swear when i watched this at the theaters all the people had torpedo glasses, zits, jeeze... just the dork flik. all the freakin' characters are gay, Froto... son of a \\"female dog\\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Lord of the Rings was a TERRIBLE movie. It was waaay too long, and a complete waste of money...and time! Some long movies are ok because they have a fast pace, which was clearly not the case with this one. There is no way I'm seeing it again or any of the other two. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the elves, hated the rest. Stupid.","review":"Bored. Bored by the books, too, but the movie got such great reviews I thought the visuals would be worth it. I like fantasy and adventure epics generally so I can only speculate as to why I'm in the severe minority on this one.Briefly, it may be a guy thing. The redundant battle scenes particularly. How many times am I expected to see Frodo almost killed and Our Heroes fight off a zillion attackers in one movie? Particularly, the death scene at the end was like watching some kind of bad soldier porn.As a female I appreciate Hollywood's attempt to put some attractive males in here. At least my attention is not expected to be held by ugly, short, kind of slow, nasty hobbits like in the novels in which they seem to do nothing but eat elf crackers at regular intervals for 1500 pgs.Classic. Masterpiece. With so many long positive review there has to be a point. All I can say is :Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film Ever Made","review":"Previous to watching the Lord of the Rings, the Wizard of Oz remained my all-time favorite movie, even well into my adult-hood. Now that special place inside my imaginative heart has been sufficiently re-filled, and re-fueled, by Jackson's Lord of the Rings. A better movie does not exist. I would have gladly paid fifteen dollars to see it, and probably will, as I return to the movie theater over and over again. I can't stop thinking about it, or stop re-playing the richness of the landscapes in my mind. This film really captured the essence of J.R.R. Tolkien's first book of his Lord of the Rings triolgy. It is going to be a long year waiting for the next installment, The Two Towers. If this doesn't get the Best Picture Oscar, I have given up all hope in the Motion Picture Academy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic movie for an epic book.","review":"A movie cannot tell all the details that make a book a literary masterpiece but \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\" comes close.

So good, in fact, that I will go again in the next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, but...","review":"I was extremely pleased with this treatment of the classic text.

A group of people (in this case an Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, etc.) get together on a common quest-- to destroy the symbol of ultimate evil. I love this movie and recommend to anyone 12 and up. The Orcs and other scary elements would be too much for younger kids. I saw the movie first, and then read all the books as well. That made the movie better seeing it after I had read the books too, because you catch something new in it every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Jackson is genius!","review":"When I first heard that they were going to make a 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings' movie, the first thought that crossed my mind was, \\"Great. They're going to destroy another book by making it into a movie\\".You see, I'm one that hates it when one of my favorites is brought front and center into the attention of the media. Usually, with all the hype and commercialism, something will be tainted and I will loose all my love for it.However, this was not the case with the movie created by Peter Jackson. He did an amazing job sticking to the book, and I simply cannot wait for the other two movies to be released.Genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kissin' cousins","review":"Did you know that Aragorn and Arwen are distant cousins or that Galadriel is Elrond's mother-in-law?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One movie to stop them all and in the darkness end them!","review":"This is tooooo boring watch harry potter. Hey don't look at me like that, this movie didn't have quidditch in it,just stupid fantasy and boring effects. LOTR should not go to your head people it is nothing but a stupid fantacy. Any person who goes to church would not watch it because of its title, LORD of the rings! yeah right....never gunna happen!

LORD of the rings...palease...I feel sorry for all of you people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long!!","review":"This is good family entertainment complete with a good story line and great anamation. The problem is that it is too long and then it dumps you like Justin did Britney, right on your behind!

The DVD has tons of special features, not that I needed any other reasons to buy this masterpeice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"I have to admit, I've never read any of the LOTR books. Now that I've seen the first movie, I think I will start them soon. The first time I watched the movie, I couldn't understand most of it. The second time I watched it, I really liked it! The costumes are nice and the scenery is beautiful. The actors who played the characters were perfect for their parts. My favorite characters would have to be Legolas and Arwen. Another thing I *really* liked about the movie was the music. I especially like the ending title, 'May It Be' sung by Enya."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best they could have done!","review":"Well, here it is, the marvelous book series is being made into movies. A message to Bill Grant, the reviewer from England: Bill, Bill, Bill. There is no way the worthy director, Peter Jackson, could possibly have crammed all the material and events down to the last detail into one movie. The only changes in the storyline were made to shorten the movie, and even then it is quite long enough at about 3 hours. Why, the only important change was that they left Tom Bombadil and Goldberry out of the script. Other than that, what a marvelous job! One of the best movies I've ever seen. Nothing could possibly surpass that book, but nothing could surpass this movie either. A true work of art, made with tons of effort and research. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very long but very worth it","review":"I won't lie... Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring is almost 3 hours long. But the detail to the story is well received in each minute. Almost every detail that is in the book is in the movie. It's not all jumbled together like a lot of the times when a book becomes a movie.Everything about Lord of the Rings is AWESOME! The story, the sets and costumes, the action scense and of course the visuals (a lot of Special Effects eye candy in this one). Also, the dialogue and acting is very good. No one in this one is stiff as a board like some movies. All of the actors and actresses become their characters, it's very cool.Now again, it might bother some people that this is almost 3 hours long. I can assure you that it won't be a wasted 3 hours. Plus there are a lot of extra features on the DVD set that are also pretty cool to watch. Check out Lord of the Rings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible .....unless its extented.","review":"I would have given it 1 star but i liked the extented.

The disc played fine when I watched-- no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Saga","review":"Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's epic trilogy \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" could very well be the greatest film saga of our time. All three films are very well-written, produced and directed. The scenery of the locations and sets is nothing short of breathtaking. The cast members all turn in some outstanding performances, especially Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Elijah Wood, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee, to name a few. Jackson matches, and then surpasses, George Lucas' ability to tell an epic tale of good versus evil. Earlier this year, The Return of the King joined The Godfather, Part II as the only sequels to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR - Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition","review":"I am a LOTR nerd and wanted the theatrical release.

More LOTR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking??","review":"Ok I love this movie & I really liked the new added scenes. So why did I only do 2 stars? Because I think it's ridiculous that they split the movie up over 2 DVD's. Most of the time the \\"special features\\" are on the second DVD. This time they put \\"special features\\" on the first two, & then split up the movie between the first two as well. I do not want to have to change DVD's half way through everytime I watch this. It breaks up the continuity of the movie. I don't know what they were thinking, but this was a really dumb idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fantasy World Gone Bad","review":"The Lord of the Rings, to begin,disapointed me very much. Now this could be because i saw it on video and not in theaters, because the theater makes it more enjoyable. For some reason, you cannot get into the action of the movie. It moves WAY to slowly and just dragssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss on & on & on................. You know what I mean (It gets old)The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the bonus disc. That is probably better than the movie itself. Without the bonus disc (on VHS), this movie would get 1/8 th of a star from me. The Two Towers looks much more active and just downright \\"cool\\", but I thought the same thing before I saw the first. The only reason I would recommend seing this is to compare it to the book. Its interesting to see what was left out and what changed and so on and so forth. But besides that, spend half the money and get the book. I will continue to to see the next 2 movies, hoping each one will get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why has society been brainwashed??","review":"Why in the world this film is SOOOOO revered is well beyond my capacity. Too Long. Too much bad CG. Too much running from annoying non-plot driving \\"threats\\". Villians that ain't scary and a slow motion death scene the like of which havent been seen since B rated schlock. You people can have have your sad devotion to a trilogy of films that have more flaws than 10 Star Wars prequels. It is a sad day for cinema...I am only staying anonymous to avoid a hundred thousand virgins emailing hate towards me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to see it again","review":"I first read the trilogy when I was 11 years old and again at about 15. Now I am 18 and am re-reading them. I love these books and wanted the movie to impress me. I was not disappointed. I saw it 2 days after it came out and immediately wanted to see it again, the next day I went, and wanted to see it again. Last night, I was satisfied once more, but still want to see it again. Maybe this sounds fanatical, but I know that I am not alone. I went with some friends that saw it for the first time last night and the first thing that they said was, \\"it was amazing, lets go again!\\" I, like everyone else am anxious for the next one to be released, I wish I did not have to wait a year. I think that they did justice to the characters such as the hobbits and the elves, they were as described in the book.

You all know what I'm talking about and I'd like to see a little variation.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I Expected","review":"I have read the trilogy 14 times since the 70's,and was hugly disappointed by the animated version of the books in '78. I have anxiously looked forward to the live action film and I was NOT dissapointed! Considering the the enormous complexity of the material, I thought it was very well done.Well casted and incredably acted! Yes there were large amounts of material left out, but come on the movie would have been 6 hours long if they included everything,I thought they compressed the story well without sacrificing the major story line.A must have when it comes out on DVD, and I'm re-reading it for the 15th time! Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I came into this hating LOTR type movies ( i could never understand how a person could keep so many different names,places, and the plot of the story without going mental).But after I got out of the theater, i really just wanted to go home and finish the next two parts.

I just recently finished reading the 1st book ok the LOTR trilogy and I couldn't wait to see the movie. Of course they cut a few scenes out and changed stuff a little, but overall they kept very well to the storyline and the CG effects were incredible.

While there are plenty of actions scenes and SFX to go around, the real triumph of this movie is that it ultimately tells a very powerful, emotional story. It never lets you forget the heart of the story by trying to cover it with gimmicks. The acting, top to bottom, is as good as there has ever been. All the fantasic visuals and imaginitive scenes promote the story and it all is Tolkien, pure, to the very core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying, but see original version as well.","review":"I bought this DVD at a store and I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. However, this extended version of the film differs greatly from the theatrical version. It's still the same movie, but added scenes and even changes in line delivery make it seem completely different. If anyone here has not seen the film yet, I advise you see the theatrical version first before checking this one out. It will help you to apprecriate the movie even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Load of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Maybe I just didn't know what to expect. I've never read any of Tolkien's work. I expected action and adventure. There was action and there was adventure, but in addition, there was an excruciatingly long and boring saga about little creatures with big hairy feet. I never developed any feeling for the characters nor did I feel any sympathy for their plight. I can't even remember their names. I was underwhelmed by the ending if you can call it that and saddened there is to be an obvious sequel. [...].Should have gone to see Snow Dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to those who gave it 4.5 Stars.","review":"I saw this movie at a press screening, and I must say, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Those who give it any less than 5 stars are just petty and picky. They try too hard to compare a movie, one that was interpreted through the eyes of another, to their own imagination. They need to let that go, and just enjoy the movie as just another way to tell the same story.The movie is absolutely SPECTACULAR! I have never seen such ambition and flawless story telling and directing. The acting and casting is perfect by any standard, and the battles are truly something to behold. The costumes and props are unparalleled, and the secenery is enough of a reason to book a ticket to New Zealand (where it was filmed). (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just way too long","review":"One of the documentaries on the DVD pretty much says it all. They spent over a year in pre-production blowing glass, carving trinkets, and weathering the hobbit village. After all that work, Jackson HAD to get it up on the screen. The result is a movie that makes Attack of the Clones seem taut. There are way too many scenes that are extended just so you can see all the craft work.And this is little more than a movie about midgets being chased by special effects for two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the rings","review":"I loved this movie!! I grew up on these books by J.R.R. Tolkin. I though the director Peter Jackson did a great job keeping the movie as close to the book as possible. He even ended the movie at the same point that the book ends. I have never been to a movie that was so close to the book. This movie was the nearest I have ever seen. I recomenned reading the books and then going to see the movie you will be impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I hoped","review":"I've read The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and the Simarillion. I've been amazed at the level of detail that Tolkien weaves into his stories, and I'm drawn back to them again and again.While I love the books and would thoroughly enjoy a full visual version of them, I realize that this is impossible. Even Tolkien leaves a good deal of information out of the Lord of the Rings (partially provided in Tolkien's other works). Given the medium that's being worked with and the time alotted, I think that this movie did a great job of presenting the storyline, portraying the intensity of the quest, and, in general, sucking you into the adventure.Being a fan of the books, I'm puzzled by some of the omissions and some of the changes in the flow of the story, but I think that the movie, as a separate work is still very good.My suggestion would be to read the books and see the movies. You'll most likely enjoy them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible","review":"This is the Greatest DVD I've bought. The documentary on the making of the film is so thorough, that I felt like I was there during the entire pre-production and filming of the movie. I recommend this to true fans of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Shafting of Loyal Fans","review":"Let the movie companies know you are sick of this scam of continually releasing multiple editions. The best way is to hit them where it hurts... bottom line, dollar sign. Do not buy from these companies who continually re-release. Support and purchase from companies like Critereon, who always issue, as far as I know, definitive versions of a flick on DVD. This is shameless baloney, and greedy corporate crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the extended version coming out in November","review":"A huge fan of the books, I really enjoyed this DVD, until....I played one of the features on the bonus CD, to see that there is another version coming out in November - with an additional 30 minutes footage directly in the movie. They gave a few sneak peaks of that footage, and it adds a lot more richness to the characters and the plot.As a result, I was hugely disappointed that I had purchased a DVD that I will want to throw away in 3 months - actually, I felt conned. Not to take away from what is a spectacular movie - but I don't agree with an approach of releasing 2 versions within 3 months of each other and both prior to the 2nd movie coming out. I NEVER would have purchased this movie if I had known about the extended edition first.If you REALLY have to see this moive NOW, then by all means get it. If not, I would advise you to maybe rent it and wait for the extended edition to purchase a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have this dvd..BUY IT NOW!","review":"Simply put the best dvd ever! The movie is phenomenal and they stay very true to the book (although there are some slight revisions...i.e. Arwen's bigger role in the movie & the wizard's fight). I have the original version that came out in August last year and then got the extended one for x-mas and w/o a doubt the extended one is better. Scenes like the gift giving in Lothlorien have been included (since the gifts given play a role in the next two films) and so much documentary and behinds the scenes footage on the other two discs. Spectacular movie and a definite must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best fantasy series of the 21st century!","review":"Before seeing The Fellowship of the Ring I had never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, just The Hobbit as a small child. As a huge science fiction/fantasy fan I was greatly looking forward to this, and it did not disappoint. Where George Luca's Star Wars \\"prequel\\" trilogy feels empty and convoluted, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings feels realistic and invigorating. What a breath of fresh air, and it's 10,000 times better than The Phantom Menace was! Winner of Four Academy Awards this classic belongs in every film lover's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowship Extended","review":"My product came in sooner than expected which was wonderful.

Tolkien fan since I was 10 years old, and I can't give this rendition of LoTR more praise. It's true to the story (though missing a few not-so-essential chapters) and lets us experience it in a way the books never could. The extras... well, hope you weren't planning on knowing \\"how they did it,\\" because you won't get it here. Be prepared for disjointed previews of the movie you already own and continuous commercials for all of the other LoTR merchandise available. There's an awesome preview of \\"The Two Towers\\" that has me anxiously waiting for more, though, as well as a preview of the Extended Edition due out in November 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"This movie wasn't that great! It was way too long... I almost fell asleep at parts. The acting wasn't the greatest but wasn't bad! The Special Effects were pretty good, but that's not what makes a movie! I give a star for some fine performances, strong plot, and nice settings. But lose stars for mumbling at points, and overlength movie. 3 movies 3 hours long, for each, that is fregon long! I had a hard time sitting through one, imagine 3, good god! Too long for me! Maybe if you got nothing better to do for 3 hours at night, you could watch this. But if you don't, which most people don't, don't watch this! Plus, if you don't like fantasy, it's nothing special, save your money! Rent it, sure, but don't buy it! It's not bad but way over rated! Maybe when I was 10, I would have liked this, but I'm not! So, do yourself a favour and save 3 hours! It should be possible that one person wouldn't care too much about this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The fellowship of the ring was far better than I expected!! I loved the action scenes and was greatly suprised at how actually creepy the nazgul(ringwraiths or dark riders)were! New Zealand was the best place to shoot the scenes. My favorite characters were Aragorn, legolas, frodo and the other hobbits and the ringwraiths. I think that Elijah Wood matched frodo perfectly and that if they chose any other person to play frodo it wouldn't match. All the cast played and looked quite similar to what I imagined them looking and acted like when I read the lord of the rings books. I can't wait till the two towers and the return of the king come out in theaters and I'm going to see them the same amount of times that I saw the fellowship of the ring (8 times) or more!!!! I loved every scene in this movie and loved the beautiful backround scenes"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Right, Call Me A Geek","review":"Still speechless, I've seen THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING four times now. The film is cinemagic. Its scope is epic. Its delivery is perfect. The acting is unforgettable, and the story is timeless. Director Peter Jackson has created a singular masterpiece that, like CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA, and STAR WARS, will inspire hundreds -- if not thousands -- of creative minds to pursue interests in film and writing. His adaptation of the book (note: not a literal translation like the boorish HARRY POTTER film) almost cries out for academic study.Of particular note, Viggo Mortenson (sp?) is superb as Aragorn/Stryder.Of surprising pleasure, Elijah Wood brings a subtle intelligence to the role of Frodo Baggins, the hapless Hobbit who inherits the task of bearing the ring to the dark lands of Mordor.Of unyielding praise, Ian McKellan deserves an Oscar for his performance as Gandalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book to movie done right!","review":"Tolkien would be very pleased were he around to see his masterpiece come to life on the big screen. I don't know who the director, Peter Jackson, is but he has done an incredible job of capturing the look and feel of the book. So much attention to detail from lighting to special effects to sound and music. The action sequences are refreshingly original and well interspersed throughout the movie. Casting was surprisingly well done. There was not one person that did not fit their role. This is a book to movie done right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"Simply put, this movie is one of the most incredible movies I have *ever* seen, bar none. Throughout the movie, my hands were sweaty with suspense. When I wasn't sweating, I was covered with goosebumps induced by the sheer spectacle of the movie. It WAY exceeded my expectations. In fact, I wanted to stay in my seat to sit through the next showing. It's that good!The creatures are realistic enough to cause nightmares and the characters are totally believable. The only critique I have is that 365 days is too darn long to wait to see the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, Peter, you've done it again.","review":"I saw all LOTR movies in the theater on their opening days. I loved them all! Then bought all the theatrical versions on DVD. THen, after that, I bought all extended versions on the days they came out. I OWN TWO SETS. I WILL NOT OWN A THIRD ONE. Better if you buy the extended versions seperate.Theatrical Version:4/5.Extended version: 5/5.Ripping people off with another box set: 0/5.Think before you rip-off, Peter Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Problems","review":"Excellent movie, but this DVD did not work on my Philips DVD player correctly. The movie freezes up about half way through... This does not happen on all DVD players though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype","review":"I went to this movie expecting \\"the best movie of the year\\" but I unfortunately got \\"The most hyped movie of the year\\". Sure there were some dead guys chasing the Hobbit trying to steal a ring (sounds real exciting doesnt it), but I think I laughed at parts not intended for laughing... The movie is 3 hours long on top of that, at the end of the film I proclaimed that I would very much want to be thrown into that volcano with that stupid ring than sit through the other 2 sequels. So save yourself the cash and the rear sore from sitting so long, and buy yourself the book instead. Unless that isnt worth reading, I wouldnt know because I never read it, I wasted enough of my time watching the movie. That is why this movie gets 2 stars, for my 2 chuckles I had during the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac DVD watchers beware","review":"This is not a critique of the film, but of the discs themselves. Disc 2 of the feature does not and will not play on a Macintosh in DVD Player, so if that's how you were hoping to watch it, don't bother. It stops roughly halfway through disc 2 and nothing after that will play. I have tried on 2 copies now and the same happened to a friend whose discs were from a different source."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the fine print","review":"Although I have yet to receive mine (pre-ordered), I will be returning them...I assumed that one disc would have the theatrical release and the other the extended edition.The only reason I wanted them was to save the trouble of switching the discs...So I will be sending mine back for a refund.I should have read the specs before buying, so it is my fault.

I love all of the books than have been made by J.R.R. Tolkien. He is such a good writer. I want you guys to do me a big,big,big favor.

I really wanted to like the movie - went into the theater trying to like it - but I didn't have any emotional ties with the characters at all, and after a while, I frankly stopped caring what happened to them. I don't know why I didn't like it. By all appearances I really should have, but I felt, at the end, that I had seen a movie where nothing happened. No resolution was reached by the characters, there weren't many shifts in the characters' relationships - there weren't any secrets, no real twists - everything was just out there on the table. No suspense at all; they seemed to just be walking around Middle Earth for three hours. I guess you have to have read the books, but I'm really wondering what all the fuss is about"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Jackson must hang out with a man named Oscar","review":"This movie was a really good eye opener to what good movies should really be like. Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellen all did their part into bringing this brilliant story to life; along with the rest of the cast and crew. This movie had everthing from violence to comedy. The movie had a good plot( duh it from the book), great setting, and was well acted. Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece, and the sequel and prequel will no doubt be just as good, or better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Movie!","review":"Of all the movies I've seen, this movie tops them all...probably because it is such a great adventure filled with danger and times where even in the darkest hours, light flickers still. The evil is gruesome, but clearly evil and the good side is clearly the good side. The characters from the book come alive on the screen and the story is played really close to the books...with a few minor details. Sacrifice, bravery, and showing the smallest thing can make the biggest changes...you won't even know three hours have gone! A perfectly stunning movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS","review":"- This most be one of the best movies i've ever seen. But, Peter Jackson's (BRAINDEAD & BAD TASTE) first huuuge project was not perfect. Sure, he mastered to transfer Tolkien's world and charachters from the book to the big screen, but i just couldnt give the movie 5 stars due to editing, cutting and background errors (you could actually see one of the crews jeeps in the background in one of the scenes). But, beside this: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the best fantasy/adventure film i've ever seen.

Disappointing.","review":"The movie is a masterpiece, and the extra scenes greatly enhance the movie, but the fact that it is cut in half annoys me to no end. It would have been a simple matter to keep the movie as a whole. It would have easily fit onto one dvd. Hopefully they will put out another version that has the extra scenes without splitting the movie in half."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the books don't waste your time with the movie","review":"Once agin the old addage \\"The book is always better than the movie.\\" is proved here. Very little was as it should be. I could not watch this movie a second time. Peter should be ashamed at what he did to Mr Tolkien's wonderful story. I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I saw this movie. Jackson seemed more interested in highlighting his special effects abillities than telling the story as it should be told. I will live in Middle Earth in my imagination thanks to Mr Tolkien not jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings wonderful but long!","review":"I went to see this when it was at our Drive In in carlsbad, NM. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Really my only complaint about this movie is the fact that at the end the movie just like stops! And you want it to just continue finish the story. It really leaves you hanging. So after the movie I went home and turned to the last page of the book \\"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and it ended exactly the same way.

The cinematography and film score are some of the finest ever done. The acting and the special effects are amazing. Neither detract from the other. While I am not a huge fan of anything cute and cuddly (read:hobbits), these story elements are not overly done to make them too annoying. The action is very well done, some of the best in any fantasy movie. The D&D geek in me, marvelled at the swordplay and archery in the fight sequences. The ending does feel very abrupt, but that is to be expected of the first part of a planned movie Trilogy. I cannot wait for the Two Towers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!

I can't even begin to say how much we liked it. It is long - but it doesn't seem so. The 3+ hrs flew by and we were disappointed when it was over. We wanted to see more....and a lot more there is in this version. Maybe almost too much. It's a bit overwhelming. Looking forward to the 'Two Towers' coming out later this year - and the final movie at the theatres shortly thereafter.note: i have friends of friends who got this for their kids (who are both under 6yo).

The Amazon editorials for the 2010 release of the Two Towers and Return of the King clearly state that the film is on a two-sided bluray which contains both the theatrical and extended editions. The Amazon review for the Fellowship of the Ring is a little less clear: \\"Extremely useful are the chapter menus that indicate which scenes are new or extended.\\" This would seem to indicate that the extended edition is included, but that is not the case. All of the LOTR movies are excellent, but the editorials need to be updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review: I love, love the extended edition!!!","review":"I love being able to stream this movie anytime I want.

If you must buy the Lord of the Rings, well at least you're looking at the Special collectors edition (Hence 1 Star rater than 0). It seams that film makers have decided that the only thing you need nowadays is an epic scale, special effects and John Williams-esque sound track. Personally I'm sticking with J.K. Rowling, at least Tolkien wasn't arround to witness the Bastardization of one of the Litery greats of all time. I judge a good film by whether you notice the time going in, unfortunately both I and my [...] where painfully aware of the time passing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"So glad I finally decided to buy this movie!!

It picked itself up about half or 2/3 of the movie through... and just as the charicters started to develop, it ended. I was hoping for some sort of conclusion to the movie but it was (as I expected) a cut short cliche, to make you come back next year.People are blowing this movie way out of porportion...its good...but its not the best.

First a Keep Case DVD. Then a 4-disk edition. Then a Collectors Box Set. And you know when this is all done, the will be a several-disc set with all of the movies in one convenient package!Call me old fashioned, but all I really care about is a high-quality transfer (both video and audio) and maybe a directors commentary. Do we really need to see every last bit of discarded footage? Hey... that footage was discarded for a reason - it was unneccesary! Don't try to convince me that there are tidbits about the story that I can only capture by buying the extra 3 discs worth of make-up application, area footage, and interviews with Elijah Wood. Thanks, but I'd rather re-read the books than pay for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, What a great movie!","review":"I can excuse the few deviations from the book because this movie was so strong. It spent a healthy amount of time building the characters which will be needed in future allotments. This movie had great acting and perspective. How hard is it to imagine a halfling, but seeing one is impressive. I would recommend this movie for all adults. I believe it would be hard for younger children to sit through. I hope this movie inspires people to read the books. I'm certainly going to re-re-re-read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"These movies are great but ...","review":"Yes, the cinematic benchmark for the 21st century. Both versions on one disc, very good idea? Well, only if you don't have them already. If you don't, this is for you and you can stop reading.Fans however, already own all the versions of these movies. The new documentary, no matter how excellent, raw and real it may be, will get one viewing; better for renting. The only reasons for buying this are if you plan to view the documentaries more than once or if you are an obsessive collector of all things related to these movies.Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan; I preordered every DVD on the first day I could. I don't doubt that next year they will release an HD-DVD or Blu-Ray version (possibly both) that will be entirely worth having.

Save your money for the impending Special Deluxe Extended Edition (208 MIn)","review":"The skinny is this should be subtitled as \\"Theatrical Edition\\" (178 Min), but it's not. Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (208 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would there be a release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true. LOTR Fan consumers beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!

It was awesome, breathtaking. One long rush, from beginning to end. The only \\"problem\\" is that some of the peaceful middlesekvenses (e. g. the first meeting with the elves, Tom Bombardilare) are left out. Some spoken lines differ a lot from Tolkien (Let's hunt some orcs!!!), but that maches the movie. If a person is biblic about the book, the film migth be to \\"fresh\\" and a large disappiontment.

The characters of Aragorn, Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Gimli, Legolas, Elrond, Arwen, and pretty much every other character. The places such as Hobbiton, Rivendell, Lothlorien, Bree, Moria, Isengard, etc. Are literally amazing creations.

The acting is, without question, outstanding. Elijah Wood as Frodo stands in stark contrast to Woods' previous efforts, playing the unlikely hero with the odds stacked intimidatingly against him. The villains, truly ominous characters on a level that I'm not certain has ever been captured on the big screen.The cinematography is breathtaking and delivers you to a time and place where fantasy and reality melt into one and manages to hold rapture all who behold it's splendor. The directorial effort put fourth for this film is indeed unparalelled in cinema history. Impeccable timing, absolutely thorough plot review and eminating the kind of awe and charm that makes fantasy every bit worth the experience.And that, my friends, was simply the theatrical trailer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised to see so many other high reviews","review":"I was shocked to see so many high reviews about this film. For a film it's good, but for a screen adaptation of a book, it fell utterly short. If I had never read the books, I would have thought it just another Dungeons and Dragons film.My only advice to people is this: if you've read the books, don't see the movie. If you've only seen the movie, don't read the books. Peter Jackson missed the point of the books. Why else would he have made so many changes to the plots. He changed the character's personalities, motives, actions, etc.... I dare not list all my complaints here, save I may offend some people who enjoyed or may enjoy the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies in these times","review":"It's really amazing how it was done, and the results are incredible. The actors are excellent, and Elijah Wood is wonderful for the lead. Of course, the story is good, that's why Tolkien is one of the best writers in history.The movie lasts three hours but it's worth it. It is about the Hobbits, a group of small people. One of them is Bilbo Baggins, and he's weird. But the weirdest thing is that he's the owner of a very powerful ring, because of all the trips he has done. But the trouble starts when he gives it to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, to destroy it for good.Wonderful movie. It's really enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"What they DIDN'T put in","review":"The production of the first of the trilogy is a beautiful piece of work, and I admire the producers for having the courage to film all three parts so that the story is delivered over a short time (unlike George Lucas, whose promises will never be kept--a great loss to all the fans of the original series who waited so long and got so little).A serious flaw in the production is the ignoring of the material in The Hobbit that explains so much. We have already had a peek at the Golum, whose \\"precious\\" is a critical element. I hope that before getting to deeply into this film--great as it is, that the really interested viewer will take the time to find out what Bilbo did, and how his adventure is a vital part of a real understanding what is happening. I don't know if the TV version of the Hobbit is available, but it is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best just got better!","review":"The Extended Edition is a must for anyone who loved the books and the theatrical release.Every character benefitted from additional dialog and scenes. Much of the additional material consists of a sentence here or an extra camera angle there. These little bits really flesh out the characters. The character that benefitted most from the recutting of the film was Celeborn. He got one line in the theatrical release. In the EE he is a completely fleshed out character. Now I can appreciate Martin Csokas' portrayal!I sorely missed the Galadriel gift-giving scene in the theatrical release. I was so happy to see it in the EE. Jackson's interpretation is brilliant and moving!I have yet to dive into the extra features. From what others have said, I know I will be busy for a lOOoog time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I saw the movie and was amazed. Then I bought this DVD and it got better.

I wouldn't necessarily say that the extended scenes make the film better, but they do add information to the story line which might make it easier for people to understand the movie. A nice added bonus to this movie is two DVD discs which show the behind the scenes for this movie. It was very entertaining to see how this movie was adapted from the novel and how the created all of the visual effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"This movie is just plain magnificent, without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. Anyone who doesn't like this movie is just plain dumb and can't see greatness when it's staring them right in front of their face. I have never read the books all the way through because frankly they bored the heck out of me, but this movie is so much better it's unbelievable. My advice for anyone and everyone is to forget about the books and watch the film instead. You will get so much more out of it this way.

I was impressed, to say the least. The cinematography is beautiful and amazingly lush, and the acting is overall excellent. Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Ian Holm as Bilbo in particular were fantastic. The movie was very faithful to the book, keeping Tolkien's original spirit and room for imagination intact. A very worthwhile experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"It's truly amazing, the new version of the film. In the booklet there is a list of chapters,and it's ful of new scenes and extended dialogue and action.Whereas the theatrical version kept most material that dealt with Frodo, the extended version gives a cleare, better, funnier, more touching view of the rest of the cast.For example, Celeborn maybe had one or two lines in the theatrical version, but had his own scene and a dozen more lines in thisnew version. Galadriel gives gifts to the rest of the fellowship, Aragorn sings a love ballad to Arwen, and Sauron's voice echoes in Rivendell at the Council of Elrond, to name a few.I fell in love with this movie the second the prologue began in the theatre when i first saw it, but this new edition proves any (small and meager) objections false.Truly, The Fellowship of the Fing: Special Extended edition is even better and even more undoubtedly the best movie in existence....That is, until the next two movies come out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a very good set.

There is also a National Geographic disc that talks alot about JRR Tolkien and the books that are the basis of the movie. Also included in the set is two statue bookends. I would recommend this set for big LOTR fans. The 4 disc set and the National Geographic CD add up to about the cost of the whole set."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Tom Bombadil, but still an excellent movie","review":"The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (FOTR) is like Ivory Soap: it's 99.44% pure. That is, it is 99.44% faithful to Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring. This is highly desirable, because Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest English language twentieth century fantasy novel. This movie has outstanding acting. The performances given by Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) and Sean Bean (Boromir) near the end of FOTR were particularly effective. The scenery and special effects were exceptional. New Zealand was the perfect location for shooting this movie. The integration of live and CGI action images was executed perfectly and seamlessly. Peter Jackson did an extraordinary job directing this movie. As usual, the book is better than the movie, but FOTR is still well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"I smiled the entire length of the film","review":"The film was wonderful. I loved every minute. It was incredible seeing the book which means so much to me come to life before my eyes. I feel Peter Jackson did a wonderful job at capturing the spirit of the greatest epic ever written. Although I missed some of Tolkien's unmatched dialouge, the film honored the integrity of the book. Aside from everything, the unbelievable beauty of the film was incredible. Simply outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"At first I wasn't sure what to expect,but by the time I reached the point where Gandalf and Frodo greeted each other with a hug.It had me hook,line,and sinker.I was extremely curious about everything,it was thought provoking.It had me on the edge of my seat waiting for what was going to happen next.The bad thing was that it repeated things a little too often.Besides that it was awesome.I can't wait to see the rest of them.Thank you for taking time out to read this.If you haven't seen it,GO see it.No matter what reviews you may have read before.The effects will amaze you,and the fighting scenes will too.The rest is wonderful too.Those are the things I like most about the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD at its finest!","review":"Very simply, this is the most outstanding DVD I have ever seen. None of the quality of the movie has been lost, but actually enhanced for the smaller screen. The second DVD w/ several of the TV programs that chronicled the making of the movie are good-particularly the one done by the SciFi channel. I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL THE COLLECTORS EDITION COMES OUT IN NOV!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one ring to rule them all","review":"the lord of the rings is one of the best science fiction/fantasy movies made since star wars. the lord of the rings is an awesome movie trillogy. i love this movie. i recommend it to everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"It follows the book!!!","review":"GREAT ACTION! AND FOLLOWS THE BOOK1!! Still, it has some added things in it. The Orcs are not frightening at all, and every supposed-to-be scary scene is not that scary, I DID jump at the scene when a cave troll appeared around a corner and roared loud but that is pretty much. This movie reminds me of Narnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"*MASTERPIECE*","review":"This film has to be one of the best things to ever hit the silver screen since it's inception... Quite frankly anyone who does not like this movie and/or cannot appreciate it's perfection has the intelligence of a flea. The score is mesmerizing and beautiful to behold! The acting IS superb! The cinematography is breathtaking! And the story is classic! Peter Jackson's intelligent direction puts this movie in a class better than Star Wars in my humble opinion. The passion this man has for the movies is evident in viewing it. I have read the books 6 times and I feel it conveys the overall tone and feel of the books with perfection even though it may change some necessary things..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Box Office","review":"Considered by many to be one of the greatest visual epics of our time, The Lord of the Rings is one of my all-time favorite movies. All of the performances stand out, especially Ian Mckellan as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn; both of these actors throw themselves into their roles. The movie also adds parts that would have been helpful to read in the book, for instance, the fight between Gandalf and Saruman. The Lord of the Rings delivers excellent battle sequences, such as Aragorn vs. the Black Riders and when the fellowship takes on 50 orcs in the mines of Moria. This movie also features cinematography of New Zealand mountains, rivers, waterfalls, and forests that blows all other movies away. See this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"this movie is cool. it is filled with intensifying action and excitement. it will keep you glued to your television. you'll want to see it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go see the Lord of the Rings!!!","review":"I have seen this video twice. It is the best video in the world.I highly recommend to go see this video. It is full of action and suspense. The characters are really great. This video will really keep you on your toes. I rate this video the ruler of them all! And I give it 5 whole stars and more! [....]"},{"rating":"2","title":"even better the 2nd time","review":"it was weird for me when I first walked out of the theatre I was a little disapointed thought I liked it then I went over the movie again in my mind and liked it even more the more I thought about it the more I liked it then I was it a 2nd time and loved it I enjoyed evrey scene.They may have changed key scenes but their wasn't much they could have done it was 3 hours long already so they don't need to leangthen it! I found the movie much funnier than the book to (though I'm not done the book) especially merry and pipen! I'm very glad they didn't include the singing the books had and they shortened the council of elrond though they included many of the stories told there before it happened. The only thing I wish they did diffrent would be to make the ringwraith chase scene more accurate"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I was amazed. I went home right away and started reading the books again. I have been waiting for this movie to come out ever since the fourth grade when I first read the trilogy. I thought how are they going to make it look real. I mean the height differences, but you did it. The characters you picked for each part was perfection. Let me tell you Legolas Greenleaf, (Orlando Bloom) what a perfect choice. He gets his own WOW! The entire cast and the directing staff all deserve a standing \\"O\\". I have seen it two times so far and I can't wait to see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I add but wow!!","review":"Yes - this DVD is as good as everyone says. For the first time ever the extra material is as good as the film, and I have watched it all from start to finish a bunch of times. The movie is more evenly paced, with crucial scenes added in. Love it, love it, love it, and I can't wait for the next one...go PJ and NZ!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I can only say say one word about this movie...breathtaking. This was one of the best movies i have saw all year. I loved every minute of it, although it was long. The scenery was beautiful and the costumes amazing. The ringwraiths costumes were outstanding. It's amazing just to watch them move as they ride. This was a great story. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job. I'll be waiting in anticipation for next year when the next installment of the Lord Of the Rings trilogy is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"They took a great movie and made it even greater","review":"You now doubt have seen the original theatrical version of the Fellowship of the Ring (if not, what the hell are you waiting for? Go now!), and chances are you were pretty amazed by it. This extended edition adds more detail, explains more, and just has some nice little additional scenes that add to the experience. The movie alone is worth the extra money for this version, and that's not even including the extras, which give incredible insight into the creation of this wonderous film. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the LOTR and loves DVD jam-packed with goodies. If there were a score higher than 5 stars, this DVD would get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it were TV formatted","review":"I like the behind-the-scenes part where Ejijah Wood swears like a truck driver - I count the F-word at least 5 times. An actor is nothing like the character he plays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TO TO GOOD","review":"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE THAT I HAVE SEEN.BEST PARTTHE FORMING OF THE FELLOSHIPWORST PARTTHER I'SNT ANY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not extended release!","review":"Why can't the Company release the Extended (and much better) versions of these films on Blu Ray?? What is the hold up? I will not buy another version of these films. Period.Stop wasting my time and release the ones that the rest of the public want."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever","review":"I think this is one of the best movies ever. It's definitely my favorite of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This DVD limited edition is amazing. There are tons of great extras. I usually never watch the extras on movies b/c I usually just don't care. This is a different story. The effort that went into making this masterpiece is mind blowing. There are extensive interviews with the director about the location selection, and cast selection. It's awesome to watch the making of this colossal movie. If ou are going to buy this movie, the limited edition is probably the best way to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"LOTR is one of my favorite movies ever. I bought the whole trilogy as a set but The Fellowship was scratched and froze so I bought this to replace the first set of disks and I couldn't be happier. So glad I can watch it again. I enjoyed this extended version :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 30 minutes of extra footage!!","review":"While the extended edition is great, don't expect a total of 30 minutes of new footage. What the idiots don't tell you is that 20 minutes of that is nothing more than a listing of the fan club members in the credits. Like who in the heck cares! I was expecting a LOT more footage. The extra footage was great, but nowhere near what I expected. I hope these liars do better on the next extended edition!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Actually, I do not contain the words to describe how amazing the Lord Of The Rings is! Most people have probably seen it and few can say that it is no good. If you haven't seen it, it's time you do! It creates life into the books of Tolkien. I never thought it to be THIS good! While standing in the que when it opened in December 2001 I was sure that the filmmakers would ruin the books with this film, on the contruary, they did an almost perfect job, just see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Phenomenal movie. I'm probably the best & worst person to give an opinion, since I've read the triology [of which this is the first part] 5 or more times. I'm biased, yet I expected a lot. This movie delivered! The scenes in the movie made me feel exactly like I did when I read the book. Though the characters were not exactly as I pictured them, they were very close. The setting: incredible! The scenes seemed to be pulled right out of my imagination. Even for those that didn't read the novel, this movie is a mastery of fantasy & special effects. If possible, read the book: either before [suggested] or after seeing the movie. But see this movie. Peter Jacob did an amazing job translating an epic book into an epic movie. Tolkien would have been proud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the rings The fellowship of the ring","review":"I have seen many films over the years, but this film is a pleasure to watch, and the acting is first class.It may take nearly 3 hrs to watch but you are glued to the screen for the entire film. I was not a fan of Tolkens work so when I went a saw the film I was not sure what to expect, in the end there is only one word to discribed this film. Amazing.I will look forward to buying the DVD and watch this many times over.I am counting the days till the second film is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, holding close to the original storyline","review":"A gem for the millions of Tolkien fans world-wide, I highly doubt that any fan of Middle Earth could be disappointed with this film.I thought this movie was fantastic. The visual and audio effects were terrific, and I have to say that the casting was extraordinary. I thought they found the exact people to fit every role, from Gandalf the Grey to an elf extra, they all fit the book's description perfectly, giving you the appearance that you imagined when you first read the book.I also must say it is commendable that the movie held so true to the original storyline, with only minor changes mainly because of time restraints (although the entire film does end up being very close to the 3-hour mark) and to add some of the usual Hollywood-style action and suspense for the audience.Overall, this is the best movie I have seen at the theatre in a long time, and I can't wait for the home video release. I would definitely recommend it to any Tolkien fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Bores","review":"This movie stunk! I even fell asleep during it. All they do is walk fight walk fight walk pre-pare to fight enemy runs away ends in a stupid way. What a boring day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled 'Bored of the Rings'","review":"I have read a lot of the reviews written here and must believe that all the people who wrote favorable reviews have not read J.R.R. Tolkien's books.The movie was extremely boring. What else can you say?If you havent read the trilogy plus 'The Hobbit' I suggest you take your money and buy the books and forget about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored of the Rings","review":"Three hours! Zero character development and even less development of the relationships between the characters. Extremely elaborate setup for something (I guess this is the mystery), 2 1/2 hours of which (at least) was dedicated to the seemingly same dark battles with underexplained evildoers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Must Have","review":"There is no point renting this set from a video store. There is simply too much information in it and you only scratch the surface by watching the DVDs.The third and fourth discs have a such a wealth of information on how the movie was made and how Middle Earth was brought to life that you will want to dedicate a lot of time to watching.Peter Jackson and his team clearly do this as a labor of love and I cannot stress what a valuable asset this is to your DVD collection.I purchased this after buying the original DVD and I am very glad that I have both. The original DVD is simply the cinema version of the movie. This set contains all the extra stuff and the extra 30 minutes of movie that is added fill in many of the gaps that the books refer to.Definite MUST BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"Peter Jackson does a wonderful job recreating Tolkein's book. The behind the scenes footage is actually interesting to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU HAVE INSOMNIA THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU","review":"Most boring movie I've ever laid eyes on. I can't imagine what the extended version is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good visuals, but misses the mark","review":"Peter Jackson has directed a visually stunning, but empty movie. The scenery and costumes are worthy of the book, but the script is lame and the characters have no depth. Choppy editing takes viewers on a roller coaster ride, hurrying from action scene to action scene, depriving audiences of the opportunity to gradually immerse themselves into what should have been a rich fantasy.The actors are competent but seem shallow, disposable, not unlike what has happened in recent Star Wars films. The lone exception being Sir Ian McKellen, who imbues the Gandalf character with lived-in warmth and wit.All in all, this film is a must-see for Tolkien fans, since the story is brought to life here with lavish attention to detail. However, it is a triumph of form over substance. Let's hope that the sequels offer better character development, stronger scripts, and less frantic editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"Although the DVD hold the interst somewhat better than the book, The Lord of the Rings remains incredibly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerks","review":"I recently purchased a shiny new copy of the Extended edition and it will not play on my computer. The computer doesn;t even recognize the disc (runs XP). My 98 machine saw the disc but couldn;t play it. the DVD decoders didn't even recognize the disc. Needless to say I'm disappointed and angry. I loved the movie, though much less than the books, but it is a shame that greedy companies like New Line have to introduce their unlawful and unadvertised copyright schemes into the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"When I saw comercials it locked good. So I took my friends to see it and all of the liked it but I thought it was stupid. The movie just keeps draging. Yeah it is loyal to the book but it is just so slow moving. I had never really slept through a movie in my life but this I did for at least 30min. But I will admit the visual effects are wonderful and sometimes creepy, the music was also neat and somethings were kind of dark and gave a nice scary touch to the film. Still, nothing will beat Jurassic Park 3 and Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never watch the theater version again...","review":"...And I'm serious.If you're a true LOTR fanatic, this is a must-buy for your DVD collection. The expanded version of the movie (w/ 30 min. of extra footage) fills in a lot of gaps that the theater version left alone because of time constraints. Gives a fuller, more powerful view of the entire story...more of an epic quality, if you will.Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dang!","review":"This is one of the best movies I have and will ever see. The acting was great, and very believable. Elijah Wood... he did A LOT better than I thought he would. This movie in not disappointing in the slightest way. I have seen it three times with my friends and family and I have read all of the books, so trust me. I just hope that the next two movies will be just as great as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Definately the Best Movie of 2001","review":"There's really not much to say. It was beautiful, an undeniable masterpiece. If you love the books, you'll love the movie. Heck, I did. It's not exactly the same, but it's as accurate as we're getting, unless we'd like a 6 hour movie. So Arwen may have stolen Glorfindel's horse and Tom Bombadil was nowhere to be seen. No big deal. The thrilling soundtrack and wonderful acting more than make up for it.Though, from a true Tolkien fan - not one of you new movie fans - The Two Towers and Return of the King will probably completely kick its bum. But that's just because the books are so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The editing in the movie was done horribly, often showing too much of one scene and not enough of another. The movie ran way too long; it left me checking my watch throughout the entire viewing. The dialogue was often boring, monotonous, and repetitive. I, for one, am glad that this film did not win the Oscar award for Best Picture. Save your money for something worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly boring!","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I mean, is there even a real story? Even Shrek was better than this, and Shrek was shorter and cuter! This story is heavy and pretentious, and the acting in the movie is simply laughable. It's sad that nowadays most people buy into Hollywood's superficial entertainment that emphasizes special effects over human experience. Just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too long","review":"I just do not get it, why people like this movie so much. It is way way way too long, I mean come on people.

I thought it would never end. This is boring plain and simple. During the best action sequence in the film with the cool looking very realistic trol.

Movies like this are not supposed to last 3 hours.It's okay for biography movies and stuff to last for 3 hours,but with these types of movies,it is just ridiculous.This movie is a very boring one.There is not even one interesting moment about this movie.Do not see it.It does nothing for you except take away 3 hours of your life.Peace Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"..............","review":"I just don't get it. Why is LOTR getting all these awards and promotions when it's not even that good? It's not the worst, but still, it's pretty bad.The responses to my last negative LOTR review is crazy, like 2/51. I just want to say thank you to those two people!Like I said though, and I still stand by it, You either love LOTR or hate it. At least thats the hint I got from my friends and family. It's either \\"OMG Lord of the Rings is the best thing that ever happened to me\\" (Okay, slight exaggeration) or \\"Lord of the Rings is a peice of ($...)I want to burn every single copy of the (d..n) thing!\\" (No exaggeration)Well, let's face it, a single opinion isn't going to matter in this world, but I just want to put in my input.

Most people like it and don't understand how anyone could not be delighted with it. But... I wanted to love this movie, I truly did. But I didn't. It was awful.Within the first several scenes Frodo was a dozen different sizes when shown beside Gandorf or whatever his name was, so I spent the rest of the movie watching him change sizes. Sometimes Frodo came up to G's waist. Sometimes he was taller than his shoulders. Sometimes he was a wee tiny thing. Sometimes he was the height of a normal person. You never knew how big Frodo was going to be.And the fight scenes were SO redundant. I didn't leave before it was over, but only because the people I was with were enjoying it so much.So, if you loved the books, by all means, see the movie. You'll probably love it. If you thought they were long and boring, the movie will be the same...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having trouble sleeping?","review":"Trouble sleeping at night?

The writers took a long-winded book, and turned it into a fast-paced, gripping film. My problem isn't with the movie, it's with the DVD.Why do we buy DVD's instead of Videos? Okay, the picture is better, but the main reason I buy a DVD is for the extras! This DVD had crappy extras. No extra scenes, no revealing anything. The extras are little more than the trailers that we all already saw in the movie theatre for months leading up to the big sceen launch.Okay, but the movie's still great, isn't that enough reason to buy the DVD?

Elijah Wood, in his usual fine form, presented a soulful Frodo and Ian McKellan, a superb Gandolph. The supporting cast was also to be commended on their excellent performances. I would rate this movie five star and will recommend it to all my friends..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Load of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Maybe I just didn't know what to expect. The critics have just raved about this movie. I've never read any of Tolkien's work. I expected action and adventure. There were action and adventure to be sure, but in addition, there was an excruciatingly long and boring saga about little creatures with big hairy feet. I never developed any feeling for the characters nor did I feel any sympathy for their plight. I can't even remember their names. I was underwhelmed by the ending if you can call it that and saddened there is to be an obvious sequel. Only the fact that I paid $9 for the ticket kept me in my seat. Should have gone to see Snow Dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"o.k","review":"It was o.k the only good thing about the movie was that Orlando Bloom was totally HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU EITHER LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T","review":"I'll be honest, I will give you a honest review. With Lord of The Rings, its eithr: YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T! Because people who have never read the book, might not understand the story. Yha, you know its about a ring, but then, you don't know whos name is who or what the heck the monsters are called. But then agign I saw the movie before ever reading the book and i thought it was the best. So then I read the book. AND that wasgood. In the end, i endded up readind all three of the books. Mabey you'll end up doing the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"Wow! Even if you saw this movie in the theatre, you haven't really seen it until you see this extended edition. The scenes aren't separate from the movie in any way. They are seamlessly set into the movie. You find yourself wondering why they cut such a meaningful scene or questioning if you would have seen the scene in the movie theatre but you blinked too long and missed it. I was impressed with the movie when I saw it in the theatre and thrilled with the extended version. If you're a long-time fan you'll really appreciate how closely the extended version follows Tokin's book. Fantastic work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This movie has it all... great storyline, great actors, great action sequences and unbelievable graphic and visual effects. The recreation of the vaious \\"worlds\\" is truly amazing and illustrates the endless possibilities that computer graphics offers to a skilled programmer.There were so many opportunities for this movie not to live up to all of the hype. However, Fellowship of the Ring truly delivers! I cannot wait for the sequel, and there have been very few movies that evoke that response from me. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys the fantasy-adventure genre or just wants to see a well-made and directed film."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Greatest Book comes the Greatest Movie","review":"I've seen just about everything you need to see about the Lord of the Rings movie. Just in case you think you've seen Gollum, or what the Ringwraiths (Nazgules) really look like, you haven't (New Line Cenema won't let the public see what they look like) I've seen them. Orlando Bloom (Legolas Greenleaf [elf]) is going to be great. I have to say, the cast, the sets, and everything else is going to be great. I'm sorry if I sound snobby, it's just that I'm so excited. It's going to blow away Star Wars and Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One DVD to rule them all","review":"This is one of my favourite DVD's. The story starts really nicely and it gives you the whole background of the original books without all the details that only Lord of the rings hardcore funs are interested about. The picture is amazing and the sound awesome. Dont miss this extended version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film ever created!","review":"This was by far the greatest film ever created. The acting was magnificent. The special effects were astonishing. Peter Jackson should be praised. He kept the movie as true to the book as was possible for such a long story. The movie was just amazing. I've seen it twice and would like to see it many more. I can't wait to see The Two Towers, and The Return of the King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...and I never thought a movie could be better than Star War","review":"Peter Jackson is a genius. Seeing this movie in the theater was amazing, but the extended scenes make for an even better movie that follows the book more closely. I was pretty scared that PJ was gonna screw up LOTR for me forever, but this is a great film adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUTS THE THEATRICAL VERSION TO SHAME!!!","review":"If you liked the theatrical version this will blow you away. More character background, and a more maticulasely fallowed story. Crucial scenes were added back into this verson. George Lucas did this to his Episode I DVD release and fans hailed it. Any Lord Of The Rings fan will say that same about this version. There's more battle, story development, and character build up. You find that you have more connections with the charaters you already love.THIS DVD IS THE MOST COST - SATISFATION DVD YOU CAN BUY!

The characters catch you, the script holds you and binds you to the story. I am not really sure if this movie will ever let the viewer go, or if the viewer wants to disconnect from it.Legolas' bowmanship is awesome. I enjoyed the swordmanship, but there has not been a movie that ever showed the speed and graceful agility as Legolas with the bow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for the upcoming Blu Ray Director's Cut...

It is not exceptional as the shortcuts wants you to believe. But i can say that is pretty good.It is very long, almost 3 hours. In some time the movie is a little boring.The Photography, the costumes, the effects, the fights are spectacular. The landscape is great too.In conclusion: i will see it again, It is one of the best movies of the year, not the best, but it is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"original version?","review":"Right now I'm kicking myself for buying this dvd. If you are considering buying this dvd, don't. Wait until the Special Extended Edition comes out. If you want to see the movie, then rent it. But, if you want to see the scenes that were deleted, DON'T buy this dvd. It doesn't contain a single one. If I were you, I'd buy the Special Extended Edition, which will contain an additional 30 minutes of the film not seen in the theatrical version."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Bombed","review":"I remember when Peter Jackson was known for his originality as a director and Christopher Lee's films were not full of cliche. Instead, this is one sword and sorcery cliche of another. It was going to be rated G but they made it PG13 as a joke that most people wouldn't be able to see it. I'm not going to tell you what the joke was. You can get this 3 movies 3 days 3 dollars at the movie store or free at the library. To its merit, the cliches are accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE MOVIE TO RULE THEM ALL!!!","review":"I have seen this movie over 100 times. I know this is the best movie in cinema history. enough said.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowship of the Rings - extended addition","review":"A few quick words; While the original theatrical release was highly entertaining, I whole-heartedly recommend the extended version. I would say this even if you weren't a fan of the books, but definitely if you are.The additional material, especially \\"concerning hobbits\\" is a treat. However, the original release did include some \\"making of\\" programs which were nice, and are not on the extended DVD.This extended release includes appendices about the story, design, characters, and locations. It also includes audio commentary by the cast, writers and directors, etc which was quite interesting to me.As far as the movie, even with all the hype I still was amazed when I saw this in the theater. I was completely drawn into the movie, and it was very entertaining. I thought some of the special effects may have even been a touch over the top, but that's just my opinion.To even be making a 3 part theatrical version of the books is just amazing.Shawn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie!","review":"I have never read the books, but even without them I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. The DVD has added another fan to the Rings trilogy. I especially enjoyed the ten minute preview of The Twin Towers, which was wonderful. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation","review":"Peter Jackson has done an excellent job on the first chapter of the Lord of the Rings, it's amazing how he managed to condense a epic book like this in the first movie of a trilogy that I'm sure will be seen as a clasic for years to come.I can't prise this masterpiece enough. Two Tumbs and Two Toes UP!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"This is a great DVD! It is worth every penny! There are so many things to explore.

You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS DVD!","review":"I'm not kidding. Get this DVD. Anyone who has every loved fantasy and everything mythical will LOVE this movie.I admit there are drawn out parts in the movie, but the cast and action more than make up for it. You will be cheering by the end and wanting more. (November couldn't come fast enough)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice DVD","review":"I bought this for my husband who loved my sister's DVD. I had a difficult time following the movie but I have 3 kids & had trouble sitting for 3 1/2 hours @ one time, but it prompted me to read the book which is very good as well. Now that I know what is going on I really like the movie also & my husband was more happy with this DVD than anything I've gotten him in 11 years of marriage. My kids, age 9 1/2, 3 1/2, & 1 1/2 like it also, but it would scare a lot of kids.They did real justice to the book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST OWN for any movie lover!","review":"From the first moments of The Fellowship Of The Ring, I was completely immersed in the story. The characters and storyline followed J.R.R. Tolkien's book nearly to the letter. The sets and backgrounds were fantastic, in fact, I felt as if Rivendell actually existed!Because of the quality of this movie, I can't wait until the sequels release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"probably the finest fantasy film ever made","review":"I was almost in tears in the theatre at the sheer, incredible beauty of this film and how well it adapted (it is *not* a completely literal translation to the screen, but that is not possible) the epic and mythic novels of Tolkien to the screen. I cried when Gandolf sacrificed himself and fell into Shadow. My significant other fell asleep. (Not a gender thing per se, most of the males in the audience were as enthralled as I.) I bought a copy and have watched it several times now -- by myself. Keep differences in psychology in mind if you want to buy this as a gift for the hard-nosed \\"realist\\" in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, Much More","review":"The extended version of Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring enhances the theatrical release at least tenfold. I have fallen in love with the movie the way my husband fell in the love with the books many years ago. The extended version of the movie gives the story of the fellowship some needed clarification and does nothing but enhance the pleasure of viewing this great and wonderful movie. Anyone who has seen the threatrical version will be in for a treat with this DVD extended version. It is truly an upgrade from an almost perfect movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves or likes or was even disappointed in the theatrical release."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST DVD's EVER!","review":"What can I say? This is an EXCELLENT package for the 1st Lord Of The Rings Movie. Features 4 discs which include a uncut version of the movie (almost 4 hours long) and hours of behind-the scenes & making-of footage. The movie is featured in DTS surround sound and must be one of the BEST sounding DVD's of ALL time! If you enjoy this movie and have a surround sound setup with DTS, you MUST check this out. This is a great disc to show off your entertainment system. The package is very cool too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a movie person, but I LOVED this movie!!","review":"This film is the best!

Definetly my favorite film to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its About Time!","review":"I first read the Lord of The Rings trilogy while in college in 1982. Even during the first reading I realized this was an epoch worthy of a major motion picture! After viewing the animated \\"Hobbit\\" film and the first animated installment of the trilogy, I was left wanting more.To date, I have read the trilogy at least twelve times and was excited to finally hear about the making and release of this literary masterpiece.Having seen the film three times (once alone then twice with my two sons) I realized that to match Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth we had to wait for today's cinematic technology to bring this masterpiece to life; and this was done very well in this film. From the opening in the beautiful Shire to the escape from Moria you are held fast in your seat. The effects, cinematography, actors, scenery and action all came together to make me admit this was worth the wait. It will you, too.Frodo lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"When I went to the theatre I honestly expected to be disappointed. Although I had been waiting for a Lord of the rings movie for quite a while, and I thought the books were so unbelievable, I found it difficult to believe that anyone could believably bring all of Tolkien's characters to the big screen and do the story any justice. But when I saw the movie, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprise. It still doesn't compare to the books but it was a wonderful attempt,and probably the closest that we'll ever get to seeing the books come to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"I read the book the year before the movie came out. And I was a little afraid that it would follow the book so closely that it would be redundant, like Beloved (Beloved was an excellent movie too, but shouldn't be watched right after reading the book). Anyhow, this is an excellent book to film! The special effects were nearly seemless and all complimented the story. The director didn't follow the exact ending as the book, but his ending works and has a greater emotional impact. Also, as any epic novel, the director had to cut out quite a bit and merge a few characters. But I didn't miss a single thing that was left out. I can hardly wait to see the second and third film. This trilogy is going to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"must see","review":"i hadn't read the books before seeing this movie. but i fell in love with the movie almost form minute one. i couldn't wait for the dvd. it's really good, and i can't wait to get the delux edition.

They have the technology for many years now to use seamless branching to release THEATRICAL AND EXTENDED CUTS of these movies to make everyone happy. To release only the theatrical cuts is just pathetic milking attempt. I purchased the extended versions on DVD and will not purchase any Lord of the RINGS BLU RAY until the EXTENDED VERSIONS are available.

This 'edition' is for those who wants 'more of the Rings'. Before I get started, Peter Jackson himself said that BOTH versions are the real thing. Purists most likely insist the theatrical version is 'proper'. I disagree. Peter Jackson adapted a book. The Extended Edition follows more closely to the book, which is exactly what an adaptation is. It's great for people who want to delve deeper into Middle-earth and for people who haven't read the book. Not only do you get more special features, but you get an extra 38 minutes of footage seamlessley re-inserted back into the movie. The movie itself is on 2 DVDs. What more can a 'Ringer' ask for? The first disc ends when Pippin says 'Great! Where are we going?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"LEGOLAS IS SOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!","review":"I totally LOVED this movie! Legolas is so cute! It was sad at some parts, and there is A LOT of fighting. It is really hard to explain, and I don't want to give anything away.

You will never need to watch the original again as this new version reveals a level of detail that paints a richer Middle Earth and its characters. But those of us who have both versions will not necessarily be disappointed as there does not appear to be any repetition in the special features. I watched one of the documentaries on the new set and was very impressed with how thorough it was. This is a truly comprehensive set that will satisfy and appeal to everyone from newbies to Tolkien fans. Needless to say the film, and I sense the two to follow, are destined to become classics that will be cherished for generations - more than can be said for last year's good yet not so memorable Oscar winner. I wonder if Jackson will return to film the equally famed prequel, \\"The Hobbit\\", as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"why not full screen format","review":"Loved the extended version, but cant get DVD or VHS in full screen like we did with original release. Disappointing for those of us without widescreen TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure excellancy","review":"Fellowship of the ring takes the cake. Drama! Action! Romance! F.O.T.R. is all that in the plot of a fanasy world inspired by Tolkien. The characters were well thought out in great detail. this movie prestigiously deserves 5 complete stars. I can clearly see why The lord of the rings is the movie of the year. The scenery itself is specacular and the cave troll is so graphical. When Harry Potter came out I thought it would wipe out all movies but when the lord of the rings came out it left Harry Potter in the dust. Luxemburgh ratings reccomends this movie to practically anyone for it's simply a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR Extended Edition","review":"Okay, this is perfect in every way you can think. It's worth your money, even if you own the original DVD-release. If you have seen the original cut, it works as a companion piece. If this is your first introduction to the film, I can't think of a better way to view it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie!!! Best In Years!!!","review":"I have one word to sum up this movie: FANTASTIC!!! I saw the first version in the theater, but didn't really enjoy because there were too many gaps. There were things that did not make sense. I bought the expanded version on DVD, watched it and fell in love with it. It totally blows the theatrical version out of the water! I highly recommend this movie. Even for someone like me that has never read the books, the expanded version made so much more sense. It really gave more insight into each character. It felt as if I personally knew each character. Watch this movie!! You will love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I've long been a fan of Tolkien's Middle Earth and an avid reader (scholar?) of his works, including those published in memorium by his son, Christopher. Let me say the following about this latest celluloid incarnation:This is, by far, a masterpiece. Other die-hards will no doubt lament the omission of tom Bombadil and select other minute details, but the seamless integration of computer animation, stellar acting, breath-taking scenery and pure genius of directing breathes life into Tolkien's world and doees justice to his long-standing classic. While best viewed on larger television/movie screens (the bigger the better, I assure you!) this movie will not fail to disappoint you.Case in point: my wife never enjoyed the book, finding it boring and disagreeable with her tastes in literature. After seeing this film in the theatres she is now hooked and reading my prized hard-cover edition voraciously.This movie gets two thumbs up. WAY up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULD NOT GET INTO IT","review":"I ONLY READ HALF THE BOOK SO I CANT REALLY COMPARE it to that but i think this movie was just okay. i felt it was one of thos movies were every ten seconds something chasing them or there in some danger after a while the constant danger gets boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Books make Great Movies","review":"I Strongly encourage everyone to go out and buy this movie and the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy.I hope Hollywood takes a que from the sucess of this movie and starts using more top-notch authors from which to derive their movies. A great book can be a great movie. Let Clancy and Tolkien lead the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dvd movie","review":"Let me tell you. It was a mistake for them to take what they took out of the movie, even if it was close to 4hours long. This special extended version rectifies most of those removal mistakes. Still there are still some things from the book not shown here, but I'm finding it harder to complain. Some things were added that weren't from the book, too. Funny (but true) seeing Frodo and Bilbo hide from the Sackville-Baggins (ahem, Lobelia I presume). Pippin actually has flatulance? I will say no more, but the extended version has some of Tolkien's good humor and more from his clever mind. Can't wait to see Two Towers even more so, now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Jackson must hang out with a man named Oscar","review":"This movie was a really good eye opener to what good movies should really be like. Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellen all did their part into bringing this brilliant story to life; along with the rest of the cast and crew. This movie had everthing from violence to comedy. The movie had a good plot( duh it's from the book), great setting, and was well acted. Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece, and the sequel and prequel will no doubt be just as good, or better."},{"rating":"2","title":"justice","review":"one of the first movies i have ever seen that actually did justice to the book.

Two disc set alledgedly holding both the theatrical and the extended films. One would assume this 2 disc set was one disc holding each version of the film. Well, one would be WRONG!! This \\"branching\\" is basically like using a laserdisc where it will cause an intermission where you must get your lazy but up and switch the discs. In some DVD players, when you change the discs, it even makes you reset the audio for bloody sake! less than 1/2 the theatrical version is on the first disc along with less than 1/2 the extended version. The second disc is the remainder of both films! haven't we come far enough with technology to be able to put one entire theatrical film on one disc and one entire extended film on another disc?? On a good note, the conceptual art for these covers looks amazing. I may end up being trapped in Peter Jackson's \\"shelob's web\\" anyway! : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the 2 disc version.","review":"I have been noticing that this 2 disc version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS has been close to the top of the sales rank and i dont know why because there is a SPECIAL EXTENDED DIRECTORS R-RATED EDITION coming on November 12th.This version has 30 minutes of new footage and commentary by 30 yes 30 members of the cast and crew,it could just be the greatest dvd ever made.It will also have abou 20-25 feauteretes a ton of making of documentaries and a dvd-rom.Also their is a gift set coming out on the same date which almost has the same things but costs more.So i encourage you if you are thinking about buying this 2 disc version forget it and wait to November."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien would roll over in his grave","review":"My overriding impression was: Evil beasts that were gross beyond the need to be gross, too much violence, not enough story. Long seconds spent in close-ups on Elijah Woods eyes does not a movie make. Frodo ceases to be a character as soon as the quest begins and becomes a \\"face\\". The same lack of dimension is true for each character in the movie. When Frodo says that he wishes the ring had never come to him, I wanted to jump up and shout \\"Same here!\\". There is little substance to any of the characters and little character development. The third hour of this film dragged on interminably. The only reason I stayed was in the hope that some of the personality exhibited in the Shire would be evident again. It wasn't. The abruptness of the ending was so unnatural that my thought was that in the editing room someone said \\"I'm tired. It's late. Let's just stop here.\\" A total disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same...not really","review":"Years and years have gone by since I've watched this movie, and I have to say, when you finally sit down and watch the extended edition, it's like you're watching the movie again for the first time. I've seen so many \\"extended edition\\" movies that my expectation has been another worthless scene that the director cut because it added no value to the theatrical release.Not the case here.There are so many extra, and I should add, valuable scenes that have been added, and the only reason that I can come up with as to why they were cut to begin with is that the length of the movie would have been daunting to sit through in a theater.Broken up into two discs with excellent break points and seamless transition between the discs...look let me put it this way...I don't write reviews...ever...yet here I am writing a review because I want anyone that has yet to consider buying and watching the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings saga to, well, consider it. AND DO IT!Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I brought this as a gift and had heard great this about it like right after it came out. I now wish i had waited to buy the complete set, but OMG how surprised at the depth the deleted sceens added to the movie, it was flawless and I almost felt like I was watching a different movie!Defenitly a good buy, I will be buying the whole set (I know i know, now i will have too, maybe i will regift it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!","review":"I have seen this movie 3 times and I have absolutely loved it every single time! And I will say, you will either love it or hate it, but for the ones who love it, it's an amazing movie, as many will agree! The special effects are amazing, and all the actors/actresses are brilliant! I can't wait for the next 2 to come out - I STRONGLY suggest this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings is even better!!!","review":"I absoulotely love this set!!! The extended version is much more better than the regular theatrical version! You care about the characters more because the movie gets much more involved with them. I love the new scene where Sam and Frodo watch the Elves leave and where Galadriel gives the gifts to all of the characters, unlike the theatrical cut which only shows Frodo's gift giving scene. The battles are now much more intense especially at Balin's Tomb and the end battle sequence. We also see a new battle where Isildur hides using the ring from the people who are trying to retrieve it. The extras are SO GOOD. They are not just boring little extras but interesting features that takes you through the making of this great film! I highly recommend this set. It is the best special edition dvd ever made!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I waited","review":"I am so glad that I waited for the extended DVD edition. So many more added features.

For one, if you ahve a certain version of a dell computer, you cant play the movie on your computer. The extra 30 minutes of movie time makes the movie great! Oh yeah, on my version, the film is very bright. It is hard to see some of the mountain scenes and the sketches on the appendices. Otherwise it us a great movie for only around 10 more than the regular version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Special DVD Ever","review":"This is by far the best special-feature DVD I've ever seen . There are over 6 hours of behind-the-scenes features and documenteries, not to mention all the included artwork and production photos. Unlike lots of DVDs, the extra footage on this is highly entertaining andit is something you can watch again and again. The actual extended movie is great too. It makes a great companion to the origional. I really hope they bring out one of these for 'The Two Towers' and 'ROTK.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"On a roll","review":"Peter Jackson had a good idea when he relased the Special Extended Edition of The Fellowship of the Ring. Some of the additional scenes make the movie more compelling. For instance, Frodo and Sam watch a group of Elves go off into the after life, and Sam feels sadness in watching this. Also, the scene that shows Merry and Pippin fighting the Urak-Hai (spelling?) alongside Boromir before he is pierced by three arrows is more compelling. In the original theatrical release, they're just standing there watching him die, making it look like they're cowards. So, I was glad to see this footage added to that combat scene. Finally, the hours of additional background information provided in discs three and four give you an appreciation for what Peter Jackson and his crew had to do to bring this storyline to the big screen. In summary, the Special Extended Edition of Fellowship of the Ring is first rate, and I hope this carries over to the other movies when they're released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full-Screen is a waste of your time.","review":"I won't review the film. That's been done enough. What I will say is that you should not even THINK of watching this film in fullscreen. The scope is so great, the cinematography so wonderful, that you are being cheated by fullscreen. It's time to grow up, understand that fullscreen CUTS OFF half of the movie and that WIDESCREEN is the only way to see everything, and get over the \\"black bars\\". Seriously- If you watch this movie in fullscreen, you're a complete fool, and you should have your movie-watching rights taken away. The only excuse for watching fullscreen is if your television is 13\\" or smaller. Otherwise, grow up and join us in the world of widescreen where things are better, and the WHOLE movie is on your screen, rather than half of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings=WOW!!","review":"This movie is SOOOO awesome, let me tell you. If you haven't seen it, you need to, and purchase it ...(it's really hard to find it anywhere else, cheaper!) Anywho, it's not exactly like the book, but what movie is? It's really close though!! Watching the movie brought me right there with Elijah (Frodo) seeing the things he saw and feeling the same. He is an TOTALLY AWESOME ACTOR that brings the movie to life, and he is super HOT!!

It is, without a doubt, the best film ever made, or the best film made in the last ten years at least! Even with awesome visual effects and intense action and adventure, the film never loses the novel's emotional depth or scope. Captures the essence of the novel in spades! It has great characters that are played to perfection, and has a wonderful score that deserved it's Oscar. ... This film is DEFINITELY worth the time! All 178 Minutes of it!

Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked It Overall, But Bored in Part","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is grandly photographed, stays as true as it reasonably can to the book, and is deliciously presented, but I was bored with some parts.I realize that might come across offensive to those who love or will love the movie. However, I felt as if so many or the fight scenes were re-runs of the previous fight scene, like a video game waiting to happen. Different bad guys, different location, but same battle.I wanted to like this more. The scenes were beautiful... sumptuous, but I had trouble getting past the fight scenses. They seemed unnecessarily violent, and didn't display the wizardry I expected from Gandalf.However, I do recommend \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" It brings home classic storytelling, and archetypal adventure. I plan to see the other two installments, and I'd love to see more about Bilbo Baggins'.Anthony Trendl"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!","review":"This movie is so neat!

It turned out that the movie was very good, but I had trouble understanding what the characters names were. I got the main ideas in what people were saying, but I had a bit of trouble. The acting was great though! I thought the hobbits were especialy good. My favorite part was prob'ly when Aragon(??) had found the hobbits, and the hobbits wanted to stop for 'second breakfast'. All in all, this was a very good movie, and I would recomend it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"the lack of a DTS sound track on The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring puts it into the \\"rental\\" category. wait for the DTS version due out next year before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely, an overrated masterpiece","review":"Difficult to qualify the idea of an overrated masterpiece--a film that's is undoubtedly a magnificent achievement, but not the flawless paragon so many have labeled it. Understand me: FOTR is a gorgeous and exciting production, rich with detail and artistry. It is also inconsistently wrought--busy when simplicity would better serve it, or too intimate when it should be grand. Its effects are often unnecessary and even silly; disappointing to stifle chuckles at uninspired digital ripples and color inversions, when we know what a spectacular vision Jackson and his team are capable of realizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't seen it yet but it has to be good, sort of","review":"I have been reading the reviews of this film and I am certain its a very good interpretation of the books. That said , I am disappointed that they once again chose to exclude the adventures of Frodo and Company on their way down the Withywindle when they met Tom Bombadil. This character was the first to show them how important it was that evil could be \\"master\\"ed. He was also the first to give them unconditional support in their quest. It's a shame that the screen writers chose to ignore his importance to Frodo when he was at his first low, a point where he could have decided to abandon his quest and forever be the doom of his civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Long, But Very Much Worth It","review":"I was very exicted as was my area when this movie came out. Everyone was so excited in fact, that my whole section ignored the [person] behind me that was cussing at everything he didn't like. That was the intense effect on people from the movie.It was a great adaption to the Fellowship of the Ring (the book version). The battle scenes were so intense and the special effect swept you off your feet. My favorite part was when the Felloship was fighting the hordes of orcs in the forest near the end of the movie. IT was great! And you were warped into the story deeply (everyone jumped so high when Bilbo lunged at Frodo). I gave it 4 stars because it dragged on a fast-paced story into a long, LONG movie. But it's a got-to-see movie and I recommend it to veiwers who love the Lord of the Ring series, mystical movies and Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Hollywood Bust In A Long Time","review":"They spent how much on making these 3 films? I don't want to see the other 2. It is 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.

Don't waste 3 hours of your life on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worse Piece of Festering Dung Unleashed to Audiences","review":"It is clear that this film is very boring and it was done on a big budget amateurish basis, for what director would sacrifice plot in the name of 2 hours of eye gouging Orc killing? Did he have something against the Orcs, who stink of urine and rat nests, or did he just want to give us more moments of boredom? I find there to be no redeeming values in this tasteless film which wants to simply reek in great amounts of money, win undeserving oscars and proclaim itself under the pretense of a great film, to be the best movie making experience. A complete waste of time....."},{"rating":"1","title":"lord of the rings, putting the ring in boring","review":"when i went to see this film i expected it to be fun and quite scary at times. What i got in reality was 3 long hours of disappointment. The film starts off with a very mild storyline and then starts to turn to the dark side lets say. The film is very slow and at times hard to understand (me being a clever 16 year old). I also find that the film has many links to warhammer (orcs, daemons, dwarfs, [wood] elves, undead etc..) it is the weird group against one and another group of people with a cut short ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I went to see the movie yesterday. The cinema was crappy & old. The seats were terrible, the sound wasn't calibrated right, etc. But you know what? I didn't care! The story just overwhelmed me.

And again and again. I have not read the books yet, but I plan to. Some people say the books are better than the movie. Is that truly possible??

I keep a naive believe that a movie should live a life of its own, and indeed one should not read the libretto but understand the flick and enjoy it as it is. None of which happens with this monstrous production.This is a fantasy run amok, a movie full of special effects to the extent that you can't see the story behind them. And with all that noise and fury it is devoid of any sense so that nothing but a yawn results.After all it is supposed to be a tale - not an agressor jumping at you from the screen like a crocodile.

Not only do you get the best version of the film, you get an incredible Behind The Scenes story. Also, buy a copy ofThe Lord of the Films: The Guide to Tolkien's Middle-Earth on the Big Screenwhich has lots more information to truly give you the best viewing experience.

But when Frodo comes to his rescue, tears are jearked between them. And lets be honest, when (Liv Tyler) the elf princess confronts him in the woods by the little bird bath in her underwear, What would you have done? I dont think my point needs much more explaining.

When they started torturing the small dude in the cauldron, I just walked out of the theatre. AND the theatre gave me a complete refund.I'm sorry if I'm the only one who hated the movie.

The fabulous sets, the superb casting and the amazing special effects are combined with a much finer appreciation for Tolkien's writing than was exhibited in The Two Towers. Most of the changes made to the story in this movie are for the purposes of pacing, and the characterizations come through as solid echoes of the characters in the book. Aragorn could be less diffident, Arwen less manly, but on the whole the movie offers a great taste of Tolkien's vision. The scene on the bridge of Khazad-dm is probably the finest.
