The box contained not a single instruction as to what to do with the screw-on lid with a hole in it and the flimsy red plastic/wire that comes with. Not so much as a picture hinting at optimal hanging procedures.So I have a relatively heavy glass hummingbird feeder that I'm supposed to (somehow) suspend from a tree with a 7 inch straight red plastic/wire? And once I add 30 ounces of fluid, how heavy will that be? And how can this tiny plastic and wire concoction possibily support it?Methinks this may go back to Amazon.com for lack of basic instruction and/or common sense.

Yesterday we decided to put it up since we have an abundance of \\"hummers\\" all of a sudden and much to our chagrin it immediately started leaking from two spots on the plastic bottom. It was brand new, never in contact with anything, just hanging up waiting until we needed it, and it started leaking immediately upon filling. We have had many hummingbird feeders and never had this problem. I would have asked for a refund but it has been a while since we ordered it, I guess we should have tried it out immediately just to test it but like mentioned, we never thought of it since it was new.

If I were you, I would be ASHAMED to say, \\"This is our BEST PRODUCT\\". Only fills from one TINY hole, in the bottle. You MUST use a FUNNEL to add the nectar. This is a PAIN. Also, because the fill hole is SO SMALL, BOTTLE IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CLEAN OF DRIED SUGAR & gets STICKY. GLASS LOOKS DIRTY, ALL OF THE TIME. VERY EASY TO DROP & BREAK. In addition, bees amd wasps are naturally attracted to the color YELLOW. So, what color did they make the flowers? YELLOW!!! MAKES NO SENSE. ALSO, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOOK?

The Perky Pet 209 30-oz. feeders always seem to be the ones the birds go for first. I also like them because they are large but easy to handle when filling and easy to clean.

The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because of the poor design for hanging the feeder and the lack of instructions. They give you a short and straight 'cord' but there's no instructions on how to apply it as a hanger to the red cap on top of the feeder. I figured it out but it does not seem very secure. They need to include a stainless steel washer to spread the load under the center of the red cap.

Not surprisingly I find it even more difficult to comment substantively about poetry that I like than to criticize it. I do think that Brodsky merits the Nobel Award he received,, and I could be interesting in seeing his other writing at some point.

It almost seems as if Kennedy was a secret member of the Rat Pack. Of course, things were different in those days as far as what the media reported or was allowed to report so nobody knew what was really going on and this book does, I feel, a nice job of detailing the relationship of all involved.I'd recommend this book to anyone who was or is a fan of this era or any of these performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read","review":"This book is an insider look on the lifestyle these 5 men had.

Equal time is given to Frank, Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Joey, but as the book jacket read, \\"it was Frank's world, and we were just living in it.\\" A common complaint of albums of that era, or any era, is that they tend to be packaged around a couple of strong singles, and the rest is fluff and filler.

Sinatra and Martin sat down at a blackjack table and demanded to be dealt from the deck, not from the shoe. If the dealer declined, they would have had her fired, if she agreed, as she did, the New Jersey Gaming Commission would have her fired for violating their rules, as they, in fact, did. These two aging rat packers decided to force a young woman into a Hobson's choice on nothing more than a whim.

It is shocking in this day and age of people copying music and movies, that WB could be as blatantly disloyal as they appear by ticking off an existing market place. Real fans of the show WANT originals, not copies, and those characters in Nikita deserve their share of the resultant income. Could that be the problem, WB?

Season 2 is highly energetic, with some wonderful sequences. It retains the usual nobody-really-wins-in-the-end trademark, or at least, without almost 'selling your soul'.(a bit like buying the DVD at auction) But, most of all, it remains highly entertaining, for those of us who love this sort of stuff. The characters run true to form, and we get to know them even better. However, it has to be said that the music worked really well in this Season.

This show never got the recognition it deserved. Hopefully it will be released soon and then we can all look forward to Season Three.

The center wire that runs through the center of the feeding bin allows for the feeder to spin wildly in the wind. I had to drill a hole on each side of the roof and attach a 'Y' shaped wire that eliminates that spin. Further, the feeding tray where the birds eat the seed has no drainage holes and fills with water. Again, I had to drill four small drain holes to correct that problem. All in all, the feeder is not worth the money unless they correct these flaws. Other than that, it's perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not OUR Squirrels...","review":"Perhaps the squirrels in Maryland are more creative and determined, but ever since we hung the feeder last week, we've been inundated with squirrels in our backyard. So far, we've seen one bird using the feeder. The squirrels are able to balance themselves on the bar without it dropping them in order to get to the seed. Twice they have knocked the feeder onto the ground, spilling the contents everywhere. A relative of ours who also has this feeder reports the same problem. The feeder is more secure now and they can't knock it off, but they are still able to readily get to the seed.We've admitted defeat to the squirrels, but at least our cats have a blast chasing them out of the yard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ... feed tray holds water & squirrel loves it","review":"I purchased this bird feeder as I have others in hopes of them being squirrel proof.

Now, birds RARELY go to this one and sure enough....the pesky little squirrels STILL found a way to beat the 'trap' no matterwhat I do! Its cheaply made, the plexiglass behind the feeding area was bowed in so when its filled with seed it flows out there! Im probably going to be returning this $$$ feeder for something better if I still can?! Avoid this and save your money!!

It is also heavy and you will need a strong hanger. I intended to mount it on top of a pole attached to the bottom of the feeder.

Financially, they succeeded. Artistically, they hit bottom.Brian Michael Bendis. Loved by everyone, appartently. Never has a writer so consistently disappointed me as Bendis has. His dialogue is choppy and irritating, his plots are muddled and anticlimactic. And all the revisions he inserted into this story were completely unnecessary.Don't tell me a story in seven issues that you could've told me in two or three. The Spider-Man film did it right, Ultimate Spider-Man did it wrong. The film collapsed all the basic and best elements of Spider-Man into itself, whilst the comic is meandering and annoying.The artwork is sloppy, and makes me feel cheated considering the sleek look of the cover.And turning Uncle Ben into an aged hippie. That's just wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"What brought me to Marvel","review":"I was never a big fan of the Marvel Universe.

This more modern variation of Spidy has become one of my favorite series. It has resurged my interest in the Marvel characters and has led me to follow other titles in Ultimate Marvel Universe as well as the Main Continuity.This series deserves all the credit for making me a Marvel fan. If it wasn't for Ultimate Spidy I would never have given Marvel the time of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider-man: Power and Responsibility","review":"Ultimate Spider-man is a wonderful series written by Brian Michael Bendis and with drawings by Mark Bagley.

It is a little bit different from the original Stan Lee stories (and the movie), but it's very well done.

I like to check things out before ordering if I can, and glad I did, because I was going to get 2 Vittles stackables to save space, but these two line up perfectly in our narrow laundry/entry whereas the 2 stackables would have stuck out too far.It is much easier to get the last of the kibble out of one of these \\"vaults\\" than the bottom of a bag, they look better, and keep the food fresher. Amazon transaction quick and easy as usual. What's not to like? And it's fun to spin the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"might buy a second one","review":"I loved the Vittles Vault storage container... the ants tried to get to the food but failed. Highly recommended for dog food storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 Pounds? In What World?!","review":"It's a good product, good for keeping pests out and the food fresh, but under no circumstances will it ever fit 40 pounds of food.I had under half a 40lb bag of food left that I put into the Vault and it nearly filled it. 35lbs max for this product, anything more and it wouldn't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pet food container","review":"We have this container and one we bought from a local retailer. The Vittles Vault is much, much better. No wheels, so you can't slide it under a cabinet, but it's very sturdy, and the lid really is air tight. Easily holds the entire 30lb bag of Blue Buffalo dog food. Nice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ANT PROOF!","review":"I loved this container despite the fact that the lid can fall off when my dog wants to tip it over. I know it's suppose to \\"snap\\" but it doesn't seem to hold too well if 40 pounds of dog food is pushing it when it's on it's side. But I overlooked that fault because it looks better than the regular vittles vault. HOWEVER, I'm so upset how I found ants inside the container the other day. I always make sure it's shut tight because like mentioned above..my dog will open it if it's loose. Maybe I just got a weird one but sad I can't return it because it's been past the 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid didn't snap on","review":"This would have been a great container. The spinning portion of the lid works great. However, you are supposed to snap the lid onto the base to create a permanent seal. Both my husband and I could not get it to snap. I also tried calling the company to see if they could send me a replacement lid, but they never returned my call."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTS EVERYWHERE!!","review":"This absolutely did not work as advertised. It says to \\"snap\\" the top in place and then use the vault opening. Well, the top does not snap in place or stay snapped. There are gaps in the top underneath where the ants got in and invaded my dog's food. I tried everything to get the lid to snap airtight and it would not. I even had several strong men helping me and they could get it on but it would pop out again. Obviously manufactured poorly or I got a bad one somehow. I bought duck tape today and taped all around the lid to see if that helps. I am beyond disappointed and have notified the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic shattered after being dropped","review":"We used this container to store our dog food. The lid sealed very well but the plastic of the container wasn't very thick or sturdy. It definitely was not heavy duty. One day it slipped out of my hands while getting my dog's dinner and it fell about three feet to the ground and the whole bottom shattered. I was worried my dog would ingest plastic shards while going for the food everywhere. It was a little bit scary.We emailed customer service and they responded within a few days to say the plastic wasn't covered because we had too much food in the container. It was only about 1/3 full so what's the deal with that?If you purchase this container don't let it ever leave the floor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"So I see people have said it fits a 40LB bag easily. I have filled the container with Purina ProPlan Puppy Large Breed Dog Food. It's puppy food so the food is still pretty small and the bag is 34LBS. I could probably fit another 2-3lbs in there but so far it's pretty tight. I'll post a picture but the container works great and I like the ability to screw off the top and back on. Very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a 35 lb bag of food easily","review":"I had to look around for a pet food container I was willing to buy online (I am always a skeptic). I actively did not want a container on wheels - I don't have much space and I thought the wheels would make the container bulky. This container fits in my small space without any problems.With a single dog a 35 lb bag of food is more than enough this container meets all of my needs.From other reviews I gather that it doesn't quite hold the full 40 lb capacity, so avoid this product if you're looking for something to hold more than the 35-37lb range.Another small issue is that when I first started using the container the top could be really hard to open, however I've gradually had less and less trouble the more I use it. Now I really can open it up one handed without any problems.Because it is advertised as 40lb and not 35lb I feel obligated to rate it 4 instead of 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills the Bill","review":"The vittles vault 40-pound food container is perfect.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product but will not hold a 35lb bag of dog food","review":"I like this container in general. It's built quite solid and I like the air tight lid which keeps the smell of dog food in and any insects out. I like the tall shape as it fits nicely under the counter and doesn't take up much space.However the other reviewers are right about this not holding 40 pounds of dog food, at least not the one that we use. We use the Royal Canin large breed for puppies and I get the 35lb bags. The 35lb bag doesn't completely empty into the container and you're still left with some kibble in the bag.I wish it was a little wider or taller so that it could actually hold a little more dog food as advertised. Other than that I like the container."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pet Food Storage Container","review":"If you buy dry food in bulk for your pet, this is a must have. It is an excellent invesetment for any pet owner. The container perfectly holds a 40lb bag if filled to the lid. Just shake the container slightly as you fill so the food settles. It's sturdy, air-tight and doesn't take up much space. I put it just inside the garage door, where the dog doesn't see it often, and I use a smaller cereal container that I fill once a week and keep in the kitchen.Great price too - I also checked the local pet store, and it was $10 more. And mine was delivered promptly, just as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what we needed...","review":"We had been using a smaller cereal type tupperware to store our wheaten's dry food. He seems to have started getting the munchies recently and started to access food and snacks on top of his kennel he's never touched before.

Now the whole bag of food is stored in a container he'll find much harder to breach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Airtight, flimsy","review":"The vittles vault, although it looked like a definite winner, was not airtight. Not sure if this was an issue for everyone, but with my vault if you squeeze on the side a bit it will expel and bring back in air. After further inspection, the sides of my vittles vault will not clamp all the way down. Even if forced to do so, the clips just pop back off. For this reason I am giving it a 2 star rating, as it is not much more than an expensive rubbermaid tote at this point. Really wanted to like this, but I can't with this kind of QC.Update: 9/12/12The clips on the container are starting to break off at the seam of the clip.

How do I fit 40 pounds properly?!? I guess I can't. So, I tend to buy 2 30-pound bags and just leave the excess in the bag. This container is still good and stores the food well. It feels like the top could use a little work as I don't think the silicone gasket seals completely. If I push it down more, it doesn't give a satisfying click.

To a student, this would be the place to start. Classical music walks a tightrope between precision and passion. The death of classical music will be when it is no longer fun. In this recording the Julliard String Quartet seems to be working, not enjoying, the music.The material is, of course, top notch, the middle-period string quartets being my favorites. This was the point in Beethoven's life when he found his own voice (the \\"Eroica\\" period it has been called) but before his tragic loss of hearing.The Busch Quartet does a better job of performing the music, but the recordings are at least 50 years old, so the sound quality is somewhat compromised.That said, this recording by the Julliard String Quartet is the best combination of skill, sound, and material."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hoot!","review":"A cross between comedy and softcore porn it's a great movie just to watch and enjoy.

Me personally Labrie is a little much at times, but he definately sounds a lot better (as he should) on here then some lackluster live performances. I just felt that Petrucci didn't have enough solo'ing and that Portnoy wasn't ripping off his best fills. It felt like a less 'proggish' album until you of course listen to the final track, \\"Octavarium.\\"It's still head over heels better than anything out there you'll see on the pop charts, but it could've definately been atmospheric in quality if they wanted it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Theater couldn't get any better, but did they have to get worse?","review":"I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles.

I have been a fan of this band since WD&DU, and welcome any & all musical experimentation & growth. The sad fact is simply that this album is just plain dull. I am surprised to see so many positive reviews of this album. It seems that too many reviewers equate musical growth and band cohesion with weak lyrics and \\"toned-down\\" songs. The mere fact that there is less shredding does not mean that the band has grown. DT has been far more cohesive and effective in the past, regardless of the \\"shred factor\\". While this album still has some good moments, (the excellent \\"Panic Attack\\", as well as \\"I Walk Beside You\\", for example) in my opinion this is their weakest offering to date, even more so than \\"Falling Into Infinity\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of DT's best work!","review":"This album is just wow...

At least with Rudess on board we don't get maudlin schlock like \\"Wait for Sleep\\" or \\"Space-Dye vest\\" (puke).Also, 6DOIT wipes the floor with I&W; or Awake. Rush or Kansas better than DT???!!! Rush have been obsolete since 1989, and Kansas are just sissy rock.

Instead of continuing to produce the same dull music they made in the last whatever albums, they now decided to copy the \\"greats\\" of the 70's. Their greatest accomplishment remains the same up to this day: covering the whole Master Of Puppets album live. That's what they are capable of - covering other people's work, and they do it very well. This is very very sad, that a band with five skilled musicians in it can not write their own great music.I give it two starts(Collectors/fans only), because I am 100% sure that Dream Theater fans will find a lot of enjoyment here.

I listened to this album, and it was horrible as well. I think the warehouses made an error on the tags because it reads \\"Rock/Metal.\\" However, I kept my mouth shut about them. Then one of your fellow dream theatre fans named Jeremy Brackeen \\"themetalbeast\\"had to go and slam Until the End by Kittie. How can you call these sad vocals that for some reason remind me of \\"death cab for cutie\\" metal vocals? This album is horrible. This band is horrible. No wonder they are so popular, the masses always seem to like crap. If you say this is metal, you must like A7X, Chaimera, Atreyu, Bloodsimple, and maybe the Backstreet Boys.

The record contract must have some tight requirements on how often they have to squeeze out albums. This cycle of heavy touring + quick album every two years is resulting in lots of weak efforts. Every album after Scenes From a Memory has consisted of perhaps 50% throwaway tracks. Octavarium is 75% throwaway. DT should take a vacation, and then sit down and really write an album. They're such talented musicians that even their rushed garbage is amazing, but it's not very good music. Octavarium is mostly cheese and DT formula. I hope we don't see another DT album until 2008 or 2009. Maybe that will give them enough time to develop enough good ideas to fill a whole album. On a related note, if you get \\"Score\\" the live album, Labrie's voice has never sounded better. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I love Dream Theater. Now that I have said that what happened to the guitars? I was very excited about this album comming out but now that I have it I'm very dissapointed. It is way too soft to be a Dream Theater disc.

At least it rocks hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quandary","review":"I have been listening to DT since about '92 when I received an advance copy of Images & Words while working at the college radio station. Anyway, that album blew me away and I've enjoyed most of what they have released ever since.I just cannot get into this album. I'm not sure if it's me or them but I find it impossibly boring. I'm sure many fans are pleased by the return of \\"melodic content\\" or whatever they found lacking with Train of Thought but...wow. This is like boring old man prog.

No more jamming solos, interesting drum patterns etc. but predictable and sometimes corny(I walk beside you and The answer lies within). If I was told 'Never Enough' was the new song by MUSE, i wouldve believed it etc etc, the unpleasant surprises go on and on... 'These Walls' however, is why it got 2 stars and not 1. Brilliant song(If you forget that its Dream Theater playing it. 'Octavarium' is a nice long waste of 24minutes. Suppose it must be soooo hard to follow up on TRAIN OF ThOUGHT.

Maybe thats the problem with dream theater, they are so adament about showing off their pedantic 'licks' that their really isn't anything beyond them except the ordinary basic song structure. So...these tunes could be any dream theater tunes: no better, no worse i.e. one song is many songs. And the production of this album stinks: where are the keyboards? Jordon Rudess is probably the best thing going in the band but where is he in most of the songs? so deep in the mix and buried behind the 'chunka chunka chunka' of guitar he seems to be almost non existant. And don't even get me started on their banel lame lyrics...ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"DT is a prog metal band. But i guess many fans focus more on \\"prog\\" than on \\"metal.\\" Though this album shows some metal sounds, where the hell is proggy sound? No creativity found. For the most of the songs, it's like once-you-hear-the-beginning-part-you-can-predict-the-rest. Like the other songs, Octavarium's 24 mins is completely wasted. They could use only 8 mins (ain't it more relevant to \\"Octavarium?\\")to express exactly same feelings.

Well on the plus side of this album the titled track was almost a pink floyd cover, but you knew it was dt about the middle of the song, Panic Attack and Never Enough were very strong names and familar DT standards. These Walls was straining to listen too, I walk beside you was probably the worst song i have heard from a major label band. I would say this is the not record you want to look at if your new to the band, but buy it anyway, start with scenes from a memory or awake i would say to start.Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Dream Theater album of all time","review":"This album, my review of which shall not be object and will be short, will simply state that of all DT albums this one is the most inspirational, the most on-target topically with regard to lyrics that really hit home, and hit hard. Here the band deals with subjects such as isolation, alcoholism, desperation and redemption in a way in which few bands could ever hope to equal.The songs take an observant listener on a ride through realms of darnkess to emerge into blissful light. The musicianship is top-notch, as we would expect from any DT album.I have to admit, this album has got me through tough times, in particular the tracks: These Walls, I Walk Beside You, The Root of All Evil and The Answer Lies Within. The rest of the album is so-so, even the epic title track.But those tracks are perhaps my favorite DT songs of all. The emotions these songs evoke are striking and poignant, truly some of the best songs DT has ever recorded IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cream always Rises to the Top","review":"In a world full of bands that SUCK, I thank GOD for Dream Theater's seamingly limitless talent and superb musicianship. Octavarium is fantastic! I can't figure out why some fans lament the fact that Octavarium doesn't sound like past DT projects. What the hell is the point of creating a new album only to replicate what was done in the past??? Anyone can do that. Truly talented musicians evolve.

I can't find anything on this cd that is from the heart or well thought out. I've been hanging in there w/ the last 2 cds, but DT really needs a writer and a producer. I don't want images + awake pt2, but I do want the same amount of heart, passion and well thought out lyrics and melodies. They could do an acoustic albulm or an acapella cd, but no matter what style, it has to have Well thought out melodies. Singers don't write well thought out melodies. Writers who understand what notes fit over chords do that. Instrumental sections should also be well thought out. Not just random pastings. Get Kevin back + hire a producer. Untill then, Rudess is just going noodle elp + various other influences from his past. Rudess needs music on paper. He can read....not necessarilly write. Also what's up w/ being influenced by the younger generation.Since Kevin left, they have been copying everyone from u2 to tool + muse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Too Depressing","review":"Thank God for MP3 downloads. I don't think this will be 1 CD I would buy. What's happening with DT is they're pumping too many albums out. So many in that they really don't spend enough time to thoroughly write the songs.Mike Portnoy could of done a lot better in his precussion playing. Just seems like the whole album was based on typical 'Jam Sessions' rather than writing the songs out on paper before playing a note.... The result is a song that simply sounds too generic with little time changes (how can you orchestrate a time change when you jam?)James LaBrie should really stop singing like Radiohead. Since when Radiohead was considered progressive rock? A very depressing sound. For the other songs that aren't so Radiohead like, his vocal singing sounds much more like mainstream radio music.The only decent melody I could get out of the album is Jordan Rudess's keyboard playing (half way into the Octavarium song)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overmatured","review":"This album shows off the quality of the band . Why 4 stars ?The fifth star has exploded into fragments , because despitegreat songs and superb musicianship the whole assembly goesnowhere.

While I loves Scenes, a great concept and a great tour, I just cannot get into Jordan. He plays too much from his head and not enough from his heart, something Kevin did effortlessly. A single listen to IAW and you'll hear more passion and more complementary keys. Not just showing you have chops (which Jordan has PLENTY of-the man can really play well, but his heart isn't there like Kevin's was).Sorry guys, I cannot get behind this one like I could the other ones.Go back to the old days when you wrote melodies and really parted your songs out in ways that fit. One listen to TOT and this new one and you'll see who's in charge, the FNG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? What happened? @#$%!!!","review":"This album is a huge disappointment. Why would a band with such amazing talent choose not to use any of it? I have been a huge DT fan since \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" first came out. The \\"Falling into Infinity Album\\" had been the only bad thing they produced, until now. I threw that album out, and I will be doing the same with this one.I guess this is the chance people take when they love an innovative band. I hope they get their heads screwed on straight before their next endeavor. I might have given this two stars if I wasn't so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album","review":"First let me begin by saying that I am not the 12 years old kid that thinks TOT was great nu-metal material nor the old DT fan that is still expecting another Awake or Images and Words album from DTTOT was awful, in fact I gave away my cd after a few days. But Octavarium is good, not the best DT album but in fact one of the best, how good it is??? Well everyone is different, but here is my Dream Theater ranking:1)Images and Words2) FII3)Awake4)Octavarium5)Six degrees, change of seasons and Scenes6)When dream and day unite9999) TOTSo, IMO give it try, in fact I wasn't expecting a big deal after TOT, but I guess DT is back from the grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems robotic and lifeless","review":"Until I looked a bit deeper, I feared I was the only person who thought \\"Octavarium\\" to be a rather boring amalgam of layered formula. Whatever inspiration spawned this recording, it must have been smothered under the huge, droning wall of sound that envelops the songs.Yes, Dream Theater produced an engineering masterpiece, played flawlessly, and conjured up a slick, scripted package--but the whole effect seems robotic and lifeless. A dose of edginess might have infused some urgency and energy into this session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album, period.","review":"Everything that makes Dream Theater is epitomized here, and they still cover new ground without looking back. Anyone that speaks badly of this album clearly had WAY too many expectations, which in my mind will do nothing but RUIN your enjoyment of anything.These guys will NEVER look back musically, so stop expecting them to, and enjoy this brilliant work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough with the bashing","review":"Octavarium isn't exactly my favorite or even close to my favorite DT album. I'm mainly writing this review not as a bashing of Octavarium, but a bashing of the so-called fans. No matter how long you have liked DT, if you have hadn't noticed they try something new with every album. There's a handful of bands who can accomplish trying something completely different from one album to another yet keep their trademark sound. DT has done it for years and reguardless of what the album sounds like, there's always people who have been listening since '89 or '92 or whatever that bash DT albums. SOAM, 6DOIT, TOT, and now Octavarium. I mean Jesus, if you are a real fan you will give it a few listens. DT is a band that their albums grow on you. After that, if you don't like it then you don't like it. But this is what they have been doing for years. So don't pretend that it's a new concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"Not great, not bad. I won't go rating every songs one by one here since I'm quite low on time, but I'll say this : Dream Theater have been a stone rolling down hill since ToT, and this album doesn't really help the situation. The first thing I thought when I heard the first 4 songs was \\"commercial\\". No interesting, progressive riffs at all, just plain and straight riffs. Even the greatest guitar player ever didn't have much to say on this album : In fact, there are only three solos, and one of them is made exclusively from guitar noises a-la-Kerry King. As a whole, the music composition on this cd isn't really interesting.And don't get me started on the lyrics either.Listen to the last song, but don't expect anything real great.Much Better than Train of thought- but this is still crappy"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY AGREE WITH FRANZ","review":"Well, there is not much more to say- yes, Pick up Symphony X- they canb do a real epic- Octavarium DOES only have about 7 minutes of real music- WOW- what a great review!!

I'm sure that there is something else they could have been doing besides making this album,like i don't know... smashing their fingers with a hammer. its not inspiring, there is no real virtuouso performances. There are no \\"wow\\" moments whatsoever on this album. I bought this album used and i can honestly see why someone decided to unload it. I am still loyal to the band to see what type of redemption album they will put out. But i am a bit leary. It is reminiscent of metallica diversifying their musical choices after the black album, and look at their fan base now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor lyrics, monotonous experience..not like other DT albums","review":"Probably the six d's of inner turbulence was the last album where DT really put some serious effort to be a little distinctive about the riffs, lyrics and ...well, everything else. Octavarium isn't terribly bad after a few listen, but it's nowhere near the other DT albums (except TOT).. When you first listen to the whole album, not a single song seemed never heard before.. DT never was rich in lyrics, but I think they are getting worse everyday..\\"I walk beside you\\" ..a 10 yrs kid can write this in the bathroom in like 5 mins..For some real good Progressive rock, try Porcupine Tree. \\"Deadwing\\", \\"In Absentia\\" or any of their earlier albums.. DT is getting boring, if they don't do something in their next album, the end is near."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasantly surprised...","review":"After Train of Thought, I was hoping Dream Theater would go back to something that was a little more their style, and \\"Octavarium\\" did not disappoint. The album's sound is definitely different from that of previous Dream Theater albums, yet stylistically the same. Save \\"Scenes from a Memory,\\" this is probably the bands best work. My ONLY complaint about \\"Octavarium\\" (and the only reason I didn't give it five stars) is that for inspiration, DT seemed to borrow very heavily from the band Muse. It's uncanny how similar some of the stuff sounds. But other than that one thing, I love the album and am kind of weirded out with how I can listen to it over and over again and not get tired of it. If you're a DT fan you're going to want to pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Creative Disappointment","review":"After great albums like Scenes from a Memory, 6DOIT, and Train of Thought, this album blows. Christ, one of these songs is a U2 ripoff. It's bad enough they rip off Pink Floyd in this album with the boring 24 minute title track, but U2? Why in God's name would they ripoff U2? The song in question is called I Walk Beside You, and is just one of the bad songs on this album. The only song worth listening to on here is Panic Attack. The Root of All Evil would seem promising on paper, because it's part of a \\"trilogy\\" with The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul, but the song is weak. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being a Dream Theater fan since 1992....","review":"I feel I deserve my $11.88 back. The soundtrack to a toilet flushing (actually, that would sound better.) Maybe their next release.I think a little more downtime should be spent before the next release. Major disappointment, guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily One of their Best!!!!","review":"I've tried to convert several of my friends to Dream Theater. I mean, come on... DT has something for just about everyone who appreciates good music. Octavarium to me is DT's crossover into more \\"mainstream\\" music but still has it's feet firmly planted in the ground. The title track is an amazing achievement on it's own. Several tracks remind me of the better \\"hair bands\\" from the day. I love this album. All the songs are good. I can't just pick them apart. They are all good..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply said...","review":"Dream Theater churned out an album of this kind of quality after 20 years of making music together. If you prefer their older or newer sound, this is the perfect mesh for the hard rock / metal fans, and the prog fans. Everything is here, the songwriting, wonderful production, and musicianship everyone loves to hear from them. A perfert capstone to the first 20 years together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A COMPLETE WONDERFUL SURPRISE!!!","review":"I just found out about this album the day it was released; completely had NO idea that DT was releasing an album, but it couldn't have come at a better time!!There's not much more that I can say that other reviewers haven't already covered, but I will say that do NOT listen to the harsh criticisms that are to be found on this product so far; for the mature DT fan like myself, this album is very refreshing. Mainly because the band is performing very much like a \\"band\\" moreso than their last effort, \\"Train of Thought\\". Now while I do love DT songs that show off musicianship ala a million-notes-per-second...it's nice to have some simpler cathy tunage such as what \\"Octavarium\\" offers.Oh, and i'll say it...I LOVE \\"\\"I Walk Beside You\\"!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this CD but they keep changing I want to hear more songs like erotomania and metropolis part 1,a very complex and off beat song,I do like this album but its no Awake or Images and Words in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back!!!","review":"After being disappointed in TOT, this is a nice, refreshing welcome back for DT. Well thought out songs; a little bit of everything that makes a dream theater fan love them. Really no complaints on any of the songs like some reviewers before me, especially those commenting on how terrible song two's lyrics are (Karl Peterson, who obviously has nothing better to do than to write negative reviews, see his other reviews). There is nothing wrong with a father wanting to write a song for a child, and i dont think any of us sitting behind our monitors could do any better. As a dad, I can appreciate this song. Give the guy a break! Anyway, i would recommend this album to anyone and everyone who is interested in great musicianship and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn...","review":"Honestly, I'd take train of thought over this. Where are the solos? Where are the sweet riffs? Never Enough and Panic Attack sound exactly the same. The first four tracks are just plain awful. What the hell is up with Root Of All Evil? Why is there so much James Labrie all the time?So far, I'd count this as the biggest dissapointment of 2005.

I pray that for every gorgeous and sweet \\"I walk beside you\\" there is an equally beautiful and ravenous \\"Octavarium\\" ...Either way, buy the disc!!! Buy them all!THESE GUYS ARE A TREASURE ...Gps. been listening to a lot of Styx Grand Illusion lately ... some similiarities in the keyboard sounds ... not a bad thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extensive Changes for Progressive Music","review":"Dream Theater has been one of my favorite bands and I too have been following them since IAW(Images and Words). This album is different than ToT in that it's not as heavy. The last album reviews, people complained that they were too heavy and others loved the heaviness. Dream Theater is and has always been a little experimental so you don't like every album all the time, but there's usually enough to make everyone happy. This one so far reminds me of FII a little bit. It's almost like the Label asked them for something more commercial again. This is also very Jordan Rudess-centric Album. You can really hear a lot of piano and synth parts in this.Also, if you happen to like Dream Theater or at least the more melodic progressive side of Dream Theater, you might listen to Shadow Gallery who also have a new album 'Room V', a concept album. Just a little plug for another Great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Dream Theater, but a bit more boring","review":"I've listened to this album about 15 times, but I find very little exciting material here.It is certainly more diverse than Train of Thought, which I think is a good thing. But for the rest, most of the songs just sound like typical Dream Theater, only less inspired, less enthusiastic and simpler than on their previous albums.I know Dream Theater can do much better than this. It sounds like they need to refind their inspiration and energy.Compared to their other albums, this album is definitely the most boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still something missing ...","review":"I remember the first time I listened to I&W; and Awake. I was blown away. I can listen to both of those CDs at any time and still enjoy them.From then on, I haven't been moved. I'd like to blame the change on the loss of Kevin Moore's lyrical contribution (which they surely miss) and the inclusion of Portnoy as a lyricist (he's absolutely brutal) but I'm sure that's just part of the problem. I will say that I enjoy FII and Six Degrees - it took me until this year (yes, this year) to appreciate Six Degrees. The others I can live without.I've enjoyed my first few listens and I'm sure most fans will, too. This is certainly better than ToT, which was a total mess. I think if I stop hoping for a I&W; and Awake-type release and give up on lyrical masterpieces as in previous releases (pre SFAM), I'd enjoy DT that much more.Solid, solid effort - though \\"safe\\" in a few areas. Good, not nearly their best, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least.","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the release of DT's new album Octavarium but after listening to it intensely it has left me thoroughly disappointed, this to me is a run of the mill release with very little substance and it doesn't leave you with a feeling of wanting more, all I can say is get Kevin Moore back and give us that sound the band once had with Image and Words, Awake, and the legendary A Change of Seasons"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even great bands occasionally release bad recordings","review":"Even great bands occasionally release bad recordings. DT has done so before (Falling Into Infinity, When Day and Dream Unite) and has done so again with this lackluster release. I have no problem with DT trying to write shorter songs and expand their horizons. They are just being incredibly inconsistent in their output. I said this when I reviewed TOT but DT really needs an outside producer to fulfill their potential. DT has never been an original band. They are quite obvious in showing their influences [Megadeth (esp TOT), Rush (esp I&W;), Yes, Radiohead, Peter Gabriel-era Genesis (SOAM)] and this record is no exception.The problem is that the influences in this record includes (gulp!) Coldplay and (okay, these guys rock!) Muse. This one is for fanboys(girls) only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Octavarium is a most worthy follow up to Train of Thought","review":"At first listen I wasn't sold but then I let it sink in that this wasn't 'Train of Thought'. I then realized just how good a record this really is. I saw Dream Theater live on this tour and was completely blown away. Their level of musicianship is just not matched these days. They carry the flame of arena progessive rock into the future with no contemporaries. Octavarium's sound engineering is noticably different from Train of Thought as well. While that was a more in your face mix and agressive sounding, this one is more atmospheric and ambient. There is a slight haze throughout the CD. I guess it's more dream like...ha ha.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album by the masters","review":"This album rocks. Its anothere great work. I really like Dream Theater. In this album they are very melodically , they play progressive metal (not so complicated as in previous albums = You can hear them even if you are not a musician). They have a huge song Ocavarium which sounds like Pink Floyd trying to play progressive metal - It is a very very good one. If you are a fan of them then this is a must buy - if you are new then this is also a good album and consider having and their previous albums and especially Images and Words - Awake - Train Of Thought. These albums are masterpieces. And the rest albums are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting compared to previous efforts","review":"I liked Awake... Images & Words... Scenes From a Memory... Six Degrees... Train of Thought was okay... but then we get to Octavarium. I listened to it once and found it in general to be supremely boring. One of my friends always comments that he doesn't like Dream Theater because while they can play like madmen, they don't really have any soul; usually, I disagree with that, but Octavarium strikes me as formulaic and just \\"we threw something together so people would buy it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ISN'T THE SAMPLES IN VELVET PANTS LIFTED FROM THE GROUPIES","review":"This seems to be a clear case of Propellerheads ripping off the famous 1969 The Groupes LP, where groupies talk about their lifestyle.

There are a few paragraphs of text on screens you have to tediously page through, that's it. No audio commentary, no little video profile of Rod Serling, no nothing. I even found the menu scheme annoying. I was constantly making the wrong selection even though there are only THREE options!

Those who rated this dvd low are those out there looking for conspiracy theories.

The dvd starts way back in 1980. The first program shows the events leading up to it, and stops on sept 10th. the second program takes you through the entire day of Sept 11. It takes you through every thing the terrorist plan and do that day. With real life accounts the events come together. I personally love the way they did the film, theres no unnessecary scenes of violence.

You'll read, and will doubtlessly recognize yourself somewhere in Broder's tales of tribulation and triumph set here in the wondrous urban armpit of our Great Nation, Cleveland. The best part is that these columns are presented chronologically, and in bite-size readings. So you can put it down whenever you like. Read a couple bits on the bus.

The shaft is so flimsy it will only go in the exaust vent tube as far as you can push by holding the back of the brush head. The shaft just kinks up if you try to push on it. The only thing the shaft can be used for is to pull the brush back out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it - waste of money","review":"Poor packaging results in two of the kit items to not be usable. The vacuum attachment is folded several times in order to fit in the packaging leaving permanent bends in the flat hose, as a result the hose collapses while trying to vacuum causing it to constantly clog up. The handle on the duct brush is rolled up in order to fit in the packaging box and will not straighten out after arrival, preventing the brush from going into the duct straight. The only good part of this kit is the cleaning brush which is flexible and has a long handle but this type of brush can be purchased from other venders for a lot less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time, money...","review":"Very disappointed in the design of the vacuum attachment.

I have the type of dryer where the lint tray is just behind the door. The lint trap vent brush works a little bit but only for large amounts of lint. The vacuum hose attachment was virtually useless, even using a vacuum with strong suction. They have to bend it to fit it in the box. When you unpack it the folds stay in the hose. You need to maneuver it around so the bend works with you. I didn't have much lint but it didn't even pick up what was there. I finally gave up and found another method. I suppose this unit would be good if you had a lot of lint, but it certainly wasn't close to the rave reviews I've seen about it picking up batteries and other items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider other options","review":"Just a quick review here.....Of the three items in the box you can only use two of them.The flexible tube for attaching to your vacuum and the short hand held tapered brush.The round brush that you attach to a drill is poorly designed and cannot be used right out of the box. The reason is the plastic they used for this item is not flexible, it has been twist tied to the box in a coil and there is no way to uncoil / straighten it out, thus rendering it unusable for cleaning out the dryer tube vent.I personally would suggest people to look for other options that buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacumn attachment worthless","review":"The flat attachment for vac. is useless.....vacumn won't pick up lint off my floor with it attached.....

As other reviewers have noted the flat piece is a stiff plastic that arrives bent to fit in the box. Sadly the bend marks compromise the suction by crimping the tubing permanently and makes it fairly ineffective. Add to the the center tip has a bar that catches lint, pet dander, etc and immediately blocks off- again, making it worthless.Needs to be redesigned to a flexible softer plastic that doesn't crimp and has better suction. Plus the part that connects into vacuum tube is too small and leaves more air gap that decreases suction.Too much money for just a couple of small brushes that might work cause the plastic vacuum piece is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I was interested in this book since I heard the author say she researched the Bilderberg Group for 8 years. Full disclosure, I'm only halfway in but instead of providing any illumination as to the Bilderberg Group agenda, besides the obvious (globalization) this follows a tired formula.But the worst part is what one reviewer correctly described as the tin-eared dialogue. In addition, there are the fanciful names, the lack of believable emotion or plot, and, again, the writing overall. This is just terrible; the writers who really did this well were LeCarre in The Spy who Came in from the Cold and Alan Furst provides some really nice writing to go with his spy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"I love spy thrillers, but this one fizzled out after a strong start. The writing was so poor starting about 100 pages in, I gave up soon after. Lynds repeatedly tells us what the character is feeling rather than showing us, and I hate that, it is a hallmark of poor fiction writing.The first several chapter though, were quite strong, and very reminiscent of Ludlum.

I have never heard such a horrible Bach. Or did Ma really know he was playing Bach?A few years ago, I went to Ma's live concert in Chicago for BWV 1008 1009 1012. I could not believe that he played them like MIDI music... But after I listened to this recording, I realized that he was actually growing better!To be honest, every time I went to his live concert, I was extremely disappointed. He is a good new age music player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best recordings of this music","review":"In this repertoire Fournier and Casals are both better; Rostropovich is best. To be fair, Ma is a world-class cellist who has produced some fine recordings. But here the young Ma must compete with masters, and these performances, made early in Ma's career, come up short. (A Yo-Yo Ma acolyte may, however, find much to enjoy in the viridity Ma's playing.) If you want another opinion, check Gramaphone Magazine's reviews online. Or buy all of these recordings as I have and compare for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD makes my life richer each time I listen to it.","review":"I have always found Bach to be tolerable, alright as background music for studying because it was not alive enought to distract me.However, When I heard Yo-Yo Ma playing these cello suites, I was truly moved. Each time I listen to it, the music draws me in and I ride on the waves of his cello. The performance feels so personal to me because occasionally, you can hear Yo-Yo Ma's breathing, sometimes sharp inhalation, sometimes drawn out- it creates an image in my mind of what he looks like and is feeling while he plays these pieces, and it takes me there too. This CD has made classical music come alive to me. It is a very personal, sensual CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, the standard for all Cello music","review":"This recording is the best solo cello albulm I have ever heard. It's fun to compare other artists, other insturments, and other recordings but you'll come back to this. Some will say Ma plays to aggressively, I disagree. Yo Yo Ma made a more mellow recording recently to satisfy those with weak hearts. This Bach Rocks. It's as good as it gets. If I could give this TEN stars I would. It's twice as easy and exciting to listen to than others. Of my entire collection of music it is the finest piece of pure music I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bach cello suites were played beautifully by Yo Yo","review":"If you are looking for first class performance of Bach Cello Suites, then you should buy this set of 2 CD from CBS.Don't hesistate, this set was released in the 1980s and may be out of print anytime.

I personally believe that the only way to truly experience such amazing 'cello music is through an amazing 'cellist, Mr. Pablo Casals. Only then can you really experience the beauty of a rarely noticed instrument playing a timeless classic.Mr. Ma stick to what you are good at, and let the professionals do the suites. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus recordings","review":"While these might be better than something you'd hear in a high school gym, they're hardly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically very pleasing, though not the best.","review":"It would be harsh - with such great exponents of these suites recorded before him, to compare Mr. Ma's playing with other great cellists.I agree that if you concentrate on the dances in the suites, you will find the best of Ma's interpretation. They are musical, soulful and beautiful. Elsewhere, like in Preludes, the required depth and nuance are some what missing. Listen to Rostropovich, for example, an immediate difference surfaces.Even so, a 4 star rating is still well-deserved, bearing in mind that Mr. Ma was not yet 30 years old when he recorded this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better performances available","review":"Although some would call this performance \\"straightforward,\\" it lacks the depth and richness of available recordings by Fournier, Casals, and Rostropovich. Before purchasing, take the time to listen to the Suite No. 1 Prelude of all four cellists. Whereas Fournier, Casals, and Rostropovich are movingly expressive, Yo-Yo Ma's is \\"on point\\" but lacking emotion.I wanted to buy this CD but had no performer in mind. I first chose Yo-Yo Ma just because I'd heard of him. After a quick review of other customer comments and my own test runs, I decided to buy Fournier, Casals, AND Rostropovich, just because I was excited to hear a familiar piece played so beautifully in three different ways. Note that Yo-Yo Ma didn't make the cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty","review":"Every time I listen to this beauful music, I am inspired by the the great beauty of his music.

Let me just say that this is everything music should be: profoundly moving, simultaneously cerebral and visceral, and timeless. With out a doubt, Bach is pure genius and Ma does these compositions justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Excellent Choice!","review":"The years that this set has remained in the catalogue attest for the level of interpretation and expertise that Yo-Yo Ma imbews here with these great \\"soulful\\" pieces. My first exposure to these works was this recorded set, and I certainly will say that I \\"struck it right\\" with this addition to my music collection. Are there better versions...? Well, there are other Interpretations, of course. But, from what I determine, Mr. Ma is playing Bach's music as written, with his own natural inflection, of course. Could you ask for more....not much! A Fine Recording Overall, Fine Interpretation, Fine Warm Ambiance (as it strikes me) as if Yo-Yo is playing these in your living room, just for the two of you. And I like this feeling a lot. Greatly Recommended. ~operabruin~I happened to see on Amazon here, that this set has been remastered, so I would think that the new set would be pretty nice!

One thing that I had a problem with was the rubber O-ring that is supposed to be set over the drain threads was too thick and it did not leave me enough threads to thread the pump on to the laundry sink. I did not use the O-ring, I just used a good amount of teflon tape and tightened it until it was snug. I had no leaks so apparently the O-ring is not necessary. My only suggestion for anyone who is installing it is to make sure you use the ball valve that is supplied with the pump so you can throttle the amount of waste water that is being pumped through the discharge pipe(the directions supplied show how to pipe in the pump with the ball valve and check valve). If you do not throttle the ball valve the pump will continuously cycle on and off.

Alfalfa comprises the bulk of my seed mixture.

The chord broke at the spot where it enters the handle after fraying cause by the rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, WEAR RUNNERS!","review":"A well made jump rope that really smarts when it smacks into your toes, feet or ankles. I usually train barefoot, but will wear my Nikes from here on. The weight is the beads along the cord, not in the handles. I was thinking there would be steel bar in the handles, but it is an empty cavity with slack cord which you can untie and alter the length. I suppose I could snip off a piece of rebar to fit inside there, but I was hoping it would come pre loaded. Still, good for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jump Rope","review":"This was the fourth jump rope that I'd bought in a year and I believe it will be the last. This jump rope is very sturdy and doesn't easily tangle. The weight in the rope is evenly distributed to give you a good rotation. My workout is more enjoyable now that I have a good jump rope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most durable rope on the market","review":"I love this item so much I just had to write about it. Have you ever used a rope and the beads are lightweight, your rope gets tangled, and feels way too light...NOT WITH THIS ROPE!!! The beads are structured so well, the rope is just as good in quality and NEVER does it tangle...has a good weight so that you still feel it a bit in your arms..The rope is also adjustable, pop off the cap on the handle pull the rope through and adjust it to your required length..9ft is a bit long for me..also once you adjust it and tie the rope again, the knot will not slip out as I found with other ropes where you have to constantly adjust it...I give these to my workout friends as presents and they are also hooked. I have 3 just in case they ever discontinue sell of them. Kudos to Harbinger for perfecting the jump rope....FINALLY :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top quality beaded rope","review":"This is an excellent jump rope. The beads are shaped a little differently and provide very uniform weight distribution. For a beaded rope, you can go really fast. Another nice feature is that the nylon string is stretchy, which makes it easier to adjust than a non-stretch string. You can achieve just the right length which provides the best weight distribution. I will point out that this rope is heavier than most beaded ropes (11 oz), so it might take a while to adjust to this. I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you work out daily/ serious user","review":"Too bad this nylon rope wears out and tears apart at the handle after a solid week of half hour work sessions. the beads fly out all over once broken and I collected them up and sent for replacement. i liked the weighted feel, and it was VERY comfortable to jump and run-rope with. So I even tried a replacement rope of the same brand and it broke again in just a week. I requested and got a refund for the 2nd rope failure.DO NOT BUY THIS ROPE-it's fun and enjoyable to use UNTIL it breaks. The failure of the nylon rope makes this a waste of money. TOO BAD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a month","review":"It's a nice jump rope but it already broke after a month! Beads flew everywhere!

Too short and lightweight for me to use at all. A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"beaded jump rope","review":"This rope has some decent weight to it making jumping easier and more rhythmic. Good for beginners like me. Beads take a beating and hold up fairly well ( so far ). I use the thing on concrete, but its probably not designed for that. Yes, the end caps on the handles do come off. However, they serve no purpose whatsoever. If you realy want the caps to stay on, super glue em. I'm out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Jump Rope","review":"This is nice, but a little long.

For example, I learned how ancient Egyptians lived and what they did in their everyday life. The book has a solid chapter about ancient Egyptian art. I was surprised at how many different types of art there were. Ancient Egyptians painted, weaved and made pots, statues and jars out of clay. They also made jewelry and large pots out of gold. I also learned about their burial chambers in the pyramids. They put paintings and all of their belongings in the tombs for use in their after lives. The pyramids are made of big stone blocks. Workers would move the heavy stone blocks into the shape of a pyramid. The book describes how the ancient Egyptians also built large ships and small canoes to go down the Nile River.

I ordered two pair of the skates for my daughters 7 and 9 for Christmas. Both of the boxes that the skates were in were damaged. One of them was torn open. It looked like I was shipped returns. The skates were suppose to come with a charm and only one had it. The box that was torn open, it looks like it had fallen out. Beacuse it was a Christmas present, I didn't have time to return them but felt bad to give them in such conditon. Especially since they were a brand new item. As far as the skates go, they are hard for them to put on by theirselves, so takes me awhile to put them both on,but they like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap skates, Buckles fall off when you try to fasten them","review":"These are so cheap the buckles fall off when you try to fasten them.

I was amazed at how much sound was blocked out--I was able to listen to my Sansa at about half the volume as with my old headphones. The reason for the two stars is that the wires lost connection right where the Tune Buds plug into the MP3 player after just a month of use. The cords really do seem terribly thin, and there is no stress reliever at the point where the wires lost connection. It's a pity, because this is otherwise a great product.By-the-way, Amazon was great about the problem. I just missed the return period, and I sent them an e-mail explaining the problem. They graciously agreed to take them back and give me a refund (although I'm still waiting for the refund, but I just sent them earlier this week.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's bass and not much else","review":"I've tried a lot of different earbuds before -- cheap ones they give away on airplanes or conferences, super high end ones, and ones in between. I must say that I can probably tolerate almost any pair thrown at me (although, of course, I do prefer some over the others). This is the first pair of earbuds I actually actively dislike -- there is weird artificial bass that is overemphasized to the point where it is distracting, almost like a pressure in your ear whenever anything on the lower end of the sound spectrum rolls around. Everything else sounds OK (I would say slightly muddled) but the bass just is horrible....."},{"rating":"1","title":"tinny cats on a hot tinny roof","review":"The sound from these is worse than the standard iPod headphones I already have. If I hadn't bought them in an airport, I would definitely have taken them back. On the plus side: the earbuds fit nicely and don't hurt or fall out, the cord is a nice cloth-like material, not plastic, so it feels especially durable, the design is cool and the mic/song advance button works perfectly with my iPhone. But the HUGE negative: the SOUND; it's all highs, no booming bass as the product description says. Very scratchy tinny sound forcing me to use the equalizer in the iPod to give some bass to the music. This then eats up battery and so I hate doing it, and hate switching the equalizer back to normal for any other way of listening. Not a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound ! No Volume Control ( so not a full replacement )","review":"I've used Tunebuds back in 2005 so I knew I wouldn't expect any less that great sound quality and comfort.Pro- great sound ( Deep quality bass )- great comfort- looks great- It's black- Lanyard wire- Also, you don't have to turn your iPod/iPhone up anymore than half in any usual environmentCon- Doesn't have volume control.The only thing I could see as dangerous is not being as aware of your environment but thats the risk with all in-ear product.I'm very accustom now to having the volume control on the wire so that might take getting use to.I love them, and I'm sure you will love them too.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for money","review":"I had a similar problem as a lot of the reviewers with these headphones at first - the sound was very \\"tinny\\" and even hurt my ears at times. I was just about to go and return them, when I pushed them a bit further in to my ears. The sound improved drastically. There is no \\"tinny\\" sound now and the bass is significantly more audible. They are meant to be inserted all the way in the ears to block outside noise, and do not perform well otherwise.Overall, these headphones are great sound quality for the price. I have not owned them long enough to know how they fair over time, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lows!!!! Terrible sound!","review":"I expected these to be pretty good based on the other reviews. There were plenty of highs, but NO LOWS at all! Absolutely no bass.

Most of the time all mine did was slop a lot of solution everywhere. Sometimes it would make one bubble that would float a couple feet & die. I would advise caution in one respect if you do decide to buy one of these. The bubbles consist of a lot of solution & one popped on my 4 year old nephew & he got it in his eyes which stung enough to make him cry. The lack of it creating bubbles was even more disappointing to him. Personally I don't think there are any good bubble makers out there. The latest toy I bought for my nephew starts out fun but ends up making a huge mess after about 10 minutes of using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bubble wand ever!","review":"I originally bought this to use on a television commercial that required big bubbles. I tried several other bubble wands/machines etc and this one is by far the best. The bubbles are huge and lasting and we've used several different commercial solutions and they have all worked for us. Everyone who has seen it wants one... which may be why they are sold out at the moment. I am hoping to order more cos I think they would make fantastic gifts. I wouldn't recommend them for small children (and some adults) as you need to be careful re-inserting the wand (it has a small opening)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professor Bubbles Doesn't Work After Solution is Gone!","review":"My daughter got this from the Easter Bunny this year.

Domingo's performance is, as usual, outstanding. Although the opera lacks any tenor arias, Domingo passionately and beautifully expresses his voice throughout the opera like no other (his opening to \\"Bevo al tuo fresco sorriso\\" is phenominal).

It is very liquid and not much scent. However, it did not work on two old stains, a small yellow grease stain and a blotch of chocolate stain. They do not appear changed or lighter after 3 tries.

I used it to try to get rid of some perspiration stains and to treat the inside collar of a shirt, by soaking in Soilove before putting the shirts in the laundry. Unfortunately no effect on removing the stains.Update - After my first try (above), I went through the process one more time, let it soak longer, and the stains actually dissolved. This product is pretty amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"practical, non-high tech steps","review":"An interesting aspect of this book is how it often advises you to improve your photos of items you're selling on eBay. Not by image enhancement via Photoshop, as so many other books do. Instead, it recommends trying simple steps in the real world, that might actually be faster than several hours in front of your computer. For example, if you have a black, shiny item, then polish it so that smudges and fingerprints are not visible in the photo. And take that photo against a white background, for high contrast.This is the general tenor of the book. Practical, non-high tech steps. A good counterpoint to other eBay books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"I didn't dislike anything...It was just not a good product. Basically nothing useful in it for Ebay or Etsy.

Holt book I've read and I might not make it all the way through. It's colossally stupid and I get the impression that the author read a few paragraphs about silk somewhere and tried to make it fly as a plot. It could have been a good plot but the characters and situations are so far from authentic, the dialogue is awkward and often pointless, and the plot is beyond predictable. The one good thing about this book is that it is so massively amateurish yet obviously popular that I think I might just have a career in writing romance novels. They couldn't be any worse than this.

The Justice Department, unfortunately, whitewashed the FBI's actions with a \\"nobody did anything wrong\\" report. Nevertheless, the contrast between evidence supported by facts, and the slanted foolishness of this video, is astonishing.

This, along with the coroner reports (in public domain) of the Davidians show that they all died behind a brick wall with single shots to the head. This was ruled as suicide, seeing as how it would be impossible for Federal agents to fire through a brick wall and hit each of them in the head without missing a single shot.Thus, this documentary is slander against the US government and lies about the tragic fate of the Branch Davidians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Informative","review":"With the exception of the tracking on the VHS tape, its still a great video.

Bruno Wollheim made two documentaries about him in a very straightforward way. It's clear to the viewer that it's just Wollheim with his camera trying to capture what Hockney does - but without placing himself between us and the artist. Wollheim doesn't say: look at me making a film, he says: look at Hockney making his paintings from life. In other words: look at Hockney looking at landscapes (or people). Wollheim followed Hockney closely and thanks to his work we can watch along with him. If you like A Bigger Picture, you might also want to see 'David Hockney: Double Portrait' by the same director.

The orchestra is the Gewandhaus, outstanding musicians, in the truly german tradition. One minor fault for some listeners can be the slow, relaxed tempi choiced by the Thomaskantor.

I think I will either throw it away or give to the library. This is not worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly sung performance.","review":"From the opening Kyrie it's clear this work is beyond the technique of the choir. The boy sopranos and altos sing with poor intonation and feeble, unsupported tone. The tenors and basses fare better but their tone is what you would expect from such young singers barely beyond voice change. Views of the choir reveal singers sharing copies of the music!

The side material is sheer cotton, but I have had no issues with it as some of the negative reviewers have. It is far superior to the elastic material you find on most deep pads. And the product is made in the USA, so by purchasing it you are helping folks out in this country rather than sending money and jobs overseas.\\"So, I purchased a second. The product has changed. The styling is different and it is now lower quality. Instead of cotton, the sides are now the papery-thin material described by other reviewers.

My wife, a RN, compared this material to the disposable paper gowns used in the hospital. Actually, you can poke your finger right through it. I've used several different mattress pads over the years and have never experienced such a problem. So far the pad is on the bed with the ripped corner. Because of the flimsy material used in the side panels, however,I'm not sure that the rip can be sewn.

But why is she so important to them? What secrets does she hold? McGowan would like to know, but she's not talking.What we're talking about here is an adventure, a spy/military/political thriller, and first and foremost, an action novel penned with a gift for the mode by author Jack Allen - so much so that this novel might easily translate into one of the action flicks Hollywood is so fond of turning out.If you are a fan of spy novels or action flicks, take Allen's \\"A Change of Heart\\" out for a spin.

Clean up is easy and with the easily removeable handle , it is easily stored. The glass lid allows viewing while the food is cooking, this is another plus.

However, I have the following problem each time I've tried to cook something with it:It heats up quickly, but once the dialed in temperature is reached it shuts off power.

The pan is either on (high) briefly or it turns itself off, too hot for an egg and doesn't stay on long enough for safe reheats.

I was raised on Mozart adagios and Beethoven symphonies. When I came across this album in my parents collection not long ago, I began to listen quite avidly to it. The \\"Air on G String from Orchestral Suite 3, BWV 1068\\" is quite probably my favorite JS Bach pieces (probably due to its usage in \\"End of Evangelion\\") and the \\"Canon in D\\" has long inspired emotional scenes in my novels. While I'm sure many disagree, I find other recordings of the piece less emotional from my experience.I rarely listen to the second half of the CD (my favorites are in the first quarter of the album), but all are relaxing and have excellent tone. The one piece I do not enjoy is the Vivaldi's Lute Concerto in D. For some reason, the sound of a classical guitar doesn't lull me into relaxation.Overall, a very relaxing CD with great voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the seeker","review":"A good book for the seeker it was very informative and easy I recommended it to beginners and those who need to brush up on there skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book for interpreting tarot spreads!","review":"Leo Louis Martello has written a wonderful, easy to understand book on understanding and interpreting tarot spreads.

The incessant repetitions, and long slow builds, brilliantly tie together the atonalities, and the screeching \\"Dorothy's flying monkeys\\" vocalizations. The effect creates a multiplicity of layers of imagery. It can either be a very exciting work, or an annoying one. If you're working on a sculpture or painting, it's great background.

This post-Stalin work is a statement to the horrors of that dictator's era, and the 2nd movement 'a capella' will take your breath away! The Kabalevsky Concerto is a very intriguing work by a little-known composer.

The lack of an index, or any way to use all the maps together, and the fact that the maps are very incomplete, make it very annoying to use. Add to this that there is an almost explicit LACK of information or routes for any of the peaks, and one wonders why one bought the book at all. There is no route to the top of Square Top Peak, nor over Dinwoody Pass, or up to Gannett. Even the non-technical peaks are omitted. There is also no \\"About the Author\\" section (although it says that there is one), and this is important when one is going to rely on him to guide you into the Wind River Range."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pain to use","review":"This guide book is a pain to use. Mainly because of the poor maps. The hiking guide is organized by trailheads, but the overview maps that are given do not cover a large enough area to plan a 4 or 5 day trip, which is the main reason I bought this book. I find myself flipping from section to section trying to piece together the trails in my mind. I've bought many other Falcon guides, and have been happy with all the rest. Since I know of no Wind River alternative guidebook, I bet you'll probably still buy this; I would, it does have some good info. But, I recomend buying a Wind River map while your at it, or use some sort of computerized map (google earth)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I have found this guide to hiking in the Wind River Mountains to be very informative.

Notre Dame, without question, is the poster child for college football. Even though the program has been dormant for the better part of 20 years, the Fighting Irish still command attention.

Frankly, nothing bothers me more than listening to music on my iPod via my really high quality car stereo without it sounding like I've got a burlap bag over my head, just like the one from Missing in Action -- in fact, the only shortcoming of this awesome device is that it doesn't come with a hungry rat that'll gnaw your face off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another warning to potential buyers","review":"While adding another \\"do not, do not, do not buy this thing\\" is redundant, it should be immediately clear to anyone thinking this device works as advertised that it obviously does not. I purchased this and returned it within two hours after trying it for my commute. While it was attached to my iPod, the backlight stayed on which at first I thought was a weird feature, but then it it would go off for couple seconds and jump right back on. Occaisionally tracks would skip for no apparent reason.

Going to Griffin Technology's support page and digging a bit, I found this:SmartDeck SupportWhy isn't it working in my car?We went to great lengths to make the SmartDeck compatible with as many cassette players as possible, including factory and after market decks. Unfortunately, there are cassette players that will not work with the SmartDeck. If your SmartDeck is not working in your cassette player, please try it in another cassette player before contacting us. If the SmartDeck works in other cassette players, you may have a player that is not compatible.(...)So be forewarned.

Amazingly enough, it arrived yesterday. I was really hoping to have the shuffle controls on my steering wheel. What a huge dissapointment. Aside from the fact that the controls didn't have ANY affect on the IPOD mini 4GB (as in Zero control), the normal operation noise coming from the cassette adapter was louder than any regular cassette I have ever played. The device practically screamed compared to the rest of the noise level in the car.I will return the SmartDeck, sadly, as it offered great promise but didn't turn out to be so Smart. My next car will have the IPOD integration from the factory, so until then, I'm back to my regular cassette adapter that came with my old XM Car Adapter kit.

It just spins arond in the cassette deck for about 10 seconds, trys to fast-forward, then ejects itself. Very dissapointing.I find it somewhat misleading that the company clearly states that the device does not work in some vehicles, yet does not publish a known list of cars it works/doesn't work with.

It came today, just before I was to head out on a long road trip.Guess what? It doesn't work. I press the forward and reverse buttons on the tape deck (a basic Ford stereo) and I hear bzzzzz. I get it to play again, and it either does nothing or goes to the beginning of the selection. Clicking the little button on the cassette doesn't change things.The only good thing is that it seems to pause the iPod when you eject the cassette, then start it up again when you insert it again. That's it.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning the thing (waiting in line at the Post Office). How could this happen? Shame on Griffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Blows","review":"Enough said. Bought a second one because I figured the first one must have been an anomaly. Wrong. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I purchased this cassette adapter to replace the iPod FM transmitter I had been using, because the FM signal was weak and would sometimes fade out. The SmartDeck is far worse. The sound resulting from this adapter is very distorted, from what appears to be severe overmodulation.

It's okay; I got about nine months of use out of it.The use, however, was disappointing. It doesn't do the fast forward/skipping business AT ALL. Okay, about one in ten times, which is enough to dissuade me from even bothering.The ONLY useful thing about this adapter is the automagic pause feature. If I turned off the stereo in my car, it would pause the iPod. Which is useful if you want to just put it on hold and stick in your bag.If you're willing to pay for that feature, then do it.

Their radio adaptors for the iPod are the best around. This product, on the other hand, is complete junk. From the moment you open the package, you can feel the flimsiness of the product. After inserting it into my tape deck, it sounded as if the tape was constantly being fast forwarded. The sound was absolutely horrible. I have been using a tape adaptor from the early nineties that sounded much better (made by sony.) The sound was completely distorted. No controls worked to do anything to the music (FF / RW) I feel that this product has tarnished Griffin's reputation in my eyes, and I am not sure if I will purchase a product from them again. Its like they did not care at all, but rather just wanted my money. BTW, I would give this product zero stars if I could..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it worked!","review":"I'm sorry to say I'm really underwhelmed with the SmartDeck. I pre-ordered mine at Griffin as soon as I heard about it at Macworld in early 2005 and received it last week, nearly a year later.The Skip and Scan features simply do not work. My car's tape player sometimes spits it out when it's inserted. The sound response is ok on the bass, but the mid and high levels leave a lot to be desired. (The Sony tape adapter that came with my Discman when I got it, oh, 7 years ago, sounds much better.)About the only feature that works as advertised is that it turns my iPod on/off when the tape player is turned on/off. I also noticed that If I fast forward my tape (not skip it) and then hit play after about 5 seconds, it *sometimes* skips to the next song.I'll be returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to other user's reviews!!","review":"I pre-ordered the Griffin SmartDeck two months ago and it really seemed like a good and inexpensive alternative to having my Infiniti factory radio modified. About a week ago I read other user's reviews and sadly dismissed their opinion thinking how bad could this product be?

This would be more annoying, if you could hear it over the god awful hum coming from your speakers. Honestly, I never even checked whether the song skipping/seeking worked properly; I couldn't get past the abysmal sound quality. Play/pause did seem to work as advertised, but that's not worth paying double (or more) the cost of adapters with higher sound quality.This is a fantastic idea that's been horribly implemented.

This team gives the performances fire and spirit. Graffman later premiered the Second Piano Concerto of my brother, composer Benjamin Lees, and again the verve and dynanism of his playing was thrilling.

Pero tengo que ser sincero es completamente incomparable, la interpretacion en el caso de estos conciertos es imparable, fluida, exquisita y soberbia por decirlo en una forma clara.Los conciertos estan interpretados con estricto rigor y con mayor virtuosismo del esperado, son geniales, la orquesta suena esplendida y Graffman se entrega con todo para brindarnos lo mejor.Incluso se incluye una sonata para dejar en claro la calidad de este gran pianista.Szell es un director de rigor y su orquesta es sensacional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version nearly unreadable","review":"Just about the time you get to relaxing and get into the story, another incomprehensible typo jangles the storyline.

The box/manual never confirms it has or not, but it has the notation \\"--\\". The 2 dashes tell me nothing. I called their support - 1st, not sure. 2nd try - it doesn't support A/V input. I went on and ask what's the A/V input for - he (support) said I don't know.

I put movies, mainly children's movies, on SD cards and let the children watch them in their bedrooms or in the car while traveling. The movies are ripped in the Divx format. The only problems I have encountered are:1. it sometimes would unexpectedly terminate the movie before the end,2. if I try to fast forward the movie, it sometimes freezes up and a reboot is required. However, this may have something to do with the speed of the memory chips instead of being the problem of the machine,3. It does not work with SDHC cards such as cards of 8 GB.I have bought two of them in the past. The battery of one gives me about 1 hour and 15 minutes of viewing time. The other one only works for about 1/2 hour.Overall, I give it 4 stars. Its strong points are:1. very reasonable price,2. works with SD cards and USB and with many video formats.James Lee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass it by if you need to play from flash memory!","review":"Well, I initially wrote a favorable review on this unit, but after having used it now for a week or so, and having experienced how well it works with AVI files on the USB flash memory, I'm not much impressed and dissapointed. I was hoping for something better. This player will not read a USB flash drive larger than 4 GB. Also, higher quality AVIs don't play well. They become blocky, and digitized like the processor can't keep up. Even on the AVIs that seem easier for it to read, the motion is still jerky, and not smooth like a disc. I primarily needed this unit to play from a flash drive, and since it turns out to be 50/50, hit or miss, I have to advise anyone to pass this player by if you need to play from flash memory, and not the DVD ROM.

It comes with all the needed accessories.My only complaint is the case is made of lightweight plastic but you can't expect everything for the price I paid. I did get the extended warranty for only about $12.00 so In case it does break easily i am covered.

Play resume function didn't seem to work reliably when powering off the unit. Had to turn the volume up to the max to hear it over the noise of the plane.

It is very hard to find any warranty information on this thing, but it is 90 days. Coincidence!? I don't think so.

The heroine is of course tough yet tender, cliched ever-so-talented gal artist in a wealthy family of strong cliched men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Lowell is GREAT","review":"I loved the characters in Amber Beach. The way they interacted with each other added to the story. I also liked the fact that romance was not the only theme in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A snappy twist","review":"Elizabeth Lowell save what otherwise would have been a slow, used plot with the quick and clever repartee of her characters. Honor is a desperate woman, on a quest for her brother. But she finds time along the way to trade insults and extremely fast-paced innuendo with Jake Mallory, who has an ulterior motive for helping her search.At the end, whether or not you like the characters, and whether or not you are bored to tears by the plot, you will find a number of very quotable lines to add to your repetoir, and maybe a book to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissertation on amber, boats and fishing...","review":"That's what I felt like this book was, with a bit of hot sex thrown in. Disappointed because Lowell can do so much better. At least this book was a bit better than 'Jade Island', but not by much. If you want to learn IN EXCRUTIATING DETAIL about amber, boats and fishing then read this book otherwise don't bother. (Same goes for 'Jade Island' EXCRUTIATING DETAIL about jade and Chinese culture, plus offensive dialogue) If you want GOOD Lowell material, go back and read her \\"Only\\" or \\"Untamed\\" series, they are MUCH better and believe it or not they have some ROMANCE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new Lowell is one of the best","review":"I have read nearly all of Lowell's books under this name and Maxwell. And this has got to be the best of the lot. I will admit that it follows a similar format to several others she has written, but that is secondary. In this story, we learn a great deal about amber, and hopefully in the sequel, we will lean just as much about jade. Her characters have a loveable quality that keeps me turning the pages long after I should have the light out. The only problem I have with recent authors, and Lowell is included in this, is the unnecessary use of certain swear words. Now, I am not a prude by any means, but I do feel that certain things don't have to be in print when they belong in the trash! I am counting the weeks until Jade Island is released. I only wish I could review books like this for the publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found E. Lowell's newest book \\"Amber Beach\\" refreshing!","review":"I've read several of Elizabeth Lowell's books, and I'm pleased to see she tried something different. She used humor with suspense. The dialog brought the character's (Honor and Jake) personalities in tune with one another. I can't wait for her to write another book about Kyle or one of Honor's other brothers. I'll be looking for it! Great Job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"I am hopeless college student and have been an Elizabeth Lowell fan for almost five years. I usually can't put down her books. I bought this book about a month ago and still haven't finished it. There is definitely something wrong here. I am used to her characters being deeper more mature than these characters were. Hopefully, her next one will be a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boats and Fishing ?!","review":"This book definitely is a BORE ! all throughout the book it tells the reader how to do this and that with a boat. The lesson in amber is good but i think the book became a flop because of too much emphasis on learning how to run a boat and how to fish..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Elizabeth Lowell","review":"Like other reviewers, I have read many if not most of Elizabeth Lowell's works. This book was not up to her usual standard. The plot was labrinthine, the romance limited, and the characters boring. I'd rather reread the \\"Only\\" series than this tripe. Get it from the library rather than shelling out good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Elizabeth Lowell style book this is not!!","review":"I have loved Elizabeth Lowell and her writing for years and have every one of her books except for one that is out of print. What was she thinking?? This is the first hard back book I have EVER bought and could not wait to spend my $22.00. What a disapointment!! The characters are shallow and the plot is tiresome. When I buy an Elizabeth Lowell novel I expect romance and unique love scenes, this book is lacking on both accounts! Please Elizabeth write what we have come to love and expect, instead of going \\"main stream\\" to please the mass market. If you want a true Lowell love story pass on this and go for the \\"ONLY\\" series, you'll have your socks knocked off and spend less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamy Action thriller","review":"International chase for missing person and valuable amber.

Excellent reading with lively plots to keep the reader interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first but not the last","review":"This is the first of the series. I've listened to this series many times and enjoy it more and more each time. The plot is great and the characters are colorful and well developed. When you finish one you can't wait to get the next one. I especially like the way characters from pervious books make appearances in subsequent books. This seems to be an original trait of Elizabeth Lowell's and one that makes this series easy to listen to over and over again. I listen to many suspense/mystery/romance series, but this one is without any doubt my absolute favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I didn't like this series,","review":"I probably stand alone with my review of this book but I didn't like this series. I thought the story was predictable and boring. I was very disappointed. As a rule, I enjoy most books written by Elizabeth Lowell just not this series. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"The dialogue is so full of cliches, I struggled to make it through this one. As other reviewers have stated, the amber story line was hard to follow, and the characters were so un-realistic. What was supposed to have been clever banter between our hero and heroine left me feeling embarrassed for an author who has such a pathetic perception of wit. I bought this and the sequel on the same day, so I tried Jade . . . something or other . . . next. SAME REACTION! Same characters, new names. Same dialogue, absence of wit. BIG disappointment times two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too much boat detail...","review":"After reading the review (not from readers) I was very disappointed in the storyline. Much too much detail and repitition about the operation of boats, tying of knots, how much gasoline the tanks hold, etc., etc. Is this a mystery, love story, suspense story or a book about boats?? When I purchased this book, I also purchased Jade Island...I hope I did not waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same old low fat advice which only increases BS levels!","review":"I cannot fathom why the medical field along with dietitians continue to advise diabetics to eat low fat and to eat grains and fruit. Any experienced diabetic who tests regularly knows that the only true way to lowering blood sugar levels is to eat low carb (and NOT low fat). As a calorie is a calorie, so is a carb a carb as far as a most diabetics go. Obviously a serving of broccoli is better than one of cake, however, intake of carbohydrates will raise blood sugars (it depends on portion). This is simplified however, new diabetics, your best bet is to test, test, test. I guarantee, you will see lower numbers when you eliminate most bread, pasta, and keep fruit portions tiny. You will also stop having carb cravings and lose weight. Bottom line, look at labels and account for all carbs (not just sugar)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"If you're looking to learn how to play songs from Are You Experienced, you're better off buying Andy Aledort's \\"Jimi Hendrix - A Step By Step Breakdown of His Guitar Styles and Techniques\\" book and CD for [PRICE]. The problem with this DVD is that while Andy obviously knows his stuff, he spends less than 5 minutes per song (they cram all 17 songs into 2 hours) and there's no real \\"analysis\\" of how to even play it. What's worse is that there's no on-screen transcription of what Andy is playing -- he just plays and you're expected to mimic what you see. You might as well get a Hendrix concert DVD and learn from that. A better idea would have been to package the book I mentioned above with this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play along with Jimi","review":"If you are interested in playing all the music from Hendrix' first album \\"Are You Experienced\\", then this DVD will show you how. All the chords, riffs and solos are taught at tempo and also slowed down so you won't miss a thing. Good for all levels but especially suited for intermediate level guitar players. I guarantee you'll be saying to yourself \\"so THAT's how he did it!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent content. Stronger visual aids could have made it 5 stars","review":"I felt Andy's coverage of the actual playing parts was excellent, and I was fine with Velvert's narrative. The DVD is generous in terms of the number of songs it covers, which goes far beyond to song list from the US release of AYE? What would have put it to 5 stars for me is what is missing:- Tab, or at least basic chord charts would have been extremely useful. Both of these could have been provided as e.g. pdf content on the disk.- I would loved to have heard more insight from Andy on the material, and his choices of equipment and specific settings for each song. Nice Hendrix tribute Strat, Andy. Sounded great!- A written transcript of the narrative, since it contained some good explanations on the musical underpinnings of the songs' constructionStill, for anybody trying to get their head around how all of that wonderful noise can possibly be produced by a single (talented) player, this is a great learning asset."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much money","review":"I bought this DVD to accompany the tab book I already have. Whereas tabs are note for note, this DVD presents the BARE SKELETON of the songs. You won't play like Hendrix, you will play a dumbed down version that does not do Hendrix justice. I have the Electric LadyLand DVD and it is way more informative, illustrative, and you play LIKE HENDRIX-NOTE FOR NOTE! I returned this DVD, it's too much money, and the lessons often are shorter than the song they are supposed to \\"teach.\\" It's horrible...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better!!!! Waste of $50!!BUY THE BOOK!!!","review":"I should have listened to some of the bad reviews. One review said that they spend about 5 minutes per songs. I think it's more like 4. They don't \\"Teach\\" you anything. They just show you how Jimi played the song. Thats great and all but I'm not Jimi Hendrix. I would like to learn how to play like him, but the DVD does not teach. It actually gets annoying after a while because Velvert Turner, just keeps saying. Jimi then does this, Jimi then does that. Like I said before I'm not Jimi. The guitarist that plays the guitar to show you what Velvert Turner is talking about, just plays. I have to constantly play the DVD in slow motion but then I can't hear the sound. I hate this product. I also bought the book because the book has the TAB's and sheet music for the songs. The Book is excellent. I wish I had never bought the DVD, I spent $50 and I can't return it.

The movie drags on for ever. To us rowers, it is a known fact, that rowing skills shown by actors in motion pictures are mostly horrible. (The only capable actors were M.Streep and G. Davis.) Besides having made some pocket change back then as an extra, I am VERY HAPPY that NO ONE (in the small world of rowing) can tell that I was even remotely part of this failed attempt to portray a phenomenal Olympic effort.XENO"},{"rating":"1","title":"its not the rowing that sucks","review":"A lot of rowers comment on the horrible technique of the actors who portray this Olympic level rowers. Hey, its not just that. Its the whole movie. The acting is baaad... the story line is baaad... Its not interesting at all! It gives the sport a horrible image cause, hey, the movie is dull as my scissors. The most exciting part of the film for me is when they showed the Montreal basin (I row there). I watched it simply for kicks tonight and unfortunately, will have to pay for it with my early 6am row tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flawed effort","review":"As a former oarsman, this film is a major disappointment. While visually stunning, it suffers from a major flaw: none of the actors can row at a level anywhere close to the one they are supposed to be at. As a result, despite grunting and grimacing, they cannot convey the true spirit of the sport: the combination of pain, power and grace. Besides making the story difficult to believe, it also prevents the director from getting us into a \\"rowing rhythm\\" as what would otherwise be flowing scenes must be shortened and edited to avoid showing too many obvious \\"crabs\\". Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"The Amateurs\\" instead","review":"I guess things must balance out for Tiff Wood. After having his Olympic efforts being beautifully chronicled by David Halberstam in \\"The Amateurs\\", he is portrayed as a childish, selfish buffoon in this pointless movie. The novice level rowing aside, this movie makes \\"Oxford Blues\\" look like \\"Chariots of Fire\\" or \\"Breaking Away\\" as far as a well made, inspiring sports movie. Unfortunately, I know of no decent rowing movie that has been made. \\"A Fine Balance\\" by Brad Lewis is a very good film but it is a documentary.To summarize, the rowing is terrible, one develops no affection for any of the characters, and the historical facts are skimmed over. Brad Lewis, the only main character in Halberstam's book to win an Olympic gold medal, is mentioned only as \\"Paul Enquist's partner\\". I consider Mr. Lewis one of the lucky ones in this regard. Save your money and read the book instead. Or you can have my DVD copy for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book.

Having read the original and liked its quirky, flawed movements, I am now absolutely savoring this rewrite. It is a full novel, rounded and studded with unforgettable characters like the elderly Jessie (the car driving scene - the long one - isi sidesplittingly funny), the romantic but wise Lou, and of course the charming and lovely young Willie, whom we all know out there somewhere, the eternal boy-man. Oh it's all pure delight. Fey to the naysayers! A perfect read for the intelligent reader who doesnt need a Hollywood plot or a pat ending. I will not,howvever, be satisfied until Anne writes a sequel to Rae's character in Rosie. We need the Rae book, Annie! We honestly do.

The characters themselves are the sort of lovable, messy types Anne often writes about. The problem is the lack of structure in this wildly uneven work.

If you're a fan, find it in a library and read it for completeness, but don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Lammot's Best Yet!","review":"I loved this book.

I kept reading it thinking that even if nothing happened I would get involved with the characters and cherish the description of their everyday lives but that didn't happen. The writing was just too abstract and.... weird. The characters had some off-kilter characteristics about them that should have been lovable but I just didn't find endearing. Things weren't explained that should have been explained and things that I didn't care about were expanded upon.

I like how it protects the clickwheel, which other cases apparently don't. I've had this case for a month with the front cover on backwards, so I had to press down really hard to get the clickwheel to work. They should include instructions or a diagram on the back of the box so users will know which way the front cover goes.

I know people who join the opus dei, and they can be nice or stupid, but there's no place for mafia and CIA members, cold-blooded killers. Maybe in 80 years there is, but not now.

The story follows a number of people caught up in the various sides of the Drug War, a DEA agent, coke traffickers call girl, mafiosos and a priest.

My congratulations to any masocist that managed to read this entire book, I managed a few hundred pages, started skipping ahead and quickly saw that it never improved.Don, whoever you are, whereever you are, come back and write another novel like, CF&L.; Until then give up on this crusade or whatever it is regarding the Vietnam war and the drug war, it just ain't interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, I have to read it again!!","review":"I wish I had started a scorecard on page one. When the author is throwing so many characters at you you don't know which ones are important or just peripheral to the main protagonists. I also didn't realize how much of the underpinnings of the story center on real life events and the political climate of the time. It is also very hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Or, should I say, the bad guys from the truly evil guys. When each evil-doer has no qualms about double-tapping a friend or foe it is really hard to \\"bond\\" with any of them. It was a little bit like the very violent stories of Charlie Houston. It was still a wild ride and I would highly recommend it.

The novel covers thirty years, thirty years in the Mexican drug trade and US interdiction told through Art Keller a DEA agent, Barrera brothers, drug lords, Nora Hayden, a teenage call girl and Sean Callan a cold Boston hit man.

I've bought other books on Russia that explained the change from communism to capitalism but they only told how it affected the government. I wanted to know how it affected the people. This book does that. Although there is a lot of text, there are a lot of pictures. Between the two, it tells the story. The only thing is I wish it was more recent. It was published in 2001. I'm sure some more recent stories have been put out by the author in the National Geographic Magazine. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in Russia and geography."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong focus!","review":"No doubt, Gerd Ludwig is a very talented photographer. However the Russia he shows is packaged to fit expectations of a clueless Westerner. Ludwig shows the disgusting reality, the poverty, and philistine Russian entrepreneurs to contrast all this. A perfect photojournalistic essay!Ludwig is himself clueless. By bringing up all the dirt he forgets that Russians are much more complex than his ugly pictures. Russians know that they live in substandard material conditions! However the drama is that their will power is so exceptionally strong that they are able to ignore the dirt in life, and enjoy its most wonderful moments: a beautiful sunset, a meadow full of flowers, a pretty cloud. Where is all that in this book? Instead, we see a hustly society that's struggling to be like the West with some dubious success."},{"rating":"1","title":"crushed in transport","review":"The table was the last in stock at the time, and arrived crushed into splinters on several large edges.

One table came with instructions for a mission bench (not the table). Unfortunately, I was told that the table is no longer stocked in the honey finish so the vendor is having UPS pick both damaged tables up from my home (free of charge).The quality of the table is not high, but it is attractive for a play table.

But the true gems are the other songs of the album.\\"Helpless Automation\\" is a song composed and sung by Greg Ham, the keyboard player. The vocals are nice, and the song goes in a nice mood. \\"Touching the Untouchables\\" has a sensational Sax solo, and a nice rhythm that goes along with the chorus. The last track \\"Down by the Sea\\" is a nice and mellow ballad, the colses the album perfectly.Men at Work was a great band that never was afraid of trying new things and mixing all kinds of sounds.

I was present at their Universal Amphitheater concert during one of the first weeks this album was number one, and I saw a group of guys completely taken aback, but genuinely appreciative towards our applause and enthusiasm.In retrospect, their first album is world-class pop music. It had a definable, unique sound...borrowed from a few sources, sure, but gelling into a wholly original package. The singles were marvelous radio singalongs, but the rest of the album has variety, depth and some impressive musicianship!The remastering has resulted in the crisp sonic reproduction of a sound that will take you back twenty years, in the time span of a sax break.

They rock by way of Sting and the Police, with less-obvious reggae influences, less grit, more humility (and kook), and more showmanship (i.e. a few too many keyboards). But they rock well, very well, even, most of the time. Hay's lyrics are pointed, impressive, almost poignant on \\"I Can See It in Your Eyes.\\" Bandmembers Greg Ham, who plays the woodwinds and brass instruments (!), and Ron Strykert, the guitarist, contribute similarly effective songs. Hay's meandering, nonsensical \\"Catch a Star\\" isn't worth much, but don't underestimate the value of the rest of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"While I did not read its predacessor \\"formally the justice league\\" I had no trouble following the joke behind this. Like most comics I enjoy this book contains characters that are under used and under appreciated on the whole, and they are funny. I am disappointed only by the fact that three of the main characters in this, Sue Dinby, Blue Beetle, and Max Lord are all now dead. And others have gone into space (Guy), joined the justice League (power girl), gone a little crazy (Elongated man), or have devolved into the most hateable super hero ever (Booster Gold).This is the last time any of these characters will be able to be funny, and that is a little disappointing.

W/ this Eddie Bauer carrier, the tightening straps don't stay tight!! They slip down and I end up tying the ends in a knot behind my back. The head support comes too far down to support my baby's head and even now when he's comfortable holding his head up, I still have to support it myself w/ my hand.

Save your money and don't buy this product... put it towards something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This carrier had some nice features, such as the great lower back support and padded straps. However, the adjustments on back/shoulder straps would not stay in place, regardless of the weight of our baby. We were constantly having to adjust the straps to bring the baby back up to a comfortable level.

I use my Baby Bjorn ALL THE TIME now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Mom in NY","review":"I gave this carrier only 1 star for 2 reasons. First, it's a hastle to put on and an even bigger hastle to get our baby into. There are 2 clips to strap the carrier to yourself and 4 to strap your baby into. Babies aren't the most patient people so be prepared! Second, my baby hated it. Every time we'd put him in it (no matter what mood he was in to begin with) he'd scream his little head off. We tried different adjustments - nothing seemed to work - except for taking him out of it.We haven't tried other carriers yet but we're still looking for the perfect one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it.","review":"Once I finally figured out how to strap this thing on, using the multiple page instruction booklet, I thought, \\"This better be worth it.\\" It wasn't. I mean, how many straps and snaps does it take?! Then once you've got it on, you've got to be Houdini to get it off! I couldn't wait to get out of that contraption. I have twins and tried them both in it. Neither liked it facing either direction. It was so stiff that I needed to use one hand to stabilize their heads to keep them from bopping back and forth. The fabric was also too rough on their little legs and arms. Plus, there was no real comfortable place for them to put their arms - too high, or too low. They both hated it. After trying it multiple times, I just gave up and returned it. I bought it because it was Eddie Bauer and I've had good luck with EB products, but this one is a design fiasco. No stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I thought that maybe I was the problem until I read the other reviews. This is way too complicated and cumbersome. There are so many straps and buckles that by the time I get it all situated and on me I've lost interest in using it. My son is 4 months old and it seems like he's soon going to be too large to fit comfortably in it anyway. I like the other Eddie Bauer products we've purchased but this carrier is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"i bought this item thinking it was the same as the baby bjorn my friend loved, only cheaper. it's not! a hassle to put on, the clips hurt my baby's arms, the fabric is too rough for baby's skin on summer clothes. Besides that, when my baby was little, she did not have proper support, as she grew bigger, she did not fit in it anymore - simply a terrible product, should be out of the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you figure it out, Its GREAT!!","review":"Ok, all I can say is that I DO LOVE this carrier. Yes, at first it looks like a maze, but once you've had it on a couple times, you could put it on with your eyes closed! Its not THAT hard!! I've had more frustration getting a diaper on.Even my husband, who is 6'3\\" can wear it. Our daughter has night meltdowns that were super ugly until we starting sticking her in this...Its THE ONLY thing that calms her down, so we swear by it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a pain to use","review":"I registered for this one over the baby bjorn b/c it was cheaper and seemed just as good. I wish I had just registered for the bjorn it is way less confusing and is just a better product. It is very confusing to use, once you get the hang of it, it gets easier to get on and off, the staps are soo long and hang out all over, the part that folds down when the baby is front facing does not stay down and ends up in her face. I guess you get what you pay for, I wish I had read the reviews before I registered for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I have no problem with Amazon, they only sell what is produced.However, over the years I have bought this item and given it to children so that they can enjoy the rabbit and be read to by their parents.Well, my great niece who will be 5 yrs old in April told her Grandmother, my sister, that her rabbit, was begining to fall apart and her Mommie was going to put him away and she was very sad. When my sister told me the story I told her I would see if I could find a replacement. I immediately went on Amazon.com and found the rabbit and book, and in fact I purchased 3, to have on hand for other children.My purchase arrived and I opened the box to find the 3 sets, and was very disappointed to find that the rabbit not only shrunk in size, but the quality also was not the same. My great niece will know the difference, other children will not, but I know and I am saddened to see this happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cuddly Classic","review":"Everyone loves the Velveteen Rabbit, but this gift set is especially nice!

I've suspected that there was more to the issue than meets the eye and that Holland Smith may have had more of a point to prove than cause for action. O'Brien's book points solidly in that direction although his perspective has to be skewed toward the 27th and I believe that he wrote the book starting from that viewpoint. However the most moving and impressive part of this account for me was the details of the heroism of Sgt. Thomas A. Baker. I first encountered his story in an obscure internet tribute one Veteran's Day a few years back. Reading his citation I wondered what kind of man could be capable of such feats. O'Brien's history contains more details of this remarkable soldier than I've found elsewhere, but still left me yearning to find out more about him. Who knows, maybe someday I'll write his definitive history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Great job visually and cueing. Would suggest showing modifications but still a great dvd.

Just like most every Wuxiafilm ever made, plot can be shakey. There are much worse examples of non sensicalplots then this film. Yes, it is disapointing when actors don't know martial arts.But the bottom line is entertainment value. These films have a zany sense of realityand violence. The costumes are very beautiful. The fantasy world of \\"martial arts\\"has a great varied cast of clans, styles and heroes. This world is very easy to fall in love with. Curb your expectations, accept the limitations and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simple","review":"Zen in 10 is a very simplistic book. It gives a very light overview of what Zen is and it appears it's intended only as a primer. While it does give a brief history and philosophy of Zen, it seems its intent is to make sure it gives the reader Zen for aesthetic purposes rather than any serious discussion of this branch of Buddhism. I can't recommend any books on the subject since this was the first one I chose to read but I know that if you are serious about learning about Zen this is not the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koyre was one of the greatest historian of science","review":"and EVERY book of his is beautiful and insightful.

It was an easy read and the two lead characters had great chemistry"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the main character?","review":"After reading the first book, I expected Annabel to be much more bold and brash like Scarlett O'Hara. Instead, I get Melony. She just gives up her dreams and runs off with a penniless Scotsman. Her comic seductiveness has somehow disappeared between book one and book two. Ewan's character is kind of wimpy too. He's not a rake, just a rich spoiled lord. He is also religious, which is not a bad thing, but I tend to like reading about the bad boys not the choir boys. He definitely does not have the character strength that Annabel in the first book would have required.I'm only half-way through the book, and I don't think I can finish. The only thing that keeps me going is the interplay between the other characters.Now Imogene has the Scarlette touch, but she'll probably loose it in the third book. The author does not seem to be able to maintain a characters personality throughout a series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The movie was a desappointment, it is more like an slide show than a movie, no one talks, there is no story to follow, there are some shots of Ibiza but they could be more since there was no story, it is not even erotic, as far as I am concern it is a low budget soft porn that I was sorry I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie","review":"Great movie for kids or the kid in you.Glad I was able to find it to share with a Lil friend of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK - SAME THING I SAY ABOUT THE OVERBLOWN MOVIE","review":"This soundtrack pales, GREATLY pales, against both the 1999 Disney movie soundtrack and the 1977 Broadway cast.

A great stage property was destroyed by producer Ray Stark and director John Huston. The ANNIE movie soundtrack should not be your first choice when purchasing an ANNIE recording. The original Broadway cast is the way to go. Even the latest recording from the ABC-DISNEY special is better. The movie version dropped some of the best songs included in the stage version (NYC,HOOVERVILLE, etc)and were horribly replaced (DUMB DOG, LETS GO TO THE MOVIES, etc). The awful musical scoring by Ralph Burns does nothing to evoke the 1930s setting(believe it or not,Burns was up for an Oscar for this work). The vocal performances are generally good, but Aileen Quinn tries to hard and tends to be unbelivable as Annie. Forget about the movie misfire and its soundtrack album, stick to the Broadway original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"The CD case and disc itself is disgusting.

Carefully researched and wonderfully written, this book is definitely one of those that is hard to put down. In fact, because of its fine narrative, the reader may feel as if it is 1864 and Robert E. Lee's army has now a clear advantage in the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Reseached and Detailed Account of a Past That Wasn't!","review":"This is the first alternate history novel I've read and also the first Harry Turtledove. Just let me say that if the author's other books are this painstakingly realized, I'll be a fan for life. This novel captured me from the first page and didn't let go! I felt I really got to know the characters on a personal level and so cared about what happened to them. Any author that can do that is well worth the time and effort required to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Neat Novel on the Civil War!","review":"I have tried to read several of this authors books. His World at War series, How few Remain, and his Great War Series. I have hated them all and stopped half way through. However, his plots keep intriguing me and I always find myself buying his latest books. Guns of the South was the one book of his I liked. I thought the idea of South Africans going back in time and arming the Confederacy with modern weapons and Robert E. Lee with heart medicine was fantastic. I also liked how he shows the now independent Confederacy dealing with the issue of slavery. So again, my review is one from someone who is not a fan of this author. However, this was a great book and one any fan of the civil war will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Terrible Kindle Edition","review":"\\"Guns of the South\\" is the best alternate history book ever written. To Turtledove, how the South could have won the Civil War is less important than what the post-war politics of the Confederate States of America would have been. It's an engaging, fascinating book and unfortunately, I regret purchasing the Kindle edition. This ebook is full of errors: bad spelling, sentences that end prematurely and mis-placed letters. Amazon needs to review this book and offer a new, complete and edited, version to those who purchased this flawed edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The proof reading of the Kindle edition is abysmal","review":"I won't review the book itself, as it has been generously covered by others. But in reading the Kindle edition, I have to ask if they even bothered to proofread it.Obviously hardcopy pages were scanned and OCR'd but it is rife with errors: Proper names appearing incorrectly and/or inconsistently (\\"Gait House\\"?), what appear to be some dropped lines or partial lines, incorrect \\"correction\\" of deliberately misspelled words (e.g., Forrest's \\"skeer\\" turned to \\"sheer\\"). And then there's the place where they appear to have scanned in the wrong page or two, replacing the text for half of one scene with duplicated passages from several scenes earlier. Just brainless error and no quality control.Should I quote my proofreading rates to the publisher? Apparently they don't have anyone in-house doing it.The rating is for the quality of the Kindle edition, not the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I like most of Turtledove's books, but this one is my favorite so far.

I have already re-read it a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast service and book is a awesome","review":"Shipping was very quick and the book was as described. I will certainly use them again in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUNS OF THE SOUTH","review":"THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE BOOK. IT IS OF COURSE A WORK OF FICTION BUT IT IS A VERY FUN READ AND HAS A LOT OF HISTORICAL FACTS THAT ARE CORRECT. THE AUTHOR DID A GOOD DEAL OR REASERCH BEFORE WRITING THIS BOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS READING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns of the South ROCKS!","review":"I cut my teeth in the early Eighties with alternate history from the late Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy books. Ever since I picked up Harry Turtledove's alternate histories of the Civil War starting with this book right here, I'm hooked. I've got a BA in American History so for me, knowing the world we live in and it's past and being able to compare it to Harry's world is great fun. I've loaned my copy to other friends to get them hooked too! Thank you Harry for a world that could have been. When I pick up one of your books, I can't put it down till it's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"An great alter-history view of what might have been","review":"I have been a student of Robert E. Lee's and the South for a very long time and I think that Mr. Turtledove spent a great deal of time researching General Lee for this book and thus he captured the true essense of him. That is what makes this book almost believeable. Of course, time travel is difficult to swallow, but what if the south did have some way of creating a superior weapon and turning the tide of the war? Mr. Turtledove provokes some interesting questions. All in all, this is a very enjoyable read and one that all civil war buffs should put on their christmas list."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent,once you start you can't stop","review":"This book was very entertaining.

And it made you think about your self and how you would act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is really terrible.","review":"I trust you got enough information about the actual writing from the hundreds of other reviews.The Kindle edition is absolutely riddled with the sloppiest typos and errors I've yet seen on this store. I'm not just complaining about spelling errors, (which abound). Entire sentences are missing, dialogue is garbled, and towards the end it looks like a page gets repeated, appearing in the text twice in place of an entire other page that's supposed to be there. The free \\"community classics\\" are done with more professionalism than this. The publisher destroyed a good book and should be ashamed. This reads like someone fed a paper copy of the book through a \\"Rainbows End\\"-style book shredder and never bothered to proofread the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st rate alternative history story telling","review":"Mr. Turtledove is at the top of his game and it shows in this first rate novel. Most of these novels are very predictable but not this one. So if you love the history of the War between the States and like a new look at it, then here is something worth looking at."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent alternate history and much more...","review":"This is much more than an alternative version of history with the South winning the civil war. It is an insightful vision of how such a victory might have changed the thinking of the Southern leaders and people. This novel is a fine example of how science fiction can be an avenue to a more profound understanding of the human condition. The historical characters are alive here, the period rich in detail and accurate. Thougtful, moving, and very well written, this what all alternative histories should aspire to. Turtledove is often a disappointment. Guns of the South, however, is his finest book yet and perhaps the best of this gendre to be written thus far"},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is his \\"best\\" I won't be reading any more from him","review":"I slogged to the end of this book, hoping for some nugget of goodness to redeem it. It never came.The most glaring problem, among many, is the fact that the South African villains are so cartoonishly evil. Other than delivering AK-47s, they serve only as a miraculous way to sway all the pro-slavery political leaders toward abolition. So the thing feels more like a fairly tale than a serious \\"what if?\\".Many have commended the opening chapters' battle scenes, but it's not as though the world needed a novel to explore what war would be like if massed infantry charged automatic weapons.There was obviously a lot of painstaking research done on various Civil War units and soldiers, but the silly plot and weak, weak characterizations detract too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extremely Literate Work","review":"I question whether John Thatch read this book at all before reviewing it. The issues he raises concerning the war, its causes, and the probable outcome had the South won are PRECISELY the issues explored in this highly literate, wonderfully realized novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"guns of the south","review":"i thought this was a great book i would reccomend this for anybody looking for a great alternate history read. harry turtledove used one of the best plots i have read in his books using twists and turns that will keep you intrested to the end and just enough politics to give it a great story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"theamazonking","review":"This man has one sick mind, all of his books twists the history in his on sick way.

When I say spell, I mean S P E L L it out. Did I mention he goes on and on and on...If you get this book, I recommend reading the first 100 pages, then skipping to the last 50 pages. Without spoiling anything, here's all you will miss:The bad guys are B A D, but some are worse than others.The good guys have to fight against prejudice and greed.The wheels of change turn S L O W L Y, especially in a Turtledove novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, but please get off slavery.....","review":"I liked this alternate history, but Turtledove is obviously not aware that Lee never owned slaves (less than 10 percent of Confederate soldiers did) and didn't believe in slavery. It was one of the causes of the war, but not THE cause, and didn't become an issue till 1863. (Read the \\"emancipation proclamation\\" online at the National Archives site; it actually freed NO ONE AT ALL) Slavery as an institution was on the way out anyway. Still, good for sci-fi fans and time travel aficionados"},{"rating":"1","title":"Civil War fans only...","review":"This book is really for Civil War fans only. The fact that the rave review on the cover was given by a Civil War Historian, should have been enough warning...The story has an interesting premise, but is poorly executed. Like other readers, I found that once the war was won by the South the story bogged down in mindless tedium. Certainly this is nowhere near the standard of Turtledove's other work. For a better, more exciting read try the back of a cornflakes packet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievable Premise","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did. But the ridiculous premise was just too much for me. Typically alternate histories follow a more or less believable plot. For instance what if Abraham Licoln had not been killed or what if america lost the Revolution. Somehow, \\"what if neorascist South Africans brought hundreds of thousands of AK-47's back to 1864 in their time machine\\" has got to be the stupidest idea ever. However, if you can hold your nose and get past this its not the worst book I've ever read. It attemts to depict life as a Confederate foot soldier in a realistic manner and the author obviously did his homework with the RE Lee character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"Oh man, is this Turtledove guy a nerd!OK OK OK, hang on just a minute. I wrote a college thesis on the subject of the Confederacywinning the war alright, so its not that I object to the concept of our boys being armed withAK-47's, but I do object to the dull and lifeless portrayal by this Turtledove clown. Its noteven worth the words, this book is so immensely and insanely boring you'd have to be crazy tothink this passes for decent fiction, or science fiction for what its worth. You could take thisentire ridiculous story and capsulize it to a single episode of Star Trek, maybe Captain Kirkcan add some much needed humor to this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate History","review":"I'm all up into this kind of thing (\\"Fatherland\\", & etc.) \\"The Guns of the South\\", is sure enough an entertaining read, but kinda glosses over time-travel paradoxes. On the one hand, it seems the 1990s books, brought back to the 1860s, should have reflected the changes wrought by the time travelers. On the other, as the tomes had already been printed & extant when brought to the alternate past, one might assume the material contained therein was immutable (as opposed to the, \\"Back to the Future\\", or, \\"Frequency\\", theory, where an act undertaken in the past would cause printed text, images or even objects to alter before one's eyes. That's a lot to try getting one's head around, if considered too seriously, so my advice is to put all technicalities aside. You'll only drive yourself nuts trying to over-analyze all the nuts & bolts of time travel, so don't. Just enjoy the stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"The interesting part of this novel is Turtledove's explanation of how the victorious South deals with their freedom and, more importantly, the question of slavery. Passages on the time-traveling South Africans are kept to a minimum, so hard sci-fi'ers may be disappointed here. This book is more for history buffs.Questions: Would Lee and the South have been as willing to change their slavery views had they not stumbled upon the trove of books that they did?Why weren't the South Africans more subtle -- thus, more influential -- in their attempts to control Southern politics? With the power at their disposal, what they resorted to seemed outright silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, though not what I expected","review":"I originally thought this book would use time travel simply as a starting point, and then go into what could realistically have happened had the South won the war. But, time travel continued to play an important role throughout the novel, especially at the end.Still, I can't fault the book just because I had faulty expectations for it. Guns of the South is an incredibly detailed and engrossing book, and one that I would heartedly recommend. It was the first Turtledove book I had read, but it will not be the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting View of the Confederacy After Victory","review":"From the onset, it's all too obvious that Confederates armed with automatic weapons will slaughter their Union opponents & win the war. The great interest in this book is it's story of what happened after the war: that Abraham Lincoln lived on as a discredited advocate of north/south friendship; that Lee became the Confederacy's progressive president; and that the South was, 1st, to defeat their S. African racist allie, and, 2nd, to learn and apply the 20th Century technology that the S. Africans had bought with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate history of the best caliber","review":"Being a masters' candidate focusing on the Civil War, I approached this book with wariness. Alternate history is a difficult genera to do well; there are no end of terrible titles in stores right now. But I am a big fan of Turtledove's books, so I gave it a shot, and was not in the least disappointed. In egghead-speak, these sorts of things are called \\"counter-factual hypotheses\\", and it's a legitamite way of studying history: change a variable, and what happens? Turtledove has a very, very good grasp of the real history of the War, including the most important facet of historiography, the mindsets of the principal players. Bob Lee was one of America's last truly great generals, and Turtledove has his character nailed down cold. An excellent read, well done in fact and fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known...","review":"I should have known what to expect when I saw a favorable review by James McPherson on the back cover. (Has anyone ever seen Harry Turtledove and James McPherson in a room together at the same time?) Whether it's \\"Alternate\\" history or the other kind, I would rather not have to view the past as a reflection in the fun-house mirror of 60's liberalism. I thought this book would be an interesting intellectual exercise but it is just politically correct silliness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible story, and awful portrayal of people","review":"This book has a very implausible development of the story. Furthermore, the character portrayal is very bad. Nathan Bedford Forrest is made into some monster, which he really wasn't. Also, Lee is not the Lee that we find in history. If you don't want anything to do with what really happened, then you might still be interested in it. But, then, why abuse actual people? Why not just make up your own whole world? I never liked time-machines anyway. Also, in the 1860s people had the technology to make AK-47s. They just didn't have the idea. Instead of making someone bring the machine-guns over with a time-machine, the author should have just made them make it at the Southern factories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man Beat Up By Book!","review":"I've been assaulted by a paperback! I could (and not just for my anti-confederate tendencies) relate to the plight of the Federal infantry pushing through the walls of lead on that Wilderness road. \\"The Executioners Song\\", is a great example of a novel that seeks to recreate events in a nearly minute to minute basis... Guns of the South, in spite of it's promising premise is not. Written like the old Cheech and Chong \\"Summer Vacation\\" skit, it attempts to wring extensive exposition out of everything. Leaving the reader no choice but to skim first paragraphs, then pages, and nearly entire chapters at a time- with no signifigant loss of overall comprehension.

There is nothing really compelling or interesting about reading how Confederate soldiers blast the Union Army apart with modern AK-47's. The entire book is a forgone conclusion before you get three chapters into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of scientific validity ruined reading experience.","review":"Turtledove doesn't tackle the problem of paradox in this book. If a group of white-supremist time travelers from early 21st century South Africa were to travel back to the Civil War era and provide the Confederacy with superior firepower, thus causing the Confederacy to win the Civil War, there would never be an impetus for the group to travel back in time and provide the Confederacy with superior firepower. Perhaps Turtledove should stick to writing alternate history novels, and leave the complicated aspects of temporal mechanics to those of above-average intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"turtledove","review":"The Guns of the SouthTurtledove is no southerner, but a reconstructed california liberal graded on the curve to get awards.

Lee finds that he is able to win the Civil War, as a mysterious group of men with questionable motives provide the Confederacy with a weapon the world of the 1860s has not yet seen: the AK-47.Though the founding premise of the book is far-fetched, you'll need to suspend your disbelief no further. The book is incredibly-well researched, and captures the gritty feel of the era and the personalities of its characters in rich detail, from the attitudes of a defeated Abraham Lincoln to the opinions of the more progressively-minded sergeant-turned-schoolteacher Nathan Caudell. I think it'd thoroughly please a reader of traditional historical fiction as well as any harder military, political or sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out","review":"Turtedove's interpretation of what might have happened had the Conferderacy won the war is a very interesting, well thought out and plausible scenario, and his versions of post-war politics in both the North and the South are very believable. As a reader who does not usually enjoy science fiction, I was pleasantly surprise with this book, perhaps because Turtledove used the idea of time travel incedentally in order to set a scenario in which he could explore the bigger questions of a Southern victory and the \\"what-ifs\\" that would ultimately follow.

The names are different because of the timing of when the book came out, I think? I think the name of Karate changed from Ryu Kyu Kempo, to To-te Jutsu, to Karate Jutsu? Although Karate Jutsu has fewer pages, it is because they fit 2 photos on one page instead of just one. If you are wondering if all 10 Katas from the To-te Jutsu are in Karate Jutsu, they are. In both books, the first 3 katas are fully illustrated and the other 7 are accompanied with 2-3 photos and the rest of the Kata described in detail.

The work is ambitious and not as immediately accessible as his other records, but the album is full of impressive music. The theme of alienation runs through the album in songs like the pounding, paranoiac \\"Pressure\\", the jilted lover in \\"Laura\\", the dying steel industry in \\"Allentown\\", the soldiers in \\"Goodnight Saigon\\". The album's closing \\"Where's The Orchestra?\\" is a Beatlesque number that shows his ambition to make more than just 3-minute pop songs. Most people rank Nylon Curtain as one of their least favorite Billy Joel records, but that is selling the album short.

Allentown and Pressure do not paint a pretty picture of society, but are very meaningful and insightful.

In fact it was the first Compact Disc I bought (or my mom bought for me) along with Prince's Purple Rain soundtrack. Billy never sounded more Beatle-esque than on 'Laura'. 'Laura' sounds very Lennon style (Lennon was killed two years before). Also it hold the distinction of being the only BJ song with an Fbomb thrown in for good measure. There's a lot of great tunes besides Laura. They are: Allentown, She's Right On Time, Goodnight Saigon, A Room Of Our Own, Surprises, Where's The Orchestra?, and the big single off of this album, Pressure (the video got a lot of plays on Mtv) After this album, not even his big seller followup, An Innocent Man, could match up to this early eighties masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joel's Social Conscience","review":"\\"The Nylon Curtain\\" was Billy Joel's attempt to challenge Bruce Springsteen for the hearts and minds of heartland rockers.

Coupled with another decent single in \\"She's Right on Time,\\" this album could have been Joel's best if it didn't peter out with less successful filler material in the second half. As a result, it confirms Joel's status as an artist more adept at producing singles than fully realized albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 Stars- Billy finally starts to go downhill","review":"Basically, when you get past \\"Allentown\\" and \\"Pressure\\" this is a pretty weak offering.

I do get a kick out of watching the video \\"Pressure\\" because I think it works better as an MTV video. Just getting the visual makes it twice as entertaining. \\"Allentown\\" did kind of have to grow on me. I wasn't impressed when I first heard it, but now after all these years, I kind of like it now. But after those two it's a pretty crummy album if I do say so myself. I just think the creative well finally went dry for Billy on NYLON CURTAIN.

I looked at the usual \\"train tables\\" and they just looked unappealing. We have to keep this table in our living room, as that's the kids play area, so we wanted something nicer. Pottery Barn has a really nice table but it is so expensive! When I saw this one by Today's Tot, I was impressed with how it looked on the website, especially for $149.00. The first table that came was damaged, but Babyage immediately sent out another table and it came in great shape. My husband had no trouble putting it together. It's really nice looking, very sturdy (important because my kids like to climb on things!). The drawers are really spacious. I am very pleased to display this table in my living room and a few friends who have come over liked it so much they want to order one for their kids too! It's a great buy at $149.00!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great train table","review":"This table is great. We bought this table for our almost 3 year old twins for Christmas.

There are so many others out there for much more money but they are very flimsy or you only get the table, not the drawers too. This is great deal. It is very sturdy and perfect for a train set.

Yup the word is 'couples' since the pleasure of sex is definitely secondary to our heroine ....

When the cord is moved, touched, bumped, etc., the headphones fill with static. So if you keep your mp3 player in your pocket, your normal movements will cause static.

I never knew Ms. Ball could act so well. I became more and more interested as the story advanced. If you like mysteries this is one to watch. I will share this movie with my wife as she will appreciate it. The plot criss-crosses as the explanation to why beautiful young unattached women are disappearing.

It can fit up to 5 games and headphones in it. Very durable and the clip is an added bonus so you can fit it on the outside of you backpack. There are a few things I did not like about it though; The PSP-3000 does not fit right inside of it. It is really snug and you really have to force it to fit inside the storage area nicely. There is a rivet that is exposed to the PSP that will scratch it through use. I also did not like the fact that I can not fit the charger inside the case with the PSP. The storage area for the Games is not big enough to fit the charger even without any games in it.

I'm not sure whether this is an item that you either get \\"lucky\\" with or screwed, depending on which version of the product you receive, but it's not worth the gamble.

I had to bend it and try and stretch it out just for it to kinda fit in there. The top flap's Velcro doesn't work very well. Because the psp doesn't fit very well there leaves very little room for games on the top. Probably a stretch to fit two umd games/movies (the say four). I purchased a silicone sleeve for my PSP as well (have not yet received) and there is NO way it i will fit in this case. I did not expect it to be this small. If you want a cheap case that barely gets the job done, I guess get this one, but there are MUCH better cases out there for just a few dollars more. Oh, and a lot of reviews talk about a metal button coming through the case.

Where it is located (top right corner of case), it cannot possibly scratch your screen. I can see how it could scratch your psp though. I have been very careful with it because of what I have read in other reviews. I just lay my cleaning cloth between it and the psp, and that seems to take care of any problems.

It's the first book I ever looked at on Java, and I didn't find it at all difficult to understand the presentation of ideas. About the first half of it is very useful, as well. The second half gets into a graphics library and a numerical functions library, both of which were written for this book.

Rohen's has incredible dissections which are the closest to the anatomy lab you can get without that awful perservative smell. You could probably do very well in anatomy lab exams just using this, as the key to anatomy is finding the big structures and then determining the position of smaller stuff like nerves in relation to them. This book is thorough, shows multiple angles of the body, and even integrates some CT and X-ray images. Netter's is perhaps better in helping you chart the course of vessels and nerves, and I used it, but it's nothing like reality and hence not like this book. You can tell the makers are masters of anatomy and lovingly crafted this book. I sell a lot of my old med school texts; I loan other people my copy of Rohen, but I always get it back :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is AWESOME","review":"I can not believe the quality of this books or the photos it is full of.

This book has made it much easier to conceptualize human anatomy in 3-dimension as well as demonstrate how each part relates to one another, by region and layer-by-layer. The cadavers have been dissected with superb precision, which provides clarity as to how all of the anatomical structures relate. The photographs are of excellent quality with nonintrusive lines and numbers to easily identify each anatomical part. You get a realistic experience of human anatomy in its true physical form and spatial dimension. This is an excellent book for those who are visual learners as well as those who desire a deeper understanding of human anatomy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very good reference.","review":"I'm a dental student studying gross anatomy.

This book leaves no questions. No interpretive drawings of muscle placement, actual photos from dissections! No mistaking about it there! And for anyone who is questioning buying it because of the price, bear in mind the following: It is almost 500 pages of full color photographs, more in depth than you will ever believe until you see it yourself, hardcover, and printed entirely on thick glossy stock paper.

Much toxic smoke later, I will NEVER buy another Chantal unless this company makes things right and makes it clear that they are removing the bad design.And simply selling the bad tea kettles at discount IS NOT ENOUGH. They need to get the ones with bad tooters OFF THE MARKET. I'm appalled.

If you are an Ekin Cheng fan, you should not watch this movie. The storyline is interesting, the execution is horrible (they tried to make it funny but it is way too corny). The only good thing is that Shu Qi played 3 roles and in my opinion she acted out well on all 3 roles. Ekin constantly wore an annoying white open jacket (Groovy!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one reason to watch this movie...","review":"And that is to gaze upon the loveliness of Shu Qi.

Much of the movie seems barely scripted. A waste of some good young talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie [stinks]","review":"The plot is weak, the script is horrible and bad directing. A big disappointment for a HK film and the film has no originality especially when they incorporated the dodging bullet scenes from the Matrix which spoils the homage of Hong Kong Cinema. Apart from that, they even incorporated a scene from Spider-Man O_o. It happens when E-kin fell off the trailer and he then shoots some kind of string from his wrist to keep him from falling. I can't really explain it though, so sorry.Don't waste money on this DVD, rent it if you like....I seriously recommend Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon.

This is wierd because most of the movie I watch, they have always been a couple. Kristy have a huge crush on Louis, but Louis already have a girlfriend, which eventually they will broke up. What's so wierd about this movie? I think that the girl (Eleven) who play with Ekin is really ugly. I don't know how he fall for her in the first place. Eventually Louis fall in love with Kristy.

The weighted handles are perfect for post workout toning and fat burning. This is the rope to buy to get shredded...HOWEVER, if you are serious, IT WILL BREAK. I understand if this was catered to a different audience how it might break so easily but it is a weighted jump rope. One assumes that people buying weighted jump ropes are serious about their jump roping abilities. Sadly this product is not made with durability in mind.

Though it seems that Gray (like most Anglo-Saxons) is unaware of the Continental critique (think Habermas), he still does a good job of making some readers aware of the Enlightenment project that seems to grip too many people. Luc Ferry does a better job of this in my mind because he nods to the critiques and tries to move towards a solution. Unfortunately it may be that Americans find his Frenchness offensive. In that case Gray's work here has opened the possibility of moving beyond the dialectic of enlightment (sorry Frankfurt School)and towards one of \\"modus vivendi\\". It also doesn't share the faults that his earlier book, \\"False Dawn\\" had, an overweening attempt to criticize without ever coming to some sort of solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I'm just listening to the first time and I love them. Every song is a surpise. Like one reviewer said, the lead does have a very operatic style but it works so well with the music I can't imagine anything else. They have the heavy metallic beat (and I'm not particularly a fan), suddendly breaking into more of a ska sound, or marachaci, or country rock, or eastern, and yes there's a digaroo, followed by straight progressive. I like Within Temptation, but Diablo Swing Orchestra is more experimental, they throw more into the mix. They remind me more of Symphony X or System of a Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Experience","review":"From the beginning to the end, the Butcher's Ballroom is an excellent music trip. Its danceable jazz-like rhythm mixed with powerful opera singing and richly arranged double bass and brass results in a fresh and most enjoyable sound, without losing any power in its scraping sounding metallic guitar riffs. It's like heavy boogie, or rock & roll & metal, but not as if it only got those two poles playing at the same time each one on its own; on the contrary, its the result of masterfully combining both fields to make one solid, well-balanced, great and rich music. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT DATED MATERIAL","review":"This book is now out dated. The Xbox 360 supplied an update on NOVEMBER 19th 2008.

I love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential...","review":"This book has an interesting premise - after dying a person reverse-ages until they are born again - but ultimately, something fell very flat. Perhaps it was the writing style: third person present tense seemed somehow alienating in this case - making it more of a story told, than a story experienced. And another part of its ultimately disappointing nature was that there were soo many opportunities for more fun with the premise than actually happened. The idea of \\"speaking Canine\\" was a nice twist, but another example of a greater potential than its execution. Though it was entertaining enough, it left me unsatisfied by the book's conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Poor Execution","review":"I began reading this book with high hopes because of the back cover. However, the more I began to read, the more ANNOYING the way it was written got to me. There were many many times when I wanted to rewrite the parts for the author for the sake of the book's moment. I have never even thought that a book might not be worth the money but this one certainly was not worth my money. I think I just might return it. It's in well enough condition seeing as how little it took me to read it. I loved the dogs, though. Aldous Ghent was also quite hilarious.

When I read the back, I thought oh, this book would be so cool. It was actually kind of weird. It didn't flow very well. It was awkward too. And the main character is really really weird. Nothing like anyone I know, and not in a good way. This book was funny and a few parts, which could actually make it bearable. I would never buy this book if I were you. It would be a waste of money. If you ever feel the urge to read it, get it from the library, have them waste their money. This book is a travesty to the literature industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, yet fascinating","review":"I won't lie-this book kept me glued to my seat until I had read every single word. The land of Elsewhere drew me in and wouldn't let go.This book has a very unique idea which sounds gimmicky, but definitely isn't. Somehow, the fantasy seems realistic.However, the writing (though engaging) does not challenge you or keep you guessing. It is fairly simple. This might be better than challenging writing, because the idea is so complex that complex writing might be overwhelming. But the simple writing gets worse towards the end and there are no cliffhangers. It takes no chances.Also, you can't really identify with the main character very much. Liz reflects what many of us would do in her situation, but she is not likable and you can't feel very sorry for her.Even though the writing is a little flawed and characters needed to be worked on, this book is able to rise above that.

Elsewhere is a quick read, but as a reader, I kept finding myself wanting more time with the characters. The ideas that the author created Elsewhere from are ingenious. In a way, the book is quite metaphysical, concerning questions of life and death. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written and intriguing","review":"Everyone else seems to have covered what this book is about, so I won't bother with that! But it was an excellent read. Usually I would shy away from reading a \\"young adult\\" book, but this one sounded too interesting to pass up. I found this book on a best sellers list by accident and ordered it immediately. I ended up reading in while waiting in the hospital for hours on end as my grandmother passed away....and what a perfect time to read it. It brings up the question of whether you would be content and fulfilled if you were to die by accident suddenly. Would you be in \\"elsewhere\\" -- heaven --- just wanting to watch what is happening on earth? The concept is when you get to heaven you would age backwards from the age of your death, until you become a newborn again and go back to earth. Elsewhere was interesting, funny and made you think. I would recommend it to anyone, and plan on passing it on to my family to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"ElseWhere by Gabrielle Zevin","review":"Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin is about agirl, named Elizabeth who recently was ina taxi cab crash. She wakes up startled tosee she's on a boat and has no idea why!?She spends a good few chapterswondering is she dreaming? or is she onher way to the glorias Elsewhere?Elizabeth take's a dive down to theforbidden parts of elsewhere or a.k.a TheWell. Here she can see and talk to theliving on earth but it's a criminal act. WhenLizzie goes down here it is my absolutefavorite part because she get's to talk toher brother and tell him how much shemisses him. I love this part also because Ithink it's such a unique idea that GabrielleZevin had so the dead could communicatewith the living.I recommend this book to anyonewho has a few hours to spare sitting athome because once you pick this book up,you'll never put it down untill you reachthe end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!","review":"I love this book, sadly I couldn't bring it to NYC from Puerto Rico, I was so glad to find it cheap and in great conditions.

Elsewhere itself, as a setting, worked quite well for me. The supporting characters were fine. Liz herself ...After a while I was rooting for her grandmother, Betty, to throw her out! Until her visit to The Well, she came across as incredibly whiny and self-centered. The book improves substantially after that. I'm not a dog person, so the canine dialogue didn't do much for me; Owen's dog, Jen, seemed obnoxious.Overall though, the plot does come together nicely, with Liz maturing as she gets younger."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books ever printed. :)","review":"Once I first read the summary and description of the book I automatically captured it as an amazing book that I needed to go pick up immediately. Of course, time passed and I soon forgot, but when I reminisced about it and conveniently found it at a book store at Santa Monica beach, I purchased it and got to reading.Automatically Gabrielle Zevin takes a turn by narrating the prologue by a DOG. Yes, the main character, Lizzie's dog. The story only got crazier after that by taking us into a twisty hurricane of a girl confused about life & death.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something to curl up with.It has a twist of everything even including a little after death romance! <3 :)I wont get into a high voltage discussion about the story's plot diagram because I'm sure after reading other people's reviews and just by \\"searching inside\\" you're pretty convinced!GO OUT & BY THIS!Thank you. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Elsewhere is the best book ever!!!!!!!

It follows the life and death of Elizabeth Hall, a 15-year-old who finds herself in the afterlife after a fatal bike accident. Zevin is marvelous and creative, constructing a \\"death\\" that bears a strong resemblance to life on Earth. Her interpretation of reincarnation is very interesting and thought-provoking.My only criticism of the book would be the expression of emotions and character development. Many of the characters seemed to lack a unique personality, and their dialogue was sometimes dry. I wish the book might have been a bit longer, and provided further details.

Elsewhere is a YA book that has a unique view of the afterlife. The beginning starts with 15 year old, Elizabeth, waking up on a boat. She can't remember what has happened right before and she thinks she's dreaming for the longest time. The boat takes her to Elsewhere, where people go when they die. She meets her grandmother (who she had never met on Earth) there. In Elsewhere, instead of growing old, you get younger each year until you are a baby and are sent back to Earth. This is the story of Liz, dying yet still being able to live a life in Elsewhere. I think this book has some great insights on what can happen and a way to look at life - and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"A clever and fun depiction of the afterlife. Loved the beginning on the cruise ship crossing over to Elsewhere, and Liz's obsession with the Observation Decks.

But not horrible","review":"My biggest issue with this book was the tone. It made it very difficult to read or take seriously. There were some great and cute ideas in it (although I personally extremely dislike the idea of reincarnation because I'd hate to forget this life)... it just fell short in a few ways... there were a few great \\"quotable\\" lines but it felt so out of place and strange.I wouldn't recommend paying money for this book (I checked it out at a library) and I probably won't read anything else by this author.

This book is the most beautifully written and moving book I have ever read. Liz finds her living (or maybe it is dying?)In this wonderful story. She wants romance, to drive, and all things that happen to people as they age, though she is aging backwards. She travels through many emotional obstacles and discovers that a life lived backwards isn't much different than a life lived forwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard- and falls short","review":"While Elsewhere has grand ambitions, it falls short on the execution. Mrs. Zevin seems unsure of where she wants her book to lead, and the plot meanders through job-seeking, romance, and some completely irrelevent pursuits before its very satisfying end (the book is almost worth it, if only for the last 20 pages or so). In the middle, however, the reader must suffer through the annoying dialouge (reminiscent of grandparents and ever so predictable)and a frustrating, omniprescent narrator who likes to switch tenses and/or talk to readers as if they were 4-year-olds. In the same way, the talking dogs and other ilogical parts are a turnoff.Also, as some have mentioned, the romance between Liz and Owen is not only pointless but subtly disturbing. He is a thirty-something. She is a teenager.

After reading the flaps, I made the decision to leave it there and left. A week later, my reading teacher announced that we would be reading it in class. Other than the matter of having to re-read every chapter because I read ahead, I absolutely hate this book. Liz's sour mood in the beginning makes me feel frustration at the character. You feel compelled to label her as stupid, crazy, and selfish. Even as it goes on, bizarre romances where people feel the strange impulse to bight one another sets an ever odder mood. Is the author a vampire? Because as clearly as I can see, the characters aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Stay Young and Healthy in a toxic world","review":"I was not please with this book.

The background and supporting characters are gone, all gone. And instead of the humor we were accustomed to, we get a plot and script that approaches the horror genre.

His book provides a very interesting and lively introduction to the earlier Greek and Persian wars leading up to the mercenary involvement of the Greeks. He describes the motives of the Greek army in assisting Cyrus to overthrow his brother Ataxerxes, the \\"King of Kings\\". In addition the author describes his personal observations of the territories and villages transversed by Xenophon's army of the \\"Ten Thousand\\". His book is a read that describes the intrigues, deceptions and treachery that both Persians and Greeks endured. His description of the famous march incorporates his own vivid historical storytelling with the actual ancient accounts of the Xenophon's \\"Anabasis\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Prevas tells nothing new.

It's quite an interesting work, and although at times the author puts out facts that don't really appear to be accurate, he is merely letting us know what Xenophon wrote those many centuries ago.

It ended up being one of his favorite gifts from me. He had it for several years when he loaned it to one of his wrestlers who was designing a team shirt. We never did get the book back, so ended up buying another copy. This year, my husband had a senior wrestler graduating whom he had gotten very close to. He decided that this book would be a wonderful graduation gift - which it proved to be. After purchasing 3 copies of this book, I anticipate having to buy more in the future, and each will be well worth the money. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GREAT!","review":"The book is small such that the author tries to cramp diagrams and tables several pages later after talking about...

This is a POORLY ORGANIZED BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very organized ... lacks crucial information","review":"While this book might appeal to the reader becuase of its size ( around 300 pages ), I found that it can be more organized. The information is not presented in the best way for Neither Step 2 nor Step 3.Although it has some nice chapters ( radiology ), it is lacking detailed information about crucial subjects ( sexually transmitted diseases, although mentioned in a table , it is not presented in a suitable fashion for the USMLEs, the psychiatry is not very organized either ) .This book is an average book, and you are better off with other books ( crush the boards, Swansons ..etc)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition","review":"I definitely recommend this book not only for your step 2 studying, but for your time on the wards as well. In terms of using is in conjunction with my rotations, I found that it was most helpful as a last minute review. I don't think that you could solely use this book to study for your rotations, but once you've used another series like Blueprints, this provides excellent review. In terms of studying for the boards, sections that stood out were internal medicine, surgery, and ob gyn. I also found family medicine helpful as I had not completed this rotation prior to taking the boards. One drawback is the lack of an emergency medicine section as EM is tested. Overall, I highly recommend this book and think it will definitely facilitate your studying for step 2. I also recommend First Aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent review of step 2.","review":"I'm somebody who used several different sources in my review for all 3 steps.

Joyce, an Irish immigrant, Civil War \\"colonel\\" from Kentucky (actual military rank of Adjutant), minor crony of the Grant years and self-styled \\"Poet of Washington\\", wrote Poe's first biography (Neely, 1901), \\"Burns\\" (Regan, Chicago, 1910), and \\"Shakspere: Personal Recollections (spelling sic; Broadway, NY, 1904), in addition to volumes of his own poetry. Joyce's works are of interest primarily because he reflects the hypermoralistic outlook of the period after the Civil War. Not a valuable work for study of Burns. However, his autobiographical \\"A Checkered Life\\" (if you can find it) is of value because it describes in some detail his experiences as an asylum inmate, as well as his involvement in the Whiskey Ring scandals, for which he served time. I believe the Library of Congress and the University of Kentucky have copies of these works."},{"rating":"2","title":"May get hooked on Jolson","review":"I bought The Singing Fool because one video catalog said that it is a sequel to The Jazz Singer. That was not true, since the main character is different. But I enjoyed it anyway.Some of the emotions looked real and convincing, even though it contrasts with cinematographic techniques over 70 years later. It's been about three years since I saw it, and some of the scenes remain vivid in my memory. On the other hand, it was a little hard to take the singing styles seriously, to get into the mindframe that people of that era had.If this ever comes out on DVD, I might purchase it then.

I thought she had the temp up too high, so I turned it off, reset the temp to a lower setting. I told her she had to wait for the red flashing light (as per directions). I was finally able to locate where the red light should be, but it never came on. Directions say in seconds, it's been plugged in for 20 minutes now, and it's not getting hot again., and no red light.I think this is either a knock off, as someone else suggested, or the product manufacturer has gone downhill.

For a playstation game, the graphics remain very well done, with moving backgrounds, and awesome sound quality. All the flaws of the previous Gundam Battle Assault have been corrected, with larger selection of suits, slightly better storylines, and expanding levels, allowing much more mobility then the old game. Levels are more interesting, as are the mobile suits. ((Tallgeese III, Yeah!)). Otherwise it retains the classic fighting game with robots, save that with hand drawn and painstakingly detailed designs, the suits move, and sound, like the ones all the mecha fans know so well.

Instead of the quasi-fusion sounds of that album, Fresu, a very accomplished horn player from Italy, provides us with a very balanced, airy set, giving all of his mate a more-than-fair turn to display their talents in a post bop setting, with hints of Miles, Stanley Turrentine, and Mark Isham. The jazz is straightforward but well-executed and quite tasty - contempo jazz in the 21st Century - an enjoyable listen. My major gripe is that the descriptive material is all in Italian, except for the names of the songs. English is a pre-requisite, if Mr. Fresu desires the understanding of an international audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best invention of all time","review":"I love the Boppy Pillow so much, I buy it for every new mother I know (whether they ask for it or not).

They shipped within 2 days of ordering and shipped from Washington State. They flew to the Dallas/FTW airport where they sat for days. Keep in mind the temperatures down here have been close to 100 degrees. I can only imagine what they were in a container or closed truck. I received a nicely packaged bundle of stinky, brown, dead plants. The plants were actually HOT as if they had been in an oven!!!! I immediately got them into the water hoping for a miracle but no such luck.

The humor is sharp without ever being mean-spirited, and there's always something going on in the background, which makes repeated viewing rewarding. Even adults will find plenty to love about this one! No violence, a couple of extremely mild double-entendres (so mild that they went right past my 10-year-old daughter), wonderful performances by young and seasoned actors alike. The two girls are natural and just darling, and Kathy Baker and Ron Silver turn in marvelously nuanced performances as a pair of lonely, slightly flaky star-crossed lovers. Fun, fun, fun.

It introduces concepts of web design in a poor and almost offensive manner. Why tell your readers HTML is like a word processor when it is a Markup Language? Why suggest that you use WYSIWYG as your only resourse when WYSIWYG program create (most of the time) illegal HTML code? Suggestions are not practical and, except for the pictures, you can find better information on the most basic tutorial online. Don't be persuaded by the pretty graphics.

Yes! Would you also expect there to be a splash of humour that is characteristic of most anime? Probably. Did \\"Fencer Of Minerva\\" prvode anything worth watching? Maybe if you like hentai.To be completely honest, I feel this is the first anime that wasted my time, because I didn't feel entertained while watching it. I am a huge fan of anime like \\"Cowboy Bebop\\", \\"Martian Successor Nadesico\\" and \\"Trigun\\". Even with the less popular \\"Lost Universe\\" series, I was at least able to laugh with it.The one thing that I will NOT take away from this DVD title is the quality of the animation that is presented. Clean from beginning to end, and perfect quality too. Great transfer, and props go to Central Park Media for it.No matter how good the video and audio are, I honestly don't think this is worthy in any anime collection. That is, unless it's a hentai collection.Reccommended For Ages 16+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anime thong song video","review":"Fencer of Minerva: The Tempest is a very disappointing anime.

Flanagan is mildly amusing at times but the entire book came off as a whine about how hard it is to be a modern woman from a woman who has money, privilege, power, and many options. Flanagan is out of touch with reality, priding herself on being a stay-at-home mom even though she has a nanny, maid, organizer, and gardener to help her with her life, seemingly unaware that most mothers do not have the luxury of an entire support staff. I found the book patronizing, annoying, and not the least bit helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is her problem?","review":"As many have noted, Flanagan is not a housewife. She's a well-paid magazine writer with a lot of domestic help. That's no crime, but it does make her a hypocrite, since she blames everything she doesn't like about modern life on the failure of women to do the very things she also doesn't do ( cook, clean,focus every minute of waking life on hubby, kids, and house). She cuts herself slack she won't grant other career women and makes all kinds of unfounded assumptions about their lives: their marriages must be unhappy, their children prefer the nanny, if they get cancer their husbands won't take care of them. If you think she's just kidding about wanting the 1950s back, see her lament for the good old days when women performed their \\"wifely duty\\" whether they wanted to or not.

Because the film was skillfully made and the acting good I kept watching.

The play between McLaren's Ranger training and his strength against Honor's past and her own insecurites is nicely balanced. We understand her and as she begins to know Ian, we understand him, too.

Prime example: Holly, trapped in a frozen part of the Land of the Lost, complains repeatedly about how cold she is, but she never even rolls down her sleeves!

Only one episode was written by a returning writer.This seems to have completely changed the tone of the show.

Sleestak and Chaka talk, Enik does stupid things in the name of 'logic'.

Not at all what I expected. Anticipating a sweeping biopic of Mussolini's ENTIRE life (especially considering the 307 minute run time) imagine my surprise when the film ends twenty years before the start of WWII! Instead we get Mussolini as a young ne'er do well aspiring Socialist. This is probably the least interesting part of Il Duce's life story. Rise and Fall? It showed neither. A more appropriate title would have been \\"Mussolini in Love\\" or maybe \\"Springtime for Mussolini.\\" Also, what is with the picture at the bottom of the box? That (and the title) indicates that this would cover Mussolini's actual rise to power as the leader of Fascist Italy. Additionally, on the back of the box there is a picture of footage of German Soldiers in WWII that isn't even in the film! What is that about?

This CD best represents what one of Mitch's holiday shows was like. Good old fashioned singing with no overblown orchestration. Ironically, Mitch was known for overdubbing and echoing effects on most of Columbia's records in the 50s when he was in charge of that. It's why artists like Frank Sinatra left the label.Back to the CD. 16 songs, most of them standards. They all sound good. One song that got my attention was Must Be Santa, a song that never became a hit. But it's a great novelty song. A nice CD for a sing-along or background music at any holiday party.

I do think about it but i really enjoy the bryan kest yoga dvds. he is my favorite choice hands down. for me i feel like i get strength, stretching, and calmness from his workouts.

There are no multi-million dollar special effects. It's a slow and methodical story, based upon true events, which portrays the dogged (pun intended) loyalty of Hachi. I believe that the true story occurred in Japan, but for purposes of this movie, the story was \\"transferred\\" to the U.S. If you're looking for action, this is NOT your movie. If you're interested in a story about the connection between man and dog, it's a great watch. There are moments that will bring tears to your eyes; well, if you're human!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loyalty","review":"this extremely well done film is about loyalty. something that is in short supply in our daily lives and is evidenced by many of us who have animals. though this story is unique, it shows the love and dedication of an animal to his companion/owner. a short while ago i was watching jerry maguire, one of my favorites, and when cuba goodings asks tom cruise why he got married, he answers, she was loyal. weather it's to your wife, family, and yes your animals, loyalty is the ultimate sign of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok I guess","review":"Gave these to my grandkids...so I heard that they liked the movie...I myself have never seen it yet....hopefully I will when I am over at their house sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming story of love and devotion","review":"I bought a copy of this movie for my granddaughter who is 9.

YOU WON'T GO WRONG WHEN YOU GET THIS MOVIE ...JUST HAVE YOUR TISSUES HANDY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of Hachi","review":"The story of Hachi is one of extreme loyalty and love by a dog for his master, a college professor. It's a true story and took place in Japan but this version is American with an American backdrop. It's a story which all animal lovers will want to see. There are many comical parts to the story when Hachi was young and it's very serious and heartbreaking as well as the end nears. Overall it's a heartwarming story of a man and his dog.I recommend it VERY highly..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hachi: A story of loyalty","review":"For anyone who loves dogs and understands their loyalty to their owners, this movie is for you. It is based on a true story of a dog named Hachiku that waited 10 years for his deceased owner to come back for him (look it up on the internet). Of course, this is the Americanized version of the true Japanese story, but it is, by all means, a fair account. Be prepared to cry your eyes out, though, because as this story proves, the true loyalty and unconditional love of a dog for its owner is very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic","review":"All of the various canine actors who portray Hachi in this sentimental film are the real stars, but Richard Gere displays facets of his ability to portray a music professor not seen in his many other great films. The pace of this movie is also excellent, moving from one surprising delightful or hear-breaking stepping stone to another. This movie is a sort of mirror forcing the viewer to evaluate his or her own life, and, perhaps, very generally, the quality of life itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring movie!! :)","review":"The movie was sad, but in the end such a wonderful inspiration to being a faithful friend!!

Definately recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Film..All to Enjoy","review":"I read the review on EW about the DVD release. It caught my eye because of Richard Gere doing a film with a dog. Turns out the film was well made. It was moving and the relationship of loyalty Hachi and Richard Gere ahd for each other was very moving. Loved the scenes where the director was showing us Hachi's view point of what was going on!Finally a movie the whole family can enjoy. This should have been released in the movie theatres. I have been spreading word of mouth about the DVD. It's a family keeper. Keep the hankies close by you also. You will enjoy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely and truly beautiful story","review":"A movie that's pretty rare, as it is a deeply touching movie that comes by it's emotions honestly, with not a false note. The tone of the movie is understated, not the typical Hollywood gloss, which makes it all the more effective. While I admit to being more of an action/horror/thriller fan, I do enjoy a movie with true emotions, and this one blew me away. Is it weepy? Yes - me, I cried at three separate moments, not because I was being manipulated by the story, but, I was touched by it. Hachi's devotion is truly beautiful, his love for his master heart rending, and this movie is not to be missed. This will be one of my all time favorites and it's got the highest recommendation I can give. WHY this movie was abandoned by the studio is stunning - this movie has more heart than TEN \\"Marley And Me\\" movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is a very sweet movie.

This was a good movie, but being the dog lover that I am.... I will never watch it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good first half, upsetting second half","review":"I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel this weekend. It's based on a true Japanese story.Plot:One night, after returning home from a trip, a college music professor finds a stray Akita puppy at a train station. Several years later, after forming a very close bond with the dog, the music professor dies. Hachi keeps vigil outside the train station for about 10 years, until he passes too.I enjoyed the first half of the movie. However, I found the second half to be rather upsetting, seeing the dog grieve himself to death, living life as a stray. Definitely be sure to have plenty of tissues on hand for the second half of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Movie Ever","review":"I am a dog lover from way back, (72 Years Old). This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen. I watched it twice and cried more the second time than I did the first. I also have seen the Japanese version and it is great too. I cried just as much. I cannot bring myself to watch it again because I cry at the beginning because I know what is coming up next. I loved the movie so much I was going to buy an Akita. The place where I inquired about a puppy happened to be the breeder whose dog appeared in the movie and his brother was the sire of the litter he has for sale.

It is a true story how your dogs can grow attached to one person. LOVED this VERY much"},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing!","review":"I was really disappointed with this movie. I like the Japanese tale much better.This movie was not about loyalty, it was about not being able to let go or move on. Ten years later the wife comes back to the same small town to visit, and she looks like hell, still as depressed as the day her husband died. Why hadn't she tried to move forward in her life? The dog got older and more beaten down as the years passed him by.Loyalty is one thing, but living in the past is another. Could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just does not click!","review":"My wife and I were really looking forward to viewing this movie as we love animal movies of all kinds, especially dogs. Hachi is one lovable dog, extremely cute and full of acting ability. But unfortunately he is the best and only good part of the movie. The plot is non-existant with a movie that is so slow with no sense of developing the characters of the movie. Richard Gere does a pretty good job as does his \\"daughter\\", but his wife never warms up to the dog and we never learn why. Rent the movie, but just do not see why one should purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and dull as heck","review":"How on Earth did this movie get such high ratings??It's slower than a snail in molasses and nothing major ever even comes of it.

The dog's loyalty and love for its master is an illustration of beautiful devotion. Even if one is not a dog owner Hachi's example reminds that we as human beings were able to see loyalty and love in action. The film could influence people to treat their loved ones in that inspirational way. To know there actually was a dog that lived that loyalty in Japan makes the film even more laudible."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Disappointment Here!","review":"This movie was so sweet and gut wrenching at the same time.

I saw the Japanese version of this film, and I didn't cry too hard. I assume the subtitles made it less emotional for me. But, for Hachi: A Dog's Tale, I cried for about a full half hour even AFTER the film was over! Both versions are GREAT, and I encourage you to watch them both! This is THE BEST Straight to DVD movie I have ever seen. I'm kind of confused to why this movie was rejected from the theaters, but don't let that influence your decision to watch this movie! I cried like a baby, and I used up so many tissues. I have never been this moved my a film!

No cussing, no explosions and no killings. I cry every time I watch it. If only people could be as loyal as Hachi. I very highly reccomend this movie. I give it 10 stars. Richard Gere is not the star here it is the Akita Hachi."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a movie.","review":"This is more than an average good movie. It is a lesson in love, devotion, intelligence and kindness. It made me know how much an animal can love us. We too often underestimate the power of that love. It would take a cold cold heart not to melt watching this movie. It is truly a love story, and a reminder of how smart and sensitive dogs are. Be kind to animals my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed - more movies like this.","review":"It is wonderful to watch a movie without blood and guts hanging or pouring out of edifices somewhere on someone's body or sexual content so hot you could fry bacon on it. Although sad but true, this is a good movie for children since it shows compassion and love between a human and an animal. Not many people realize how devoted a dog can be and the suffering that goes on when abandonded or when they have lost their master. It would be great to find a human life-mate this devoted."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST AMAZING, TOUCHING TRUE STORY EVER!","review":"I bought several copies of this video for myself & friends.

Every person on this earth should see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humbled.","review":"It was in the last scene of the film that I realized just how good the film is. I couldn't move. I was so taken aback and stuck by a strange feeling of pain in my heart. Richard Gere finds a dog on the road and after numerous attempts at finding it a home finally decides to keep it. His wife is not a dog person so he doesn't know how to convince her but eventually...What really moved me about this film the most was - how complicated we make our lives and how much happiness can be derived from the simplest and noble most of things. This film is about a small community of regular people who care about one another despite being disconnected. Living in the city one tends to cherish little things like being part of such a system of community, unobtrusive and friendly.Wonderful film. I would recommend it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"Well trained dog. How faithful dogs are to us. Humans could learn from them. Found the ending sad, but liked the fact that it was a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, we cried over this one!!!","review":"Excellent movie. We have mailed it to our great grand daughters in Indiana and they enjoyed it as well. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real tear jerker","review":"Get out the tissues, you're gonna need it! Excellent movie, Gere is great, the dog magnificent and the supporting cast was well chosen. Joan Allen would not have been my choice for his wife, but she grows on you as the story progresses and she redeems herself when she encounters Hachi after having been away for a number of years. It is very touching. Gere's professor colleague/friend was a great choice and lent some much needed Japanese history & background to the tale. Jason Alexander was the least sympathetic character but overcame his schmuck role with some dignity near the end.Every child should see this movie for it character lessons and portrayal of undying love, as well as for its historical reference. It's on my list as Christmas gifts for the hard-to-buy friends. Enjoy again & again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie I have seen in a long time","review":"Having had an Akita I can tell you they are the most loyal dog of all dogs!! And I have had all kinds of dogs in my time! As you have read in other post about what happens I will not bore you with the details. I will tell you that you need to see this movie!! I cried almost from the start because Hachico reminded me of my Akita Max who I just put down a few months before this movie came out. The looks and mannerism was the same and it brought back great memories of my time with Max and how he waited for me when I was in the hospital for a week. So get your popcorn and klenex your favorite pet and see what love and loyalty are like in a age where even a spouse will leave you for no reason. Death could not deter this faithful dog from waiting for his master to return. The very end of this film is done wonderfully!!! very heart warming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hachi?","review":"This was a good movie, not much substance to it but over all a good retell of a famous story. It's not often you see the owner die before the animal most movies the animal dies and the owner is sad.The crazyest thing about this whole movie is that I have a cat named Hachi! I did not know anything about this movie or the story of Hachi-Ko when I named my cat over two years ago. I love the Japanese language and when I went to adopt him his coller had the number 82 on it to tell him apart from the other kittens and he was the last one in the bunch so I adopted him and the number in Japanese is Hachi-ju-ni so that is his full name but we just call him Hachi! I couldn't believe it. I had never heard of that name for an animal before! I thought I had an original name, guess not so much!Enjoy this movie for the story because it is a very heart warming story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully good and timely service","review":"As of today 1-30-13 I cannot say anything, as I had it shipped to a cousin in New Jersey. Haven't heard from her as to whether or not it arrived and in what condition. I will not ask her, as it is to be a surprise gift from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy unimaginable loss and tragedy...","review":"This movie starts out sad and only gets worse. Death of people, death of dogs, homelessness, neglect... you got it! If you enjoy choking heart ache and sobbing and movies that will ruin you for at least a week, Hachi is for you. Don't be fooled by the healthy pet and smiling actors on the cover. All will have masks of misery on about fifteen minutes in until this movie mercifully ends at last. It's the Terms of Endearment for dog movies, only without the humor and with a happy ending. Oh, that's right, there wasn't one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service and product!","review":"I'd been waiting to purchase this DVD for the longest time, but the price was always too high.

I am an avid animal lover and sit here today still affected by this movie...one week later! Flame me if you will, but this is the most depressing movie I have ever seen. POSSIBLE SPOILERS No sense of hope whatsoever. It was excruciating to watch this poor dog with his false hope, waiting, especially struggling healthwise as he became elderly. I am wasting my energy and it is probably illegal to tell my thoughts on the rest of the family who just left him! How could anyone sleep in peace? I prayed for a happy ending...I waited it out...no such luck. I will hug my dog and try to help any stray animals, even more so now.

Haichi was a GOOD dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie about death and grief too upsetting for my seven-year-old.","review":"The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. Nowhere did it even allude to the fact that this movie is about death and grief. My seven-year-old sobbed and sobbed for about the last 40 minutes of the movie. After his beloved owner dies (Richard Gere), the dog Hachi is grief-stricken and for the rest of his life waits at the train station for the master who will never return. It was heartbreaking.

I bought the film, but I will never loan it out to anyone. I might just break the DVDs, so no one can watch it. Although I'd rather not hear a sad animal story, I can withstand them. But this was a sad story made into awful. It had me upset for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Movie So Bad Our Family Still Talks About It","review":"This is one of those movies so incredibly bad that whenever my wife talks about watching a movie the kids remind her she picked out this one and she should not be allowed to choose any more movies. The kids don't yet get the nuances of bad acting but they certainly recognize a horrible movie when they see one. I don't know what people are thinking who rate this more than one star. Maybe they feel bad for the people who made this and think they deserve our pity. I pity the people who wasted their time watching this. Don't be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hachi A Dogs tale What a wonderful Film","review":"This was a wonderful true story, if you love Dogs or any animal, this is the movie for you.

It's obvious that Hachi is the centerpiece, but not annoyingly so. I do wonder if these dogs are all that dedicated to their master.I'm not fond of crying as much as I did (which Disney does too often) and it was a bit of a thin script too. Then again, I'm not sure how it could be made better though as it is a simple story which doesn't need to be overdone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great Movie about the freindship of a dog.I would buy more movies like this one.

This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, \\"I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no.\\" The story was too good for him to pass up.That's my recommendation to you: watch the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend, exhibiting loyalty such as you have never seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"Really great movie.

There are such changes in our environment and also in the elements affecting new-borns through their parents that mutations don't seem impossible anymore.Oh, certainly, the X--MEN are wildly exaggerated and beyond credibility as good comic book heroes should be, but there is nevertheless an underlying general theme.As an older guy interested in the two X-MEN movies, this graphic novel helps give me an introduction.

The X-Men, as Millar has shaped them, are insufferably jarring and their dialogue is insipid. Millar's Ultimate X-Men feels completely uninspired and characters seem ready to completely change the course of their lives and their moral ethos at the drop of a hat. Millar shows either no understanding or no regard for the rich relationship between Professor Xavier and Magneto. None of the concepts or moral ambiguity that makes X-Men comics so special is present in Millar's rehashing of the mythos .While the series may improve in later volumes, I cannot stress enough that this is not where a newcomer to the X-Men's legend should get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I hadn't read any X-Men comics (though I had seen the movies) untilI read this. I thought it was pretty good. I thought Wolverine/Jean relationship was kind of weird considering the age difference and that she barely knew him (and that's she's only 18 years old...) but still, it was good.The teen speak is a little off (kind of obvious it's how an adult guesses teens would talk) and the way Toad (a character from later issues) speaks is a litle so-so too. I'm an American teen and even I know British people don't say 'sodding' every other sentence.But even so, I thought it was good and didn't have any difficulty understanding it even though I hadn't read any X-Men comics prior to this. I reccomend it, even for teenagers and maybe some adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle version","review":"An entertaining book, marred by some formatting problems. There are multiple instances of strikeovers from the editing process that have left in the book. There are left-hand margin problems, also.

I also have a pair of B&W 684 speakers connected via Straightwire Octave II speaker cables. I have even connected my Pioneer DVD player to the amplifier.

The Monsters in this story are so morbid, but you can't help but want to squeeze them and love them. I remember one of intestinal organs saying, \\"Pooka, Pooka\\" and that really doesn't do it justice until you actually take a look at the visual element itself. I don't think Dirge actually meant for this to be a literary phenomena and it isn't, but what it is, is a candid, yet quaint protrayal of personified organs. I would recommend looking at this even if you aren't interested you will become interested because it will trap you in its glory. The illustrations are beyond cool.

We've all seen the weird apartment movies before. I tried and tried but this one didn't hold my attention. For some reason I can't think of the last Japanese horror film that actually did. It's either the ring,the grudge, or a copycat of one of those films... or are they the same film? I'm so messed up I can't even remember. The long haired ghost is just a mish mash of every Japanese horror movie I've ever seen...aside from the comedic ones. 1 Star from me this gets. I see some people gave it 3 or 4 or whatever.

This CD is a straight reissue of that budget release.That doesn't excuse the two songs' absence now, though; this just puts their absence into historical perspective.Perhaps the Legacy label will do a full reissue of this album, which deserves greater recognition, the way it did Johnny's classic first Christmas album a couple years ago.

I found Derber's upbeat style and witty presentation ultimately hopeful. It's a complicated topic, but this is a readable and important book. We need to wake up ourselves and our country to the reality of what's really happening under Bush (not to mention whoever wins in Nov) - let's demand our leaders and institutions do a much better job of implementing the fundamental ideals and human rights that our country was founded on and that we teach school children to believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly mindless little book I could not get through.","review":"It's pretty typical for a book which essentially says \\"It's all Bush's fault\\".

Some of his best guitar work, trumpets, accordian(!!!), and sparse percussive work. The electronic work harkens back to the electronic reworkings of Fields of Rape and maybe Death of a Man.The album is basiclly divided into two sections. The first are acoustic tracks with a bit of Boyd here and there. The tracks are all very good in sound quality and construction. These are some of DIJ's darker songs, but they have such a great and almost upbeat melody. I hesitate to use the word fun to describe this album, but it is.The second section consists of radical, electronically altered versions of the first half. Dark, noisy, menacing... All very, very brilliant.All in all, All Pigs Must Die continues the run that started with Operation Hummingbird and Take Care and Control.

This software is simply a gateway to their online music service. In itself that's not a bad thing but they have a history of using upgrades to sell you the same product several times. The current version in many ways is not as good as previous versions. It's a resource hog. If all you use your computer for is to listen to music you won't notice this but if you have to do anything else to do (other than word process), you'll find you'll be doing it in silence. Your real dissatisfaction will come when you need customer support. Ther responses you get are so generic you wonder if they even read your letter or if they can read at all. I had a problem and after five emails it is still unresolved. There are a lot of programs that will rip music and manage your files and there are a lot of suscription music services.

This item was close in appearance but that is where the similarities end. The marbled look is, as expected, a thin paper laminate over wood. This is the case with most plaques of this style. The problem with this one is that the laminate is not adhered to the wood very well at all, and gives a bubbled wavy look to the piece. The second, and greater, problem is the plastic cover. It is very thin. This was not expected. Other similar products come with a cover that is thick and rigid (4-5mm). this product comes with a cover that is about 1mm thick. This causes the cover to not lay flat against the frame and gives off a very wavy appearance. This also causes quite a bit of glare from office lights.Would not recommend this product. I give it an additional star for staying hung on the wall, the wooded frame itself is fairly sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect goldfish food!","review":"With less than 30% protein this is an excellent choice for goldfish.

I contacted Invicta and was informed that the stem had sheared and that it was a rather simple repair, however the estimate for the shipping and repair offered by Invicta cost more than I paid for the watch new from Amazon. I took it to a couple of watch repair shops and was informed by both that the repair was rather simple but the part from Invicta was rather expensive.

It takes the viewer through changes from his former angry, mean-spirited self, whose anger was visited upon everyone who came near him, to the day he was hit by lightning, causing death/near-death experiences, and a long road back to life. The life he finds he must live afterward, however is that of a changed man. He is truly touched by a transforming 'power' which he uses to build a new life, sharing his message with others. Eric's portrayal brought all the emotions one might imagine into the film. The depths of both sides of this personality were brought forth skillfully by Eric Roberts. The complications during his rehabilitation show the unexpected consequences of such life-changing events. The story is true, and I have heard Dannion speak numerous times over the years. He continues his 'new' life's journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Enchancing and Life Changing!","review":"I first saw \\"Saved by the Light\\" when it was broadcast in 1995.

Having dealt with many RMA's over the years, I'm amazed how unresponsive this vendor is. I will never use any PNY product for home or work."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY USELESS!!!","review":"I have a fairly new machine and wanted to turn it into a media center so I bought this card. The box claimed that it supported Vista but it doesn't work for me so I popped in a different drive to install XP with MCE. That process does not solve the problem either. The video jiggered after a few minutes after every power on or reboot.Giving it a benifit of a doubt, I installed the new drivers (Vista and XP) from their website to see what happen. BAD IDEA!!! Both Vista and XP got blue screen and while loop of reboot.

The camera is smaller than I thought it would be, and it is very lightweight too. The video light is very bright, and it is nice to have stereo microphones. It has a very durable feel.

I used it recently to help me devise lesson plans for a 5-week class for children ranging from 8-15 years old! Having it with me to consult during class boosted my confidence, since I had never used GIMP before teaching the class! My only additional comment is that I quickly discovered that GIMP, which is continuously being revised, has new and different features which are not covered in this book. Fortunately, the online manual fills these gaps. Still, I think this book was a good purchase, and I do recommend it to GIMP newbies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a GIMP book that's easy to use!","review":"This book is *so* easy to use.

I haven't actually purchased this item on amazon but do use this brand. I especially love it when I'm sick and stuffed up. I just dab a bit on/around my nose and within a few minutes I'm cleared up. I also like to rub it into my chest if I have a cough. It has a similar effect to Vicks vapor rub but I just love this more. If I have a really persistent cold I will rub some into my feet and cover with socks. I also think it does help with temporary pain relief.

Needs less Nebulous Drama, and more Direct Substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb film","review":"This award winning Italian film tackles a difficult issue in a subdued but dignified manner with great acting along the way. The title, \\"Don't Tell,\\" sums up the main question behind the film. When should you tell about deep secrets?The film's answer appears to be always. Sabrina's problems come from covering up her childhood suffering caused by her fathers' sexual abuse of her as a child. Will she ruin her retationship with the famous actor who loves her so? Of course he did cheat on her when she was with her brother in the states but he does not think it important.Relationships are very fragile in this drama which easity could have degenerated into a melodrama but the fine film avoids that danger and delivers a subtle but nevertheless real emotional impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I always thought that while movies about incest were shocking in, say, 1975, that path had been well-worn. Not to say that I'm only looking for shock in movies, but I found this highly-praised drama to be flat and bloodless. Sure the acting is good, but the script is rather pedestrian, the characters uninteresting, and after the end we don't get a sense that much has changed. And it's all told so slowly, with lots of portentious flashbacks (it reminded me in that regard of Barbra Streisand's Nuts, another wildly-overpraised film) as though there's this great profundity when in fact there's nothing but banality. I was waiting for the twist, the surprising insight, but it never came. The video box is plastered with awards and nominations, but compared to the ground-breaking Italian cinema of the past, this is banal television. Can't say I'd recommend this, unless you're looking for something light. Yes, light. It seems odd to describe a movie about incest that way, but 2007 isn't 1975."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Accessory; Near-professional Quality","review":"This is a wonderful camera flash accessory!After two years, adn losing the bottom component, I still use this all the time.If you follow the instructions properly it works great.

The 3d graphics are fine, actual talking in the game (for those who hate reading)!, a lot of fighting styles to choose from and u can even create ur own fighting styles! What is also awesome is that it has these 'magic spells' called Chi Arts (there are 6 types and each can reach lv3). Whats even more awesome is that once you completed the game, u can restart the game with all your stuff and u get a secret fighting style and with stronger monsters (but u start out as lv1 so that mite be some problems [e.g. die faster at lv1]) The only problems i think this game has is that there may be too many cut scenes AND that tasks can get real confusing (as in, at times, they dont give u specific instructions.) so you can be seeing urself roaming for bout half an hour til u get it.

The story is rather simple. A kind-hearted, semi-talented Irish heavyweight fighter comes to New York to fight Mike Tyson. Dan Starkey, a less than semi-talented journalist, is brought along to document the Irish fighter's American experience. Things get interesting when the fighter's wife gets kidnapped and a black extremist group is suspected.Colin Bateman makes good use of his humourous prose; he has great (and often crude) one-liners. He makes good fun of Americans and the Irish of all persuasions. I think only the most sensitive will be offended.Bottom line: lightweight but very funny.

But in the solo setting he's more of an entertaining player than a great musician. Aside from a few really memorable tracks on this one (Jimmy's take on \\"Joy Spring\\" is really something!), much of his playing on this disc lacks subtlety and taste. Some will also be turned off by string and pick noise throughout, and some of the playing lacks the clarity and articulation one would expect from a player of Jimmy's caliber.

It IS a difficult item to move. In the pictured folded state, the mat is taller than I am - not easily stored, and certainly not easy to transport. The handles are attached, but are a joke if you really want to be able to even lug this thing across your living room. This WOULD be a good product for a home gym if you plan to lay the mat out in a set location and leave it in place.

The thoughts are meandering, while there are some occasional general themes, it would appear that the artist was more interested in the form rather than the content of his expression.

Oh my. My husband put it on the first time and said it was hard, but I thought he was just exaggerating. I honestly spent 30-45 min. today trying to get the blasted thing on after having washed and dried it for only the second time. Granted, everything's more challenging with a bunk bed, but I got the regular sheet on in about 3 min. I am honestly thinking of putting him back in pullups so I don't have to deal with washing and changing it when he has accidents!!! It did do a good job of acting as a barrier and I didn't have pee cascading on me when I took it off his bed. **UPDATE: I originally gave this 3 stars, but the next time washing it, the expandable part totally ripped as we were trying to put it on the bed and was rendered useless. My husband was not yanking hard on it or anything. So, after about 2 weeks and 3 washes it was done for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Accident-Proof Mattress Pad","review":"I purchased two of these waterproof mattress pads for my son's bunk bed. He has frequent night-time accidents, and these work perfectly at protecting the mattress! Easy to wash and to install. They fit snugly and are quite comfortable as well. They are also very queit, as the protective barrier is sandwiched between two padded layers (no plastic rustling sounds!) It also adds a little extra padding to the mattress, adding to the comfort. I highly recommend these mattress pads for your kids' beds to protect your mattress and its warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Have Liked, But...","review":"We probably would have liked this pad more, but for one big thing... It is nearly impossible for one person to get it on a queen-sized bed. Also, it will not stay on the bed when you do get it on, sliding off repeatedly and easily. It did not want to lay flat either, but rather \\"bunchy\\". One other thing we didn't like is the non-woven polyester fabric sides. Since it was such a struggle to put on, we would have liked sturdier woven fabric sides. I wish the manufacturers would stop being so \\"stingy\\" on the sizing; this one was a little too small on the top-side, as well, before washing. This \\"stingy sizing\\" issue seems to be a common problem with most mattress pads now. Otherwise, we probably would have liked this pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simmons???","review":"It rips way too easy!!!!! It rips along the seem of the outer part. I expected more from Simmons. Buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations","review":"After a single wash, the fitted section ripped while putting the mattress pad on our bed.

The package they came in was fine so I'm sure they were done during manufacturing. Very cheaply made. Definatly not worth the price. Have returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality - ripped the day I bought it.","review":"This thing ripped the day I bought it putting it on the mattress - such a rip off! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that my daughter has wet the bed about 3 times and it's kept the mattress dry, so I'll give it that much. That said, I'm sure I'll need a new one in a matter of months because every time I wash it and have to put it back on it rips even more - it barely even covers the mattress now. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mattress pad!","review":"I purchased two of these mattress pads when my second son graduated to a big boy bed. Wow - how nice! The sides fit the mattress snugly yet adjust for a great fit. The fill is amazing! A friend thought I bought a pillow top bed for my 2 year old, and was surprised to learn it was the mattress pad that made it so soft. It washes really nicely, too. I bought cheap waterproof pads for my first son, and they fell apart within a month of washing. Not this pad! I'm going to order another for my older son now - you know, just in case he gets sick in bed or something, plus it will make his bed much more comfortable. Great quality; great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product Slightly different than I thought","review":"I was looking for the plastic backed matress pad and this one seemed to imply that in the description. When I got it there was no plastic lining to be seen. What I realized later is that the liner is inside the pad so you dont get all the crinkle noise etc. Well worth the money and seems to be working on my sons bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mattress pad","review":"We are happy with the mattress pad. You can't hear any crinkling noises when you move around in bed. It washes nicely, and so far, hasn't gotten stiff (I think we've had it about 4 months). But it seems to have shrunk a little bit in washing & you really have to pull & work on it to get it to not bunch up on the mattress, and that is the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating. I do like all the elastic along all four sides, making it able to fit a deep (or not so deep) mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for toddlers","review":"We bought this pad for our 2 year-old son's twin bed and it was so nice that we later purchased one for our Queen sized bed. It is soft and doesn't crinkle and make noise like other pads we've had. It also washes in the machine really well. We've washed my son's once a week since we bought it (about 6 months) and it hasn't changed a bit, still appears to be in great condition. Both the twin and the queen fit our mattresses well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cover I have had","review":"This cover fit perfect. I ordered the California King. Was waterproof and washed well. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very snug fit","review":"I put this on a new queen size mattress that was 9\\" thick. I would not say it is a perfect fit. I struggled to try and get the pad even around the circumference of the mattress, and did ok, but I am a little disappointed. Hopefully it will stay put and not ride up because the circumference is a little too small. I would have returned it, but it I bought my adult daughter a new bed with bedding for Christmas and set everything up today as a surprise. It will have to do. The quality appears great though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmons Mattress Pad","review":"Excellent purchase, second one we've bought this one in twin size, true to description and wears very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't feel or sound like plastic","review":"My initial reason for getting these (one twin size, one queen) was that my current pads were impossible to get on & off for washing. They were the kind that entombed the entire mattress, and then you zipped them up...ughh! Ask me how many light fixtures I've broken trying to mattress wrestle. I also decided I wanted waterproof pads now that one (or more) of my 3 kitties has decided that my spare bed is a lovely place to take a \\"tinkle\\" (I'm ready to take DNA samples to find the culprit). I digress. These Simmons pads are just perfect. So easy to put on, and yet they still feel like they're bonding. And they feel great, too. No \\"plastic-y\\" feel on either side, and the sound is also like a plain-old pad. Maybe I'll buy another one and make little diapers from the material for my kitties (okay, that's going too far...or is it?). Okay, seriously, buy these pads!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shapeless Shifty Mess","review":"This mattress pad is apparently oversized for a standard queen bed.

Washed up great, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as designed","review":"Two local places had a waterproof mattress pad selling for about $90-100.

I guess I should have known going in that a cotton BLEND wouldn't have the same soft feel as pure cotton, but I was surprised by just how stiff it felt. Oddly, the waterproof side intended to go towards the mattress was softer than the padded side intended to go facing up. It definitely had a plumper fill to it than some other pads, but I wasn't looking for that.It may be that some of the stiffness would have come out after washing, but I decided not to risk it and returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped the day I open this","review":"I bought this to put on my queen bed after my father-in-law moved out.

We were then told if the mattress is soiled in any way the manufactures warranty is automatically voided. We have a new baby which means numerous accidents like spitting up, and peeing on my bed while she is being changed. Well this mattress protector is great.

The only thing this mattress pad protects is Simmons' profit margin.Additionally, it is very hot and sweaty -- not comfy by any means, though at least it isn't loud.I hope someone benefits from my negative experience with this product.To solve the leakage problem: I put the $40 towards a microfiber base layer that is guaranteed against liquids, and a foam or fluffy merino mattress topper for coolness and comfort. So far, so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mattress pad","review":"Nicely constructed mattress pad which does what it's supposed to, protect our expensive mattress from getting soiled. The one minor improvement I would have liked is if the elastic parts on the side were more solid. We bought 3 of these for the house, and over time, 2 of those have the elastic parts torn from the sides from stretching when fitting it on the mattress. Still holds together though and the tear cant be seen under the sheets.

After doing research on coffee makers, I found out that the burnt taste was due to having having an inconsistent water temperature during the brewing process. I found out that the Bunn coffee makers were designed in such a way that the water temperature is accurate and consistent. As a result, the Bunn produces the most consistent and best tasting cup of coffee ever! As stated in other reviews, you do have to leave the coffee pot always plugged in to keep the water heated. Water is stored in a heating reservoir in order to ensure a consistent water temperature through the brewing process. If you choose to unplug the coffee pot, you will have to wait 15 minutes for the water in the reservoir to be heated to the proper temperature before the 3 min brewing cycle proceeds. That being said, I highly recommend this coffee pot and I will never depart from Bunn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee Maker.","review":"Coffee is quick and hot.

I bought this based on the positive review and that it is a quality, durable product. The complete brewing process was fast as advertised. However, the coffee that came out into the decanter was light brown water. And it tasted like brown water. It was not dark like normal coffee. Maybe because it was a High Altitude brewer and we are not in high altitude? I picked it for the office because it says \\"Commercial\\" brewer. For the cost of it I expected better tasting coffee.

I place it in the microwave for 40-50 seconds to reach my temp. A warning is you use twice the coffee of a conventional drip pot. With the cost of coffee, that should be kept in mind for a potential buyer. I have had many Bunns throughout the years and this is cleaply. There is no more carafe for measuring water nor a scoop for measuring coffee . We are seriously preparing to dump this pot and go back to our Cuisinart.

It might have a decent temp and it is fast but everything else is terrible. I use gourmet coffee and I like it strong, so I us a lot. Usually 2 tablespoons per cup. The brew basket only holds maybe 15 tablespoons if you are lucky, which is about 7 or 8 cups. You cannot make a full pot unless you want weak coffee. If you use more, it overflows and gets grounds in the coffee. Bunn sent me a flow restricter brew head, but it did not help. The brew head is cheap plactic and after changing out a several times it bacame stripped and would not stay on. Another drawback it that you need to leave the coffe pot on all the time for the water to be fast and hot in the water resorvoir. So in the morning if you want to make coffee, you have to turn it on about 15 minutes ahead of the time you want to make it or leave it on all night. I am still looking for the perfect coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this coffee maker","review":"BUT I can see that others may fear it.

Feeling that Jennifer needs a tutor to help her Drake hires Lauri Parrish, a teacher for the deaf. Lauri moves into Drake's house to help Jennifer, while Drake is on location for the soap opera. Sparks fly when Drake comes home for a break from his work. Eloquent Silence is a love story that will pull you in and grab hold of your heart.

How sweet a novel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love IT","review":"This is one of the best romance books that Sandra Brown has written. I love books about star crossed lovers.

Lauri falls for Drake but lives in the shadow of Susan, his perfect ballerina wife. Their loneliness, love for Jennifer and mutual passion bring them closer together, but Lauri still feels like a pale version of ethereal Susan.Brown's dated and misogynistic \\"Rebecca\\" knock-off pales in comparison to the original, but heats up the pages with steamy passages sure to curl your toes.

In the U.S., we started with commonly-held morals based on biblical commands and progressed to each of us making up his own individual set of values. The author is pessimistic about things getting any better. Don't look for solutions to the problems he enumerates. Rather, he sees us sliding down a slippery slope of disintegrating morals into eventual chaos. Honestly, if I'd known what the book would be like, I wouldn't have bought it. Having bought it, if someone had told me what it would be like, I wouldn't have read it.

He was so enthused about his thumb stabilizer that he took it off for me to try it on, large though it was! A walking talking advertisement!

I bought a brand name because i thought it would be better and it's not. The non stick surface isn't in a nutshell. I've had it for two years and most of that time has been spent in storage. Each time i get it out i think I can do this and then I have to hold it over the sink,soap the bottom plate up and scrub with a sponge. I really want to toss it out and buy another brand that cleans easier. Life is too short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it away","review":"This item is useless. First, all steaks, chops etc., come out very tough in relation to any other method of cooking. Second, it takes forever to clean it. You have to scrub it hard to get it clean, which is difficult to do considering the plates do not come off. After several attempts to get it to cook something other than hamburgers, we just threw it in the garbage. I'll never buy another - of any size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another model!","review":"This model burns everything so it is not edible, while leaving the center still raw.

It took a few episodes, but the show got back it's rhythm that Wells wanted. It wasn't supposed to mimic Sorkin or anyone else. John Wells needed to find his own strength and he did.For an example of his kind of quality, you have to look no further than Days of Our Lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad sequal","review":"After four of the best seasons for any series in television history, Season 5 of the West Wing was just aweful.

Certain dialogue parts are uneven and in one episode the degree of tension and anger between everyone was very different from the four previous seasons.Season 4, by the way, for those complaining about the kidnapping, was done that way to give the new writers something to work with since the heavy hitters were leaving.Overall, I'd say this doesn't measure up to the first four seasons, especially the first three, so, it's a few notches down.However, as the quality was so high, even though it's dropped a few notches, it's better than almost all of the current TV programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Sorkin's departure is evident...","review":"I am a fan of West Wing, good, bad or ugly. I know this season was not up to par with the previous four, but so be it, it is what it is. I still enjoy watching the show, regardless. One off comment I have is regarding the packaging.

I have an Asus Transformer Prime Tablet and while I was streaming the episodes for free and too many taps on the screen and I had bought the series, which I never intended on doing. There is no way to back out of it once it is gone and how in the heck do you contact Amazon to discuss a wrong purchase?? I have yet to figure it out.

Setting aside the loss of Sorkin's brilliant dialogue (which was for me, the main reason to watch) all of the characters had personality transplants. After 4 seasons, I felt like I knew these people, and all of a sudden aliens had taken over their bodies. The stories were another problem. Some may say that they were more focused on politics. To me the drastically shortened story arcs trivialized the purported issues and made them laughable. One of the strengths of the original show was the way story threads moved through time as they would in the real world. It gave the show continuity and life. Season 5 eliminated the continuity as if each show had a different writer who had never watched previous episodes. It should never have been produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a lovely happy lil comic.","review":"perfect family fun for hours!

I would think that's the most important. Anyway, this book gives a good intro to what is snowboarding, the history, the founders, the equipment.

You will be a whiz on all the freestyle terminology and different possible tricks but you won't know how these are done. Perhaps this book would be useful if you ever compete in Jeopardy and there is a category called \\"Snowboarding\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has everything except what I need","review":"Don't buy this book if you want to learn the technique of snowboarding. It mostly has info for those who would like to know everything about snowboarding except how to do it.

I was a little dismayed at the price per bag, but I soon found out that pretty much all GF specialty foods were on the pricey side and I needed to get used to it, especially b/c she had to order most of it online (add S&H;).But then they opened up a Trader Joe's right down the street from us this past year and we discovered a near-identical cereal product for half the price!!! Same flavor, same ingredients, same GF assurance...but only $2.99 a bag.They even started carrying this product in our local Kroger grocery stores recently, but it's still $6.99 per bag!!! So no S&H;, but you're still paying crazy $$$ for cereal.No contest for us...TJ all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff...","review":"I have been using this product since diagnosed with celiac disease several years ago.

A powerful male witch falls for a clumsy female witch who has mysteriously lost her powers. After awhile I felt she was too clumsy, and abit stupid for someone over 1000. I mean even if a witch loses her powers, she still should be able to handle herself to some degree living over 1000 yrs. I mean who gets stuck on a chandelier? I figured out early why she lost her powers, and who the Ancient One was. I also knew ahead of time the miracle that would break the spell. I mean they had much sex. Ms. Fletcher spoke over and over about what love is, felt like one of my school lessons.The book had a few moments but I am sorry I just cannot recommend it.

As the first book introduced us to a primitive society on the edge of extinction, Warlock exposes us to the larger world, technologically advanced and decadent, living off rich resources with no thought to the future. Merika is forced to do despicable things, but still we sympathize for her because she bled first. Cook weaves a tapestry of treachery, intrigue and deceit and Merika is our brutal sword slashing through it all and making her own path while we follow helplessly.

The most humurous part of this book is when someone's radio mic got stuck in the on position and the pilot of the Mustang was talking to himself about the mission, the bomber crew, and one of the other Mustang pilots of his squadron. A memorable quote from this part of the book was, \\"I was laughing so hard, the flak didn't even bother me!\\"This book is very detailed in every way! Mr. Fortier takes you on a journey back in time in the way he describes his experience as a combat fighter pilot. He briefly describes his training experience to where it's not bogged down and yet is very interesting and then moves on to the types of aircraft he flew from P-39's, P-47's, and ultimately P-51's.

It really did, but you just can't escape the facts. Meat Loaf's first two albums were fantastic, timeless classics (even though Dead Ringer sold about 30 million less copies than Bat out of Hell), both had something in common: Songs by Jim Steinman. Meat and Steinman split after DR and this is his first solo effort, and while the first two songs (Razor's Edge and the title track) are actually quite good, the rest of the album shows instantly why Meat never wrote his own songs back in the Bat days. His voice is in better form than Dead Ringer, much better, but the songs and the music just aren't up to snuff. Stay away from this album and go for his next effort, Bad Attitude... also known as his real comeback album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeesh . . .","review":"What would have happened if Meat Loaf hadn't teamed up with Jim Steinman, and instead got grabbed by purveyors of light-to-medium power pop? Midnight at the Lost and Found.There are two songs worth a listen here -- the rousing title track, and the Elvis cover \\"The Promised Land.\\" The rest of it is Loaf back in good vocal form but singing bad, bad songs.

That said, Warner cut corners on making the DVD. There is no additional content other than the programs that aired. But the real shame is the sound -- they put this series out in Dolby 1.0. So if you have a home theater setup, the only sound that will play is a very, very tinny soundtrack coming out of the CENTER CHANNEL ONLY!!! They could have spent pennies more and released it with Dolby 2.0, which would play out of your main stereo speakers. As it is, there is no advantage to buying the DVD over taping the shows off the air (for time-shifting) other than convenience, and the shows are on heavy rotation on the cable channels. PLUS -- taping them off cable or satellite, the shows sound 100% BETTER!!If you are willing to put up with this kind of ripoff production quality, the shows are charming and really quite funny, once you get into them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit with little girls","review":"My 3 daughters, ages 4-11 all love to watch this DVD series.

Christina Ricci and Matthew Lillard are also good actors, and I was hoping for a cute little movie. But within minutes, my excitement took a sharp turn. The acting and storyline are just plain BAD. The performances are so over-the-top, especially by Chris Wylde, that they were more akin to what you'd expect from a goofy kids movie (like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers). This was so true that I thought that kids might have been the audience they wanted, except that there were some definite adult themes, and so it really became this aimless, horrible thing. I don't know how so many well-known actors got roped into doing this flick, but it was pathetic and a struggle to watch the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Season Yet!","review":"I feel this is the best DVD Season for Gilmore Girls.

I thought surely this season would be better than the fourth season (which wasn't terrible, but had more cons than pros, in my opinion). But it's been a major disappointment. The only good thing about this season is that Luke and Lorelai are finally dating. Rory is no longer the smart, innocent girl we liked in the earlier seasons. Instead, she's only interested in trapping herself a boyfriend and sleeping around. Her relationship with her mom is extremely two-dimensional, and the witty banter that was such a delight in other seasons is now slow, lacking in references, and just plain boring.

Such abstention is bad for the soul) nor does she really fool around with young men. The show started to go wrong when Rory decided to go to Yale instead of Harvard; the result? NOTHING CHANGED. Rory was home every other episode, it was Chilton+. Nothing new. The episode where the Independence Inn burned down was the episode where GG jumped the shark; to whit, when it reached its high point and began its decline.

I checked it out of my library for years until the sad day it disappeared. At the time there was no way to find it except searching through stores which specialized in rare and out of print books. I then added it to my birthday wish list, then waited years before getting my own copy. What makes this book special though is unique recipes and interesting combinations rather than the specifics of preserving. You'll never need another idea book for beautiful and interesting gifts!

This one matters. It is revealing of a great talent playing the music of a totally different type of genius...emotion and intensity meets...a different sort of emotion and intensity. Not for the conventional stickler or the exclusive lover of mechanistic baroque theory. This is deep emotional beauty cast out in a set of musical exercises that while technically perfect, are also wired with all the baggage and wonder of Glenn Gould's playing (and humming)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gould is a genius.","review":"You'd have to be as bizarre and crazy as Glenn Gould was to pass up an opportunity to own the debut album of one of the greatest musical minds of the century.This one is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Essential. Buy this *and* the 1981 version.","review":"It requires a little justification to own two copies of the same piece. Moreover, owning two copies of the same piece by the same performer might be thought of as bizarre. However, Gould's interpretations of the Goldberg Variations are infinitely rewarding, each in its own and especially as two views of the opus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gould/Bach partnership never ceases to amaze","review":"The continuing power of this recording is a one-off. Having listened to it more than any other record, it still sounds new, fresh, pristine, sparkling with insight and power to move. Goulds ability to make each note stand out as a single entity with a life of its own, occupying a different dimension in space, in the midst of a passage at breakneck speed, is one of the many facets of this incredible recording - the one piece of music I can listen to infinitely, at any time or mood. Only five stars? Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired and Important","review":"Someone who hates to hear Bach on the piano would deny us pianists the chance to play some of the greatest keyboard music of all time.

Enjoy these as the wonderfully expressive works they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gould reconsidered and so should we","review":"Gould's '55 recording of the Goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man. Perhaps it needed to be played this way, at least once, or perhaps Gould needed to play it this way at that time.He thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time. It is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound, but how beautiful it is! Bach doesn't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did Gould. You can still hear his vocalise (love it or loathe it - I love it), but the passion, depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else's efforts too. Hear them both and then decide for yourselfRIchard Maycock"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gould ruled","review":"Love him or hate him, Gould's contribution to the technical lexicon of classical piano playing is undeniable with this rightfully historic offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Marvel's few Modern Day Classics","review":"I know what you're thinking...Black Panther, big friggin deal.. and yes, you're right, he was never much of a character as used in the FF and Avengers comics of the 60s and 70s. He had no real powers and no real personality. He seemed to be there for the sake of political correctness, nothing more. But things have taken a 180 degree change, believe me. Priest has put the character into a world that plays like a major motion picture with believable situations based T'challa's status as a major world leader. The characterizations and dialogue are all equally convincing. The best part is how the supporting characters and the villians fill in the void of the mysterious, aloof T'Challa, with their own interpretations, leaving you, the reader, to make up your own mind about just who or what T'Challa/Panther is. This ranks with anything Alan Moore or Chris Claremont ever did, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent collection- writing and art are top-notch","review":"this is the first story arc in what should have been a series that continues this day.. just canceled in 2003..Mr. Priest's work has a political sophistication that never comes off as too snarky or heavy-handed, especially in an era where most fans want their comics to \\"only\\" be escapist fare.. the art by Texiera was a great opener to the series, it's too bad he left after this arc..If there is ever a movie made about the Panther, this is the tale to base it on.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very expensive strobe light","review":"Bought this as a dual reading lamp.

Oh, and if you wander too far and find a way *around* where they want you to go, you'll find yourself stuck, having to reset to the last save.This game was originally set for the original X-Box, but took so long to develop that they had to upgrade it to 360 status. The problem is that they didn't upgrade enough.This game leads you by the nose, and is fun for twenty minutes or so, before getting frustratingly familiar.Please don't buy this game unless you've already played through it and for some reason really like it.

You'll be saving your game progress a lot (trust me, you WILL). The battles get redundant and the puzzles to solve in regards to manipulating time are no-brainers and not that difficult. Aside from the redundant battles, slow time power charging, and so-so weapons, this game was a huge disappointment. I recommend that you RENT the game and not shell out $59.99 for it.

But two of the corners are broken, those cheap plastic corners are what hold the metal frame in place, which is what holds the cheap outer panels in place. It was just broken enough to where it would still open and close and look like normal, but the slightest pressure and everything falls apart.

In fact I saw little chemistry between most of the actors in this movie--the \\"acting\\" between the players was obvious, especially between Newton and Evans, even the last scene lacked chemistry between the two, when you can't get the final love scene emotionally charged there is definitely something missing--dropping the takeout plate and throwing your arms wide open isn't exactly a tender, touching love scene--Newton at least did better there than Evans.

You should expect much more from a film than this one delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Dull Film","review":"This is very lifeless and boring movie, as are the three \\"younger\\" lead \\"actors\\". The whole cast is too old for the age they are supposed to be playing. The beautiful scenery can't make up for the fact that the storyline is not fleshed out, and neither are the characters. If you want to purchase a fine Hallmark movie, I would recommend \\"Pictures of Hollis Woods\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor acting- total sleeper","review":"Wow! I couldn't believe all of the good reviews on this movie. Short and sweet; plot is very predictable, and the acting is subpar. It's obviously this was a low budget film starting with the first \\"explosion\\" while the soldiers were in camp. Not all low budget films are poorly scripted, however this one takes the cake. Don't waste your time on this movie, unless you want to see a slew of bad acting and comedic attempts at a love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely movie","review":"This movie was really nice. It's less about the war, than it is about a soldier coming home to find a place to belong. It was refreshing because it takes place in a small town, and the main character is an attractive young woman who loves the small town she lives in, and feels no need to move away to a place that is more sophisticated and glitzy. It's a heartwarming movie, and well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Card","review":"They don't get much better than this.

It's one of those that will give you the warm fuzzies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, ..obviously a TV movie.","review":"This 'movie' is a TV movie that romanticises war and 'Christian values'. I could not finish it. Very sappy lines and acting. For example, Jones shows Cody a picture of his girlfriend, and later when Cody meets the girlfriend she has on the same sweater as in the picture! Did they think that we wouldn't recognize her? I would give it zero stars. Koolaid for those who have already had too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Christmas Card Movie","review":"I had never heard anything about this movie, so was pleasantly surprised at this. It's about a woman who writes a Christmas card to an unknown serviceman in Afganistan, and how that letter sustained and encouraged him. When he was on break in the U.S., he decides to look up this woman and meets her and her family, and really never identifies himself as the soldier who received her card. The woman had a very long standing serious boyfriend, whose relationship gets very complicated as they fall in love.This is a touching Christmas movie with a lot of great scenes about true love. I love how the marriage of her parents and the family business was portrayed, they were a family you wished you came from.It was a bit predictible in story plot, but still it left you thinking about the deeper issues of life and the holidays besides gifts and getting and the whole holiday busyness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time","review":"We have added this movie to our tradition of watching Christmas movies at holiday time as a family.

The beautiful real Christmas story is presented so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, clean, very fun movie.","review":"Honestly, at first I thought this movie looked a little boring. From the cover, it looked only ok. I then watched this, and loved the small-town scenes and old-time romance between the parents. It was a fun romance too, but it seemed that Cody was much more interested in Faith than she was with him. Whether she was just ignorant, or purposefully not interested, she was extremely dry and unaffectionate. The movie was almost perfect, if only Faith would have been more real and emotionally in touch with what was going on between her and Cody. This movie is suitable for all ages; no swearing, perverse actions, or anything else. I really enjoyed this movie because it was not like the trashy movies being made today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie","review":"This is a wonderful Christmas movie and I highly recommend adding it to your collection!

You will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Christmas Card","review":"This is a wonderful story, that I watch at least twice during the Christmas holiday season. A twist of fate sent a young soldier to find the young woman who sent him a Christmas card. Instant attraction occurred between the two, with Dad playing matchmaker after he saw what was happening. The spoiler was the traveling selfish boyfriend, who started aggressively romancing her only after Cody came on the scene. True Love does win in the end, and a lonely young man finds a family at last. This is a wonderful movie, which stresses love, family, hard work and fair play. This movie is certainly a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy junk","review":"This Christmas I DVR'd THE CHRISTMAS CARD and BOYFRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS based on amazon recommendations. I have learned my lesson!I guess there are a lot of people here who are into sappy movies, but this is just bad. The acting is terrible and the story is silly. The premise was nice, but ugh ugh ugh. So much bad is going on with this movie that I cannot believe they made it. I did get through it, but ill not be wasting time on movies like this (lifetime movie of the week) ever again. If you want a cute, sappy, well-acted movie try Christmas in Connecticut or some other classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, but for Ed Asner","review":"This is a great Christmas movie, with beautiful scenery, and a heart-warming story.

The man is told to take some leave that he needed to get away for awhile. He took the dog tags back to the widow and went on to find the lady who sent the card by going to the church mentioned in the card. She is already involved with another man.

It is good for the whole family because it is a very clean movie with no sex or language. The acting was just ok for me. I felt that Cody could have shown more emotion. I know he was military so that made him more on the reserved side, but it was a love story! I wanted him to show a little more passion in his emotions.

By its own merits it hardly deserved the success it provided for the artist, since it's wholeheartedly plagued by unmemorable MOR material glazed in a slick & dated production, though its most cringe-worthy quality is how passionless Neil Diamond and his backing musicians perform the material (not like the songs allow much room for vivid interpretation in the first place). The album did produce \\"Heartlight\\", an early top 10 hit for Bacharach/Sager in the decade, but while they would move on to write and produce many hits throughout the decade, Neil Diamond drifted from major public attention for the rest of the eighties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combination Vehicles","review":"This book combines Combination Vehicles with Doubles and Triples.

The Woolie brand is still going strong. We had to manufacture new handles to hold the wire frames in order to continue using the Wagners.

As post WWII Britain was not the best time to explore British culinary traditions. I dare say that it only takes a half dozen good or bad restaurants to make or break the reputation of an area. So take the Epicurean out of this book's title. Some 20 years after this book was written I spent a few months in and around London. The finest steaks and prime ribs were to be had.

When the Sennheiser headphones arrived I fully charged them and was surprised that I had a terrible hissing/static noise. I thought they were defective until I went to the Sennheiser site and downloaded the instruction sheet. I found out that there is a lever on the base that adjusts up to three different frequencies. I moved it over a notch and voila! the noise went away. I've suggested to the sellers that they include that sheet with the headphones to avoid confusion about this feature.

My guess is everything from my computer sound card could be heard on the cordless too, given the right channel/tuning conditions. I expect the design flaw isn't limited to this brand/model but for all wireless headphones. But since the drawback wasn't mentioned in the product description, here it is in a review.For what it's worth, the sound quality when not buzzing was very good, and they were comfortable ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"works well but is difficult to store charging on the stand.","review":"The headset works well for listening,the audio is good but it is easy to detune by accident. You have to retune it many times when you take it off the stand. When you store it for charging on the stand, many times the headphones have to be physically adjusted so that it will reliably charge on the stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"RS120 Wireless","review":"If you consider that this product is wireless and not compare it to a connected headphone than it is quite nice. The hardest part to adapting to wireless is tuning. If you want to listen to radio (AM or FM) or a TV, the tuning can be very hard because just moving the dial a trivial amount will bring in another station but once you finally \\"find it\\" the sound is excellent. There are occasions when you may turn in a certain direction and briefly lose the signal but it is not bothersome compared to the convience of wireless. The signal travels throughout my home and yard with no problem but I have not tried any further. All in all, a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Very Pleased","review":"This is my 3rd wireless headset, my 1st was A JVC set for about $45.00 not so good, Ok sound, and interference, If you turn your head to one or the other side you get nose. My next was A Vizio wireless for about $300.00 surround sound with an ipod/iphone dock very nice sound but interferance from some house hold components. So I tryed this one, I can go into other rooms upto over 100 feet with no dropouts, for analog the sound is very good I have had them for too months with no problums.

Also good background on the history of the region. I give the book an A."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most badly written sports books of all time","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers. Although this book is well researched it is almost painful to read. I can't believe that the Wall Street Journal pays Mr. Prager to write and I find it even more incomprehensible that the editor at Pantheon let this book go out like this.Luckily I got to read an Advance Reader's Edition and didn't pay good money for this book. If you really want to read it just wait a year or so - their will be plenty of remaindered copies out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly researched!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I was born in 1966 so I don't know much about the \\"Shot Heard Round the World.\\" I am a baseball fanatic but even if I wasn't, this book develops the characters of two people who were drawn to each other for a lifetime because of one simple moment that was so important for so many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Me Out to the Ballgame Again - Please!","review":"As soon as I finished reading Echoing Green, I had to write to tell the author how much I enjoyed it. I wasn't even five when \\"the shot\\" happened, and my Dad was fighting in Korea, so I don't have any personal memories of it. But still, as a kid growing up in the late 50's & earlier 60's, many of the names that were mentioned were heroes of mine. And although Bobby Thomson never was (probably because I eventually ended up becoming a Dodgers fan), I still loved the book and didn't want it to end. Probably, it will only appeal to a sports fan, and maybe only even to an older baseball fan at that. But even so, it's one of the best sports books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I've tried, I've made it to 100 pages, I can't take anymore.

Only try this one when you have lots of time and plenty of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book actually contains the following sentence:","review":"\\"Mueller, of all his team best at directing a pitched ball into the gaps afield, did so now...\\"If you enjoy pretentious, overwritten prose such as that, you'll probably love this book. Because the entire book is written that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many books in one","review":"Thumbing through Echoing at Borders, I bought it expecting nostalgia. It delivered that and more. To me, the book was also a social history of our changing times. To wit: on page 247, Prager reports thatafter the home run, Thompson went on the Perry Como show, then took a cab to the Staten Island Ferry. It is hard to imagine one of today's players using public transportation on a night like that.As others have reported, the book is a bit difficult to read in spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"4-2 in 9?","review":"I love baseball history and enjoyed this book. I have been a fan for almost 50 years but I have one question. If they were stealing signs how come they went into the bottom of the 9th trailing 4-2? Shouldn't the score been more like 11-4 Giants after 8? Would they go the whole game and not steal signs until the last inning if they had that capability? On such an important game, I doubt it! But it makes one wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes--tough read.","review":"I thought that the author uncovered some interesting 'side' stories to the drama that was the 1951 National League season. Prager's inclusion of the tragic electrician who suffered physically and morally as he listened to his Dodgers come undone was extremely interesting. But, the style of writing was horrendous. All I wanted was an interesting read to get me ready for baseball season. It is really a chore to read through this book. As stated in earlier reviews it is way to verbose."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Echoing Green","review":"The book is very interesting because of the subject, but it is over-written, and the writing gets in the way of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Word Fillers","review":"Overloaded with extraneous, and occasionally manufactured information. Jumps around regarding the main characters and emphasizes bit players far too much.Why tell us that the electrician cheated on his wife, or that Bobby Thomson's mother was pregnant well before her marriage?Thomson may well have been tipped off that a fastball was coming, but he still had to hit it, with results similar to what he did against the same pitcher without the \\"advantage\\" two days before in another ballpark.This matter should have been allowed to rest in peace. The whole thesis of the book is smarmy, as is the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much is Made of the Author's Writing Style","review":"Yes, this book can be difficult to read at times, due to the author's penchant for unnecessarily convoluted syntax. But the sentence structure doesn't get in the way as much as other reviewers have noted, & I smiled at the subtle humor sprinkled throughout. Every few pages I came across a weird sentence that needed to be re-read to be understood, not that big a deal (although I wondered, was he taught to write like that, or did he go out of his way to turn a simple thought into a complicated sentence?). I enjoyed this book for its wealth of detail, & I appreciate the vast amount of research Prager has done in compiling the most thorough study of this event. Or, should I have said, \\"A wealth of detail in compiling the most thorough study of this event, Prager a vast amount of research has done, & this book I enjoyed & am in appreciation\\"? The bottom line is: it's a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and on and on,,,,,,And on.","review":"OMG. Let's get on with the story of \\"The shot heard round the world. \\"By chapter 9 I was so fed up with how the Giants used every possible technology known to man to steal the catcher's signals, I wanted to scream. No. I just stopped reading the book. I know the story of the \\"Miracle of Coogan's Bluff,\\" but I don't care that Durocher spent 9 chapters trying to steal signs. Sorry. I love the game, my uncle was at the game and there are much better books on the market that tell what happened in this, one of the greatest sports stories of all time.

Most of the packs will be the cheap dime a dozen pro set, score, etc, from 1990 and 1991. These sets, in any form, are just not valuable. You can find boxes of unopened cards for these sets and better ones for a couple of dollars from card dealers at your local flea market, or card show.It is definitely fun to go back and open these old packs, but I would suggest spending the time to shop around first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Assortment","review":"This item shipped to me in a timely manner and there were (30) wax packs just as advertised. The huge problem that I have, is with the content. The seller clearly states, \\"cards from the 80's and 90's.\\" In fact there were NO packs (zero) from the 80's at all! Twenty-nine packs were from 1990, 1991, & 1992. There was one pack from 1994. It is as if the seller took no care or time to have a even distributement of different years. I have collected, sold, and bought sports cards of all types for years and never have I been more disappointed! This is false advertising and if you are looking for something like what the seller states, believe me you want to stay away from this!

Most of all the mesh windows are placed perfectly for the animal to be able to breath and look out of the bag.The only downside is durability. I left the bag out for my cats to get accustomed to and they made plenty of scratch and bite marks on it. I suggest hiding it and using it only when you are going to transport your animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usable, but not great for unhappy cats","review":"Got this to take my cats to the vet. The only real problem is that they could escape unless the zippers were held tightly by hand.Pros:-Lightweight, collapsable design is easier to store than hard plastic case-Washable liner providedCons:-The zipper and clasp closure leaves enough room for my cats to stick their heads out. If they push hard enough, they can loosen the zippers and jump all the way out-Stitching has started to fray even after light use (probably only 5 times in the past 4 years).Not recommended for cats!

Please pass this game up!","review":"This is the worst Garfield game I have played. You have to collect mice because they have stolen Pooky, but the mice don't put up any fight at all. You collect one mouse, take it to the cage, get another mouse, take it to the cage. It's the same thing throughout the whole game, but they switch it up so you have to take Odie to a hole and have him dig. The game play is exactly the same though. Very annoying, very repetitive. If you want a good game for the DS, Garfield's Nightmare is good. A good game on the Game Boy Advance is Garfield and His Nine Lives. This game should be passed up because it really is HORRIBLE. Even after I read the reviews, I still purchased it from Game Stop and thankfully I bought it used and I took it back and got my money back. The negative reviews are right! Bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pookie","review":"This game is fun to play! You are searching for pookie, the mice have stolen it! First level you have to catch all the mice in the house before john lets you out then the next level your outside in the yard with odie digging up the yard to see if the mice buried him the the yard! You do have opticals in you way to get through in the first level it's bees in the second it's butterflies cause you have to get rid of things that will distract odie from digging!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the pie to Garfield's face, this game is KERSPLAT!","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Garfield. I have read EVERY single comic strip of Garfield, since day 1 it has been out. I recieve emails on Garfield comics everyday, since it updates everyday with one comic strip. When I saw this game, I thought this would be the cutest game, and perhaps fun. My boyfriend and I tried it out, and we thought it was the DULLEST game out there. It was no fun at all. All you do is collect things and put into cages and make sure you eat things. The jumps he does are HORRIBLE. It is either over-simplistic, or just plain lame. I was obviously very disappointed in this game, coming as one big fan of Garfield's. I immediately sold it back to EB games.. I didn't even want to wait for ebay bids--I wanted it off my hands ASAP.

If you own the original master and are hesitant to buy the remaster, trust me- the 12+ minute track of \\"The Grand Canal\\" alone makes the purchase worth it!

I loved it because I was lucky enough to see the actual show. You have to be in tune with both the characters, and really understand the music. Bottom line the 'in remarks'. The music and story line are difficult to imagine in ones head because its a visual that then sticks in your head. It first came out twenty years ago and it still in my head. That must say something about it. Tommy Tune was one of the top choreogragher of his time.Its a pity that more people don't revive GOOD shows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The show is very Italain","review":"I own this orignal recording and the stand out performers are Anita Morris- her Call From The Vatican is vocally amazing and her costume is very sexy. The orchestrations for the show are beautiful. I also have the 1992 London concert cast with Jonathan Pyrce, Ann Crumb, Elaine Paige, Lillane Montevecchi- tony award winner from the orginal cast and Becky Norman. This concert version is a more complete version of the show that the original. Jonathan Pryce, Elaine Paige and Ann Crumb are stronger performers and the chorus is larger and adds men to the chorus. I recommend both cast albums. They should add the 1992 concert cast album to their buying list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill","review":"If you have not studied mathematics extensively, at least an undergraduate major, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is dense, abstract, has very few concrete examples, and has quite a few errors to boot. De La Fuente is a mathematician in full glory, and the student of economics is often left wondering when he will get to the relevence to economics.To be fair the book does cover most topics at a higher level of sophistication than most other mathematical economics textbooks. It does a nice job covering calculus and the implicit function theorem, if you have seen these topics before. However, unless you have had about 8 semesters of college level mathematics of more, you will not be able to read and comprehend this book on your own without a class.Most of my colleagues at UC Berekeley have been unhappy with this book. If you must use this book for a course, try buying another book as supplement. I recommend Mathematics for Economists by Simon and Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for first year grad students","review":"I purchased this book because it was on the suggested list for my economics PhD program. This book was too difficult for most of us. It claims to be arranged in a more intuitive way than the typical math econ book but most of us graduate students found this book indecipherable. There are books that are much more approachable for students at that level. After a few attempts to use it, I never opened the book again. The good thing I have to say about this book is that it held its value and I was able to resell it on Amazon for a decent price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, specially for a Penn PD in Economics","review":"Very good book to have if you plan to be an economist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Three Math Econ Books","review":"I bought this book for my Ph.D.-level mathematical economics course, and although I'd gotten an A+ both in Calc I and the honors section of Calc II the year before, I could make neither head nor tails out of the book. Sure, de la Fuente might work alright if you already think fluently in mathematics, but even if you do, you'll probably find Simon and Blume's book superior. If you don't think fluently in math, I'd suggest Alpha C. Chiang's math econ text instead. If you're just trying to learn mathematical economics, don't even open de le Fuente or you might find yourself unnecessarily abandoning the study of economics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and nothing like picture","review":"I was searching last christmas for an upside down wall mounted christmas tree.

One flower is crinkly and the other has a small rattle inside. It's very quiet, which may be a pro, but I have found that I wish it were a bit noisier, as it does not hold my daughter's attention much. She does love chewing on the crinkly flower, though. The other drawback is that the flower bouquet is not attached to the wood, but rather tied on, so it tends to slide and rotate to the inside of the ring. I have to keep re-tying it tighter. Not a big problem, but just a minor annoyance. Overall, I like this toy, and I love the way it is a conversation starter for other moms who comment on it.

This drill is excellent, I would like to say that it's much closer to deserving a five star rating than a four so let's give it four and 1/2.... If balance is a must, this drill has it, even with the extra pound I added with the quick exchange bit, and drill and drive system I use. User fatigue doesn't seem to be an issue. The only thing I noticed that may take some getting use to is the 3 speed clutch. At times the drill doesn't seem to want to advance out of a gear so it's necessary to run the drill, allow the motor to stop and try again. Not a big issue and if it's the only one I can't complain!! Do yourself a favor and look closely at the 14.4 volt Porter cable. If you dont mind the extra 20$ on the price tag it may be the only comparable drill on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"did't last long","review":"I have a Dewalt corded drill and plate jointer, and like them.

But alas, it lost its luster when I heard the Philips CD featuring Arthur Grumiaux (Philips 420700). I would encourage lovers of this music to give a listen to Grumiaux. I found his interpretations to have the best rhythmic, melodic and musical sensibilities of any that I've heard. Technique is invisible; it's the music that comes through with transparent clarity, strength and sensitivity. And the Philips transfers are outstanding.

I had the basic idea of the album though: the Boss armed with his lonesome howl and his guitar. After taking long enough, I finally went out and got me a copy. After listening to it once, I only have one thing to say.Wow.This album is stark, dark, lonesome, and hard. It's a complete turnaround from Bruce's usual loud, fist-pumping rockers. These songs are stories of everyday people, as usual, but these stories are bleak and have no happy endings. This is a rough album.Nearly all the songs captured me (except for State Trooper), but some standouts are the title track, Atlantic City, Johnny 99, Highway Patrolman, and My Father's House. The track Nebraska is truly terrifying and stays with you long after the last song has been heard.All in all, this is an excellent CD. I'm still trying to stockpile Springsteen's discography, but this one is a definite winner. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spingsteen stark and cold","review":"Sandwiched right into The River and Born in the USA this shows how Springsteen's work covers all areas.

Take for example the keyboards in \\"Born In The USA\\". So I was worried that since this album came out in '82, that it would be too cheesily polished. It blew me away to hear track after track of excellent acoustic songs. Nebraska is a gritty, black-and-white movie that is at once creepy and heartbreaking. I immediatley recognized the true events that the title track is based on.(The same events were the basis for the Martin Sheen film \\"Badlands\\" and propably inspired \\"Natural Born Killers\\") Nebraska is excellent. And this is coming from someone who can be critical of Springsteen without feeling guilty of blasphemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, challenging album","review":"\\"Nebraska\\" was a great risk, a great challenge, and in the end, a great masterpiece.

It's a ballad about the New Jersey town famous for its boardwalk,casinos and nearby hotels. \\"Put your makeup on,fix your hair up pretty,and meet me tonight in Atantic City.\\",are sample lyrics from the song. Unbelievably,this album flopped just after the abundant success of 1980's THE RIVER. But the follow-up BORN IN THE U.S.A.,released in '84,would be an even bigger success than THE RIVER.

Basically how to play: you are given an ad slogan or jingle, or mascot and you have to name the product. The object is to climb the \\"ladder\\" in an ad agency. Some of the cards are very easy, and some are hard. There are very new ad campaigns and \\"classic\\" ones. There are even super bowl ads. We have played it so much since Christmas, that we know alot of the answers, so we need them to come out with sequel cards, like the \\"Scene It\\" company did.I think this game would be especially fun when entertaining guests.

I can do all my assignments for class and get A's on the exams, but when I sit down to read the text, I wonder what language Joyce Farrell is speaking.

You will soon wish to drive a stake through your skull. The band members are not bad musicians, but they are solidly average. The singer, well he can hit higher notes than I can, which would be impressive if he didn't sound so much like a prepubescent boy.CIWWAF is clearly attempting to follow in the footsteps of Fall Out Boy or Panic!

But at the same time the songs are fun as anything to listen to and i plan on doing a lot of that now and in the future. I had no idea about this band before i purchased the CD.

Try All Time Low, remind me of these guys a little bit but they are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"When I first heard this cd, I didn't like it. After a few more listens it grew on me, but it's still a little hard to take in one sitting. The problem is, Cute try to do too many things in too little time. At some points, the sound like New Found Glory. At others, they sound like a toned down version of Panic at the disco. As for the ballads, think paramore meets october fall. It's pretty messy, but it grows on you after a bit. I still think the band does best in NFG mode (examples: Sweat the Battle Before the Battle Sweats You, Sweet talk 101 and There's a Class for This), but thats just a matter of taste. Also, many people have raised the point that the album suffers from too much filler. I agree, with reservations. When a band tries many different styles on an album, some of the songs can sound uneven, or, not as \\"good\\" as others. Again, this is really a matter of taste. Hopefully the band will expand on the energetic pop-rock sound they fit best with, and deliver a better follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album purchased in a long time","review":"Should have bought it from Amazon, but we were going to be in Orlando the day it came out and we were at the Virgin megastore in Downtown Disney so I bought it there and paid $15 for it.

His last great work, \\"A Mathematician's Apology\\" represents one man's dissolution and subsequent crystallization of lament, despair, and acceptance: the same that will inevitably veil us all, perhaps not though, to the same extent. I believe Hardy's trepidations surrounding death had less to do with corporeal existence than acknowledging the slow demise of his postcard universe of a bygone Cambridge - that Ivory Tower teeming with the greatest minds of his generation, all players in the graceful game of numbers.Credit must also be given to C.P Snow. His foreword to the Author, forestalls any bias we may have before Hardy makes his personal introduction, and Snow is careful not to daub exaggerations or hypocritical praises, balancing sixteen years of acquaintanceship quite comprehensively in his short introduction.

As a Reiki master-teacher, I have sought out any material that supports more self participation and responsibility of clients in a healing event. It is easy to place the fate of our own health into the hands of a healer, and I find this channeled writing refreshing and full of positive information for healers as well as their clients. Considering that all Reiki masters are \\"channels\\" of Reiki energy, I am comfortable with channeled materials when they come with the highest of intentions. All I had to do was pick up this book and feel the good energy coming from it to know that the material is authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Wei Chi stand up?","review":"Reiki is a real healing process. One problem with being an open minded light seeker, is we are afraid to question the absurd. We are too accepting of anything couched in the trendy terms of the day. Yes I saw one of the authors in his robe do live channelling of Wei Chi with revelations as vague as a political candidate. We are to revere this information which ignores the slave existence of Tibetan peasants of that era, who gave all to the Temple.

The author is painfully slow in ever getting to a point, and constantly telling the reader we're going to explore this in more depth in the next chapter; time after time after time. It seems that he wrote the book and then his publisher asked him to 'beef' it up with another 100 pages.

Because Revere Ware went out of business, we were unable to replace like with like. So I searched around for a 'high-quality' brand. All Clad was recommended by our local kitchenware store. The pot was on sale, but nevertheless, quite expensive. The first time we used it, we realized we were not entirely happy with this brand. The handle on the pot lid is stainless steel and gets VERY hot. You HAVE TO use an oven mitt to remove the lid or you will be burned badly. I called the company to express our dissatisfaction with the product. The Customer service rep's response: You have to use an oven mitt or you will be burned and this is not covered by warranty.

I got set up and mixed a quart of PPG jet black. Once I loaded the gun, I noticed paint leaking out from behind the trigger somewhere. I activated the trigger a few times in hopes it woild seal. It got worse, now running out. So, I dumped the paint, cleaned up the gun, me, floor and bench. I took the trigger and needle out to see if there was a bad O-ring. There wasnt. The needle seal in this thing is a poor poor design. I adjusted it and even talked nice to it, but it would never seal. I have to say, cheaper is never better...

Navigation via the LCD display is ok but not quite as easy or as quick as on an iPod.The big drawback is the Sony Sonic Stage software that comes with the unit and that must be used to transfer tracks (there is no alternative). The software's faults include but are by no-means limited to; can't handle a large number of files (crashes), intermittantly hangs your PC, relies solely on ID3 information (i.e. often transfers files as 'Unknown Artist Unknown Track'), auto-transfer will re-transfer audio files that are already present on your NW-HD3 as additional files (resulting in many copies of the same tracks), has a confusing interface, requires frequent re-installation (which often requires completely re-formatting the NW-HD3), no longer supports importing Windows Media WMA audio files and is very 'processor intensive'.Software aside, I would give this product 4/5 stars.

The battery life seemed very short, even if we had not talked on it much and when I put it in the base to charge it wouldn't make contact without a lot of repositioning. Last night I was talking on the just-charged phone and it began to beep and there was so much static I had to switch to a different phone.

But I'm afraid that the transfer to DVD by Fox Lorber is very poor. It's got a very soft, almost pixillated look with a lot of strobing on panning shots. At the cinema, Pierrot le Fou is one of the most colourful, vibrant films ever , but this DVD has a sad washed-out, de-saturated, dirty look and the sound level is also very low. All in all, it's a great shame that one of the classics of modern cinema has been treated with such a lack of care... I would recommend that you wait for a decent label to release this film properly. I have to say that it's made me wary of all titles on Fox Lorber now."},{"rating":"2","title":"forever magic","review":"I tell you one thing- either you'll love godard or you'll hate him.

I was amazed by how clean and clear a picture (as well as audio) the movie had,both because of its age and the technology associated with films of that period. Criterion has done a masterful job with this edition,and I couldn't have been more pleased with its presentation. Of course, the beautiful cinematography helps out, too.Give it a shot, it defied everything I thought it would be.

Yet the only point on which the book succeeds is Chapter 3, in which Lanham fully develops a theory of the benefits of self-conscious artifice - which has little, if anything, to do with economic theory. Lanham admits he is no economist; this might explain his adoration of libertarian economic thought, which of course, is more a faith than a theory. \\"Don't worry, be happy\\" is Lanham's response to anyone who questions any possible negatives associated with technology or the market. Ultimately, these are the only real \\"lessons\\" of the book - awareness of communicative \\"styles\\" make us better communicators (a valid point, but hardly new), and a McFerrinesque attitude towards risk and responsibility. Hardly worthy of the pulp it is printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling wreck","review":"The reviewer here, Henry Berry, has given a wonderful summary of the main point of the book.

Sadly, this CD is not something any person should ever listen to. The lyrics are horrible and generally rap about completely stupid things or nothing at all.I know, this all sounds like standard ICP. It's not the same though. This CD is a mix of upbeat rap music that only a moron could enjoy.

The other songs I like are \\"We'll Be Alright\\" and \\"Deadbeat Moms\\" w/Esham, but the chorus totally sucks and sounds like it took 3 seconds to come up with...So I say if you're collecting CD's buy it, if you're looking for a good CD buy one of their older ones or buy KMK's upcoming CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than hells pit but where did ICP go?","review":"The clowns I know sing chicken huntin and Piggy Pie with some wicked sh*t mixed in like dead body man. Hells Pit was horrible. Not one track on that CD was tolerable. Now Ive been down for 8 years but I have to say that since they got rid of Mike Clark ICP isnt ICP anymore. It's either the producing or J seems to have let the weed get to his head and thinks everything sounds good. This CD is an improvement over hells pit but not much. Atleast they are back to thier comedic ways but its still not to the likes of Riddlebox or Milenko. Only two songs are bangin and the rest are just ok. The only terrible song on the CD is \\"We Like It Like That\\" because thety repeat that saying every 5 seconds...literaly. The Best song on the cd is Rollin Over which is somewhat back to their roots. In my opinion, ICP needs Mike Clark back and needs to realize why we all became juggalos in the first place.

I am now concerned that they may overheat even in an open light fixture. This does raise safety concerns.The dimming is very poor on these too.

These ULA bulbs are probably the best for dimming smoothly over a wide range from bright to dim, although they still won't go as low as incandescents. Unfortunately, I can't use them in most rooms because of the noise they create. It is audible even at full power, and gets louder as the bulbs are dimmed. If you have a room where there is background noise all the time, these will be okay, but my house isn't like that.The other brands? GE was much quieter, but had a very limited dimming range.

The problem is that I (and probably many here who've tried it) always wake up shortly after becoming lucid, which forestalls any further attempts for the time being.

Never mind not wasting your money, your time is better spent on doing anything else but watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different","review":"Not what I thought it was going to be; not my type of movie but I'm sure many will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"secrets of self storage marketing success by fred gleeck","review":"I HAVE READ A-LOT OF BOOKS ON MARKETING BUT THIS BOOK IS SO BAD IT WAS LIKE BURNING MY OWN CASH. ITS SO BAD YOU SHOULD BUY IT JUST TO SEE (UNREAL) IT WILL NOT BE AROUND LONG."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide and a Good Read","review":"Not only does Doris Larson's new book give all the important details about the destinations she writes about. It offers descriptions so personal and vivid that one feels they had already visited these places in another life. Nuances abound, describing ambience, innkeeper personalities, surrounding culture and little known gems to be discovered in each location. Points of historical interest are described as much more than a footnote. Architectural highlights abound. All in all, this book surpasses its status as a guide book and qualifies as a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best In Ohio","review":"Ms. Larson has written a complete and wise guide to the area. I have visited a couple of the Inns she discusses and found her observations to be very close to my experiences. Her local commentaries are wonderful and reflect a very thorough knowleged of her topic. She writes with warm perspective and lovely appreciation for the Inns, their histories and their owners. I am looking forward to trying a few of her choices. For anyone in the region or thinking about visiting I would consider this book as one of the best resources available."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book, insightful author","review":"This B&B guild is among the best on the market and definitely the most complete of this region. Ms. Larson prefaces each section with her special commentaries about the specific areas and her grasp of the area is immediately evident. Her warm personality matches the character of the B&Bs she describes. For anyone venturing into the historic nooks of the region this is the guide to have. I live nearby and have visited several of the homes she has reviewed and find myself happily surprised at her thoroughness and accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga Basics from Yoga Zone","review":"You will need to know quite a bit about warming up your own body to do this without straining. They do not give you enough restorative poses. As a result I would not recommend this tape for beginners. Even if you are intermediate in your practice, you better be able to do a warm up before this tape. For a much more well-rounded routine, I recommend Total Yoga with Tracey Rich and Ganga White."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it zero stars","review":"No kidding--The worst piece of garbage I've ever seen!!!Don't be fooled by the dvd cover like I was. It looked like the film was written, produced, and directed by a bunch of 6th graders-and the acting was even worse. Unrealistic plot and storyline that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone actually was able to pitch this nonsense and get financial backing. Looks like someone picked up a camcorder, grabbed some people off the street, and decided to make up the script as they went along. To the guy who gave this movie 5 stars--you should be ashamed. You must be the either filmaker or a realtive, because you know this movie sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN I GET 85 MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK?","review":"I SAW A PREVIEW COPY OF THIS MOVIE TWO WEEKS A AGO.

These concertos were written for the harpsichord but Gould makes a compelling case for the modern piano. It doesn't hurt that he plays them on one of the most beautiful Steinway pianos I have ever heard. The big, fat, round tone of this instrument is breath taking. The first concerto in D-minor sounds like it was composed on graph paper instead of music paper, but Gould makes it sing and dance. The fifth concerto in F-minor usually sounds heavy on a piano, but Gould makes it float on air. The slow movement here was used by Gould as the music for the alien visitors in the movie \\"Slaughterhouse Five.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, basic self hypnosis","review":"This book teaches basic self-hypnosis techniques. The book even suggests recording certain phrases to replay back to yourself. It would be better if they provided at 10 CD in the back of the book.I was very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridden with too many errors","review":"For 16 authors (programmers??) to make so many typos, mistakes, ommissions, is unacceptable. I even sent email to the authors who cared to provide addresses and none responded.The authors must have been confused or took so much for granted. The problems I found with the book are too many. For example: Code snippets fail, poor steps (making the book a very tidious read.). The steps are embedded in lengthy theories, making them impossible to follow. Focus is lost and references are poor. For example, on page 88, they write \\"you can find this function [global_service_lib.asp] in the include directory\\". Wrong because, the global_service_lib.asp resides in the siteroot/service/include directory. These are minute errors that can frustrate many readers in the middle of the night.Some diligence should be put into books that involve program codes. I generally do not tolerate such errors from programmers. We should be people akin to details!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At first glance this book seems to be a lamens' saviour.","review":"After going through the steps in this book, you quickly find that this book is just an overview of topics available to the Commerce Server 2000 administrator.

The book does not give you any thing that is not there in the MS docuentation. It can only be used by person who wants to use the GUI tools provides with Comerce Server. There is no effort made by authors to actually explore the full capacity of Comerce Server objects to leverage the functioanilty. Overall, i don't think it is worth spending $(...) on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly a crock","review":"mostly factual as to actual events of these horrid crimes. That is until the author starts trying to convince the reader that these women were actually deceived by angels. Those of you who choose this book for interest in the crimes themselves, will not be pleased. There is also a lot to this story left out by the author. He seemed to base his entire book on some fact, and mainly what the convicted criminals told him. Having some knowledge of these women and their crimes, I was very displeased with the direction of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a sweep!","review":"Margaret Moseley has done it again...swept us into the mind and antics of a most unlikely detective.

AWESOME information.I did not find answers telling me what to do, but more a gentle guidance toward the direction of finding my own way - in your writings. The book makes you think and examine where you are in your own life and empowers you to move forward on that path. Thank you so much, Connie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallel Universe is a road map to inner peace.","review":"I appreciate how clear this book makes the path to connecting with your soul and to higher realms. It is well organized, thorough ...and the exercises are a pleasure to do, as well as easy to integrate, even when time is limited. It has resources to improve functioning in anyone's life ..in a way that flows easily. And reading the messages from the Master Spirit Guides feels like a breath of fresh air.

It has great educational value and she can now sing the ABC song. The focus is on the letters not on words or sounds which is great for a two year old. She doesnt love the \\"Howdy friends\\" video as much, She doesnt quite get the wild west concept, However the package was worth it for the ABC video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used the 5400ZL series for a couple of years now...","review":"I've been using these switches since they first came out in 2006, and let me tell you that HP's ProCurve line is coming up in the marketplace for a reason. This switch is a monster! I've used several blades and by far the most impressive is the 4 x 10Gbe blade. That's right, you can fill all twelve bays with 10Gbe ports and have complete management over them. They are extremely, extremely fast and capable even in a core capacity. HP's lifetime warranty extends beyond the original owner, so you can buy these used and still have complete coverage without spending a dime. Timely firmware updates round out these giant-killers. So stop paying the Cisco tax and get into ProCurve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good outdoor projects","review":"This book has some good outdoor projcts. The 2x4 title is a little misleading though, a lot of the projects are 1x stock. Still, it's a pretty good book. Look for it at a discount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aargh!","review":"While the ideas in the book are certainly good ones, the true basis of a woodworking book is the instructions, measurements, and plans. I started the Adirondack sofa and found that the hardware list did not match up with the instructions or what was actually needed. In addition, the picture of the sofa does not match their instructions...which can be very confusing if this is the first one you've tried. In my opinion, these guys had good ideas but did a poor job of proofreading their work. They really need to fix things and put out an updated addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like Sword and Sorcery?","review":"Welcome to a distant world. A world of exciting battles, exotic women, and evil wizards. It's a world of mystical secrets, magical happenings and extraordinary entertainment. David Carradine is Kain, the last survivor of a mighty warrior tribe. Once an exalted warrior-priest, Kain now wanders the planet Ura as a mercenary sword-for-hire. In the small village of Yam-A-Tar, he finds more than a simple village war; he finds two mighty opponents, an oppressed people and the piercing, haunting eyes of a stunningly beautiful sorceress (Socas). Kain becomes embroiled in the treachery and battles, the mighty wizardry and rampant debauchery.Actually this film is a copycat version both FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and YOJIMBO transplanted story of a lone fighter playing both ends against the middle to a mystical kingdom on a planet circling two suns. Lovely leading lady Socas plays the entire film topless.The bottom line is this. If you like Sword and Sorcery you should like this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Warrior and the Sorceress","review":"You'd have to call this \\"Yojimbo\\" meets \\"Kung Fu.\\" Essentially a sword-and-sorcery remake of \\"Yojimbo/A Fistfull of Dollars\\" starring David Carradine, TWATS is remarkable faithful to its source material considering how many goofy in-jokes and hokey special effects it contains (the grizzled wandering swordsman played by Carradine is named Cain, for example). You probably need to be drunk or (heaven forbid) high to fully appreciate this film; but it has its moments of goofy fun, and its a must for completests who need to have every remake of \\"Yojimbo.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this???","review":"I normally love all this 'Sword and Sorcery' stuff, but was sadly let down by this dire film - for starters where was the sorcery, or \`The Mighty Wizardry' as the review on the back of the cover calls it??? Not one spell, incantation, curse, enchantment or lightning bolt in sight throughout the entire movie. All there is to mention is a sword that can chop through an anvil (the one and only time you see this done is when it's made towards the end of the film).The storyline, dialogue, acting, fight choreography and the sets are all terrible filled with a cast of characters that are instantly forgettable - you kind of wish at the end of the film that a huge fireball would come and engulf them all. It would certainly add to the enjoyment.All in all, at a short 81 minutes this film felt too long to endure it all the way through, so do yourself a favour and don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"This silverware is not 18\\\\10 as advertised. it is very pretty. but it is 18\\\\0.

He evidently set out to render the operas as ugly as possible, and certainly succeeded. The sight of Don Giovanni stripping to his underwear and shooting heroin into his arm while singing the \\"Champagne\\" aria is unimaginably gross. Prospective purchasers would be well advised to pass quickly over these offerings and select the early video of Don Giovanni with Cesare Siepi. Although produced in the 50s, the conducting by Furtw?ngler is unmatched on video, and Siepi is the best Giovanni in living memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear, thoughful look into the basis of existance.","review":"Darling's latest work is masterfully crafted piece that will intrigue the scholar and novice alike.

This guy is onto something I said and so googled for signs of any more of his stuff. Two more books presented themselves - 'Equations of Eternity' and 'Zen Physics'. 'Equations' proved to be a great read that takes you bit by bit along a journey of human development without having leaps of faith/belief or wild mental gymnastics (he is an astronomer and physicist by training). And, lo and behold! you arrive at our present human condition but without the baggage we normally cart along for these journeys. Read it slowly and carefully and you cannot help but see human development and sense of self in a totally different light.
