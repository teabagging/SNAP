Alas, our heroine Becka comes off as a complete witch, who never has any faith in him and treats him like a stereotype. The author pumps up the sexual tension, hen leaves him and everyone else dangling, just because she blows hot and cold and really cold.The book starts out well and you can tell the author likes baseball a lot, but they deal with a lot of issues outside the couple, so much so that the couple's affair takes a back burner every single time to the latest crisis with the team.I would love to have seen a real development of character from both people.

Third, the missions you have to do are very poorely explained. Fourth, one of the most annoying things were that every time you go near a kid in Whoville, he'll try to hug you and say,\\"Hi big daddy!\\" and you have to shake him loose. This happens a lot.I have to admit that they did do a good job on Whoville."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an okay game","review":"This game is great, but it is directed towards the wrong audience. This game will not be very simple for the children which are the target of the grinch movie, and it will turn away teenagers and older gamers because it is called the grinch.

Your interest stays with you throughout the book. I found myself unable to lay the book down! Lynn Chandler-Willis does a great job in telling this unfortuante story. Her chapters are descriptive enough so that it's easy to invision what you read. For anyone looking for a true crime story to read, I highly recommend this book!

It was a senseless murder of a beautiful young woman concocted by her husband for his own selfish, monetary gain. Chandler-Willis has definitely come across with a writing style in this book that is intended to keep the reader hooked from the first page to the last!I wish her much success with \\"Unholy Covenant\\", her first published book, and look forward to any other books she may write in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty amazing . . .","review":"I read this because it never ceases to amaze me that people can so thoroughly, utterly hide who they are from so many for so long -- and because it never ceases to amaze me that sometimes these people are even clergy!

Ofcourse the invoice said that once the package was opened, it could no longer be returned!While the little iGuy was cute and the thick rubber would protect an iPod for a child; the way it opens to charge the iPod (sitting down) would eventually quickly cause the iGuy to break in half.

I felt that this was a letdown after seeing Walt Mink live. They were thoroughly better than this CD when I saw them. The CD came out no too too long after I had seen them live so the memory was still fresh and not softened by time. I NEVER listen to this, though I do keep it as part of my collection. If you must have Live Mink this is the way to go. If you love them and do not need 'Alternate versions' steer clear.Side note.The label on the CD is misleading. It lists, I beleive, Showers Down then Twinkle and shine. THey advertise this as 2 different songs when in fact it is a medley.

Why not just tell me you are sorry for the inaccurate description and accept the return because you don't have what I wanted to order? Then, change the description so no one else has to do all this. I intend to be relentless until the description is changed. If the description were accurate, I would have ordered a different bib. Also, the color is not 'Navy' either. It is medium blue.

Why did Paul Solomon lie about where he went the night of the murder? If Carolyn was obsessed with Paul, why was she sleeping with other men at the time?

So much tedious USELESS information it made my brain hurt just trying to sift through all of it. It started off pretty good, but the minutiae of information from the detectives on to the trail was so overwhelming I had to quit reading it. And I NEVER stop reading a book. And there is no way the author could have known what everyone was thinking. That makes me believe this is more 'fictional' than true crime. And it's such a shame too. A rich heiress who graduated Columbia University with a masters degree goes on to kill her lover's wife by shooting her more than 8 times! There's no way this could be boring right? Wrong...I would definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the details - Copyright 1924","review":"The book was interesting if you consider the context.

They even give you a strap to mount it to the wall so it doesn't tip over (a good idea, since we put our TV on top). Very pleased with the finished product.

Sure he's a bit shorter, but has cool weapons (missles that can fire), and the articulation is great as well. I bet if you took him back in time, and showed him to a kid in 1984, the kid would probably identify him as Starscream, unlike previous Starscreams (thats how close of a homage to G1 this is). The transforming is relatively easy, and if you're short on money and don't want to shell the cash for the (now rare) G1 reissue, this is the best way to go.

It is one I have never got bored of. I still can't get over how incredible the whole album is. All of the songs are amazing because they are so original and funky.Dangerous is of the same brilliant standard of the rest of his albums and is perhaps even one of my favourites.Michael Jackson's sound is one that will never go out of fashion and will continue for many years to be the inspiration of many great artists to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ALBUM","review":"This was a good album, however, it did not measure-up to Off the Wall, Thriller, or Bad... it does, although, make more of an impression than Blood on the Dancefloor.

It's a mix of good hard-hitting songs, a few songs that make you want to get up and dance, and my favorite, the songs like \\"Heal the World\\" and \\"Will You be There\\" that show a softer side of Michael, these songs show that he truly did care about the world and the people in it. Some people don't think that this side of Michael is serious, but you can tell that he was genuine and really concered about what was going on in the world. The booklet that is included with this cd is great. The pictures are wonderful and I always love it when the lyrics are included. I think that this is one of the best albums of all time and true Michael Jackson fans should definitley have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calidad Musical es lo que sobra en este cd","review":"Desde que tengo 5 años, mi principal afición fue la música en general pero sobre todo la de ese hombre que hacia que la musica fuese diferente, me refiero a Michael Jackson.

Los arreglos son excelentes, la orquestación es impresionante y por sobre todo las letras hablan de la dura realidad en la que vivimos hoy en día, la que todos sabemos, pero que muy pocos se animan a decir, estando Michael Jackson entre este grupo de \\"Pocos\\" que se animan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the Faith.","review":"This has been an important part of my music collection ever since I stole the cassette tape from my sister after seeing Michael Jackson perform magic at the Superbowl \`93 Halftime Show.

I recently bought it because I liked the songs I heard from it (Jam and Black or White, as well as others).It is awesome. I can't say it's my favorite because all the albums have their unique style and sound.

This is my childhood friend eventhough we did not see each other before he died. I love him and his music. MJ forever. Thank you Amazing. love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Jackson at the peak of his career","review":"Following Michael's two biggest albulms, Thriller and Bad, it would seem hard to produce something to live up to the fame of those two, but Dangerous does a pretty good job at breaking away from Michael Jackson's older stuff and turning his style more modern. I felt a few songs were rather uninteresting and broke too far away from the traditional Michael Jackson music, but other songs like Remember the Time and Heal the World made me realize why Michael was such an influential figure in the music industry. Overall a good albulm, especially at the dirt cheap price it can be bought at today, even if a few songs don't live up to Michaels higher standards, it has enough quality songs that make it worth purchasing. It also breaks into more variety than his other albulms and some songs include rap and rock elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous - Revisisted","review":"Let me start by saying, the only difference between this album and the original DANGEROUS is that this one is remastered. There is new pictures in the booklet as well, like in his other remasters, but there are no extra tracks or interviews. That's no big deal, because DANGEROUS is an excellent album. After a lengthy gap of nearly five years, Jackson had to pull something out of the bag. BAD was, after all, a difficult act to follow, and the press were trying to prove he was bonkers. This was a pretty decent attempt and fell in with the hard dance beat of the early 90s. \\"Heal The World\\" was much like the old melodic Jackson, and it became a major hit. \\"Black Or White\\" was the best of the rest, a well-constructed song in which he attempted to repeat \\"Ebony And Ivory\\" in the context of 90s dance music. Other highlights on the album include \\"Give In To Me\\", \\"Jam\\", \\"In The Closet\\", \\"Remember The Time\\", \\"Who Is It\\" and more. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD BUT STILL DOES'NT TOP THRILLER","review":"Michael Jackson returned with this studio album in 1991 following the tremendous success of the 1987 album, BAD, and the string of singles taken from it. Where as THRILLER remains his very, very best work, BAD did come close to that and this too is a very good album with some exceptional tracks but his momentum is slightly lost. Where as THRILLER and BAD were stunning and surprising releases this is a little too predictable. However judged on its own merits its stil worth having and what does remain stunning and unique are Jacksons' highly charged vocals. Pumping pop tunes JAM, BLACK OR WHITE, IN THE CLOSET, DANGEROUS, REMEMBER THE TIME and the truly touching, HEAL THE WORLD are the best of the bunch. This gave him another succesful run of hits. On the whole very good throughout but the format sticks closley to that of 1987's BAD. Recommended never the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HEART HIM MJ IS THE MAN","review":"top 5 dangerous picks:Who Is ItGive In To MeWill You Be ThereHeal the WorldJam"},{"rating":"1","title":"No new tracks","review":"Folks--avoid this. The first album sounded fine and this is just an attempt to cash in on the new \\"remaster\\" phenomenon. Madonna, Pet Shop Boys and Blondie have all just reissued part or all of their catalogs as rematsters-but here's the up side for them. The albums NEEDED to be rematstered and include bonus tracks. In the case of Blondie, the albums weren't even available anymore. Dangerous is readily available and was recorded using state of the art technology. The original sounds fine. This edition continas no new tracks, no interviews, nothing extra. THe other three (Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad) at least have extra tracks, and the first two were probably in need of some serious remastering. Dangerous should just sit on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Pop???","review":"I'm not sure what Michael Jackson does to continue earning the title \\"King of Pop.\\" Let's face it, he hasn't released a groundbreaking record since Thriller and doesn't record or perform with the kind or proficiency or frequency to earn such a high status. It seems that he makes more headlines for his actions off the stage or out of the studio. All that aside, Dangerous does little else than provide us with a few moments of tuneful hooks. The lyrics are as naive and played out as the music is tame and lacking in the adventure and spirit that characterized Jackson's earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Souless Excess","review":"The problems that surfaced on Bad are exacerbated on Dangerous: 1) To continue to outdo himself in product sales and hype; 2) competition with sister Janet leads to a less organic and more percussive sound; 3) insistence on most songs to try to emulate the Jimmy Jam 80's production. While it worked with the Time and was popular with Janet, it doesn't fit Michael Jackson's vocal talents; 4) probably as a result of 2 and 3 the songs are far less melodic, the production monotonous and uninteresting as Quincy Jones is sorely missed. I would have given the album ONE star, but for the fabulous \\"Remember the Time\\" with tight vocal harmony overdubs by MJ. If this is your first Michael Jackson do yourself a favor and get \\"Off the Wall.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael The Deity, Not The Musician","review":"Michael attempts to become more than his music.

'Black Or White' was nominated as the No.1 single of 1991, 'In The Closet' featured Naomi Cambell (though Jackson did ask Madonna, but she politely declined), 'Give In To Me' featured rock band 'Slash' to do the guitar riffs, and 'Dangerous' is a cool, layed-back song about a 'Dangerous' girl standing a guy up or something.Some days, you'll feel that this is the greatest album in the world, and at other times, you'll wonder why you bought this album in the first place.This album may not be up to the standards of 'THRILLER', but never the less, Michael Jackson enters the '90s in fantastic form!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MJ brings us another hot album! :D","review":"\\"Dangerous\\" is just great and i recommend this one for sure, it has some of his best songs included on this piece, my fav tracks are \\"In The Closet\\" \\"Remember The Time\\" \\"Heal The World\\" \\"Black or White\\" \\"Who Is It\\" \\"Give in to Me\\" \\"Keep The Faith\\" and \\"Dangerous\\", i honestly could've just wrote all the tracks, just remember like his other releases this doesnt disappoint at all! with all the tracks great and listenable, and the beats are on the spot without a doubt !!the music video's for the songs are hot also so go check out the \\"HIStory\\" Dvd's ! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I'll Make this short and sweet,Dangerous is a power album that was blinded by the 1993 molestation case.Their is really good stuff in here, I took off one star because it tends to get boring towards the end.

I can play it all the way through. I can't say that for any of MJ's other albums. I remember Thriller coming out when I was in the 1st grade, then the Bad album after that. But as far as when I was really at the age to get into music and when I started to appreciate it the most, this album was it for me. I don't think it's a coincidence that this was the album that Michael had his hand in the most and thus is the reason that EVERY track is nice.

Came RAZOR SHARP straight out of the box. Did find that the sheath dulled the blade ever so slightly when drawing from the sheath but the edge was still entirely useable and a great work edge. However, due to the tapering flat grind I had reservations about using it for a work knife. Wound up trading it to a friend of mine for a BK&T Eskabar. Up until he lost the blade he had no complaints and used it rather often as a light/medium duty knife.

There are some great individual stories, such as the British agent who the Soviets hired to find himself, and several crackpots with serious delusions of grandeur. What really emerges is how tenuous Moscow's hold was on its further-flung regions, as Bolsheviks, White Russians, and native people vied for control of these regions.

I WISH I HAD THIS 10 YEARS AGO! Today, I just hope parents, teachers, educators, and other adults in charge of teen girls will consider buying this book and giving it to a young woman they know. It will help that girl make informed choices and avoid merely guessing what's going on with her body or following the latest fad among peers. A must read for all adults who care about teenage girls and for those girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Significant advancement in the study of the Italian rapier","review":"Tom Leoni has produced an excellent and readable translation of one of the most celebrated Italian rapier treatises. Praised by both later masters and his contemparies, Fabris provided a detailed description of tempo, misura, guards, counterguards, feints and cavazione (as well as many other concepts vital to an understanding of rapier combat of the period). Mr. Leoni has successfully rendered the original Italian text into an English translation that is both faithful to the original work and easily understandable by the modern reader. The book is handsomely presented in a large hardcover edition with excellent reproductions of the original illustrations; not only is it essential reading for any student of the rapier, but it also deserves a place on the shelf of anyone with even a passing interest in Renaissance swordsmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"warped and split apart","review":"Snow River Wood/Poly All Purpose BoardAs soon as I received the board I oiled it.

One of my first shows a 7 Seconds and the Circle Jerks at City Gardens in 87. A lot of people are saying this is a lame album, or it doesnt sound the same as The Crew. What's the point of a band putting out the same record over and over? I have to admit, when I bought this album when it originally was released, I was a bit confused. And when Ourselves came out, I was convinced that they had \\"sold out\\". But Listen to some of the albums to follow, and you will see that they never lost their hardcore edge! Now that I am older ( a lot older) I can appreciate what the band was doing. This album is refreshing all these years later. Now I still love Skins, Brains and Guts, but I am not as closed minded now as I was as a 16 year old straight edge punk. I see this album for what it is...a \\"New Wind\\", and the chance for a hardcore band to show that they could do more than just play the same 3 chords over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic 7 seconds release","review":"This is classic 7 seconds. not as hard as \\"Walk together, Rock Together\\", but just as great.

I'll just say that when compared to all the punk albums since this albums original release in 1986 (not 1991) 'New Wind' sounds rather bland and uninspired. Even I must admit that their songs can seem to be just...blah, but if you listen to the lyrics and the emotional power behind lead singer Kevin Second's voice you'll realize the potential and true talent of this band. Many of their lyrics, especially Man Enough to Care, ring true. If you enjoy a band like Fugazi, it is definitely recommended you check out 7 Seconds.

I'm 18, just graduated high school, and just went out and purchased this CD a couple days ago. It's beautiful, gorgeous, and brings back memories! I was singing along with it while in the car and while doing housework--it's a great collection that anyone can enjoy, especially those of us who are kids at heart. The only thing I wish is that there were a couple more songs present, which detracts 2 songs, but overall, it's gorgeous!

Seldom is one provided with so many wonderful tools to overcome the stress and anxiety caused by the troubled world around us. Against the background of the current world crisis, a lousy economy and the constant threat of terrorist attacks, we all need help to keep calm and balanced, and I found Dr. Jeffers's advice to be ideal in terms of leveling my personal equilibrium. Now, I can approach each day with much more confidence and handle the uncertainty in the world without feeling fearful and stressed. Further, the book is filled with such common sense advice that's so clearly stated, it is accessible to everyone. I can't recommend this highly enough! A great gift for loved ones..."},{"rating":"2","title":"timely tranquil message","review":"Dr. Susan Jeffers suggests a methodology for people to attain mental equilibrium and serenity in an uncertain world that seems increasingly unpredictable since 9/11. The author feels that too many people waste time, energy, and money trying to control what the future will bring to them. Instead, Dr. Jeffers advocates acceptance of three prime \\"realities\\" before one can learn to live life to the fullest.In other words, Dr. J encourages readers to \\"live for today and don't worry about tomorrow\\". Though nothing innovative (Grass Roots offered the same advice thirty-five years ago) to embrace in this self-help book, Dr. Jeffers provides a timely tranquil message in a world that seems as if stress is the solo measure.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Embracing Uncertainty","review":"Excellent book.

Not to say nothing can be taken from it, but the useful bits are stuffed between a lot of garbage.I was immediately turned off in the introduction by some annoyingly hokey sentences, for example: \\"As you travel through this book, you will take a magical journey into the mind and into the spirit.\\" It's magical!Also the concept in the first chapter didn't quite tickle my fancy. It suggests you replace hope with wonder. Somehow I don't think I would feel comforted as I walked through a minefield (or whatever) thinking \\"I wonder if I'll make it across alive.\\"There are many mystical and religious ideas called on, particularly in the second half of the book, that I found pretty much useless. It makes reference to the \\"Grand Design\\" and the reader's \\"Highest Good,\\" yet claims that a belief in God is not necessary (title of chapter 10: \\"Let God Worry About It!\\").Anyway, I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for something more positive","review":"No one knows what tomorrow may bring but I would rather look forward to something with excitement instead of a \\"maybe this will happen or not\\" attitude. I didn't really care for the mediocre attitude - shouldn't we strive / expect more. Sometimes there is disappointment but it's better than shrugging ones shoulders and saying \\"oh well\\". Shouldn't we have a more positive attitude. Yes, we need to be realistic about things. If someone has cancer or any other serious illness a positive attitude is much more helpful than \\"maybe they will beat it, maybe they won't. Sorry but I find this attitude depressing. Perhaps this attitude is why so many of our younger generation does not strive for things, just does enough in school to get by or drops out of school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manual for CR-V","review":"I bought this manual for a Honda Cr-V. The manual is written to cover the Civic, Acura Integra, Civic, and CR-V since they presumably share a lot of common parts.In short, it tries to cover all models, and doesn't work very well for the CR-V.Example: I used the manual for a timing belt replacement. This manual doesn't even cover the engine that is in the 1997 CRV. The timing belt replacement section in the manual is for a single Over Head Valve (OHV) engine.

And, Studio !K7 are putting out loads of good stuff, to boot. This compilation makes the airy beats of their first 'Offering' sound sorta gutless. While both are certainly worth the price of admission, this second one has many, many more memorable tracks. Those two songs by Chantel, for instance, grab the ear and the heiny right away. I especially love track 8 by KHAO with its deeper than deep poppy funk up -- makes the kitchen vibrate from across my apartment. But, really, I dig 8 or 9 of the songs here. And that is telling. Where electronic music can venture toward the mind-numbingly fast or forgettably space-y, !K7 churns out the best-of-the-best somewhere in between.

The remastering engineer, Lutz Rippe, (according to reviewer L. Johan Modée, see his review here), has said that these transfers were made from the original 35mm 3-track master tapes, and furthermore expressed his feeling that the recordings were of some cultural significance and worthy of considerable effort to preserve them well. And from what I've been hearing, I have no reason to doubt that. The texture and tone color of the sound seems to me quite vivid and detailed enough for a recording of this age. It is vastly superior to the old Bescol set, and I think only the most fanatic of audiophile would have much to criticize here.

If you are looking for a no nonsense approach to getting started with the German longsword, this is your book.

I have read this book cover to cover at least ten times, and used it as a refrence countless times more.

This is pre-Atlantic Records Big Joe Turner, the ORIGINAL rock and roll (even tho' it's called jump blues at this point). The four songs by Big Maceo, however, sound more to me like straight blues stuff and doesn't really fit in here. I never heard of Smilin' Smokey Lynn before, but the tunes here are pretty good, although one of the songs kinds of drags along, and another one is a straight out ripoff of Wynonie Harris.

No worries-it doesn't. \\"Including Alice\\" seems right back in the groove of the familiar Alice books. A little more sex talk than there used to be (but not nearly as bad as in \\"Patiently Alice\\"), but it redeems itself with some of the tradmark humor between Alice and Lester.

And yes, I have been very careful to avoid grounds at the seal. Will try to send this POS back. BTW, even if this gadget did work properly, I would not be impressed. It looks like it was made in China. As others have noted, the edges are sharp, and the metalic surfacing looks like it will start chipping off quickly. This in no way can be appliance-grade stainless steel.aUpdate...have tried to make espresso 5 times. Same technique every time. Three times it produced no espresso, two times it worked.

I must say though that the seller, Amiganien, did a great job replacing the unit promptly. The second unit works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns Coffee Every Time","review":"Every time I use this pot it creates very burned, bitter coffee. The valve on top is supposed to remain sealed keep the water from mixing with the coffee until a certain pressure is reached and the water is quickly forced through the grounds. Unfortunately, this isn't what happens. Instead, the valve allows air to pass through, and then the water slowly reaches the top and trickles out very slowly. The valve isn't fully released for another minute. In that minute , your coffee is burning as the hot water is at a near standstill in the basket with your grounds. If the brikka's top valve actually sealed, then I think the brikka idea would work, but instead, the brikka's poor execution produces burnt coffee every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bar stools at a good price","review":"These are great bar stools and relatively easy to put together.

Another thing is the graphics. I know this is Super PAPER Mario, but come on! The new characters look as if they were made in paint. I seriously believe I could have created the characters in paint with line and fill color.

But my 7-year old grandson plays video games all the time, so I think I can speak for him.From what we could tell from the time we loaded this game is that there is a lot of reading required. And I don't mean short instructional type info. They want you to get the whole story and the whole background of whatever is happening but it is wa-a-ay too indepth and complicated to keep the interest of a 7-year old, not to mention the vocabulary (including character names) are often well beyond that of a child.Luckily, I only paid 19.99 for this game as an Amazon special.

Then comes good old Mario and it turns out that he's the hero spoken of in the Light Prognosticus that is the only one that can stop the Bleck guy.

I have to say, the Gamecube version is harder. I was surprised to have beaten the game in less playing than it took me to finish the other.However, this game is really fun to play! I like the unique storyline (they're collecting 8 Pure Hearts this time instead of Crystal Stars. That's the only obvious similarity.) and the cool graphics. The music is okay, nothing special. People say it's really text-intensive? It is, I guess, but it didn't bother me as much. The characters are awesome (villains, particularly.

Another interested feature is flipping between 2-D and 3-D. It may seem weird, but this game is very fun.Presentation: 9/10This game runs in 480p and 16:9 widescreen, and while the 2-D worlds are vibrant, the 3-D \\"parts\\" are slightly lacking.Visuals: 9.5/10Classic sound effects dot the worlds. Some backround music is perfect, others are blaring.Sound: 7.5/10The 2-D/3-D gameplay works well, and the platmorming is reminscent of old Mario games.

Super Paper Mario attempts to blend the RPG with the sidescroller format to varying results.

I think this game is pretty satisfying once you get going and I enjoy it, but I dread all the stupid blathering. The dialog might be ok if it were sort but it isn't even that. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on with inane stupid conversations that consist of nothing better than \\"I'm better than you!\\" \\"Nuh uh!\\" \\"Yeah huh!\\" \\"Nuh uh!\\" And if, for example you don't beat the villain at the end of the level you have to scroll through the entire stupid conversation AGAIN!

The game is so thick with dialogue that it distracts from the game. I just wanted mindless fun. You have to worry about equipping items, purchasing gear, leveling up, and using the 2D/3D \\"flip\\" ability to discover secrets (usually these secrets are required to progress further into the game).The game is too complex for an action game and too simplistic for a RPG. I am still at a loss as to how to describe it. One would think that Super Paper Mario would find a cozy middle ground, but it doesn't. It's a pity, too. Super Paper Mario would be a strong title if its fast-paced gameplay wasn't bogged down by heavy exposition.Oddly, I do suggest this game for parents looking for Wii games for their kids. Super Paper Mario reveals patches of rather sophisticated dialogue that kids, especially those who enjoy reading, will most likely find engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"This 47 yr old father loves this game","review":"My 7 yr old and I play this a lot together.

It is honestly not worth your money, unless you get a really cheap price. There were hours of text you had to sit through, and no joke, the game actually got easier and easier as you progress instead of harder. The final battle with the main \\"bad guy\\" was a joke. I think I pressed one button and the game did everything else for me. More text.... then.... I won?? I was so disappointed. I was expecting the final battle to be tough. Im sorry I wasted my money.

This game isn't even worth renting. Waste of Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mario diluted","review":"You make no friends by saying bad things about a Mario game, but this is my honest opinion. Nintendo would have been better off to make a simple, fun side-scroller in the style of New Super Mario Bros (DS) instead of this.The art style is brilliant, as is the character design, and the platforming areas are usually great fun. But the game is let down severely by the pace: for every fun platforming area, there's twice as much irritating, unnecessary talking, hunting for items, and using the gimmicky \\"flip to 3D mode\\" to find secrets. I was actually relieved when I found Save Points in the game so I didn't have to keep playing.I thought that the Wii was meant to feature lots of pick up and play games - a criteria the standard, start-to-finish platformer would have fulfilled nicely - not ones that dilute what made games featuring Mario great in the first place. Really, really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste [...] Bucks on this!","review":"This game was awful!

Seriously, blab blab blab. And, it's not a complicated story to explain. If what you enjoy is playing a game, don't buy this one. You spend half your time reading mediocre blather. Also, it's obvious that they didn't make the game with the Wii in mind. When you play the game, you turn the controller horizontally, and use it like you would any other older Nintendo controller. This is pointless as a Wii game, and kind of stupid and slow as any kind of game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children will not be able to read extensive dialog","review":"I rented this game from gamefly.com and I hate it. They should have kept the mario side scrolling theme and kept with the mario formula (run, jump, fly, swim, castle). I'm probably the biggest mario fan so I'll just break down my pro's and con's now.Pros: It's mario in a paper thin form (adorable), the flip thing is so-so.Cons: I had to first watch the annoyingly long intro (and they used slang???) I swear I must've hit the (a) button a million times to get thru all the dialogue. My 6 year old who has trouble reading would not have the patience to read all those dialogue bubbles (rediculous!!!). I let him read one bubble (which he did pretty good) but the dialogue just kept coming and coming (utterly rediculous!!!)Probably the worst mario game nintendo ever co-signed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Platform Game? Really Nintendo?","review":"Let me first say that I grew up playing Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. I would play it hours a day running around and I was never able to complete it before I sold my Gamecube. Then I got aWii a few years later and was so excited to play this game! Until I realized that it changed into a platform game! Why? This completely takes away the RPG feeling to all the levels and makes thegame really bad. The flipping is not cool, in fact it is really annoying and I do not like it one bit. They should of stuck to the original style where there were multiple ways to play the gameand you could do whatever you wanted. Bad job nintendo. Really this one is bad.

My friend brought and I thought it was going to be one of those long and good adventure rpgs like the first and second one.

The gamecube and n64 versions were fantastic, I could play them over and over again, and I do. But this wii version is atrocious. It pains me that it even holds the paper mario name. I've tried and tried to give the game a fair chance and to get into it, but I just cannot. I dislike the style of play. The whole point of paper mario was that he was 2d in a 3d world. I understand the \\"flipping\\" concept in this game but it's just well.. bad. Not enjoyable by any stretch. I feel like I'm playing super mario brothers and that's not the feeling I want to have when I'm playing a paper mario game. If you have not tried the first two paper mario games I'm sure you'd really enjoy this game, but coming from that background this game is a huge let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fun Mario!","review":"I am a Super Mario fan ever since Super Mario Bros came out and I'm always looking for something to come close to play. I have a Wii and an N64 system (used to have Gamecube but don't need it with the Wii). I bought Super Paper Mario because I needed something to play but nothing new was available (Galaxy wasn't out yet). I thought it looked dumb and was thinking twice before I opened it. I hated the ongoing dialogue and the neverending name calling between players but once I got to playing I was addicted. I like to play games that make me want to play for hours and then leave me wanting more once I quit playing and this one does that. This game has lots of secrets and endless hours of play.

I was hesitant because of some of the poor reviews but I bought it anyways. This game has a lot of unnecessary dialog in it and its a lot of just sitting there and clicking through it. The story line it self isnt even all that great either. Besides that this game plays nothing like the first one. Yeah it has 3-D in it which was kind of neat but it was mostly confusing and irritating. In this game you cant even battle with the enemies. You stomp on them just like all the other mario games and IF you want to use any items you must first avoid that enemy and then go to menu and choose what you want. It doesnt initiate a fight like the first one. I feel like I am playing a boring and slow version of regular Mario. this is definately not worth the money, thats why i am returning mine.

The percentage gains he reports in some of his examples are blatantly deceptive. An example is Fig. 5-10, where he shows the possible gains achievable using the \\"gap\\" method. He quotes a profit potential of $21062, which I dont dispute. However, there is no mention of the actual money necessary to make the trades shown, which is probably somewhere around $30,000 (minimum). This would yield a profit of around 67%. The figure, however, quotes a profit return of almost 700%!! Whether or not these figures are his, or if he borrowed them from another source does not matter. He should know better!

The songs in \\"Revelation\\" have been re-recorded with the incredible voice of Arnel Pineda in the lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real American Sounds","review":"We can confirm that they have worked great efforts by listening to this album.

I thought I was getting a book about what the title discribes (which in itself is misleading). The book I thought I purchased was going to tell me about the different Miracles around the world. About the weeping icons, relics, stigmata, visions, etc. It does but only to say that they are not indeed miracles but scientific explanations. Peoples imagination or mental illness. As a Catholic I could not get through this book. I ACTUALLY ONLY READ ABOUT 4 PAGES AND THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME. I am getting rid of the book because I don't even want it in my house. This was the biggest waste of money. I am glad I bought it used and not paid full price. This book is a good read for ATHEIESTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a Miracle was terrible","review":"This author must be totally anti-christian. I have friends who have been over to Medjugorji who have had miraculous healings and rosaries that have had the chains changed to a gold looking metal but it is not a metal of this earth. This author has no basis for any of his conclusions. The only thing I can do for such an unbeliever is pray for him and hope that one day he sees the light and finds that God forgives anyone who asks."},{"rating":"1","title":"par for Nickell","review":"Nickell is a major-league dip. He doesn't research his facts fully, and--despite his claim that he's interested only in the scientific method and, above all, the truth--he is certain to prejudge everything as false and select only that \\"evidence\\" that supports this position. He reminds me of one of his younger fellows from CSICOP--Underhill or Underwood or something--whom you always see on TV. That fellow will go off about, oh, sasquatch or some such, dismissing eyewitness reports, films, and such with general comments about people having seen bears. Generalities are just fine, but they do not serve as an off-the-cuff, zero-thought-required refutation to any and every possibility that presents itself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant, unbiased examination of miracles","review":"Nickell carefully examines various miracles ranging from uncorruptible corpses to stigmata, and offers his own credible explanations.

A must for anyone, skeptic or believer, who wants to hear the other side of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and easy to manage","review":"This inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it's light wheight. Once inflated, it's easy to carry with just one arm when empty. It also has a very sturdy feel once it's completely inflated (I would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger).With both seats in the kayak, there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear. I have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes. We generally carry two fishing rods, gear box, bottled water, and other related items, along with a dry bag. Even with all this \\"stuff\\" in the boat there is plenty of room inside, and with the seats in place I have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling.I haven't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so I'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best investments i ever made","review":"Nothing is better than canoeing comfortly down the creek. This joker is comfort. The hard canoe hurts my back after a long trip, even with the staduim chair thing. I'm able to get my girl in front and she faces me. That way works best with 2 adults. If ur alone there is plenty of room and so comfy! There is many great features about this kayak. Most important is being able to deflate in seconds and throw in the trunk and drive home as fast as u want without worry about blowing off or looking funny. Love it! Get it! Cheap and nice. Tough too. Get the skeg if ur using as a canoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"I have used my inflatable kayak 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. It inflates easily and handles easily. Appears to be made of durable material. Because it is inflatable, it is affected by wind more than other kayaks, so I recommend purchasing and using a skeg with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful Maiden Voyage","review":"Just took the new Sevylor Inflatable Tahiti out for the first time yesterday on a local river with my 5 year old son. I purchased it with the skeg per the recommendations online and we had a great time. We did bottom out a few times, but not due to the kayak, rather the water depth. Tahiti is durable, inflates easily in a matter of minutes (we bought the sevylor electric pump and found an outlet near the entry point) and had a great time! For the price, ease of use, ease of transport and durability (so far), I'd highly recommend this product for novice kayak-ers who are looking to try out water sports and have relatively low-intensity, but fun time. Kayak generally stayed on course, I assume due to the skeg. Great design and functionality. I loved the valves as I found them easy to deal with on the inflate portion of the adventure, which I was afraid would be a real hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"ocean boating","review":"I purchased this kayak to take with me to the beach. While I was on my way back up the beach from the water with my kayak there was a person that asked me where I rented it. I like the idea that someone seemed to think the quality was good enough to be considered a rental. I found that it does handle better if you put a skeg on it and it sits much better if you put at least one of the seats in it. I am very please with my purchase of Sevylor's inflatable kayak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and fragile","review":"We were disappointed that it took more time to inflate this boat than the time that we could enjoy it. The boat was comfortable to sit in on land. In the water, the boat is hard to steer and kept turning in circles (we are experienced kayak users). Ten minutes into its maiden voyage, our boat brushed up against a stick and tore a 6 inch gash along its bottom. Vacation ruined.

It was somewhat tedious reading this long book cover to cover. This is expected when there is such a vast number of author writing, but this cross-over isn't necessarily bad. It does give weight to techniques that are shown to be pragmatic. None of the authors are claiming that \\"their-way-is-the-best.\\" They are merely showing what's worked for them and what is tried and true.

A lot of these songs would have been o.k. with simple arrangements (like more country....hint, hint) but as is most of her stuff its full of rich, full, orchestrations and what seems to be all the background singers conglomerated together in Nashville.

The material she picks though or is picked for her and whatever the company decides to release as singles are another story. This is an album that falls substandard to her two previous greatest hits packages. Perhaps that as time has progressed she has allowed herself to stick to a formula, aimed at a \\"younger audience\\" and I'm not THAT old (37 to be exact)...the younger audience being the teeny bopper audience which most of these songs are geared to.

Its already probably gone triple platinum and its not because its any good (it isn't). It is simply because Reba McEntire has an organization (a huge one!!!! to go along with her gargantuan ego) that helps promote her CDs no matter how bad the music is.

But it doesn't matter, does it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL HER CROSSOVER ATTEMPTS","review":"Songs like \\"Take It Back\\" and \\"Why Haven't I Heard from You\\" along with rock ditties like \\"One HOnest Heart\\" and \\"I'm a Survivor\\"......taint country folks...just all of Reba's attempts to crossover. She should realize she has arrived and doesn't have to do this kind of stuff anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIT OR MISS","review":"Its mostly miss on these greatest hits. They may have been greatest hits but its only because this type of music sells among the \\"younger generation\\". Well I am part of this so called \\"younger generation\\" (I'm 19) who is not buying into the hype. I love Reba McEntire but I simply can't take most of her later albums because they're not country.

I say No to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reba, I Miss You","review":"It's been a while since I listened to anything new from Reba so I borrowed this CD from a friend to see what she's been up to. I have to tell you that what I heard on this new collection of \\"greatest hits\\" only reinforces why I gave up on Reba in the first place.She seems to have forgotten what country music sounds like and has gone for a whole different market. About the only thing country about Reba these days is her accent. Two of the few songs that can make me run to change radio stations are on this CD: \\"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\\" and \\"I'm a Survivor.\\"I really miss hearing new country songs from Reba and hope someday that she will rediscover her roots but, as long as Reba sees herself as some kind of singing feminist, I guess the wait will continue.

But when she sold out to do in her own words \\"what sells\\", she compromised herself and her talent. This hodgepodge of what sounds like Paula Abdul rejections will never be up to par with her classic 'traditional' sound that earned her 4 CMA Female Vocalist Awards and the Entertainer of the Year. This was when she was recording \\"real\\" country. This may be \\"Reba\\" music, but it is not to my taste or liking. But this is just my opinion. If you share it, go with 80s Reba and her one 90s CD that is a masterpiece. That CD is called \\"For My Broken Heart\\". It was all downhill after she recorded \\"The Last One to Know\\"...her last truly traditional country effort. This is what made her stand out. Reba is just another face in the crowd now....and if she would just go back to singing 'real country' she would reclaim her title as 'queen of today's traditionalists'. That title now belongs to Patty Loveless who has never compromised."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED!","review":"This CD does not belong in the category of country music.

Not recommended unless you like bubblegum pop country!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY!","review":"This CD was just an excuse to highlight two new singles, one of which is \\"Im a Survivor\\" (a terrible song). But the rest of the songs (the greatest hits) aren't much better. Its all Reba's maze of pop stuff...inconsistent and not worthy of her talent. MCA needed to put something out because Reba went Hollywood around this time trying to be an actress (which, in my opinion, she would have done better to leave well enough alone). So she didn't record because she was burned out. Its no wonder with stuff like \\"One Honest Heart\\", \\"How Was I to Know\\" and other unmemorable Reba tunes. Nothing grabs the heart here like her other greatest hits packages that contained Reba classics like \\"Somebody Should Leave\\", \\"Whoever's In New England\\"...you get the picture. There are no classic Reba songs on this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meow, Meow...","review":"Am I the only one that thinks she meows when she sings?

This author places angels as created before Genesis 1:1 (as far as I can tell), yet the Bible teaches angels are created and that everything that was created, seen and unseen, was created in the six days of Gen. 1:1-31 (see Colossians 1:16, Exodus 20:11). Beyond that, at least from our angel-eye view, God comes across as rather limited and unknowing, having the think up solutions as trouble happens. Yet scripture repeatedly says that God had already chosen who was to be saved before creation. As in, He already knew we would rebel before we were even created! He knew where free will lead. Thus, I can't be impressed with this author's take even on free will."},{"rating":"2","title":"People Wanting More","review":"I am the author of BEFORE EDEN.

Considering that Greece is the birthplace of what we consider modern democracy, I was surprised, no stunned, at the number of communistic philosophies Plato expounds. Children are not to be raised by their birth parents, or even know who they are. Instead, they should be raised by the community. Children born with afflictions should not be reared (infanticide).

The chapters on John Weber are fantastic. This book tells you everything you wanted to know, and then goes beyond into things that you almost don't want to know, but you can't stop reading. I liked that the murders chosen are a bit obscure- there's no Dahmer for example or Ed Geines and this pleased me- we've all heard & read all about them already. This book is a page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A startling and unusual collection","review":"I initially read this collection of short stories when studying language and literature and was bowled over, because Kennedy's writing and characterisations come across as both startling and fascinating. Having re-read this, I'm still willing to grant it the 'unusual' tag, but I was not quite as wowed as I was when enjoying them without the benefit of having read a lot of short fiction. Two stories still stand out as really special - the one that lends this connection its title, and 'Tea and Biscuits', both dealing with 'ordinary' people thrown into sudden change by a single event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Does a great job for a low price!

I like this book because it is clear about the benefits of yoga for babies, and it gives clear instructions. Really looking forward to giving it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yoga","review":"The book as far as I could gather, contains postures that have nothing to do with traditional yoga, but were developed solely by the author for the use with babies. These are interspersed with various new-agey words of wisdom, called \\"mantras\\", and a lot of yoga-style talk, to yoga it up.I feel the title is misleading, it should have been called \\"developmental movement\\" or something like that, and not yoga.Yoga is an ancient set of postures and practices that have been proven to work over thousands of years. IMO you can't just come up with some new postures of your own and call that yoga, it is false advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole Lot of Fun","review":"The names of the \\"yoga\\" postures are a little \\"out there\\" and the songs are too silly, but Baby and I love working out from this book! I am from India and my mom (and MIL) have practiced this on their two kids. Even if you take the claims the title makes with a pinch of salt, the activities work wonders for bonding. Most importantly, my baby is all giggles when he knows I am about to start Itsy Bitsy Yoga. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating for the Poor Kindle Version","review":"The low rating reflects the quality of the Kindle version, which is carelessly produced and definitely not worth the price of the item (which is the same as the Amazon price for the printed version.)There are photos missing throughout the Kindle version of the book, which is frustrating for those just learning the poses. Also, there are numerous page references in the book, and as the numbering of the Kindle version does not correspond to this, navigating the book is a major pain until you make your own bookmarks and hilights.Until these are corrected by the publisher I suggest avoiding the Kindle version and getting the actual book instead. Hopefully Amazon is listening and will send an updated version to those disappointed customers who bought the Kindle version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !!!!!!! relived from Gas Pain","review":"great book!! my 7 week old daughter is suffering from gasn pain and constipation from the start.

The placement of the fans are correctly placed on the bottom where needed instead of on the top like other coolers. There is a dial located on the right side to control the speed of the fan. It does not have settings but the dial works like a volume control which is convenient as you are in complete control of the fan speed. On the lower speeds, there is no audible fan noise. As you increase the speed the fan noise is still so faint that it is practially undetectable. At times we have to check to make sure that it's actually on.

In my situation, my Toshiba Satellite sits comfortably, since the plastic stand-offs I placed on the cooler rest against a solid part of the notebook's bottom (rather than, say, a fan grill).

The main reason I say this is because this is one of the only coolers that is completley sealed between the fans and the vents. Much of the air pressure that open coolers use to provide more airflow is lost in the areas around the fans, however with this cooler, all the air pulled in by the vents in the back is sent to the bottom of the laptop where it is needed most.While this cooler does in fact work better if your vents are in the bottom of the computer, I've bypassed this by covering up the holes everywhere but my laptops intake vents so all the air is sent where it can be most effective. I see literally up to 10 degrees Celsius temp differences on my i7 which is pretty substantial. The build quality is also superb however it isn't the most travel friendly cooler since it has a solid piece of aluminum covering it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zalman","review":"I like it but I wish more air came out.

These are OK, but some of the pieces are very small, are more specialized than most blocks (and so limit how creative you can be), and the finished product isn't as interesting-looking. But the worst part is the overall quality of the product. The pieces are very, very hard to put together (require much more force than an average kid can produce) and many of them, due to the high pressure, just separate on their own after a while. A couple of them just popped off all by themselves. This happens repeatedly. My sons are both fairly adept at working with these kinds of blocks, but both of them just got frustrated with these, as their project just kept falling apart while they were trying to construct it.There are other alternatives, but this is definitely not close to competing with the quality of Legos and other building blocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"Found these worked great for a little while, but were difficult to remove when the nails grew out.

First, the author applies no valid scientific principles before drawing conclusions about cat behavior based on his observations of a few pets and, apparently, legends about the creatures. For example, he simply repeats the old idea that domestic housecats are solitary by nature, whereas serious biologists have lately concluded that these animals have a social structure similar to that of lions (e.g., female cats live together and raise one another's offspring). Second, and most alarming, the author is a threat to the environment, and his opinions should not be spread. He moved to New Zealand, acquired five cats, and has no remorse about letting them run free in a rain forest, where they frequently grab rare birds that have no experience fleeing predators. The author maintains that keeping cats indoors is cruel. But is it any less cruel to cause the suffering, death, and possible extinction of some birds? Please do NOT buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your library card, rather than purchasing...","review":"...The author had his heart in the right place, but it resembled one long journal entry. I found it hard to read, not so much because of the awkward writing (as one reviewer noted), but because it offered no real insight into our beloved felines. And the author's making such a big deal over his cats enjoying taking hikes with him made me realize the author really isn't a great authority on the nature of cats at all. He was merely 'discovering' cats and was taking the reader along for the somewhat boring ride. It certainly didn't dazzle this reader, as I live with three cats who come with us on vacation trips in our RV and not only do they take regular hikes with us during these excursions, but one of the cats enjoys being on my husband's shoulders while he rides around on his mountain bike.I hesitate recommending that people not read this book, however if you're expecting an insightful tome to grace your bookshelves, I'd suggest you save your money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nine Emotional Lives of Cats","review":"An informative and interesting book about 9 emotions that are common in cats.

He uses an academic tone, but provides helpful insights to the cat owner. I learned more about my cat and what makes him tick through this book!

But then he claims they have \\"no economic value.\\" Anyone who looked into the topic would know cats have been treasured as mousers since the Egyptians and Indians began storing grains, maybe earlier. Some historians think civilization might not have developed had the mouse population consumed our grains and spread disease unchecked.In the first tape, Masson also claims cats care nothing for humans. Personal experience suggests otherwise and there are numerous reports that show Masson wrong.

It didn't do anything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Unfortunately, I did purchase this book as a guide to understanding my cat better. I guess I should have realized it would only help understand the author's cats better. Purely anecdotal accounts, no real expertise or science to his assertions. That may sound like no big deal, but realistically, every cat owner has a cute little story about their cat and an opinion about what they are thinking. So I was hoping this would go beyond his cute little cat stories. Frankly, by the third section, everything he said was running together, as there were no real main points presented. Also, I found it tiring to hear him talk about himself so much. Even his cats don't get full focus in this book, it's mostly him and his swims and walks on the beach.

He writes flattering things about big names like Desmond Morris in the book, then gets them to write blurbs praising the book--pretty tacky and not done by reputable writers.

Unfortunately, I ended up irate that this man thinks he knows cats well enough to write about them. He seems to have only lived with them a year and even gave one of his five away at one point. When I take an animal in, it us mine for the lifetime of the animal regardless of behavior or any other problem. I also believe as most intelligent people do that cats should be kept indoors only. Yes, they may get a little bored, but it is the owner's job to find new ways to stimulate them. A beach in New Zealand may be fairly safe for cats, but you never know when they could get into poison or near an animal abuser.

Shouldn't there be SOME suspense? Was it just me, or did anyone else notice that this character served no other purpose in the book? All of the other \\"suspects\\" had motives, half a dozen suspicious occurrences in their pasts, and clues planted to suggest they might have done it.

The problem with this book is that there was to many charecters for me to keep track of i ended up thinking that Nans brother was the murderer for a while and when she started falling in love with someone i was kinda confused coz i thought he was 50ish(it turned out i had the wrong charecter). I wouldnt recomend this book to ne 1 under 13 coz thats how old i am and it confused me.Appart from that it is a very good mystery about a serial killer who kills girls and leaves them to b found with a dancing shoe on one foot and their origanal shoe on the other. He finds his victems through the personal adds and Darcy Scott and her friend Erin are answering personal adds to help a friend of theirs with research for her TV program. It has a lot of suspense and i would recomend it to most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves Music.. Loves To Dance.. Unfortunately...","review":"This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I ever read - and it led me to buy over 20 more!..Higgins Clark is the only author who can introduce 20 characters individually to a story - and then bring them all together in the end!!.. This book is proof of exactly that..Erin & Darcy agree to help a friend who is doing a documentary on Personal ads - The idea is appealing for a good laugh & who knows who they'll meet..Erin soon disappears - and is found dead with a high-heeled dancing slipper on her foot..

Get involved in other rhythms, but in one record! her formula is good. But lyrics for a latin singer are important. Whatever, she has written some songs for this CD, and... they're the worst!Watching up the steps of Thalia, with the double of millions sold around the world, Thalia get involved into so much music rhythms in her all career, demonstrating that she don't have to put 'em all into a one record.

The beat in Perros is groovy, but the lyrics are a bit too stupid. The lyrics of the songs are not included in the booklet... another disappointment.

The lyrics are stupid and the music sounds horrible. Is this some kind of regional Mexican music mixed with reggae, or what? It's just horrible. I don't event want to waste my time talking about the songs. I only have one thing to say about them. They stink!Her only good album out there is \\"Paulina\\".

However, the new album \\"Pau-latina\\" is by far her best album. With songs like \\"My friend, My Amigo\\" where she uses spanglish in her lyrics to celebrate her crossover to songs like \\"Algo Tienes\\" and \\"Baila que Baila\\" which incorporate hip-hop beats, the album has a song for everyone. If you like hearing powerful beats or ballads and hate skipping tracks, this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad Paulina has it in her...","review":"This CD is a really great and cool comeback, the Paulina Rubio I think most people like. The songs are catchy, well produced, the messages throughout the songs are inspiring/motivational, and reflect Paulina's personality. I'm really glad that this is a Spanish language album, because I think artists who try for this English album crossover sacrifice some of their essence and personality in the process. Nothing compares to one's Mother tongue! And why can't artists crossover with what best reflects their personality? Anyway, Pau really has start quality, eventhough superficially she may be considered your typical \\"pop\\" artist, there is a genuine vibe in the songs, and her personality really comes across in all the songs. I think the better tracks are: My Friend, My amigo, Perros, Mia, Alma en Libertad, Adiosito Corazon, and Dame Otro Tequila. I also enjoyed how is some songs she sings in Spanglish, as a person with a bi-cultural background that was really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pau-Latina is a huge letdown.","review":"I sampled this cd online at univision.com and was surprised at how bad it was.

Just like the wonderful Shakira, she is definitely one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"She has returned.","review":"At first, this album seems a bit lost.

The song's music is not out of this world, but the words and its entire -feminist- message are simply the best! It gives the saying \\"perros\\" a whole new connotation!

Then the fast songs sound as Regional Mexican music instead of the so-called latin sounds. If you dont believe me, listen to My friend, mi amigo. The Cd is not worth buying it. I recommend you Laura Pausini, Shakira, or even Natalia Lafourcade instead of this. In the stores, the Cd is not been sold at all. PAULINA released in the year 2002 was better.

There is no heart, no passion in her. If you want beauty in music try Thalia's \\"Rosalinda\\" or \\"Entre el Mar y una Estrella\\" most material by Shakira, ANYTHING by Selena or country music. I will say this CD is better than \\"Border Girl\\", which is one of the worst CDs ever made (Thalia in English is not good either). Paulina is exactly like Brittney, Christina, JLO, Mandy Moore, and others who who cater to the lowest common denominator, the only difference is she does it en espanol. Let me say this while I prefer Thalia (And there is NO comparison, THALIA is on the level of Elvis or the Beatles compared to Paulina), if you really want to LISTEN to musica en espanol with intelligence try Selena.

I'm sure you'll find plenty of adequate reviews of these albums on their respective pages, but if you want to save some time, take my (and several others') word for it, and just buy this now.

This book devotes entirely on 2D potential and 2D elasticity problems. It has a good number of interesting examples which also includes problems with discontinuous boundary conditions (normally not available in other textbooks). The results are well detailed, well-explained and compared with reference solutions. These examples will be very helpful for beginners. This book shows formulations using discontinuous singular elements.

Wrede is overall fascinating and readable. For those who adore the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, you will only find two tales that come from that familiar landscape; although some are written with the same light-hearted and matter-of-fact silliness that made the EFC so enjoyable, others are more serious stories (even a little violent or macabre) and two are \\"modern\\" day tales of magic. A good addition for the collector of fairy tales or fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"short stories that rock!","review":"If you read some of wrede's other books you should really read this!Some of the stories are humorous, but others are more serious, all of them are good!Two of the stories are set in the enchanted forest.At the end there is the Quick After-battle Triple Chocolate cake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This collection contains a variety of stories, so if all you're looking for is more \\"Enchanted Forest\\", then you may be disappointed. Or you may be pleasantly suprised. I think on the whole, though, the stories are suitable for an older, more mature reader than the EF books. The recipe is potentially very good, though I found it difficult to spread the batter over the required size shield, er, pan, and found that it needed to be baked for only 20-25 minutes.

I read reviews on several car seats and checked out the safety ratings. This one is the best by far. It was rated better than Britax in crash protection and was HALF THE PRICE. We have no problems with the straps and I find them easy to adjust and use. The only difficulty I ran into was actually getting the car seat installed because my vehicle doesn't have the latch system, this is where husbands come in handy! Also, it fits in smaller back seats. We have a Quad Cab Dodge Ram 1500 and it fits perfectly. I would recommend this car seat to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great seat.","review":"i bought this seat for our 8 month old granson, really easy to install, and boy does he look cozy in it too. the seat is higher than his infant seat, so now he looks out the window as we ride. this seat is safe and soft. why look further.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat","review":"I couldn't give it a 5 star since my husband and I also have rare occasions of difficulty with the harness. Our daughter as well have outgrown the infant car seat by length (but not by weight) and it seems as if she's not fit snuggly. I find that you have to make sure the straps are equal lengths (it doesn't seem like they're two separate ones, rather one big long one) and once you get the initial tug to fit, you have to do short tugs to get it to fit snuggly against the child--holding the center harness between you and the child's chest (without it getting too tight against the chest though!). So, you might want to do that. Just a little bit more adjustment than you would probably want to, but it is a great car seat...it looks sooo comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book, but I have all 65 episodes on DVD!","review":"I loved this book and I am a big fan of the TV show!

I didn't realize the edges wouldn't be exactly level, but it adds character to the lip of the glass. Though described as a \\"rocks\\" glass, these serve a single very well. The mint juleps look great, and they also look good with whiskey sours. I would recommend these glasses to anyone wanting to add a little character to their glass collection or as a gift. Everyone seemed to find a use for them even if it wasn't in their glass collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Chunky","review":"I bought these on the presumption they were Murano 'Made in Italy' tumblers, but they are actually made in Spain. No problems though, as they are of good quality, very very heavy, and also very thick. For that reason I believe they are very sturdy and should be resistant to thermal shocks that plagues most tumblers on the market. Thermal shock will show up as a crack that occurs with no provocation - it's the glass waving the white flag for too many hot and cold dumps into water. The rim itself is also very thick, and will surprise you when it greets your lips. The rim is also uneven, with a few bumps and lumps, adding to its already 'hand made' appearance. As stated, each of these glasses is a one off - that is, no 2 are the same. For the price they are a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ongoing battle between good and evil","review":"Sanders might have had more fun writing The Loves of Harry Dancer than any other of his excellent books. Best known as a mystery/suspense writer, Sanders seems to have enjoyed indulging his creativity in unusual and singular novels like The Tomorrow File, The Marlow Chronicles and The Loves of Harry Dancer.This fanciful love story recounts the turmoil recently-widowed Harry experiences amidst the passionate and changeable forces of good and evil. Sanders creates some of his most memorable characters and certainly some of his most fantastic action, not to mention some of his edgiest sex.I love this book, and I enjoy giving it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Love of God, Avoid this Steaming Load","review":"This book is among the worst books I have ever read. Two sides compete for the soul of Harry Dancer. There is no explanation as to why Harry is worth competing over.

I did not choose wisely.I see used copies are available for a penny. You are at risk of overpaying. The book really sucks plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I have read many of Mr. Sanders book recently and when I found this one in a library I decided to read it.

The nature of craving is also misunderstood, as a result.

Chapter 2 to chapter 5 is somewhat useful, but this is in no way for beginners. The writer assumes that the reader is familiar with visual basic terms and uses them extensively in this book, which of course just confuses the reader. And what bothered me more is the book doesn't really talk about the programming aspect, it concentrates more on how visual basic itself works. There were couple of examples (which if you are a beginner will stare at it as if it is written in a different language, even at the explanation part). I guess I am so furious, because this book wasted 30 days of my time and where I learned little to nothing, and almost (yes, ALMOST) made me feel like ending any programming desire I had.

My surprise is that my school actually choose this book for a junior level programming class.This book offer no indepth explanations of terms used and it has no additional resources.

First, the battery does not hold a charge for very long. According to the manufacturer this is normal. It must be recharged every two weeks or the battery goes dead. The translations are often spelled differently than most Romanji dictionaries, e.g. \\"konnichiha\\" instead of \\"konnichiwa\\". Although technically the spelling is correct, it is not a common spelling anymore. Many of the words are poorly translated. The same company makes a very inexpensive translator that does several languages that is more than adequate for travel. If you are looking to learn Japanese, look elsewhere for a translator. I have purchased superior English-Chinese electronic dictionaries and sentence translators for far less than this costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAULTY PRODUCT","review":"I am about to return my second translator to the company, which, by the way, has VERY strict rules regarding returns so be careful.

Original, unique, a force of nature. We will never see someone like him again. This boxed set contains his best works, it is essential for any fan of real rock n roll. I count myself privelleged as having had the honor of seeing the man perform live. Even though he was well into his sixties, it is still the best concert I have ever seen. Elvis may be considered the King, but Richard Penniman is right up there with him. This collection is the greatest testament to the majesty of Little Richard. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Richard's first hits are the first 100% Rock & Roll h","review":"I purchased this boxed-set (vinyl) in '89 after I purchased the European version on Ace Records, which contains much more. However, the domestic set remains as perhaps one of the most comprehensive Specialty LR releases - most do not include the final sessions from '64. I believe that \\"Long Tall Sally\\" is THE first 100% R & R recording - and remember Elvis & the Beatles relied heavily on this number! And there are many more here equal to \\"Sally\\" in Rock & Soul power. Richard recut these tunes many times from '64 to '94, and a few recuts are excellent, but the '50s originals beg to be heard and sound better with time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Excellent 6cd set of Little Richard's crucial 50's work.The vocal firepower he displays and maintains take after take is stunning. The intent of this box was to be exhaustive and show a vocalist in the light as a instrumentalist(e.g jazz, classical, etc.), hence the reasons for the multiple takes.However, this is not the place to start. Start with \\"Georgia Peach\\", add \\"Shag On Down by The Union Hall\\" for additioinal 50's work, then consider the 3cd \\"Specialty Sessions\\".Both the 6cd set and the 3cd set are called \\"Specialty Sessions\\".

This is a cd filled with emotion and conveyed beautiful through the music and Fairuz's golden voice. She sings in Modern Standard Arabic, (formal Arabic), which creates an undertone of dire earnestness and defiance in a time of impending oppression.

This performance is so developed that it encompasses much of the Hicks legend. And it's from 1989. He grew from here, but since he was dead by 1994 he simply didn't have a chance to keep going. To make an analogy, this is Nirvana's 'Nevermind' and 'Revelations' (on the 'Social Critic' DVD) is 'In Utero.' You need to own both--20 bucks and you get six hours of one of the greatest comedians ever. Even if you hate what he says, spend 20 bucks to argue his ideas, but be honest. Regardless of your beliefs, you will gain some new perspectives on your world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great extras","review":"I purchased this on VHS two years ago and am a huge fan of the performance. I was thrilled to hear it was being released on DVD and even more pleased when I finally saw it. The added footage in the show + the backstage stuff and additional extras definitely make this worth another purchase.I do agree with whomever said this was for hard-core Hicks fans though. It is show from earlier in his career, and it's pretty raw. If you haven't heard of Bill, I'd check out Bill Hicks Live, and go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comedy show of all time.","review":"This performance is the best comedy performance from any comedian to have ever lived. People like to compare him to Lenny Bruce, but, with all due respect, Hicks was better than Bruce and better than any one else in the history of comedy.This is an incontrovertible fact. Until you see this performance, you have not seen the best comedy ever made. Its even better than the other DVD's of Hicks because it is less commercial, and therefore more effective in conveying his raw on-stage power and immediacy. Perhaps you think I'm exaggerating,just wait till you see Sane Man and, notwith- standing the some times out-of-date material, realize he was the king of realcomedy.

I use it when politicians are on talk shows, to give me an idea of where they are coming from. It usually proves there is a huge media imbalance of views on network television, so I've switched to C-Span. Seeing a voting record clues me in on where a Congressman is likely to stand on an issue, before he opens his mouth. I use it for background information, and to send faxes and letters. I use it to keep track of my own Congressmen and to find others who have voted the way I would vote, to contact, if an important issue is pending for a vote. It's only big handicap is a lack of E-Mail addresses. I could do much more with it, if I had them.

I wanted something my young kids and I could listen to in the car, but these audio tapes are useless. The English translations are in the book, not on the tape, so you have no idea what you're repeating or why, and the book is too advanced for the little ones to be able to follow along. They start out with people's names (Juan, Juanita, etc.) and then the next lessons are random words, the alphabet, a list of Latin American countries, vowel sounds. I would have liked to start with the most useful phrases in any language - hello, good-bye, thank you, numbers, big/small, etc. I'm not trying to learn how read and write, or even speak, fluently - just enough to function in day-to-day transactions, such as with neighbors, or at the store, and to give my kids some basic exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very deceiving","review":"For the person who really enjoy indepth bible study and is seeking a deeper contextual meaning referencing ancient scrpts and language, this book will dissapoint!

The only reservation that I might have is that the time period covered is that of the early and middle Empire and does not discuss the army at the time of the Punic Wars, the late Republic, from Gaius Marius to Jullius Caesar, or the late Empire of Diocletian on through the end. I do realize that this would have required a very much larger, and more expensive, book.

It is certainly one of the very best books on the subject that I have found to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tall babies","review":"My daughter is 6 months and off the charts in her height. The instructions indicate that the top of the child's head should be AT LEAST 1 inch below the top of the seat.

If this seat is made for infants - 1 year rear facing, then the back should be taller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Carseat....","review":"This is a great carseat. I bought it because it has the extra detachable seat pad. Haven't had to use it, but it always happens a diaper overflows at an inconvenient time and I could remove the cushion and contiune to use the seat. It is kind of heavy. I have no trouble loading it in my truck. The seat is very simple to install with the latch. Its more difficult with a seatbelt, but overall we love the seat and would absolutely recommend it. The only reason it didn't get a 5 was because of weight and when the time come to move the straps higher I will have to unscrew the back to access the straps. (Not totally a bad thing because I have a curious 2 year old and I like she can't play with the straps)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Car seat","review":"My husband and I purchased this car seat a little less than a year ago. At 4 months my daughter was too tall for her infant seat. We liked this chair because of the price and that it appears to have a lot of room for growth. We have not had any significant problems with the chair to date. On one occassion the harness straps got stuck and I had to take my daughter out of the chair to fix it. Since then I have found that if you turn the knobs slightly while gently pulling on the straps they become unstuck easily.

It's very comfortable and has excellent padding! She even lets me strap her in without any fuss... She used to push up with her feet and fight me not to get strapped in. What a difference!The belt is much easier to adjust and buckle than the Baby Trend carseat that I got used to. (My husband refused to strap her in because it worked so hard, so it was my job.) I do caution to be careful when adjusting to make sure you don't over tighten the straps.The latch system works great in my tiny Corolla (in the passenger side rear seat). I actually have space to stand between the car seat and the front seat! And now two nice-sized people can actually sit in the back seat with the baby.

Only to find that my car, 2000 Impala, still wasn't big enough for it to fit in the back seat rear facing. I was a bit blue. However, the well informed sales person directed me to this car seat. She was really helpful and sold me on the Evenflo. Brought it to my inlaws home and was intimidated at first by the instructions. It wasn't as hard as I was making it out to be. I got it adjusted to my 9 month old and got it into the car without much problem. He rode home in it from my inlaws and fell asleep and didn't fuss like he usually does in his other car seat. I love the safety features and comfort it gives my son. It fits wonderfully in my car to boot. It doesn't move around and I didn't have to put a towel anywhere to make it fit better.

It is so easy to move the harness straps up and down without taking the car seat out of my car. The car seat is so soft and comfortable. My daughter just looks so comfortable in it.

The reasons we bought it were that it looked easy to adjust, and its relatively compact size. What we didn't know until much later was that the shoulder straps are set too wide for an infant. When our son fell asleep, his shoulders would slide out of the straps-no matter how well it was adjusted. We kept it because we thought it would be better when he was older and forward facing, as he would be bigger and this wouldn't happen. Well, when he did get bigger, we found that the adjustment mechanism is almost impossible to work with the child in the seat. I give up. My reccomendation is to stay away from evenflo. The others are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dominicks Mom","review":"My husband and I HATE this carseat! It has been a struggle to put our son in since day one.

My cup also had 2 tiny pieces of seaweed, 1 TINY mushy piece of what I'm guessing was supposed to be tofu, and no mushrooms.I also read the nutrition facts and it had a LOT of sodium, which is shocking since it tasted so bland. Moreover, it said 1 of these 1.9 ounce cups is 2 servings. That's preposterous. How could 1 oz. of anything (even with the addition of bland broth) count as a serving? I think they only made it into 2 servings because otherwise, 1 of these cups would probably be 50+% of your daily sodium allowance? I threw my cup away, so I can't check it, but believe me, it had a shocking amount of sodium for gross, bland noodles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This tastes nothing like miso or ramen so I'm not sure why they bothered labeling it as such. It does turn into a soupy substance when you add your own water though. So, how does it taste you ask? Bad. Not inedibly bad but bad nonetheless.

I just can't get past the 2 questionable ingredients: yeast extract & natural flavors. These are 2 ingredients that almost always contain MSG. If they didn't, why would they be in there with such odd names. Why wouldn't it just say flour or carrots? When I make soup at home I never add anything called natural flavors, and wouldn't know where to get yeast extract. These are unnecessary ingredients that I am guessing are not so natural and are probably flavor enhancers. I wouldn't care so much, but MSG in any form gives me a headache. If the ingredients read \\"MSG\\" or \\"Monosodium Glutamate\\" many customers would avoid the product. Hence the need to be covert. Google MSG and read how many ingredients (additives) actually contain MSG.

The noodles are ramen, but not GOOD ramen. They are thin, flat, and have a strange aftertaste and texture. The flavor of the soup itself isn't miso, but a bland approximation of it. It tastes more like a watered down salty broth. There isn't much wakame, and a few more tiny chucks of tasteless tofu.

They seem to pop up everywhere, just in time to save the day, while everyone else gets picked off like fleas! Their wounds seem to heal supernaturally!And then I'm supposed to believe that a pot head who's stupid enough to believe that he's going to get all A's for the semester because he's helping the government, can crack the computer code that none of the big boys can?

The story made zero sense and zipped around the world. The big secret was laughable. I kept reading hoping that the big reveal would make it worth it...um, no. The fact that some WWII vets had deciphered a Nazi code that revealed that something vague, and semi-sinister would happen at some point in time was enough to worry supposed illuminati-style bad guys enough to hunt them across the globe and kill them?

Please.) This novel is written in a wanna-be-Dan-Brown style but clearly lacking the skills of his fellow author. Overall, the book lacks a decent instigative element. Why would the Arabs care what Nostradamus wrote? It just makes no sense that they would run after a piece of paper written by Nostradamus that vaguely describes a terrorist attack. Had they not looked for it, their plan would've probably worked since the old veterans had no clue where to start looking.

I treated the house, washed all bedding, bathed the animals and applied the Advantage. I could have rubbed the money I spent on the flea control on them and gotten the same results. They would be flea free for maybe one day and then my pets were full again. And the fleas didn't even act as if they were affected by it at all. The fleas were full of life jumping all around.

I am very disappointed in my purchase of Advantage and will purchase Frontline instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this is great stuff. much better than frontline. only reason i gave 4 stars is because it says on the box that you CAN wash your pets after putting on the advantage. i dont care what the box, vets, or anyone says, this WILL mess up the treatment and your $ goes down the drain....no pun intended. i've been working with animals for a long time....wash and groom your pet, administer the advantage, and wait 4 weeks until you groom and bathe again. its makes giving the medicine, and your grooming schedule easier to remember. plus you really dont want to bathe your dog anymore than that. anyway, GREAT product other wise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't tell ya!","review":"Did no receive the small dog one.

Advantage works the best of any of them, but I wish it didn't cost so much.Not only did it get rid of the flea problems quickly, it holds up for a month. It also is by far the easiest to apply of any topical anti-flea application, which is worth something, especially when you have a cat that hates to get even minimally wet and a dog that gets into everything.

Anyway, I ordered the Advantage after reading about so many positive (and safe!!) reviews. And this absolutely worked. We've had it on our 6 mo. old pomeranian for over a week now and it is still working nicely. After the first bath following the application (about 3 days later) at least 20 dead fleas were in the water and on the towel and we still found some days later.

Couldn't find this anywhere else.","review":"Great movie. Arnold is a charismatic person. His story shows people that anything can be done as long as you don't give up. Roland Kickinger did a nice job portraying Arnold. That is probably why they hired him to play a robot in Terminator Salvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocket book !","review":"I am deceived, I would have rated this book 4 or 4.5 stars if it was not for its format: 6\\"x7\\". The pirelli calendar is about brilliant pictures taken by some of the most reknown photographers at the peak of their craft! Therefore when you have 4 pictures printed on a page, you are left with very small images wich fall short from giving them the acknoledgement they deserve. What was supposed to be a feast for the eyes leaves you on your appetite. Dont get me wrong, the book is well made and printed, and after having said all that, it's a bargain to have the entire 1964 to 2001 era in one book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, REAL female science fiction characters.","review":"Friesner puts together a collection of stories that poke fun at the stereotypical female character in science fiction novels. It was funny and it showed that female characters can be just as tough and interesting as the Conans of the science fiction world. Way to go Friesner"},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought the book for it's cover","review":"I have to be honest when I say it was the cover of the book that sold me. Despite not having too many scantily clad babes in chainmail bikinis I still liked the stories. It was refreshing to be able to read a fantasy where the women are always in peril. The short stories are a quick read and something you do not have to but a lot of effort into following. A book that as easy to but down as it is to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"From mediocre to dire","review":"There are a few half-decent entertaining works in this book. In fact about half of them are average, mildly entertaining stories. The problem is the other half are below average to flat out dire.The arrangement of the stories left something to be desired as well. Placing the very worst story of the collection in the fourth slot, after a couple below average tales almost put an end to my reading right there. The story I'm speaking of is the Hilary Clinton in Valhalla tale.Even the better stories are hobbled by the restrictions of the collection. One after the other of stories that are very similar, bad jokes that aren't presented too differently from one story to the other just wears the reader down with the lack of variety. Really, how many breastplate asides and jokes are necessary?Suffice to say that the title is the cleverest part of the collection. Good idea, but it wasn't pulled off.2.5 stars that I rounded down to a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable failure.","review":"I too thought this would be fun, but the stories are trite, a struggle to read, pure boredom. I got as far as Hillary Clinton being transported to Valhalla after a train crash, and this book crashed shut. It has made the rounds in my office without one person completing the book, or any positive comments. I can't get rid of it. Even as an oddity, it is a miserable failure. This feminist joke is horribly presented. Any comic book on the same subject would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pun-nishment","review":"When I stumbled on this series, I thought \\"this should be fun\\" with good authors working with the opportunity to be creative and insightful and wise. Instead I read some simple, contrived, and boring stories that showed that the authors didn't \\"get it\\". From the nagging mother to the stories based on bad puns, I can't think of one story that I wanted to share with my wife. The Tamora Pierce \\"Alanna\\" series was more on target, even if it was a teen series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book that Whacks Stereotypes in the chops","review":"Chicks in Chainmail is one of those books that had to be a volume of irony, the title wouldn't permit anything else. Friesner's relating the (real? fictional) difficulties in getting people to get the title accepted is a good start, and the book goes right on from there, shredding stereotypes, stomping on the fragile male ego (you know, us males ARE the genetically disadvantaged ones, ask any doctor), and in general having a good time stepping on those preconceptions that people tuck away in the back of their head. Some people may not like the one-note nature of the book, but I think THAT'S THE POINT! The selective taxation story ought to be mailed direcly to our present congress, too. I read it on a plane, and again when I got home. Then my spouse captured it and giggled until about 3 in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must to slip under your little girl's pillow!","review":"This is a smart, funny and sexy book! Drawing from various science fiction writers both male and female, a collection of both halarious and inspiring stories portrays women as warriors, healers, and mothers, often at the same time. This is a must to slip under your little girl's pillow, and would make an excellent coming of age gift. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously showing its age","review":"This book was written in 1968 and then updated in 1996. While it contains a wealth of information the illustrations of the wild flowers are black and white sketches with a few color sketches included in all but the white plant sections. For actual field identification, it would be far better to have actual plant pictures. Even the Peterson First Guides to Wildflowers contains all color illustrations. My other field guides with photographs are more useful. Maybe the Peterson Field Guide Service might consider redoing this book as an iPhone/iPad app in the future. Until, I do not recommend this field guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book.","review":"I found this book to be of minimal use.

Easy.I applied it on, thinking nothing of the minor burning following the application. I thought it would be fine! Of course it would be fine, the box says it's gentle. So let's continue on with it!!Time was up. The hair could be removed easily with a wipe, so I did. Yay, hair was off! But god, the application site sure feels painful.In the end, the area started to be red and irritated. I eventually decided to use rubbing alcohol (which stung so bad I cried) to cleanse the area. Thankfully this helped the irritation.This could all have been avoided if I just didn't purchase this item to begin with.

Very disappointed with description.Also, the red is not cherry red like it looks on the screen. It is definitely dark brownish red. But wait, there is more...there is no sheen whatsoever like in the alternate pix. It is completely not shiny and has micro pebble like texture, not smooth like the pictures.The fit is ok for the new iPad, other than the top cover slightly not lying flat and the stereo holes not matching at all(completely covered...completely misaligned)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seventy year old grandma who says, \\"Amen!\\"","review":"I share the view that age adds a beautiful dimension if one so chooses.

Went to slice cheese yesterday after owning this product for the last 2 and a half years, and the thing snapped right in half. Not the slicer it's self, mind you, but the neck...the thick part...snapped right in half. Now maybe I am mistaken, but I thought something that is only ever used for slicing cheese should probably last a little longer than a couple years. To it's credit, it did work fine up until then-though as other people said, the slices are on the thick side-I just couldn't believe the whole thing snapped like that. Going with something else for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adjustable or durable","review":"For such a simple device, it really missed the mark. Its not adjuatable, so you are stuck with just one thickness, which happens to be too thick for my preference. I use a slicer so I can get nice thin slices. If I wanted thick ones like this, I can just use a knife. On top of that it broke after about a year. Not getting this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sturdy enough","review":"This cheese slicer costs much more than others, but the part that holds the cutter is plastic, and it broke shortly after the manufacturer's warranty ran out.

I bought this DVD under the christian movie section. There isn't enough information on this movie; so maybe this will help keep other believers from throwing away money.

My first was loaned along with my First Edition Catechism and sadly never returned. The value of this book is indespensible. It expands upon the references in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) and allows you to see the full reference in its context. In doing so, you begin to appreciate the chain of thought of the original authors of the CCC, as well as begin to have a broadened appreciation for the wealth of insight that two millenia of devotion has produced.I not only highly recommend the Companion to the CCC, but it should almost be a required set for any catecumin, serious student of theology and scripture, or anyone who wants to learn with precision and depth what the true position of the Catholic Church is with regard to her doctines."},{"rating":"1","title":"dogma is for me","review":"I've studied Catechism all through my childhood and thought this book might help me to understand. \\"Understand\\", you say?

This book does make the whole pill easier to swallow, but I still don't unerstand why they make us do it. We go, we see, we do the tricks, the bells, the whistles, and they leave you so empty and unfulfilled.

The greatest strengths of the book are two-fold. First, it is written in easy to follow, plain english. Second, it is amazingly comprehensive. I have been practicing employment law in two millenia, and this is the book that I use (after reviewing dozens) to teach non-lawyer classes on the topic. As with any survey book, it doesn't cover the details of the many topics it touches. You don't want to use this book to deal with comprehensive planning or an employment law dispute. But if you read this book you'll understand much of the language and many of the concerns of the experienced human resources professional or lawyer that you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I am an avid fantasy reader and I was looking for something new and fun. I looked online to see if there were any popular fantasy books/series/authors I had yet to read and Terry Brooks' \\"Sword of Shannara\\" was one that many people recommended. So, without even reading the jacket or checking out the first chapter, I bought the Kindle edition of the trilogy. This was probably one of the worst book purchase mistakes I have ever had the misfortune to make. The writing is bland and stilted. The characters and plot are so predictable I was out of my mind with boredom. I finished the first book wondering why on earth I had wasted my time with it, but I figured, since it was Brooks' first book, the series might get better. I was wrong. The subsequent books were just as dull and plodding. I would *not* recommend these books to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another one...","review":"I recently bought the Sword of Shannara book at my local book store and figured I would give it a go. To my disappointment you never get truly involved in the story and at times I wondered if I should give up the whole book.I read the other reviews here just to see what others thought about the book and that made me write this review. I just have to say, how on earth can you give this book 5 stars!! Fanboys or what?For those of you that are considering this book, try a book by: Gemmel, Steven Erikson, Orson Scott Card, R.R. Martin, Hobb ... instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After playing the DOS game based on this series I thought I'd give the books a try. I read through a few chapters but I couldn't continue it got so boring. Its a difficult job for an author to grab a reader and hold their attention for any novel let alone an epic series. They should be able to do this by the first page or even the first sentence of the story but after a few chapters I really didn't feel invested enough in these characters to want to go on a huge journey with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have the whole trilogy back-to-back","review":"I always find myself looking for a complete series: having them all together in one \\"book\\" is truly an awesome find!This epic series is one of my favorites - not a replica of The Lord of the Rings - but it does follow a similar theme, so it's a fun, adventurous read. The distant future twist is cool and unique, and Terry Brooks does a good job twisting our current history, with current folk lore, to paint an epic fantasy saga in our distant future. If you like J R Tolkien, you'll love this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Highly recommended for fantasy readers.

I'll probably look into getting one for myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and hated it.","review":"I have to say this first.The first book of this set, The Sword of Shannara is a blatant rip off of LOTR. I won't go into detail, but because it follows the storyline of LOTR so closely there were virtually no surprises in the story. It is so obvious that at every turn I could say \\"What would Tolkien do in this instance\\" and voila guess what happens.Now that that's taken care of, the second two books are actually pretty decent. I like the world that Brooks created, and the characters are much more interesting than the LOTR clones from the first book.After reading the first book I wouldn't have chosen to read any further Brooks material. Since I had all three in this edition, I decided to tough it out and I was pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Trilogy, once you get past trying to compare it with LOTR","review":"Yes, this book has many similarities to the Lord of the Rings, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that it is a great story that is definitely worth reading. I struggled a little at times with not making comparisons, but once I got over that, I really began to see the book as its own story which was highly entertaining and and exciting for me to read. I haven't read it for a couple years and now that I got my kindle I definitely plan on purchasing it and reading it again, because it is one of the books that is worth re-reading every now and then :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the fantasy series worth reading","review":"This was the first fantasy work I read after LOTR, and while it didn't compare favorably, the plot line moved along, the characters were likeable, and the adventure was fairly constant.

I couldn't get into this book at all as I had already read a much better, more dramatic version with far superior characters called 'Lord of the Rings'.I knew what would happen in this book at almost every step because it follows Tolkien's book so closely. Do yourself a favor Read 'Lord of the Rings' if you want monsters, battles and magic OR read the 'Warded Man' for a truly new fantasy experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as I remember it was...","review":"Still an entertaining read after all these years, but it doesn't hold up to the passage of time as well as I thought it would. When I first read the Shannara series (back in the mid-80's I believe) I remember being totally captivated by the story and the characters, but 20 some years later it just doesn't satisfy nearly as well. The story seems hurried, the characters a bit thin, and the magic just isn't there. I still enjoy Terry Brooks writing, but after having read LOTR several times in between Shannara reads, it's now obvious just how blatant the copy of the story and characters is. I'll still continue to read some Brooks novels, but with less enthusiasm than I did when I was much younger, probably still a good series for younger readers to sink their teeth into however..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incognito","review":"I first read the Sword of Shannara in the late 70's when it first showed up in book stores. Being a big Tolkein fan, I was worried that it was going to be a rewrite and wouldn't hold my attention. Boy was I wrong.. the characters came vividly alive in their own good time as any good fantasy should. Yes it was 'in the style of' Lord of the Rings but definitely no copy. I enjoyed it immensely and devoured the book in no time. It was a wonderful prelude for the remainder of the Shannara series. It was well worth the read. Loved it. My ancient copy was autographed by Terry in the early 90's. Very nice down to earth man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another wonderful offering from Terry Brooks","review":"In recent years I have become a fantasy buff, and Terry Brooks is one of the greats.

Brooks is fine for an airline trip, but I wouldn't push it beyond that. This is not a memorable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"I have a kindle and bought the trilogy which was fairly expensive for a kindle book. I purchased it based on the great reviews it had. I didn't even get through the first chapter. The author must have been a high school English teacher since it is written for proper grammar without any interest in communicating as normal people would communicate. This was so irritating to me I lost complete interest in it. No one (even fantasy characters) talk this way. I've annually read LOTR and the Hobbit and have read A song of fire and ice series from George Martin and waiting on the latest. All these were written to communicate on the level of each character based on their role but in \\"The Sword of Shannara\\" everyone must have graduated from Cambridge University.

You can draw a 1-for-1 coloration between the characters (here's the \\"Frodo\\" character; here's the \\"Aragorn\\" character, etc.). What's worse, the story isn't even good. PLOT: (1) characters get into trouble, (2) the \\"Aragorn\\" character shows up out of nowhere and saves them, (3) repeat. That Brooks has been able to string an entire series out of this is amazing. He must laugh his way to the bank every quarter when he cashes his royalty check. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad","review":"Terry Brooks had a good idea for a story so it's a shame that it turned out as poorly as it did. This may be the worst written book to ever land between hard covers. Good fantasy has an element of rationality; this book is a testament to the \\"escaping the avalanche...\\" school of writing. The characters are shallow, the adventures are trite. It's rare that I don't finish a book once I begin to read it, but there was no way I could get through this dribble. If you MUST read this, at least buy a second-hand copy; using paper to print more copies of this is nothing less than a sin."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Robert Stanek you'll love Terry Brooks","review":"I thought only Tolkien could transport my mind to another world.

David Eddings, Joel Rosenberg, Lynn Flewelling, Raymond E Feist. Even Brooks became a better writer as the genre grew. So i guess its nice to see how the works of fantasy have imroved, if nothing else.I had good memories of my first read through this series, and i regret re-reading after all the years.

I am clearly from the wrong demographic; these stories seem to be aimed at young boys. I like fantasy, but I am not a fan of jejune writing. It's tiring to read about characters who yell when there is no need or whose voices continually trail off... And any story that has exclamation points in the text is clearly aimed at a younger crowd, the sort of reader who, had he been born many decades earlier, would have enjoyed the Hardy boys. In short, I found the stories boring and wish I had read the negative reviews here before purchasing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I picked this up on a whim. I love fantasy Robert Jordan, Branden Sanderson, being my favorites. This is Lord of the Rings rewritten. I can't believe how many ideas he stole from Tolkien. There is nothing original here. This is awful, and boring! Waste of my time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the Elite Writers","review":"Brooks writes like one of my friends when they give me there take on a book. He does not know how to build relationships in the books. Write they talk about the past and the future and then the guy thinks he loves her. The story is ok, but there is no feeling to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Fantasy Series Ever(next to LoTR, of course)","review":"Love this series! I've read the entire series through twice! The way Brooks shadows Par in The Sword, Uncle Boh in The Druid, and Wren in the Elf-Queen, then does all three in The Talismans is pretty amazing. The book has a lot of humor, and is very exciting. The first book starts off a bit dry, but they get much better. I got so into it, I read the entire series in about one week, because I could hardly put any of them down. The Elf-Queen I finished off in a day. They're great books! A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Brooks Fan I Am!!","review":"I am a total fan of Terry Brooks, I have been following his writing since I was in the 9th grade (too many years ago) when I read The Sword of Shannara in the first edition hard cover. How I wish I hadn't given that book away....I have read and re-read the entire Shannara Series, the Running with the Demon Series and most recently the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara series, and while at times it can be predictable, I still can't put them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books, I love them.","review":"The Sword of Shannara and the Elfstones of Shannara (have yet to read 'The Wishsong of Shannara') are great books. The crisp details of the battles, and the sharp characterization make these books great. So, it's cliche in a few places, but it's original in it's own way. It's a wild tale, and it kept me entertained for many nights. I even finished the Elfstones of Shannara in a week's time for it kept me so enthralled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly pleasant","review":"I purchased this trilogy while waiting for another book to be released. I had read the Word and the Void trilogy in high school and thought I would give this one a shot. I must admit I have been thoroughly pleased with this trilogy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Reality","review":"I loved this trilogy.It's a welcome change to discover main characters who have their weaknesses held up for all the world to see. Despite their shortcomings, we see in each book echoes of ourselves and how, if we could find the courage to face adversity despite our many weaknesses, we'd be all the stronger for it. Look for the hidden message. It's there - along with a set of thoroughly entertaining tales, each refreshingly different from the other, that will transport you to a world of 'what if' and leave you breathlessly wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative","review":"OK, up front I'm a big Tolkien fan. Since the 70's. Never heard of this guy, but thought, well, I like this kind of stuff. Let's give him a try. Read the first story. Slowly. Started the second story. Gave up after about four chapters. You can see where this guy got all his ideas. Save time and just read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy again. I have 5 times. You won't be disappointed. With Terry Brooks, you will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What got cut","review":"It is nice to have all of the books in one volume.

One of the best adventures ever","review":"I remember reading the Sword of Shannara in junior high school as required reading.

I think, that if a film of these books was made, it would rival Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Christian life should be one of honesty with ourselves, with our communities and with the world.

Difficult to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubert Selby Jr. One Not To be Overlooked","review":"Hubert Selby Jr. It'll Be Better Tomorrow is a fascinating film. How could an author of such overwhelming influence have become so overlooked for so long. Controversy and drugs derailed this genius but when you hear those he influenced tell it, it was the mainstream that passed him by not the artists. Selby's battles with TB, heroin, and everything else belie the spiritual giant he seems to have become. Lou Reed tells how 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' spun his world, Lou Reed goes on to spin the world of music, the impact is profound. Writing when books could still be banned 'England banned Last Exit', Selby triumphed and didn't bow. Amazing film, well crafted and concise, a great look into the soul of the artist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Selby fans rejoice!","review":"This is an informative look inside one of the most talented but tortured writers of our time.

They appear to be safe because the entire backing is made of a magnetic material. The magnet isn't too strong, but strong enough to stick to sheet metal.ConstructionThe construction of the product appears to be laminated wood or laminated wood pulp - looks like plywood, but much lighter.The painted layer is a laminated layer on top. I would not go as far to say that it is a sticker, but it's not simply painted wood.DurabilityLike other reviewers, I've noticed that the top painted layer will begin to wear or delaminate if your child puts it in their mouth. Other than that, the pieces are solid and stiff.I have the letters and the numbers set and I do recommend this product for its value and safety. I can imagine that there are higher quality products out there, but when you think about the longevity of children's' toys in general, this set is on par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Melissa and Doug.","review":"Another quality product from Melissa and Doug.

Patricia tells the story of how her adventurous side comes alive through one Grand Canyon trip, motivating her to abandon her corporate urban life in NYC for the wild rivers of the American West.

The technical content is lame and disjointed. Unrealistic shots of Computer Animated Airplanes plague the movie.

Admittedly the 787 is a marvel of engineering and might indeed be a game-changing airplane, but that could be said of countless other aircraft and hardly any of them, including this one, would be a fitting subject for a movie/commercial like this one.

Lots of shots of the inside of a factory and engineers sitting around talking about airplanes. This is like watching a board meeting with a few eye candy videos mixed into a very uninteresting story.

Most of the action takes place in the Boeing assembly plant. On screen design graphics are pretty dazzling, but it was a real disappointment that all the 'bird-in-flight' footage was animation, and not too great animation at that. I've seen other films where actual birds were shown in flight, with stunning results.The 787 is a beautifully designed aircraft, but not worth an entire IMAX film.NOTE: I did NOT view the 3D home version, which might have been a much better viewing experience. I saw this at an IMAX Theater where the picture is in front, sides, and on top of you - not the best viewing experience at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D","review":"Just purchased a 3D TV and wanted a 3D DVD to demo my new toy.

The array is no less enormous than Mahler's symphony No.8 requires.Simply speaking, Sir Colin Davis and LSO ensure an excellent Berlioz performance. This splendid Requiem recording of 1969, like other Berlioz discs from LSO under the baton of Davis, can be rated first class in terms of all aspects. Davis's unique reading is as charming as before, especially at chorus sections. The original recording keeps high level of Philips and the CD transfer is also well done.Colin Davis ranks absolutely among greatest Berlioz exponents. This Requiem interpretation stands undoubtedly along with those legendary performances from Charles Munch and Sir Thomas Beecham.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The description of this book is deceptive. The book merely goes over numerous topics lightly and barely goes into detail at all when the reader really wants it.

Charlie's friend Nick (Sean Marble) is one of those guys which women in real life hate, but in the movies, they love.

Of the 2 chapters that might help, I won't actually know until after I have the baby. There's little advice for prepping your dog - much of it is advice for how to fix an existing or developed problem, not avoiding them altogether (like licking baby's face or eating diapers - no advice for how to avoid... just how to fix if you see it happen).

He dispels myths and gives new parents an idea of what to expect both from their dog and from themselves. He identifies often-missed (or exused) signs of dominance in dogs, explaining the natural progression from dominance to aggression if left unchecked. In cases where there is a specific problem involving advanced aggression toward a child he advises going to a professional, as would any responsible dog trainer in print.

It would take volumes of books to address exactly how each individual breed, temperament and problem should be handled. That perspective is best left to a reputable, thorough and non-violent trainer. Brian and Sarah give you good specific information on how to keep common problems from developing and some great general rules that apply to every breed of dog.

He has never chewed on her toys or given us a reason to feel uncomfortable. Not to say he isn't still hyper, he is, but he knows to avoid her. She is able to love on him, take his toys, and pet him. He behaves beautifully. He always barrels through the back door, and she gets such a kick out of it that she stands in the middle of the doorway and lets him blow past her while she giggles at him.

It is on the back and one must use the stylus to operate it. It is impossible to get to the back to operate the switch when the Navman is mounted in the car. One must remove the Navman from the mount in order to operate the on/off switch.

And evidently, the author didn't rate either a first rate editor or a fact checker. For example, there's no \\"e\\" after the \\"g\\" in judgment. He does this repeatedly. Moreover, for someone allegedly so well-versed in the entertainment industry, he's apparently rather ignorant of some basic knowledge. When discussing Reagan's inaugural parties planned by Sinatra, Clarke mentions \\"someone named Ben Vereen who performed in blackface\\", and then trashes Sinatra's \\"judgement\\" in arranging such entertainment.

It's possible that Pad Thai is the only gross one of Dr. McDougal's soups, but I don't think I will be taking my chances with any of the other flavors offered."},{"rating":"1","title":"photoshop at its finest","review":"I bought these thinking they would at least be somewhat like the picture and the noodles would be thick (like pad thai noodles...). instead what I got was an over-spiced (not spicy, just an attempt to mask the terrible product by throwing in too many spices), flat noodle soup that not only tasted terrible but was not filling in the least. You'll get better flavor and a more filling meal with the cheapest imitation ramen noodle product."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad taste","review":"I prepared as instructed, but the taste was not pleasing, Very fast food like , a poor taste.Was especially disapointed, as the McDougall Split Pea soup is something I do rather like,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavorless, salty and not really Pad Thai","review":"I'm not sure what part of this is supposed to be pad thai - the noodles are short and chewy and the flavor pack tastes mainly of salt. I know this is an instant product but I was expecting something that was vaguely close to Pad Thai rather than a bowl of hot water without much flavor. Although this is tagged as vegan, I suspect it's not very healthy since I felt like drinking a gallon of water after eating this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as bad as the ramen noodles","review":"Second strike for Dr. McDougall's. Love the pilaf and tortilla soup, hate the ramen and pad thai. So mushy, salty and disgusting with a weird chemical taste.

Signed up for subscription service and paying only 1.50 per cup, a good deal in my book and love that it comes directly to my door. I would otherwise have to drive 45 minutes to buy in a local grocery store. So pleased! Tasty and cheap lunch option. Will keep several in my desk for work!

I could not believe how disappointing this was. The ony PRO was that it was chock full of noodles. If you love rice noodles, the Asian style, this has oodles.But the flavor was lacking. So bland, it was like someone took the soup and watered it down and served noodles in saltyish water. It's called Pad Thai soup, but as a pad thai afficionado, I can't say I noticed any resemblance to pad thai--other than Asian noodles.If you like watery noodle soup, go for it.If you actually want a burst of Thai yumminess, this is not a soup I can recommend.Mir"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edible, but certainly not good","review":"\\"Fresh flavor\\" -- don't you believe it.

I won't say that I had to choke it down, but it wasn't very far from that.

That combined with the classic Pad Thai flavor just made this completely inedible for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great..","review":"I have had Pad Thai before...And always liked it quite a bit. This kind, to me, is pretty disgusting. It's nothing like any of it I've had before. The noodles are weird and really short and the broth they're in is gross.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping","review":"The Black Bean Soup is very good so I was hoping I found another winner in the Pad Thai Noodle Soup. Not so. The fruit flavors and other flavors are a little too overpowering.

But I won't buy this flavor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd expect","review":"I love Pad Thai and had great expectations for this product. Unfortunately, it was a bust. However, the product is described as a soup, and that should have been a tip off, since Pad Thai is more of a spicy noodle dish than a soup. You won't find either the flavor or texture that you'll find in real Pad Thai."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because there is no zero option","review":"This concoction was as bitter as a divorce after 20 years of marriage.

If it doesn't look like pad thai or taste like pad thai, it's probably a good idea to call it something besides pad thai. A few broken rice noodles in the bottom of a cup of dehydrated broth does not a pad thai make.I had this for lunch today, and the other kids pointed and laughed at me. Thai people walked past my table, frowning and shaking their heads. Soup technicians from the Department of Soup issued my lunch a cease-and-desist order. President Obama stopped by my table, gave me a stern look, and said, \\"Mark, I thought we had made more progress than this. Forget the debt ceiling. We need to do something about this concoction, which is neither pad thai, nor soup, but an unsatisfying amalgamation of the two.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good for something so easy to prepare!","review":"I found this product while shopping at Whole Foods.

This is a great product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noodles Are All Little Pieces","review":"Like the other reviews, it doesn't taste like Pad Thai. I was disappointed that the 'noodles' are actually broken up pieces of noodles...so no long strands here.

A lot. My favorites include: Black Bean and Lime Soup and the variety of oatmeals. The Pad Thai soup is not good. Both, the flavor and texture are disappointing.

For a very good studiorecording (with all music, without cuts) buy maestro Zeddas from the 70's with Rosetta Pizzo, Pietro Bottazzo, Nucci Condò etc. It's slower but at the same time much more true to the work than Parrys boring (but fast), stale tempos. For example the big \\"prayer\\" in the 2nd act \\"Deh tu reggi\\" almost drives me to tears in Zeddas version (which surely must be the meaning) but in Parrys hands I almost feel nothing. And the ensembles are way too fast. If you want a good liverecording, the one from Pesaro with Ricciarelli and Furlanetto is the only available that hasn't got extensive cuts (sony). Mateuzzi is the tenor in that one and he isn't my favourite but the rest is sooo good."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"My healthcare provider recommended I read this book.

I wish Henry were right. I wish it were that easy. The truth is, depression destroys a person's ability to \\"detach, see feelings as passing clouds,\\" or even meditate. As one author put it: \\"You don't learn to meditate AFTER you find out you have a brain tumor.\\" You work on these skills before you need them.The best book I can recommend for dealing with depression is actually an old book, written by a woman who clearly understood the bewilderment and despair of depression and the ravaging terror of anxiety. The book is \\"Hope and Help for Your Nerves,\\" by Claire Weekes. Although originally written for people suffering from anxiety, every client I've lent it to has replaced my copy or refused to give it back. Once you feel better, read The Chemistry of Joy. But while you're suffering, read Claire Weekes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A broader view of depresssion","review":"Excellent book. A multi-disciplinary view of depression, it looks beyond drug and talk therapy without denying their importance. Emmons studied, practices, and writes about other approaches to depression, such as diet, supplements, exercise, Ayurvedic (historical Indian) medicine and the Buddhist psychological/emotional types. This provides a deeper and broader understanding and treatment of depression. A richly woven text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"Sound is good, but the earpieces themselves are large and bulky. Not great for running. Also, the clip is made of a clear thin plastic spindle with a soft plastic curve attached at the end. The soft plastic immediately broke off from the spindle. All I did was store them in a separate compartment of my gym bag and they broke. The clip will still rest on my ear but not comfortably and they won't stay on unless I wrap a bandana around my ears. Also, even before they broke, these earphones did not stay on during sit ups or push ups so they are not great for the gym. If you are a walker who treats them very carefully, they will work fine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use on the go.","review":"These headphones are not very comfortable, they are large and heavy for supporting them with only your ears with insufficient cushioning. For sound quality they are okay, but if you turn your head too fast they fly off. I cannot imagine using them while trying to run or walk. I was baffled by the hinge on them to make the earpiece wider, they are not secure in their \\"locked\\" state so I see no need to make more room on them. The main feature of attraction was the retractable cord, but the wire between the ear pieces themselves is not retractable, far longer than it appears in the image, and it sort of nullifies the appeal of that feature. I gave this product a year of \\"benefit of the doubt\\" and then went back to a standard ear bud.

It's not a bad DVD - everything is quite professionally and neatly done - but the material presented is probably not very useful if you are an amateur photographer, i.e. not a total novice.If you are about to buy your first digital camera, or if you've just bought yourself one, this DVD will definitely fill in some blanks, but if you're expecting very in-depth technical information about digital cameras and digital photography - the stuff you won't find in the manual - then you will likely be a tad disappointed. This is not the learning tool that will take you a significant step closer to being a hard-core professional photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically simple with a professional sound","review":"I've used everything from Ableton Live to ProTools to Reason and this thing is just plug and play. Very easy interface makes for no brainer recording. I'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding. Most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it's all about the SONG.

But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two. In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the \\"3:00\\" position on the dial. And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation. It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time! Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless. I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead. Even if it costs more.

One thing I didn't like is that it sets up your computer to run all of your audio through the interface. I couldn't put the interface anywhere near my CRT monitor, since it got extremely noisy. The only other place I had was on top of my computer, and it picked up the sound of the mouse. When I ran my audio through it, it made a loud intermittent static noise, and was unusable. I sent it back, and Amazon gave me a full refund with no problems. Maybe the the loud static noise was due to a defect, but the rest of the issues made it unusable for me.

I was very excited to see on Amazon a board book version of 5 Little Ladybugs and immediately ordered it for my daughter so she could have a copy that she could play with by herself. I expected the pages to be thick and sturdy like other baby board books, something that could stand up to a toddler or baby. However, the pages are the same thick paper as the 10 Little Ladybugs book. I was very disappointed as she would destroy this book quickly too. We will probably hold onto it as a gift for someone since it is a very nice little book. I just wish they had a sturdier version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ears With Plugs","review":"I am a Die-Hard Tori fan. So much so that I have hoped and prayed since first hearing the down-falls of To Venus and Back, that Tori would come back to visit in that sub-conscious place that only Tori can go. In consequence I have wasted time, money and real heartache in being a devoted fan; Being in denial, wanting to hope for that light in the dark. Tori has become the anti-thesis of what she set out to do musically. Her whole essence is contradictory to the genius Tori we all fell in love with. Instead of touching something real, setting something free, she has embraced the sterility of our popular culture. Tragically, the beekeeper is the last Tori album I'll be buying. I finally have given up on her. I've decided to put away the new albums and try to remember her magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I haven't been able to listen to the whole cd all the way through, because I find it to be incredibly boring. What happened to 'Boys for Pele' Tori? which by far was her best album. Don't get me wrong, what I have listened to, there are some decent songs...but overal, it just seems like she's getting worn out, and as much as I hate to say it, seeming as though she might want to reconsider her life-long profession. Tori Amos is incredibly talented, thats a given, but since 'To Venus and Back' she has lost her creative spark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing into The Beekeeper","review":"I have had the opportunity to listen to this CD for a few weeks now, and though I was initially timid to accept it, it grew on me. Tori has a more mature lyric and musical style in this piece which is accentuated by the organ. The tracks on this record sound very realistic with few apparent \\"studio\\" enhancements, and beg to be played live. I would love to give this record 5 stars for tracks like \\"Marys of the Sea\\", \\"Martha's Foolish Ginger\\", \\"Parasol\\", and \\"Witness\\", but disappointing tracks (especially \\"Ireland\\" and \\"Cars and Guitars\\") are holding me back. This is an essential purchase for any Tori fan, and highly recommended for the music connoisseur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very long, and every song is good","review":"One of the things I love about Tori Amos is that in addition to being an incredibly talented artist, she doesn't usually skimp on her albums. This one in particular is very nearly 80 minutes long, and unlike some of her others, I can listen to it all the way through. A few of my favorites: \\"Ribbons Undone\\" is a loving ode to her young daughter, \\"Ireland\\" is a silly but fun song - silly because you can't really drive to Ireland, and I am not sure what \\"Martha's Foolish Ginger\\" is about but it's a good song. Another favorite is \\"Goodbye Pisces\\" and the album closes with the very sad but beautiful \\"Toast\\". Great disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"beeZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Ohp's was I sleeping?","review":"First off I am a huge Tori fan, seen her live ,got all her stuff..

Her music is like nothing I've ever heard and I support her in everything she puts out there. But, I will be honest this is horrible. Come on Tori, we have been waiting since \\"Strange Little Girls\\" for some good, harsh, raw, honest, offensive, piano fire like Pele, Choirgirl and Pink. There are maybe 4 songs on this CD of 19 that I can stomach. 3 things cause artists to loose it: getting married, getting sober and having kids. Tori had all 3 hit at once and what a waste! I'm praying the next CD will take us back a little. I read in an interview where Tori said her next CD she's almost completed is old Tori we haven't heard in a while. I hope so. I'm tired of falling asleep to a song about driving in Ireland with friends in a Saab. I mean what's that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I have been an avid fan of Tori since Little Earthquakes. I really tried to like this CD - but I shouldn't have to try so hard. It's just not that good. She is trying to force her creativity now, whereas it used to come naturally. The cheesy, MIDI sounding instrumentation doesn't help either.Go back and listen to Choirgirl or Under the Pink after this. It is shocking to see how poorly this compares. The beauty, experimentation, moods and pure wildness of her music is all but gone. Replaced by easy listening elevator music, a familiar voice, but a shadow of Tori Amos past, singing with none of her former enthusiasm, lust or passion. Very Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Wrong With Tori?!","review":"I don't know how long these people've been listening to Tori who gave her 5 stars here. I've been listening to her for a long time since her first solo album. I just don't know what's wrong with her, her albums are like getting worse and worse after The Choirgirl Hotel.Really really disappointed, where's the old, crazy, senual, intimate, emotional, piano girl?! The piano seems like less important for her now, every song sounds similar, same boring beats/drums, yes, it's soft and easy to listen, but less emotion, less powerful, although she's getting extremely fashionable and beautiful herself.If she's just going to choose this way to go for her music, then I can't find a reason to listen to her anymore, I loved her cos' she was different, now...? *Sigh*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~But I'm sure she got more fans now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","review":"Tori Amos has lots of talent, but this album is a little ridiculous.

I miss songs like \\"Mother\\" and \\"winter\\" geeeeeeeeeeeeeeez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute GARBAGE","review":"As a Tori fan, I must say this is the worst album she's ever done. Many of the songs seem to try too hard to fit into the image that she built with the previous albums, sometimes channeling \\"Little Earthquakes\\" and \\"Under the Pink\\". For those new to Tori's music, it's best to skip this album and begin with her older, more solid material."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE Tori Amos but find Beekeeper droll","review":"I agree with Sean from Oakland (wuddup Oaktown??!!) - this album is weak. (Although, I admit, I couldn't bear to give it less than 2 stars, Tori still has that amazing voice and piano skill.) I am not sure I've even been able to listen to it all in one sitting. I've tried everything, downloaded on my computer, my iPod, nothing works, I always end up skipping or deleting the songs. It's quite depressing actually. Tori Amos has become a wife and mother and it's changed her music. What used to be powerful, full of shock and pain, real, has become something silly, sappy, and at times just boring. Oh well. Hopefully she'll be back, I'll keep buying her music just to make sure."},{"rating":"1","title":".......wtf","review":"if you are a fan of tori's earlier work up until \\"to venus and back\\" just stop there and do yourself a favor.this cd is 2x as bad as \\"scarlet's walk\\" the only redeeming quality is of tori's massively cryptic lyrical poetry. every song sounds the exact same with very small variation, there is no real catchiness to any of this music.i was almost convinced tori's music career was over when she released scarlet's walk, but now i'm totally convinced it's over. this is outrageously bad.i would save myself some cash and try to hack this off the web somewhere, it's for sure not worth the $, unless you started with scarlets walk and enjoyed it, even then prepare yourself for another letdown! np.-cwc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant... a very cool album..","review":"I really hate it when people who claim that they are the ultimate Tori fan trash her new stuff.

I think it's high time Tori quit the music industry or at least finds someone else to produce her records. This sounds like Scarlet's Walk pt. 2 only much, much, much, much worse.

I would say, with the exception of VENUS (an impressive effort), she's been on a constant downward slide. Granted, this album is slightly better than her total bomb LITTLE GIRLS, but it's still not worth the price of admission.And who the heck is that lame loser she sings with on song #3?

The Beekeeper sounds exactly like Scarlet's Walk and that's not a good thing. Maybe this album wouldn't be so bad if she didn't put a ridiculous 19 songs on it. If you're the kind of person who likes to listen to 19 almost identical songs sung by someone who sounds like a dying cat, you'll love this album. For everyone else, go buy a William Hung album. At least then you'll be entertained for a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable...not like her at all.","review":"I am a huge Tori Amos fan, and have been for the past twelve years. This record is the biggest disappointment in her catalogue. None of the songs sound terrible when listening to them, but a couple of days later, I cannot, for the life of me, recall what the hell they sound like. I rank \\"The Beekeeper\\" even lower than \\"Strange Little Girls\\" because, while at least half of that album was spectacularly awful, none of it was forgettable. This record is just bland. Dull. It sounds, to my ear, like an uninspired retread of the same ground covered on its predecessor, the stellar \\"Scarlet's Walk.\\" I have always considered Tori the ultimate \\"love-her-or-hate-her\\" artist, and I never would have dreamed that she was even capable of making such a \\"take-it-or-leave-it\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"an album for all kind of music listeners","review":"Excellent! from the very beginning until the last end,this album keeps your mind spinning emotionally. One of the best records of this scene in 2005 yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's inside is not the packaging","review":"Die-hard Tori fans will of course think they are getting an important work of music, but like Scarlett's Walk this is just another rambling set of unrelated songs packaged as a song cycle. (Tori, if you list the songs in different gardens, why didn't you put those songs together on the album?)And there are too many songs. Even Laura Nyro & Joni didn't release EVERY song they wrote, but Tori seems to think fans will want to hear every little ditty, finished or not. One bothersome quirk about Tori's songs is that many of them don't have an ending,...no conclusion. They just die.This is good background music for when you're doing other things cause there's nothing to pay attention to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to tell one song from another","review":"I've come to expect a lot more from a musical genius like Tori Amos. Deep, sensual moods, precisely \\"designed\\" music and poetic lyrics. Sorry, none of that here.

I guess a cushy, suburban lifestyle will do that to you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but still good!","review":"Certainly not her best but still good. Tori can do no wrong in my eyes.

She has so much wisdom and incite as a human being, but she uses all of this uninteresting symbolism, and I just don't feel her. Plus, the production is overdone. The layered voices, Damien Rice--yuck. I wish she would have uncluttered some of the songs and just used her voice and piano. I listened to her play a clip of \\"the power of orange knickers\\" on her DVD bonus CD. It was quite lovely, because it was her and the piano, not this horrid masking production. I do not recommend this CD--big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Although I really admire a lot of the lyrics on this CD, and the shaman's journey she is openly taking...

As a caveat, I do have A Piano: the collections and I found that every song that I really liked off of The Beekeeper was in the collections CD and those songs were strong, very strong. If I knew what I know now, I would not have bought it but then that is mainly from the fact that I already have the songs that I liked. If I had neither, I would buy A Piano: The collections and not buy the Beekeeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album since Little Earthquakes!","review":"I've been a Tori fan for going on 11 years now. Although I prefer her older work, I have to say I am truely impressed with this album. It is a bit mellower than the Tori most of us have come to know and love, but I personally would be disappointed if this album was the same as her first. She's growing as a person (marriage, a child) and as an artist. If you're looking for the Cornflake Girl, you're not going to find her here. But if your looking for a beautiful, maturing woman, you're in for a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it a few times before you bash it...","review":"I am a huge Tori Amos fan - I will admit this album will take some getting used to. Tori has changed her style slightly since her \\"From the Choirgirl Hotel\\" days but I still thoroughly enjoy this album.The highlights of this album are \\"Parasol\\", \\"Mother Revolution\\", and \\"Ireland\\". The song \\"Witness\\" is absolute crap - to say it bluntly.On the overall, I can't stop listening to this album - go buy it!!! It is Tori, afterall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Worst Album Yet","review":"I Love Tori's music, but this album is the worst by far. Her idea of a garden theme is great, but many of the songs on the album do not follow the garden theme. I also hate how she tries so hard to come off as being sooo European. Singing about Ireland, knickers and such, makes me really dislike the music. She seems to be changing her identity, which is sad. If Little Earthquakes showed us who she was and how she thought, The Beekeeper shows us who she really wants to be--something she's obviously not. Some songs on The Beekeeper are good, but the material is pretty bad and not that enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Tori??","review":"I remember after Scarlet saying that Tori is the one artist whose work is always better each time. Beekeeper is no different. It is strange that so many people consider this album adult contemporary or dull. Can you not hear every album prior? The last thing it is, is dull. She returns to the quirky nature of Pele, the innocence (yes, I said innocence) of Little Earthquakes, the grooves of Venus, all proving, as Scarlet did, that she is her own best producer. Watch Welcome to Sunny Florida and read Piece by Piece. These albums have been a ride. Every ride has its bumps, its different scenery. Tori is in the same place she always has been. Two (or many more) steps ahead of all of us. There is no understanding her. She lets us in as far as we can handle, shares her friends with us and lets us go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cornflake Girl's rooted garden","review":"A new Tori Amos feels like the arrival of spring break - fresh, exciting and full of possibilities. The excitement still continues. THE BEEKEEPER, Tori's 9th album is sublime and haunting. Tori Amos has and ( hopefully ) always will be rooted in what she does best. I don't think motherhood or a change of scenery will change her way of doing things. She's an artist - meaning she will never lose what made her who she is - a great musician and storyteller. The story may be different but I think it still comes from a very deep and sacred place.This album is not her best effort, but still worth it. Allow it to grow on you :-)Best tracks : Parasol, Sleeps with Butterflies, Cars and Guitars, Jamaica Inn, and Toast. Also check out FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL. It's my favourite and Tori at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori is a sellout","review":"This album was largely a disappointment. Tori Amos has lost her fire and her style, these songs sound as though they could have been written by any middle aged pop artist. Sounds as though the infamous \\"piano humping\\" days are over. The songs on the album are divided in the liner notes into \\"gardens,\\" which is a poor and fabricated attempt at giving the album unity. I wonder how much money Epic Records paid her for her soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened?","review":"I am sad that Tori has sold out. This album continues the downward spiral of Tori's creativity and magic. This album is for radio stations that feed the boring masses junk like Brittany Spears. Please, Tori return to the style of Little Earthquakes, Boys for Pele, and Under the Pink. I miss the passion, the memorable lyrics, and the raw emotions you put into those albums. They spoke to me and made me feel your music. I play the Beekeeper for background music since it is pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Endlessly Rewarding Album","review":"I decided to write this review after reading Rolling Stones 3 star review in the current issue.

I'm happy that tori is at a pleasant place in her life, but come on, there has to be some dark spots left in that twisted heart. From the Choirgirl is tori's plateau, but seriously, there has to be a higher jumping off point than this.

Sorry.","review":"I usually like Tori. A lot. Usually, I don't even need to think twice before buying her new CDs, even if I didn't get to listen to any of it first. But this time, I wish I had.Sure, even the worst song Tori can give us would be a ton better than the best songs other artists might produce, but as a Tori album, this one is as uninspiring as it can get.Sure, the melodies are fun, and so are the lyrics. But as a whole, other than a few gems (such as \\"Goodbye Pisces\\" or \\"Original Sinsuality\\"), I found most of this album to be rather bland and uninteresting.Maybe its because she seems to be genuinely happy with motherhood and life. Maybe its because she's matured as an artist. I don't really know. What I do know is that after listening to this CD for a few days in a row, I can't find that element in it that would draw me in over and over again (and I tried). It doesn't sound *new* in any way and it lacks the soul her previous albums had in abundance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not One Of Tori's Greatest, but, still a really good CD!","review":"Now, I've been listening to Tori's music for while now, and I have to say, she's different!

Thought provoking songs, great melodies, nice piano, and Tori's unique voice. There are 19 songs on this CD - There is plenty on here to like. A lot of songs take you back to the early Tori. A great CD for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori Amos: The Musickeeper","review":"From her critically underrated \\"Y Kant Tori Read\\" to her latest incarnation \\"The Beekeeper\\", Tori Amos has proven time and again that music lives on. She has given music a facelift - one it has been in desperate need of since the rise of \\"grunge\\" in the early 90's.Now, years later, she is still an artist in the true sense of the word. Tori is a living vessel for the spirit of music and possesses the ability and magic to channel it into amazing arrangements of style, substance and raw, unabashed \\"Original Sinsuality\\".From \\"The Beekeeper\\"s opening track \\"Parasol\\" to the final \\"Toast\\", Tori provides 79 minutes and 31 seconds of soul-wrenching, heart-lifting melodies and poetry that does not fail to deliver. She entraces and entralls us with tales of love, sadness, woe, hope, spirituality and humor all arranged and woven sweetly and stingingly in a style that is uniquely her own.Truley, Tori Amos is The Musickeeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzz as the bees would say, but its ok","review":"Okay. She's gotten better with \\"The Beekeeper\\", it's a bit more mellow, pretty nice choral arrangements on select songs.it's a BIG album that was commercially released that has very little to offer - 19 songs at 80 minutes? come on!Orange Knickers - the worst song off this album. Repetitious, boring, blah.Sure, I think you're a great artist, very creative, but not enough to feed my ears.

The first single 'Sleeps With Butterflies', a motherly love reflection of Tori towards her one-year-old baby, blooms as a slow ballad with an accompaniment of her cherubic touch on the piano and background vocals of herself as if the multiplicity of Tori angels sang in unison around you. The political discussion 'The Power of Orange Knickers' canvases gullible emotions toward female suicide bombers as she sings: \\"Those girls that smile kindly, then rip your life to pieces.\\" Get acquaintance first with her old stuffs however, or otherwise will bore you to tears to the point of paralysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori Amos: Cashing In?","review":"Overall, not a bad album, but gone is that fiery goddess who created songs like Bliss, Cornflake Girl, Sugar, Caught a Lite Sneeze and so on.Where is the old Tori?Of course there is the idea of evolving one's style, but her previous material always managed to fill me with emotion. Sadly these tracks don't offer that same magic. There's no spirit there. I just don't feel her at all.I did like Parasol and The Beekeeper somewhat, but I feel this is her weakest album. So odd, because it sort of follows in the same musical style of Scarlet's Walk, which was brilliant, in my opinion. This album fizzles into contemporary soft rock, which is relaxing, but just not the music of the magic woman I fell in love with."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing CD + amateur DVD = special edition rip off","review":"Once again, I am amazed by Tori Amos' lyrics and music. The story she tells in The Beekeeper is simply wonderful, the jacket design is beautifully done and the musical portion of The Beekeeper Special Edition is as moving as her earlier work.However, it is evident that Tori Amos did not have much creative control, if any at all, over the production of the DVD. It was a complete disappointment. The photographs and font used for the Garlands \\"video\\" are reminiscent of still photographs set to music for a video shown at a Bar Mitzvah. The interviews with Tori contained little substance and the footage appeared to have been stretched out to obtain a very unsubstantial \\"30-minute interview.\\"The highlight of the special edition was the enclosed packet of seeds. For the extra $8 spent in the special edition, I should have purchased a truckload of seeds for my family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, pretty radio fare","review":"Lots of buzz and sap, little Tori. When has she ever resorted to so many clichés, lyrically (\\"take a walk down memory lane\\") and musically (accompaniment overload)?

Expect some schmaltzy duet or car commercial (Saab?) soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we listening to the same Tori?","review":"Mysteriously, I seem to be the only one aware of what a complete disappointment this album is. It seems that having confronted her demons and found happiness, Tori's creativity has expired. I'm not one of those fans who expects every album to be a copy of Little Earthquakes; I enjoyed the \\"sui generis\\" direction she took--up to Strange Little Girls, which album we can all agree was a disaster. And she's never recovered. This album is nothing but Lite 97.7, especially the Muzak-scented \\"Sleeps With Butterflies.\\" There's no passion, no originality, no remarkable notes at all in the whole soundscape. Tori started out playing in hotel bars, and with this album, she sounds like she still is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am one of the biggest Tori Amos fans. I am a fan of her weird and off the wall musicial stylings. But this album was bland. Boring. Unexciting. I'm not suprised, I haven't trully liked any of her albums since Boys for Pele. But I will always hope she'll put together more of her crazy off the wall music. She still has an amazing voice, plays piano very well, and she hasn't lost any of her beauty. She needs - maybe? - a producer that will shake things up a little. She's gone \\"Lite Radio\\" on us, I'm sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I LOVE Tori! I do not like this album, and that is the first time I have ever been able to say that about any Tori album. It is a huge disappointment especially to follow up \\"Scarlets Walk\\" which might be my favorite of hers. This is a kinder, gentler, happier Tori. I think the fact that she is growing into motherhood is changing her. There's no pain in any of these songs. There's feeling but it's all gushy and stupid. Way out there even for Tori. I can't even listen to \\"The Power of Orange Knickers\\" or \\"Hoochie Woman\\" Tori please don't do anymore duets especially with men!!! There are some good songs \\"Cars and Guitars\\" is my favorite I really like that song. Hopefully this is just a bump in the road for Tori!

See for yourself, there is a chapter for everything from the LSAT (I found that part reallty helpful, the author gives several helpful pointers) to employment considerations, to every law school in the nation! The first half of the book is very practical and is for anyone considering law school, whether the thought crossed your head one time or whether you are applying or planning to go to law school. The second half contains all the 411 on the schools, when to apply, avg GPA/LSAT, ratios, etc. All in all, this book is filled with realistic practical information, and often, things you never realized (like exactly HOW to impress admissions with your personal statement)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Eerie Euro-Art film about drugs, love and death.Excellent acting by the two young stars.A strange Romeo and Juliet tale.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"This film fails on several accounts.

However, there she meents 'boy' played by Hunter Bussemaker who's been shot in the abdomen, and using her father's doctor's tools and books to look after him.

I started reading this book and was immediately thrown off by at least one coding/logic error in the encrypt/decrypt programs (which are among the first scripts in the first chapter). The fact that these are annotated multiplies the error, because a newbie is more likely to be misled by the clear explanation of something that is false. This left a bad taste in my mouth, so I've been leery of using the book much since (it's the last one that I consult). Finally, I don't like the author's Perl style. Yes, \\"there's more than one way to do things,\\" but the style is (IMHO) somewhat non-Perlish and may lead to people missing out on the Perl Philosophy.I recommend the Perl Cookbook instead for recipes, and the Programming Perl book for examples/tutorials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very graphic video re U S Postal Services","review":"Actor/Producer Dave Hood and actress Becky Borg do a great job taking the \\"mail\\" from the corner mail box from the sender to the addressee (geared for kids 3-8),it gives info not interested to their age groups about the different acroynms and not enough for an older kid ,since it's limited to delivering the mail to \\"one residential street\\"--however Hood and Borg 's antics are the equal of any slapstick comedy with info which is accurate and good to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Observation of a Laughter Yoga Class","review":"If you want to be a spectator of a Laughter Yoga class, then this CD is perfect for you.

It contains very detailed descriptions of what happened during battles of the civil war in which Longstreet was involved. It covers many areas of the battle of Gettysburg in which mistakes were make by the Confederates, and how some things just worked against them. All in all, it denies that the battle was lost solely because of the delays of Longstreet, instead it was a combination of the mistakes of many generals/soldiers that lead to the loss. Longstreet was blamed by many Confederates after the war because of his affiliation with the Republican party, which many Southerners scorned because it represented the Northern government and politics. Longstreet was Lee's \\"Old War Horse\\" until the surrender at Appomattox."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book on how to blame longstreet!!","review":"This book is one of the most disrespectul books,in attention to Luiet.Gen James Longstreet,and his actions at gettysburg.

To be honest, i thoroughly enjoyed it and still am(not quite finished) its very concise, and contains all sorts of useful quotes, and insights into the actual scientist that we dont often hear about... My main complaint (if any) was that some of the history and recounts of era's gone by tend to (in my opinion) drag along a bit.. it may just be my young mind wanting to get to the juicy science, I found the biography on Newton very interesting, but it tends to waffle on a bit about this and that when you reach the middle... I did skim several chapters, i may well reread the whole thing oneday... but i was mainly looking for Science, not a history lesson.

So, I was really disappointed by this trimmer.The problem is that the Merkur blades for this trimmer are not in any way comparable to the standard Merkur double edged safety razor blades. The blades for this trimmer are actually quite dull.To verify this, I specifically compared the sharpness of the blades on properly prepped skin. The standard double edged Merkur blade glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade on the other hand catches and hesitates on every single hair.This trimmer might be a nice if one could find sharp blades for it.

I think she stared out trying to write in a sort of noir style. It failed. Then the next few chapters switched styles and there was no cohesion between the way the character was first presented and the way she acted throughout the rest of the book (well, what I forced myself to read).Awful.The fact that this woman teaches at 2 local colleges in Chicago frightens me.

It was extremely easy to set up and has worked flawlessly. The compressor is so easy to carry around and holds enough capacity so that I can carry it into closets or other small spaces without having to worry if electrical outlets are nearby. It takes mine less than a minute to refill if I use all the compressed air. The nailer itself is easy to use, not too heavy, and I like the adjustable exhaust. It was easy to load and I was able to place my brads right were I wanted to without any kickback or bouncing. This was my first time to use a pneumatic nailer. Outfitted with an air chuck, I can keep all the motor vehicle tires filed without running to the gas station, and by purchasing a nozzle, I can keep all my other tools free of sawdust. I am glad I own this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"I remodeled my basement a while back and this is the compressor I used to do the framing. It kept up ok with the framing nailer that I borrowed. I also used the finish nailer to put up my trim boards. The compressor wasn't able to keep up with my die grinder though. I used the die grinder to prepare my gutters on my house for painting, and I would have to stop quite often to let the compressor catch up.

The finish nailer is a quality tool, its a Porter-Cable.

I can't believe it took me so long to buy this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought this combo pack years ago!","review":"This is a great value for the money. It provides a good range for finishing nails and is a great starter set for even the expert. The compressor is a bit noisy so if you're in a small space you will want to invest in some earplugs otherwise it's tolerable for a basic 2hp pancake compressor.

It begins and ends in Singapore, the country of birth of the writer, but in between the author travels a lot, also when she decides to live in the Netherlands. In the meantime she decribes politics, philosophy, music etc.etc. like a real cosmpolitan.The speed in this book is enormous, especially considering the fact that this girl has a tumor which disables her seriously. It is really striking that with all the pain she suffers and the sometimes humiliating aspects of her disease, she is still grateful of the time she has and there is no thinking of losing any of her pride. On the contrary, at he end she is living more intensely then ever. The love of her life helps her a lot in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave","review":"I started inmediately and could not stop till I had finished it.

The symphony is tuneful, imaginatively orchestrated, and sheer delight to listen to. If you like the music of the composers I've already mentioned, you're going to like this symphony every bit as much.The other works are also highly enjoyable. Arensky is probably best known for the Tchaikovsky Variations, and justifiably so. The working out of the variations is ingenious, but technique never distracts from the quality of the music. The other works are smaller, but not lesser.Playing is first-rate, as is Chandos' audio.

Manybooks which cover topics from the very small (atoms andsmaller) to the impossibly huge (B)illions and (B)illions ofgalaxies :) are a very difficult read. This one isaccessible to all. An added bonus is the section on thehistory of science and how it was prompted by man's searchto know God's creation better. This easy reading bookcovers these topics well.Fred Heeren's main point is that the science available tothis generation points towards events that look very muchlike the God of the Bible. An interesting read for thereligious and non-religious."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIND BLOWING","review":"I am no scientist but I love learning about our origins and how this awesome universe came about.

That is why I bought the book. Inside I found way more depth than I expected. Let's be honest, a lot of \\"apologetic\\" work is done by people cut and pasting material you can find online in a college blog. Not Heeren, he is an expert scientist and a compelling writer. Want to know about space and the universe? His passion for the subject is contagious. He also sticks to what he knows and doesn't try to sound like an expert in 30 different fields. Focused and fascinating. Did I mention how cool the cover is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor understanding of subject material","review":"This book is best viewed as a source of questions which should be answered rather than a critical analysis of Heinlein. Panshin will, in one chapter, praise Heinlein for the economy of his descriptive prose, while in another chapter criticise him for the dearth of descriptive prose. Panshin introduces very worthwhile topics for analysis of Heinlein (such as Heinlein's extended character dialogues); unfortunately Panshin does not seem capable of addressing the topics he raises. The best review of this book of which I am aware is \\"Rah, Rah, R.A.H.\\" by Spider Robinson, reprinted in \\"Requiem: New Colleccted Works by Robert A. Heinlein and Tributes to the Grand Master.\\" I urge all Heinlein fans to read this book, but I don't expect that anyone will derive significant enlightenment from it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A critique of Heinlein's philosophy more than his writing","review":"Panshin seems to have many philosophical disagreements with Heinlein, and thus has a few axes to grind. This seriously distracts from his criticism of Heinlein's writing. The criticism mostly serves as a vehicle for making cracks about Heinlein's philosophy instead.Much criticism of Heinlein seems to fall into one of two camps - the bash him at all costs camp, and the adoring fans camp. (This one is obviously from the bashing camp.) Neither really does the man justice. He's a great writer, but not without flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"contents","review":"Basic steam locomotive maintenance was developed by the late D. C.

So far, it has withstood a fair amount of traveling abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Take nothing. and use it\\"","review":"This little book didn't really appeal to me, so I've given it only one star. Perhaps it's because it's not a book Kathryn Kühlman actually wrote - it's not a cohesive work, only a compilation of sermons or messages taken from video- or audiotapes. It's also a bit too conventionally religious to my taste.But I have learnt something of what the Holy Spirit is, something I never used to have any idea of. And I realize I myself have seen people at evangelist meetings that may have been under the influence of the Holy Spirit, people who collapsed on to the floor when \\"demons\\" were driven out of them. (And then again I may be wrong.)And a statement of Kathryn's I found noteworthy was when she said \\"I have no talents. I was born without anything, Nothing! That's the reason it was easy for me to say 'Take nothing, and use it!'\\"I can't really recommend this book, but many may appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid SF/Fantasy","review":"This is a wonderful novel about twin worlds that share an atmosphere and what happens when the inhabitants of one world have to abandon it for the other via hot air balloon!! It contains suprising charactarizations and a very cool ecology all wrapped up in a fairly believable page-turning plot. What more could you ask for from SF? This is the first book i've read by Shaw and I now consider him to be one of the better SF/Fantasy authors.His sentence by sentence prose is tight and scans easy. He knows how to describe a scene or scenes well without glutting the reader with oceans of words. He does fairly well with characters and although the protagonist is a bit of a Conan/type, we like him and find him fairly interesting.I found myself remembering scenes days after I put the book down, and that's pretty damn rare. Check it out, if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Information and Humour as Well","review":"This is a great informative book of information about ghosts, poltergeists, vampires and sightings of them all. Not only does the reader learn about the differences between ghosts and poltergeists and other interesting facts but some great British one liner humour is threaded throughout this book as well. The writing is clean and simple enough that kids as well as adults will enjoy reading this masterpiece from cover to cover. The illustrations also by John Farman are also sensational and amusing. I'll definitely be checking out his other work as well.

I do not recommend this. Very unhappy. I have three cats who are allergic to flea bites and dogs who scratch constantly.

I also have tried the mix-with-food Program liquid, but the two drop-hating cats won't eat enough food at one time to consume all of it and won't finish the food later either, so it isn't effective.My veterinarian doesn't carry Program pills and his assistant said it was because they hadn't been effective. I order flea remedies on line anyway because they cost less than at the vet's office, but even the drops seem less effective after a time. The vet's assistant recommended alternating two brands of the drops on a monthly basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Great product, works better than the topical solution.

Program worked beautifully - but I have two Siberian Huskies and Novartis has just suspended production of the 45-90 pound size. My dogs are around 50 pounds and the Program is less successful on the smaller dose.Anybody know if it's safe to just double dose them to get the right strength?

This story of the day-by-day struggles through childhood and on through adulthood touched me deeply. The genuine feelings expressed on each page say so much more than any statistical analysis done by professionals. By sharing her journal of her own transition, Samantha Walker Adams shows us the inner reaches of her heart. While each person must walk their own path through transition, the path she walked was a long and a tough one.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering transition or who has a friend or relative who is doing so. This story of one person's path shows just how heart-wrenching and, at the same time, fulfilling this can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's Poulenc","review":"Being a tenor, I know I am harsh on other voices - especially those that are stringy, strident, strained, sickly - pick an \\"s\\".Poor Robert White should be singing lower rep at this point, his voice is really not suited to the range of some of these songs... and we all know they weren't even written for tenors... oh well - the pianist is good, Mr. White's performance isn't terrible, it's just not nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong connector","review":"it as the wrong connector and is not a direct fit.i need to return it now theres a problem because i opend it up"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it worked????","review":"I actually ordered two for my 99 Honda Accord to try to get the engine light to go out.

Unfortunately, Douglas either won't (or mare likely can't) say.Douglas was a generally Protestant minister, influenced by the mid-century liberalism of his time that caused him to approach the promise of Matthew 6:3-4, but then back away at the last moment. So, this book is disappointing. You expect that he will explicate the promise fictionally, but he never does.While he was popular with the undifferentiated liberal Protestantism of his time, his writing doesn't hold up well. The characters are wooden and the overall treatment of the Biblical premise unsatisfying.Go to the original -- any number of commentaries on Matthew 6:3-4. Douglas' pale reflection doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUISTING","review":"These bones were old and smelly. I am appalled that the company would even mail them to someone.

It can be shoved under a car seat or lie on the floor with relative assurance that the CD's or DVD's will not be cracked when any weight is put on them. I wouldn't try putting my whole mass on it or jumping up and down, but other than that it is the sturdiest case around. It also looks very neat in an almost military manner - for that matter it also locks with included keys, not that you couldn't very easily carry it off.My only complaint is that when you pull out discs you need to lift up the envelope type holder away from the metal edge or you will have scrapes and gouges on it. Some might not always remember to do this and will be sorry. It comes in a 48 capacity size also. I would check my local office supply store, because sometimes I have found their price is much cheaper.In total it is a great case for travel and looks very handsome too."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfy sweatshirt","review":"This sweatshirt is so warm, comfortable and fun.

It is a low-budget B grade horror movie, but there is no trick. You aren't suckered into buying something and dissapointed. ROADISDE massacre is a fun horror movie that is made by people who love the genre and made to be an hommage to the great horror movies. It's also funny...

The difference between the old one that was used for several years and this new one that only has a little more than a month's life, without knowing the specification of production, this new one is made in China. Many products that are made in China are fine products, but not this one. After this one was broken, bought another 2 later. Same problem. Broke too easily and their lives are too short.

I have several sets of superior glass mugs and glasses that I purchased online elsewhere from the German companies Trendglas and Jenaer Glas. The Chinese glasses I received from Amazon had chips, scratches, bubbles, imperfections and were just absolute junk.The German glasses, on the other hand, are great tea glasses. The mug sold by Amazon looks identical to the German variety in the picture, but it's absolutely a different glass. Maybe Amazon has a mixed stock, because I can't otherwise understand how someone can give this glass a good rating. The German glasses have their manufacturer's logo etched in the bottom of the glass. If you get the Chinese model, I'd suggest returning it as I did and look elsewhere for the slightly more expensive ($3-$4) and far higher quality Jenaer and Trenglass mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but certainly not cheap.","review":"This was a terrible purchase. I should have payed more attention to the reviews. The craftsmanship is pathetic -- the rims are uneven, the glasses are not circular, the handles are shoddily fused in a way that is not perpendicular to the rest of the glass, and the quality of the glass itself thin, hollow-feeling and light.I purchased these for the design, but Anchor Hocking, for example, makes glass 3x thicker and 3x less expensive. I will continue to use these because I purchased them, but even the weight of a full glass of tea makes me feel like the mug will soon break at the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Flimsy glass not sure if Adagio site has the same raving reviews about it and though I'd buy it with the Ingenuity tea pot. The base is the same thickness as the walls making it very fragile, most cups meant for hot beverages have a reinforced base this lacks it.After placing the cup on my desk for 2 days I realized the base gets scratched and displays a ring formed by the glass and desk rubbing. Some sort of integral base for the cup would have fixed it. Lastly it needs a slightly bigger handle this thing is designed for people with five pinkies.Arrived with a cute dimple of the tip, wasn't really impressed with the quality.Adagio should stick to teas, tea-ware especially glassware is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Chipped","review":"The mug arrived with a large chip out of the handle leaving a jagged edge and rendering it unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"glass tea mugs","review":"Very disappointed with these tea mugs as they are very large and not what I expected...The advert should have given the actual size of these mugs....I would never had bought these had I known the size....I have had Jenna tea mugs before which are far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor handle and watch out if the liquid is hot","review":"Well, looks cool but the skinny handle is almost useless. You have to hold it just right to prevent your fingers being pressed against the thin, and thus hot exterior.

Glass is very unforgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to size","review":"I have the Adagio Ingenious Teapot and got their mug to use with it. But surprisingly the mug doesn't fit. Now the teapot will dispense into the mug but what I mean is that the mug \\"floats\\" under the teapot. Before I bought the Adagio Mug I was using a common ceramic coffee mug with the same capacity and the top rim fit the bottom of the teapot just perfectly. The Adagio Teapot can be slide all over the top of the Adagio Mug.Now it's not likely the teapot, with its wide base, will flip off the mug but you think Adagio would have a mug with the top rim the same diameter as the teapot base."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was laughing at the first paragraph!","review":"I loved this book.

The only negative I would give this book is that some of the language is strong and therefore not appropriate to share with the whole family.

I would definitely recommend this book for all people who are owned by poultry and those who wish they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are serious about raising chickens, do not waste your time","review":"Yes, the book is pretty accurate about how you go about your daily life raising chickens. However, there is not enough information on actual raising chickens. Chickens are not just pets. You can't take them to a city vet, since they won't know what to do with it. It doesn't tell you how many hours a week it takes, how much the feed will cost for X number of chickens for a year (layers vs. broilers), it doesn't tell you anything about raising and nursing baby chicks or working with an incubator. It's funny, it's easy reading. However, I wouldn't waste time reading. If you have raised chickens for years and did fairs, this book won't add any information.

This CD is a great replacement for my crackly copy of the Tops LP edition of 1956--I could stand a little more punch to the sound, but I'm simply glad this gem is out there in digital form.

I waited the month brushing with flea combs, and managed to get frontline on the cat and others and fleas were down to a minimal within a day. I wouldn't buy this product again.

In 1997 the Cowboys were 6 and 10, the Redskin game that year was a good game but not an all time classic and the 2007 game should not have even been considered. I don't think a broadcast of the 1974 Thanksgiving game exists but the comeback games of 1979 and 1983 should have been no brainers. How does the 2007 and 1997 games get included before either the 79 or 83 games."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better than this, NFL.","review":"When thinking of classic Cowboys wins over the Redskins, we think Staubach, White, Theismann, Dorsett, Riggins, Pearson, Monk. It's simply what we want: the games we lived and died for on Sunday afternoons as kids. An era where Brent Mussberger would say \\"...You are looking live...\\"Here we have games from '97, '99 and 2007. Really? The closest thing to a \\"classic\\" game between these two teams over the last 20 years, in my opinion, is the 1992 season opening win over the Super Bowl Champion Washington Redskins on Monday Night. Dallas rolled the champs lustily 23-10 in what was the kick-off to Aikman, Smith, Irvin era. But that game isn't here, as well as a few other glaring omissions.The games on this DVD set are good for Cowboys fans to have in their collection, to be sure.

I have reread them all several times, and each of them (Fire and Rain, Outlaw, Granite Man, and Warrior) remain some of my favorite series romances ever.With that being said, I felt compelled to read Reckless Love as it tells the story of Ty Mackenzie...an earlier generation Mackenzie.This is just not a great book. Ty thinks that Janna is a boy for the entire first portion of the book. He has all these shallow notions of what beauty is, and I found myself not really liking him at all. Janna was a better character for me, but I was hoping that my interest in her character would be enough to propel me through the long pages describing horses, mustang's, breeding..blah blah blah. For the horse lover...this may be the book for you. For me, I want a love story and this one fell short of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dated, and not a hero to fall in love with","review":"This book was originally written in 1990, and boy does it feel dated. You wouldn't think a book set in the old West could date so fast, but the hero feels like the villain in today's book, the guy who made you feel bad about yourself and your body and everything you valued, that diminished you, and that the new hero would have to help you rebuild. He was just so awful to the poor heroine, and his insistence that she was no lady, barely a female, and the put downs he kept giving her, in order to 'protect her from his woman hunger' initially irritated me but them started to make me really sad at the thought that she would going to end up with him for the rest of her life. That he apologizes in the last 5 pages scarcely makes up for it. I liked the 'Only' series, but this book was just awful for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissue Ahoy!","review":"Oh, the bad old days when romance novelists apparently believed that abusive behavior is love. The \\"hero\\" says hurtful things to the \\"heroine\\" throughout the novel, up to the last couple of pages. Then he repents! HEA! Yeah, right. Of course, the \\"heroine\\" is totally cool with his abusive behavior because she is not only TSTL, but also enjoys being a martyr. So maybe they WILL be happy together. Personally, I'll be happy to never read another supposed romance that makes me want to call the abuse hotline.

Detractors below complain about the book's \\"limited perspective\\" and seem to accuse Daniel's parents (who carried this project through) of exploiting their son's name to explore the mosaic of Jewish perspectives. Perhaps if this book was intended to be a life history, collection of Daniel's work, or tome of political essays exploring the region, their critiques would have some merit. Instead, this book does exactly what it has set out to do-- it has gathered together the views of Jewish individuals who had all been affected by Daniel's death, and who were made to think about their Judaism through the lens of Daniel's last words.My one complaint is that the spectrum of Jews selected largely neglect the voices of Jews of color, who deal with yet a different set of issues in claiming their Jewishness every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Jewish","review":"I am not Jewish but have a lot of friends who are and wanted to understand them better.

Daniel Pearl was of course the Wall Street Journalist.

So I agree with the Montreal reader, and disagree with the \\"oversimplistic\\" teenage reader from Washington DC (soulseeker). I think all the world felt affection for Daniel Pearl, and books such as this tend to undermine this global affection. His message of greater understanding stands in contradiction with this book.As the teenage reader from DC underscores, it is a book that will unfortunately attract only Jews, further undermining the memory of Daniel Pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Nice Book!","review":"The premise of this book is exquisite.

It's a good recovery album after the mediocrity of \\"Soundtrack To Your Escape\\", which only had a few highlights and nothing more.\\"Take This Life\\", the first single of this album, shows promise. With staccato riffage in the beginning and a more dynamic sound, it got me looking into this album. Other tracks such as \\"Leeches\\" and \\"Crawl Through Knives\\" show off more spectacular work from this band. \\"Come Clarity\\" was a surpise for me, though, as it was more of a ballad. The only thing that the band could improve on more is the clean singing. However, if you're not a vocalist purist, you may be able to get by it.Overall, this album gets a 4.

I have now had it for nearly a month. It still smells awful. I don't know if rubbermaid has changed the compound that it is made of or what, but the oder is overwhelming. At first I thought some of the negative reviews might be from folks who have a small unventilated kitchen and didn't give it enough time to lose it's \\"new\\" smell.

Incomplete bits of story tossed in. Honor mostly on the sidelines. Shameless watering down of one story to justify (I'm guessing now) two more books. And the shameless watering down evidently did not save him any work, because he still came up with 800 pages. Man, what a job to finish reading. It's like he wants to stretch the story out because he's afraid he won't have another story left in him for the next book. Which I sincerely doubt would happen. He needs to get back to telling taut, exciting, fast paced, action and character driven tales!"},{"rating":"1","title":"War of Honor by David Weber","review":"Nearly all of David Weber books are so good that you cannot put them down. His latest however is not in that category. Lenghty political discussions with petty and small minded characters do not require 700 pages, but 70. The remaining 100 being good.However the broad painting of this universe remain well written and not too boring if one reads fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been an OK 300 page book","review":"unfortunately it was 800+I've read all Webbers books (not just the Harrington series) and I think he's a wonderful author, but somebody needed to edit this effort drastically.There are some interesting developments in the first 100 pages and the last 100 sets up the next book(s) but the rest is way too long winded. This reminded me of some of Tom Clancy's weaker efforts, a small idea padded out to long book.It seems Webber may be setting up the rumored \\"Manticore becomes the expansionist bad guys but Honor is still duty bound to ...\\" I really hope this is not the direction that he takes because it certainly isn't what I'm looking for out of this universe.Very disapointing, and I don't think I'll be buying the next one in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Honor We Know and Love","review":"I am SOOOOOO disappointed in War of Honor. I have read (and liked) all of the other Honor books, as well as most of the other books Weber has written. I waited months to receive WoH. After 518 pages of struggling, I gave up on the book and read the last chapter to at least gain some closure. I've never had to do that with any of his other books. Yes, Weber does spend more time on politics and Honor's personal live, but the writing is turgid and DULL."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first poor Honor Harrington book","review":"This is the latest book in Weber's previously superb Honor Harrington series, detailing her military career. It picks up four years after the previous book. I thoroughly enjoyed every previous book in this series and would rate all of them four or five stars.This book is much more slow paced, predictable, and frustrating than the rest of the ones in the series. Having read the previous books, I could predict most of the ending of the story just by reading the back cover. I was especially disappointed that Weber relies upon the rather weak plot point that one diplomat in a key position obfuscates information to start a war. I would hope that the chain of communication in any government is not that vulnerable to subversion.My advice is to skip it. I won't be reading any more Harrington stories unless the reviews are positively glowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"slooooow and painful","review":"Clearly the worst of the entire series, ham-fisted, slow paced and incredibly predictable.a brief synopsis: The jerks have come to political power, now let's try to stay awake through 800 pages while said jerks screw everything up, crap we are running out of pages, Ok Honor time to save the day.Have you ever been sitting at a restaurant and had your meal ruined because you are forced to over hear the most inane trivial conversation that is emanating from the people at the table next to you? Reading this book is like that except worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a waste of time","review":"Imagine 'Star Wars' being eight hours long, and beginning with a five hour Senate meeting that shows everything. EVERYTHING--the delegates shaving, driving to the building, parking, sitting down, getting their pens out, everything. Around the fifth hour a delegate from the Emperor drops by to announce the Senate is dissolved and, oh, by the way, something unpleasant seems to have happened to Alderaan off-camera.That's what reading this book is like.I'm on page 714 and it looks like some action is about to start. PAGE 714.What's especially frustrating is that Weber's utterly forgotten about the \\"Hell's Gate\\" series in favor of writing something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was truly disappointed in War of Honor. It doesn't compare at all with the first 8 books in the Honor Harrington series. However, it does compare quite nicely to its predecessor Ashes of Victory, they both stink. As far as I'm concerned you can completely skip the first three fourths of the book. The last fourth of the book isn't much, but at least we saw a little of the Honor we know from earlier books. I'm so glad I didn't waste even more money by buying the hardcover version.Will I buy the next book, of course I will. But please Mr. Weber, write it like the first 8 books, and not like a boring political novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"All work no fun","review":"An avid fan of Honor Harrington and all of Weber's books I found War of Honor to be extremely disappointing. At times I found myself wondering why I continued to read since it ended up being work instead of fun.I kept waiting for Weber to finish laying the groundwork and get to the fighting...he does finally have a couple sparsely developed battles 95% of the way through the book...well below par for a David Weber book.A well written political intrigue that leaves you disappointed in how a few politicians set empires against each other and how the admission of one word will start a war...Other reviewers stated they thought this book was setting the stage for future Honor novels, unfortunately the development of both sides over the course of his 10 books leaves me wanting the Peeps and the Star Nation to make peace, not war...he needs to find a new enemy for them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored of Honor","review":"Some of the other Honor books have been page-turners, all of the other ones I've read have been entertaining. This one is just boring. The first 80 pages consist of endless explanations of the politics of the various star nations and - I'm not kidding - and interminable explanation of the game of baseball. I don't know what happened after that. I put the book down and have no intention of picking it up again. Mr. Weber, get an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera","review":"Unfortunately David Weber, like so many authors today seems to be writng for a TV mini series not a novel. The cast of characters is so large that it is hard to keep track of who did what and when. The scene changes so many that the modern TV producers will love it. Honor Harrington, the heroine is conspicious by her absence. Like his last two novels about her, 80% of the book is about other people. Also, it should have been called the \\"Battle of Honor\\" as it is a lead-in to the sequel(s) that will have the war.I also didn't like his non-standard use of female pronouns to refer to people in general, it interrupted the flow and made me stop reading to try and figure out who he was talking about. Besides using bad grammer the book was poorly edited in general. I don't think I will be buying any more of this line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor in the thick of it again...","review":"This latest of the Harrington series continues with the saga of the Salamander--a female starship admiral with a penchant for being in the \\"right\\" place at the wrong time for the enemy. Political intrigue with the Peeps continues, with twists of plot that are unexpected. The usual military details on weapons can be a bit overwhelming at times, but this book moves the epic of the Manticoran world ahead nicely with a surprise ending on the last two pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"I was between a 4 and 5 star but went with 5 because I didn't agree with the 2 & 3 reviews. I thought it should have been shorter and if you want mostly space war. I enjoyed the focus on diplomacy and politics which in the real world are a major part of war. People seem to forget HH is now an Admiral and their function in war is different then a ship commander. One of my favorite real world Commanders Raymond Spruance was much like HH in this novel. I like this series because it provides a believable fantasy world without BEM's or beating the readers over the head with their personal philosophy. But then I find Politics as exciting as war."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bore\\" of Honor","review":"I've read through every single one of the books in the HH series so far, cover to cover--including this one. This was, by far, the most difficult read of the series for me. I found myself tempted to skip entire chapters at every turn. The pacing was glacial. The focus on politics and \\"behind the scenes\\" discussion amongst leaders of both sides, while quite possibly realistic, does *not* make for an interesting book. Fans of the series expecting epic space battles and the thrill and terror of war will be so happy when the action finally starts they're likely not to mind it's over in the blink of an eye.The repeated back-and-forth political scenes showing how both Haven and Manticore discuss the exact same thing gets really tiring, really quickly. Unfortunately, that's literally the majority of the book.I guess if you're really into political science, this could be your cup of tea.Definitely hoping \\"At All Costs\\" is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"read it, don't listen to it","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and the series as a whole, so I picked up an audiobook copy of it to listen to in the car during the commute. I was, in a word, disappointed.Barbara Rosenblat's reading is flat, and her intonations and inflections are unnatural and stilted. I find it hard to listen to, as her artistic take on the conversations and her impersonations of military personnel are completely off and unrealistic. Her mispronunciations of simple words sometimes makes it hard to understand what's going on, and her overall characterization is low, in that it is very hard to tell which character is speaking at any time. All in all, I get the feeling she ignored the actual content and militaristic theme of the book in lieu of a very generic, pulp reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Droll and superficial","review":"Either Weber is infatuated with his own rhetoric or he doesn't even bother to proof his writings.C'mon David, enough of this cutesy bantering!

Although some recent editions have had 100, maybe 200 pages of introduction, this one has 800. As discussed in other reviews, lots of committees and talk, all leading to an obviously avoidable war. This is not worthy of Mr. Weber."},{"rating":"1","title":"The master stumbles....","review":"I am a big fan of David Weber's books but this one is just not worth reading. Extremely wordy with lots of irrelevant points, you really have to be tough to slog through this brick.

Now there is a man who can pack a story in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Quite unlike earlier books, this one is just boring.

This is the first Honor Harrington book I have read or, better to say, attempted to read. Skipped hundreds of pages of blather and missed nothing. The author seems to have a knack for avoiding the action part of space opera. Is this really the same person that wrote the Prince Roger series?! At 7.99, it cost about a penny a page and that clearly was overpricing it. I would ask that in the future the author pay me to read his ramblings rather than vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising disappointment","review":"I've a big fan, and unfortunately, this book is just not up to par. Other folks have been frustrated by the same things that things that I'll summarize here...- space battles that are over before they start- way too many characters- endless (endless!) background explanation, to the point that often I forgot where the plot was because David Weber was off explaining some nuance that I just plain don't care about.I found myself skipping over pages at a time in reading, just to get through this. If this were any other author, or any other series, I would have stopped & wouldn't have finished the book. I slogged through it though, and after 800+ pages of buildup, even at the end, the ending came abruptly. It's as if he said \\"Okay, deadline's tomorrow, lets finish this puppy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over written, a reader's slog.","review":"I have read every one of Weber's books too include, sadly, this one. He has always had a tendency to bog down in the backstory and character development, but this time he has surpassed himself for sheer over-writing. The book is over 800 pages in length, and the first sign of real naval action comes after page 700. In fact, the entire thrust of Harrington as a naval action officer, comes as an afterthought. Frankly, if I wanted heavy reading with Byzantine politics and plot lines, I would have purchased a book on the history of the Holy Roman Empire. If Mr. Weber's editor and publisher pushed for this type of work, Mr Weber should take them on a trip to the woodshed. If not, then he needs to do something to alliviate the tiresome boredom of the first 700 pages in any future efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to Honor","review":"I was very disappointed with this effort. Way too much \\"character development\\" not NEARLY enough action.Honor seemed to be almost an after-thought. Will not be buying any more in this series unless Mr. Weber gets back to Honor and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thoughts","review":"I really enjoyed reading the first nine books of this series. They were a great mix of action, character development, and insight into the \\"enemy's way of thinking\\".This book is different. It would be great if it was labeled as \\"political intrigue\\".As a space opera, it is about 350 pages too long.Please please please David, don't go the route of Jordan and Goodkind. Your fans can get verbose political commentary elsewhere, we don't want it in the Honorverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major Disappointment","review":"I have read all the Honor Harrington books, as well as everything else Weber has written, and I can honestly say this is the only one I did not like. Way too much talking, characterization, and scene setting. Very little action. Weber could have written the entire novel in about 100 pages, and I wouldnt have missed a thing. I hope this is just an aberrant entry in an otherwise excellent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.......the end of the road for me.","review":"This will probably be my last purchase in the Honor Harrington soap opera for me. Lets see....300 pages to rehash what has happened before500 pages of boring political maneuvering100 pages with some minimal action in itI guess that I am just not interested in page after page after page of the inner mental anguish of Weber's characters. Sheesh, give it a rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrgh! 760 pages before the first shot is fired..","review":"Skip forward in your reading list if you are looking for a story.This book spends the first 400 pages dealing with a minor political incident, even by todays standards.. Another 100 pages or so on deployment. A minor skermish and then finally. A whopping 75 pages on \\"Honor in action\\" The last page hint of the next book wasn't so subtile either.*sigh*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately seeking editor...","review":"This book needed some serious editing, but it didn't get it. The first 80% was filled with endless meetings between various characters who either rehashed what happened in the previous books or rehashed the current political situation. This book could have easily been half its length without leaving anything out and would have been a much better read in the process.I'm sorry to say it, but Weber's writing has just deteriorated over the course of the series. The characters have all lost their distinctive voices, and even if they hadn't, 90% of the dialog has become exposition in disguise. It's clear that at this point, Weber is just grinding them out to order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Honor","review":"This is the weakest of the Honor books. Way to much character dialog that has been done before. Very little action. And most important....VERY little of Honor herself.Mr. Weber, please return to the dialog & action of the other Honor books & rember why we buy the \\"Honor\\" series.Hint......that would be for HONOR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"As much as I have loved the Honor Harrington series, I was hoping this novel would bring closure to a worn out series. Much to my horror, the story in War of Honor not only refuses to end, but is thrown backwards!The unrealistic stupidity of the politicians and the over-the top intelligence of the treecats really spoiled it for me. The animals should have been running the government while the politicians perched on someone's shoulder, looking threatening.And lastly, this novels ends up with all invloved pretty much in a position they occupied a couple books ago! How many more books will be suffered through before this tale is finally brought to a conclusion?Please Mr Weber, bring this once beloved series to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-third of this book is good!","review":"In fact, that's just how I read it - skipping over the interminable talk, talk, talk. It's been a while since I've read On Basilisk Station but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have read any more Honor books if it had been this bad. I'm hooked into Weber's world creation, tho, so am stuck. Perhaps if Baen re-hired the editor they so obviously fired 5 years ago we could get at least one more decent Honor book out of Weber!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded rehash of the not much of anything","review":"After ten books, the Honor Harrington series seems to have run out of steam. Weber takes 864 pages to move the plot forward about a short stories worth. All the characters spend their time telling each other everthing that has gone before, and it's not until the last 100 pages or so that anything of substance actually happens! I've enjoyed a lot of Weber's other books, but this one is just one too many for this heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baen and Weber: a loss of Honor","review":"In the long, slow decline of the Honor Harrington saga, this work is an abrupt plunge into the depths. Filled with endless exposition disguised as conversation, Weber abandons the formula which made his early work so vibrant, and instead attempts in his usual heavy-handed way to explore the black and white world of politics.Baen should be ashamed: don't they EDIT anymore? This work cries out to be edited. And Weber should either retire Honor, or spend more time to write a cohesive novel. This one is filled with promises which it seldom delivers.If you want black and white characters, no subtlety at all, and a tedious narrative, then this one is for you. But if you are looking for the joy of the early novels, forget it, Weber has lost his way and doesn't have the discipline or skill to explore the world he has now created."},{"rating":"1","title":"War Weary","review":"I will say this for Weber: It took 8 or 9 decent books for this series to run out of steam.Too bad, because the early books were really enjoyable. As other folks have said, \\"War of Honor\\" is a bit of a chore to read.Also, as other folks have pointed out, really the strongest aspect of the series is reading about Honor Harrington kicking *ss. Which is largely absent from \\"War of Honor.\\"The truth is that \\"War of Honor\\" could have been decent if it had been edited down. Instead we're saddled with (literally) hundreds of pages of internal monologue, silly banter, and C-SPANesque discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Devil is this all about?","review":"I REALLY was anxious to get my hot little hands on this. What a disappointment! 900 pages of boring dialogue, poor plot, lousy characters and maybe a 100 pages of action. And in the end all it does is set up a sequel! I may or may not read the sequel (Alright, I will read it, but I'll object.) I really hope Weber gets back on track. This stunk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The longer the series, the poorer the stories","review":"Unfortunately, the longer the series goes on, the more the author relies on 'gimmicks' such as the treecats' ESP powers and Honor's. I just don't enjoy the stories now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.... Not the best, not the worst","review":"Sad to say but this was not up to the standards I expected from D. Weber based upon his other Honor books. Some parts were very long, almost minute-to-minute, other parts you'd skip over whole weeks/months and have to readjust where you were in the timeline. When I finished I was suprised at how many pages there were, over 800, and yet I barely felt like I had acutaly gotten to the true climax.Did not feel any of the breathless excitment or heated emotions that I've come to expect of the Honor series. Purely an investment for the continuation of the series. Not something I'd read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"People sitting around tables discussing politics","review":"\\"A Reader from Texas\\" already said everything I had planned to say. 600+ pages of people sitting around tables discussing politics. Only one full blown space battle and that was quickly over. Honor Harrington spends very little time \\"on camera\\". And while the overall plot of the series was perfectly poised to move on to fresh new story arcs at the end of \\"War of Honor\\" we seem to have taken a few steps backward.A certain amount of monotony is the price we pay for Mr. Webers finely crafted stories. And I have no doubt that his attention to the fine details is why Honor Harrington is such a well loved character. But this is without a doubt the most tedious Sci-Fi novel I have ever read. I kept hoping it was going to get better, but it just kept dragging on and on. I can only hope that in the next book Mr. Weber pulls a rabit out of his hat and throws us some surprises and new directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"is ten too many?","review":"Nope. This book i liked a great deal more than one or two others in the series. This book balanced the tech and the politics very well. Many of the things long predicted by various online fans came in to being but the book was hardly predictable. For a book approaching ponderous in size, it kept the pace moving along pretty well and while there were only a two or three characters that emerged as new names in this one we did get to see quite a few old friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"skim skim skim","review":"I wanted to review War of Honor just to make sure there are more 1-star ratings than 5-star.What was a tendency has become a very bad habit. No action is taken without an essay. No plot is plotted without excruciating discourse. Where is the Editor? This could have been a good short book. D.W. has to know what 60% of his readers think of this growing habit of his and I have to respect his determination to press on anyway, not pandering to that shallow majority of readers who want conciseness, lucidity, and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 10 still had me chomping at the bit","review":"I read the book in installments on Baen's websubscriptions and then bought it when it released. War of Honor nearly killed me waiting for the next set of chapters. I would ration myself to one a day. Okay... so this one was not as heavy on the Space Battles. There was more polotics. BVut that was the POINT!! There is a lull in the storm and all of the political issues lend stress and suspense to where the story is going. I think Weber did an excellent job of portraying the Star Kingdom's slide towards two potential Wars that nobody wants. If he had not had as much politics I do not think it would have worked. At the very least I would not have developed the loathing for some of the characters that made their getting their cumpupance(sp>) so sweet. Heck, I love the Action, but it the context of the Action that makes it so much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Work For Too Little Return","review":"David Weber's books are generally fun to read and go rather quickly. Sadly, this book was more of chore than a diversion. The Honor Series used to be about naval action with politics thrown in. War of Honor changes the mix and makes it a book about politics with a little naval action. I was more impressed with the CD that had all of the previous novels in various ebook formats. I can only hope Weber gets back on track with the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A transistion book - don't expect much action","review":"Unlike the rest of the Honor Harrington series, War of Honor is decidedly lacking in action. Much time is spent filling in background stories, and developing the political situation into one that will allow continuation of the story in future books. What action there is comes late in the book and lacks much of the detail characteristic of Weber's previous Honor Harrington novels.One irritating point about the development of the political situation is the consistent lack of due diligence in montioring communications by leaders on both sides of the Manticoran / Havenite negotiations. I understand that David Weber needed to contrive some way setting up the conflict for future books, but the idea that NO ONE would have noticed blatant tampering streches reality a litte thin. As a result, the complex characters that David Weber spends so much time developing do not \\"feel\\" as real as they otherwise would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and boring - sadly unlike the previous books","review":"I felt like slitting my wrists while reading this to escape the boredom. Seriously, the series is terriffic, until this book. The lack of overt action and too much exposition where people in meetings talk talk and talk some more about previous events is enough to put the most die hard Honor fan to sleep. I agree with earlier reviews that state the editing was lacking. It was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading an 800 page CSPAN transcript","review":"David Weber can't write dialog. All his characters share the same voice, and it's the voice of a particularly boring PoliSci professor. This book is about 50% dialog.David Weber can't write any sort of descriptive or background material that isn't so dry and wooden that it sheds splinters. This book is about 45% of that. Never has political intrigue been so leaden.Let's not even mention the attempts at humor or romance. Those are just too painful to mention.David Weber does one thing well -- great big space opera battles, with missles flying, lasers flashing, ending (usually) with virtue rewarded and stupidity punished. This book devotes a handful of pages to this. A very poor reward for wading through an ineptly edited and infinitely tedious description of the politics of an imaginary Star Kingdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber's worst","review":"Sadly, unless you are a dedicated and brain washed member of the Weber cult, you will almost certainly find yourself skimming this over done nightmare of a novel, desperately hoping for the space battles and action that made the series worth reading in the first place - and when the action does come, you will find it sparse and unfullfilling.To date the series was characterized by excellent military action set against a believable political background. In this latest, most self indulgent, episode we are flooded by hundreds of pages of boring and over written petty politics, while the few battle scenes are dealt with in a few paragraphs - in short Weber has tragically reveresed the formula that made him a great military sci-fi author. The entire 800 page novel desperately needs to be cut down to about 250 pages, and Weber desperately needs to find an editor with the guts to get him under control and force him to return to the early style which made him worth reading in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching for the WAR in War Of Honor","review":"The entire war in this 861 page novel only took up 1 page and didnt't even start until the last chapter. This book is devoid of any detailed military conflict. The one and only only battle lasted only a few sentences. This is a purely POLITICAL sci-fi novel. I kept reading on and on and on waiting to get to the \\"good\\" part but it never came. The Harrington novels are military sci-fi but this was a purely political book and because of that a great dissapointment. The political intrigue was interesting for a chapter or two but not for 860 pages!Mr. Weber, where is the \\"war\\" in War of Honor? Will I have to wait another year or two to find it in the next book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointed, again","review":"I was hoping that Ashes of Honor was an over-written aberration, but the author seems to be bereft of a good editor and a clear plotline. He is lost in charactors and seems to have run out of scenes, referring to recycle ones I have read before (i.e., the scene where the captain boots an obnoxious political charactor out of his conference room.)Gone is the crisp writing of On Basilisk Station.

I found very little of the action usually found with Honor, and waaaay too much talk, talk, hundreds of pages, on politics, by Mantie, Peep, Andies, etc. This book could have been halved from its 929 pages. I found the book very boring, as Honor played a somewhat small role, compared to the Star Kingdom's political \\"leaders\\". I did find similarities to the current Bush regime in the USA, politically speaking.This book reminds me a lot of how the legendary Heinlein's books in later years became more and more wordy philosophy, and less and less of the actual story. Stop the hundred's pages of talk and get on with the story, for Pete's sake!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happening here","review":"I've followed this series from the beginning and this book is the one I least like. Nothing happens, with even the ending being disappointing - it's basically just a quick summary rather than the usual exciting finale. In 800 pages, the book is all didactic political talk and explanation. And those \\"bad guys\\" who get their due justice receive it all offscreen. It was such a disappointment, I wouldn't recommend the cliffsnotes for this book- they'd be boring too. And that's too bad, as the series held up well for 8 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the unabridged version","review":"This is really the first abridged audiobook I've listened to. I did the previous 9 in the series in unabridged audiobook, but the abridged copy was what the library had.As far as I can tell, they abridged it by throwing the pages in the air and picking up 10% of them, putting them back in order and reading them.I went out to Baen and bought the eBook copy for my Sony reader, and I'm reading it there. I expect that the book is as good as the rest of the series, but I can't tell from the abridged audiobook version.I expect that the book itself is 5 stars, but this version is 1 because I can't give zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor's back","review":"If you want to read a synopsis of the book read someone else review of David Webber's latest offering for the story of Honor Harrington. It is filled with the usual mix of politics and war that have made these books some of if not the best science fiction over the last decade. Webber gives us characters that seem to come to life off the page, and gives us a story worthy of the main characters he has spent years creating. For the first time since \\"Echo's of Honor\\" Webber in this story gives us the action, suspence, and an ending you just can't miss that have defined a series of science fiction novels that I would say rank with the best of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SERENADE VOLUME ONE","review":"THE ALBUM IS COMPOSED OF FILIPINO-AMERICAN ARTISTS OUT THERE WHOSE VOICES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND WITH LYRICS THAT HELP INSPIRE OTHERS TO DEAL WITH LIFES ISSUES .....SO WITH THAT IN MIND THE ALBUM IS NICE TO BUMP DURING A HOUSE PARTY...AHAHA AND NICE TO MAKE A SLOW JAM TAPE FOR YOUR LOVE ONE"},{"rating":"2","title":"ArMeEs","review":"This CD is pretty kewl.

Oh well whatever,\\" then clicked play. I was horrified to find most of the footage in the actual show was sped up.This made me completely regret buying this product.The only reason I am not giving this 1 star is because the information about eagles was excellent.In fact it kept me watching til the end, despite the distracting unnatural looking sped-up video which ruined the entire thing.2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"IDIOTIC\\"","review":"I am providing this review as a much needed reality check for people, (like me), who might read the first three reviews of this film and order it on the srength of those reviews.

The only film I can remember where the silly antics of the ignorant bad guys actually worked was in the original version of \\"Home Alone\\". Unfortunately, I've seen more than my share of movies where the foolishness and overacting of the ignorant bad guys ruined the film, but the antics of the foolish bad guys in this movie wins the all time prize for scriptwriting and acting that is worse than bad.

This is a story about growing up gay, which might seem well-trod but which is always interesting and can be clever.However, I struggled mightily to follow this book. To me it read like a first draft. There are numerous ill-placed flashbacks that drag an already-thick narrative even further down so that it's very hard to follow. Sure, there are mentions of things that will remind you of the times, but it's not enough. You have to care about the narrator and care where he goes in life.The humor here is somewhat subtle and dry, but nowhere near David Sedaris' level.

New to my knowledge is the deep feelings Morgenthau harbored toward Roosevelt.Well written and balanced in scope this is a must read to anyone interested in the major events of the second world war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking substance","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. The first 3/4 seem to be spent as Henry Morgentheau vs. Everybody in the Roosevelt Administration, and all it is how Roosevelt can't decide or won't commit on the Morgentheau plan while everybody else tries to persuade him otherwise. It picks up a little when Truman takes over, but not a great deal. It has enlightened me as to how all of this unfolded, but, in my opinion, could have been much better. I don't know if there's a better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"henry morgentheau - not \\"the conquerors\\"","review":"Mr. Beschloss put this book on the shelf for 10 years for a reason: it is incomplete. In the end, I found myself cheated because it is cleary an account from Henry Morgentheau's ( then secretary of the treasury) perspective in dealing with Roosevelt. It is as if Michael Beschloss ran into Henry Morgentheau II ( who is quoted frequently in the book) and got all his dad's notes.Truman is a footnote in the last few chapters. The chapters on the attempt to assassinate hitler by his own people was misplaced and didn't support the title of the book.It was an easy and entertaining read, yet I felt cheated at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale for today","review":"Could there possibly be room for yet another book about WWII? I've read many, from Churchill's memoirs to Ambrose's foot soldier oral histories. So, I found Beschloss' book extremely fascinating for its exploration of an aspect of the war I have not encountered in other well-known, mass-marketed general histories related to it. This is the story of how the post-war was planned. Or, as Beschloss says, how Allied leaders attempted to \\"minimize chaos.\\" The author, best known for his TV punditry, is a great story-teller and examiner of character and characters. As I write this review, the U.S. is at war with terrorists and could soon enter another conflict with Iraq. As I read this book, I found myself hoping our nation's leaders were also reading it, as it reveals how important it is not only to win the war, but also how necessary it is to plan the peace at war's conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Slant","review":"The title is misleading as the scope of this book is narrow in focus. Notwithstanding that, this book is very worthwile to someone interested in the Second World War. Yes, it does appear at times that this book is a biograhpy of Morganthou. However, there is fresh information and look at the political influences behind the Allies post war plans for Germany.The book does amplify Churchill's foresight in his concern of a post-war Soviet Union. The decisions may not have been as rationally made by the Roosevelt administration as one would expect; however, the book illuminates post war thinking of a strong or weak Germany to provide a buffer or balance for the Soviet Union.A must read for students of the political history of World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bio of Henry Morganthau","review":"This book is not about The Conquerors. It is the wartime biography of Henry Morganthau, Roosevelts Secretary of the Treasury. The primary source for the book appears be Morganthau who comes off as playing petty politics. The perspective provided in the book is also Morganthau's. Where is Stimson, Marshall, Eisenhower and Truman?The most interesting parts describe Roosevelts poor skills as an administrator; how much his illness affected his administration and the way he played his cabinet members off of one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The Conquerors by Michale Beschloss is one of my new faviort books on the market.

Kreeft presents the essential Pascal, and adds his own explanation and commentary after each Pensee, to great effect.

Milo's early career is especially intriguing, and, as always, Kellerman makes the characters come alive. But . . .I found some descriptions unnecessarily long and tedious. I either slogged through or only skimmed too many sections. Every once in a while, a phrase struck me as cliche.

The only character that is complex and compelling is Milo, Alex's detective sidekick.Compared to recent releases in this genre (The Big Dig by Linda Barnes, Q is for Quarry by Sue Grafton, Shrinkwrap by Robert Parker, Reversible Errors by Scott Turow...all great! ) this mystery does not grab attention.

He shows it to his friend, homicide detective, Milo Sturgis. It turns out one of the photos is of a girl murdered 20 years ago. It was one of Milo's first cases and the two friends set out to solve the very cold case.I think the beauty of this book is that a lot of it is from Milo's point of view. That's something Kellerman has not done before. It is great to learn more about Milo. Until now we've only had Alex's view of the offf beat detective.

I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective. As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar. This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy.

While some could tell you that the story line might be implausible - a 20 year old unsolved murder somehow getting resurrected and the culprits still actively involved with hiding their involvment - it is nevertheless a very interesting book and one that I found difficult to put down. All I know is that it had great entertainment value, and, after all, that's what I am looking for in a novel. When I find myself taking a book with me everywhere and reading it every spare moment, I know I've found a great one.

The last few books in this series have been pretty poor attempts at the hard boiled school and this one sinks even lower. The writing and plot are hardly up to the standards set in earlier efforts. Kellerman has lost his way and to say this book is disappointing is an understatement. A repugnent waste of time in which Alex's profession is irrelevannt as there is little that is psychological here. Perhaps the author needs therapy or just a writer's workshop. At any rate, there is certainly something wrong. A session with Dr. Gregory in Boulder might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn!","review":"I'm actually not sure what happened in a lot of this book.

A pack of dingoes to rend it completely, Bradbury's firemen to burn the kerosene soaked pieces and multiple horesemen to carry the remaining ashes to the four corners of the globe would have been an even sweeter revenge. This book stands for everything that readers hate about best sellers and must have been karmic punishment. Rather than read the book, please take several Percoset and five tumblers of Jack Daniels.

Well, you do the math.I thought maybe it was a typo, but no, rechecking it 3 times it still comes out wrong. Says to me JK maybe needs to take a vacation. A very long one.The rest of the book is so slow I'm about to go into a coma.

I'm an avid Kellerman fan, but this one definitely didn't make the grade with me. I found I had to force myself to pick it up from time to time, something that has never happened to me with one of his books before - usually I can't put them down! I kept finding myself thinking, \\"did Kellerman really write this book?\\" It felt rather offbeat for him. I bought the hard copy, but wish I had rented this one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving","review":"I have been trying to read this book for over a month now and just cannot get into it. It is slow moving and not enough actions or events that keep you locked in. The flashback to 20 years earlier seemed to take 20 yrs to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Murder Book","review":"Convoluted story. Hard to follow. Boring. Implausible.Ponderous.No more Kellerman for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing he's done in years!","review":"I think Mr. Kellerman finally decided to break out of his rut, a little bit! There are still the usual elements there: Milo and Alex get involved in a case, Alex goes alone and gets in trouble, Milo clashes with LAPD authority. The good news is that some of the novel (probably 30%) is written from Milo's perspective, and not in the first person. We get to learn a little more about Milo's past, which is a good thing. I've always thought his character is more interesting than Alex Delaware, and it is a nice change to follow him around for a while.Sensing the boredom of Alex and Robin's relationship, Kellerman gives it a shake-up. This has happened before, but it is good to see some downs in their life, just like normal life. This is a solid effort, the best he has done in quite a while. If you are a fan, get it! If not, then I think it will still be a decent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME...","review":"I read a lot of books by a variety of different authors and Jonathan Kellerman's The Murder Book ranks amongst the worst I've ever had the displeasure to read. While the story lacks any real substance, the actual writing is practically intolerable, if not downright laughable. For example: \\"Novelty had always been my drug. I craved insomnia and menace punctuated by long stretches of solitude, puzzles that hurt my head, infusions of bad company and the delicious repellence of meeting up with the slimy things that coiled under psychic rocks\\" (and that's only page 3). Get it? Heed my advice and don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausted and Bored!","review":"In reading this Kellerman novel I find the switch from first person to third person exhausting. I find the decription of events taking place too long and decription of characters too short. The characters are boring. The detective work is slow. Not to mention the significance of Alex Delaware's failing relationship to the rest of the story line eludes me. Kellerman seems to be writing just to see his own pen. The story line feels like it is taking the 20 years it spans to be delievered.On a more upward note, I love the third person narrative of Milo's character. The explaination and interaction of the homosexual relationship between Milo and his partner Rick is wonderfully described and I found it very interesting.In the end I find this book very disappointing and frustrating. Not what I would consider a New York Time best selling author to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need glasses?","review":"Because this covers so many years the print is very small and the pictures are blurry.

Over the years he has created his own version of the Conservative Movement. And it doesn't resemble the thought and mind of William F. Buckley or National Review.

More like The Dead Season.","review":"Season 3 had its moments but overall it is by far lame. The first and second season are hilarious and full of witty remarks and shows great character. It also helps in identifying what makes Dethklok; Dethklok. The third season just has a bunch of lude, crude and grotesque comments and the dialogue is supar at best. It also has an extreme amount of adult content. What made the other seasons so great was the blurs, the bleeps and the run around on what they were actually referring to. I absolutely love this show and have the first two season memorized by heart. I was thrilled for the third season and when I finally got to see it was throughly disappointed with it. I know these guys can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was sent a European Disk which will not work in US players. Since we had already opened it,we could not return it.

The 1st and 2nd seasons contained relevant material that made \\"Metalocalypse\\" original- fresh ideas, direction, hilarity, and blood & guts. As for the 3rd season, the more I watched, the more hugely disappointed I was. NO laughs. Just a whole lot of none-stop needless cussing, sex, and.....well, nothing else. There is really nothing else that can be said about this season. FAR from brilliant. The show has now run its paint with the rest of the brainless crap on tv. So long, Dethklok...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The first two where definitly better. Iv read other reviews, but after I already got this. I don't like how they don't use the gutar rif when cursing its was funny, the violence isent as brutal, the story lines feel a bit draged on, and I don't like all the unpixelated nudity its juvenile and pathetic. This show was so much more funny and cool now its too \\"the real world\\" or some other lame ass reality show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metalocalypse sells out!","review":"WTF, where did the sweetness go? No more brutal death and destruction, no more concerts, no more people trying to kill dethklok, and no more Illuminati. All it has become is vulgarity plus nudism. I thought the show was about the \\"metal+Apocalypse\\" not lets go MTV with this garbage. Way to get lazy Brendon. Don't waste your money on season 3. Seasons 1 and 2 kick ass, but season 3 is straight fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"hamburger time","review":"Metalocalypse is one of the funniest shows around. A smart and extremely funny satire of the music bussines. This season the episodes are longer (20 min) which makes them more interesting, and consequently even better. Toki, Nathan, Swisgaard and Pickles are great, but the show has only one real star. If there is any justice, William Murderface will go down as one of this centuries' greatest comic creations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"Another great season of Metalocalypse. Though this season doesn't focus as much of the actual 'metalocalypse', it does involve quite a bit of character development and character background stories in the band as well as for some side characters. But best of all, these DVD are actually uncensored! Funny that it's the one time the 'uncensored' label is not on the package... My only compliant about it is that there is about double the amount of swearing as in the previous seasons. I have no problem with swearing but it really makes an episode bland when it gets to be excessive. But overall, it's a great season and still has it's unique charm. Definitely one of the best, and funniest shows on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this is one of my favorite new cartoon shows to come out in a LONG time. and what you hear IS true....this show will make you like heavy metal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"good show","review":"Good show, the season is pretty entertaining.

The Honor of the Tome, opens up a world of childlike fantasy filled with good and evil, man and elfin, dragons and beasts and takes you on a seamless journey from one volume to the next. This is definitely a book/series to be shared with your children, or as in my case grandchildren and bask in the awe and excitement in their young eyes as they realize the beauty and good that can be, and how it always overcomes the ugliness and evil of the world that is.

What a disappointment. The bare bones outline is interesting but the writing is pathetic. I wouldn't want a grade school child to be exposed to this type of sentence structure. I had to give up on it and pick up other promising e-books instead. Written at the reading level of a third grader or lower.Examples:\\"Lady Oer had been preparing for a long time to find out where the Valley of Dragons was engrossed in devising a scheme to learn of its whereabouts\\"\\"She disdained the family as inferior to her knowledge and power believing them to be lesser mortals to her she tossed her head at their entreaties.\\"If this kindle version has already been extensively edited, I'm really glad I didn't see the initial copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"The story of Merlin and Lady Oer had me captivated from the beginning.

The arguments in this book have been made before, but this book is worth having just for the fact that it makes up a small anthology of the major issues that we are facing today. Plus, the author is perhaps one of the best writers of all time. Though this book is very small, it packs a big punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice try but.....","review":"here we have another example of celebrities trying to make crossovers to other genres.

I recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of her or loves pop or latin music. You won't be disappointed at all. I love the name of the cd as well- Here to Heaven very inspirational. You can not find this at stores at all, its out of print now. Back then I wasnt' really a fan of her's until I heard this cd.

The problem I have with this program is that the words are given in random order which makes in more difficult to retain.

XP won't take the driver off of either disk, or from the download. Their web site support is just the driver downloads, no FAQ, no email. Pathetic!

That was not the case with this card. I have two other USB wireless connectors on other computers that seem to be fine but this card frequently dropped the signal and had only at a poor signal at best no matter what I did. The drivers seemed to be somewhat flakey at best and while they did work, there were times when the card was not recognized at all.

Right now I have it running at about 1/2 speed per the control, and it is very quiet.At the lowest speed it is difficult to ascertain if it is even running.Maybe it had been sitting a long time and the lube in those little bearings needed to be distributed around everything.So far I am very pleased with it.

Even at a distance of 1 meter, I can clearly hear the fan sound at the slowest fan speed setting. The noise is not high pitched metallic sound, but it is annoying. I cannot believe the decibel figure they advertise. I use this product in an ordinary studio, not in an anechoic chamber. The fans do not seem to be so quiet, and it seems that there is amplification of the fan noise at certain frequency range due to enclosure effect.

Instead, we get all complete seasons of Friends when all one needs to do is turn on the TV at any given time of the day and see the same episodes in syndication - as bad as seeing I Love Lucy continuously until we have the complete dialogs memorized!

Chapter one explains why people decide to work for a restaurant while chapter two details the many types of places to work. Chapter three explains the many people who actually work in a restaurant. Many other chapters follow, some serious and some hilarious stories. While Clam Chowder explains the restaurant business, Matt Lehman adds plenty of hilarious real life stories.

In this book he sounded whiny and seemed to try and make up for not appreciating Jim Morrison while he was alive and how without Jim, The Doors would not have been able to do what they did. I lost respect for John when he sued the remaining Doors choosing to be the voice of Jim from the grave...The book was not an interesting read at all-just sour grapes, and too little too late in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book that shows the doors journey through the eyes of an honest person.Is anyone else missing pages 55-86???"},{"rating":"1","title":"densmore needs professional help","review":"This man was being eaten alive by his jealously of Morrison and this thread runs through the whole book.

Historically, it seems accurate and informative but I can't understand why John felt the need to crucify himself over and over again in this book. I think the final two chapters are unnecessary, almost the babblings of a committed man. I understand he has been through hell in his life, but we all must deal with our own personal hells. There's not enough celebration about the Doors - he almost gets there a few times, but the music is all powerful, not the words or the individuals. The most annoying parts come as John repeats his thoughts about how the group had few confrontations about Jim Morrison's ever-increasing problems. John sounds timid and cowardly during these moments. It taints the whole thing. I like the history, but not the Densmore depths and his attempts at analysis and theory! Sorry John, better luck with the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"Its great, I liked knowing his thoughts of Jim Morrison's self destruction and he is honnest, only thing I didnt like about his book was the few times he would whine about his marriage which i really didnt care for.

Many fascinating accounts that only John had with Jim leave the reader wondering how crazy Morrison really was. It is fascinating but doesn't leave the reader with an untruthful perception by any means. Morrison was special and he was undoubtedly a poetic genius who seemed to be having an inner battle with good and and evil. Densmore justifies his feelings for Jim based on his ignorance of the seriousness of Jim's drinking problem and inner battle. A must read for any true doors fan complete with Jim's aswell as many others poetry from the time period and including many interesting stories from a racist limo driver to how John and Ray dodged the draft and how the doors seperated and became more independent and much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Although I was somewhat disappointed at the beginning of the book, I was satisfied with what I ended up learning from this book. Densmore included many detailed stories which differed from other Doors books. I felt it was worth getting the story of Morrison from a band member's point of view.

This book was just ok. True to the Game was one of my favorite books and I expected the writing style and the enthusiasm to be the same in Dutch. From page one in the court house the book bored me.

Nothing at all exciting but the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is Dutch lll","review":"Where is Dutch lll??? Why is it so hard 2 find??? I hear and read about lots of people talking bout it but where is it? And this Kwame dude where is he? Is he really in jail or is this just gossip to make the book more interesting. I was just hoping that part lll would be a little better. If dude really wrote these books why doesn't he at least have a web site like everyone else. Oh he is in jail but so was Wahida Clark.

Teri Wood is a good writer but this just wasn't his best work. Its so bad that your reading and you don't even remember what you read in the previous chapters because your so bored. I know that he came out with a second part to this book, but I will not be purchasing it because if I didn't like this one then I proably won't like the new one being that I don't remember what the hell happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fallen Author","review":"I think that the author needs to find something moreto write about.

The book was so boring; I only finished it to find out what was going to happen in the end. It was not good at all.Dutch was suppose to be this hardcore thug that killed and cut heads of and all this theatrical stuff, but it just didn't make for a book, it made for more of a low budget movie. Dutch and all of his so called crew were so corny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Hood","review":"This book was great. Besides Bitch by Deja King it's my favorite street novel. It was very well written. Some of the things Dutch did seemed unbelievable to me. I mean he had no problem killing anybody that crossed him but yet he let Qwan live knowing that he had too much dirt on him and he ended up coming back to testify against him. Why did you even let that man make it to the stand? He shoulda killed him from jump. The same with the crooked cop that testified against him. I mean if you gon be gangsta be gansta all the way. But I still loved the book and think it's a great read. I'm about to start part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the chain","review":"I loved this book.

I order Dutch I &II back in febuary and normally i can read a book in one day if its okay or in a couple of hours if it is really good. This book took me a whole week because i could not stand the plot of the book. The plot is so far-fetched that when i finally finished the book, i was so upset that i refuse to read part 2. My sister says that the part 3 is the best but i would never know cause im not going waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was poorly written and had a meaningless plot. I know authors want to tell their story and try to get our youth to choose another path in life, but this novel felt overly fabricated and glorified a meaningless street life with young kids who performed \\"Scarface\\" like antics. I did not enjoy this book at all and would not recommend it to anyone to read. I am highly disappointed that it is a trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise","review":"Great book, Kwame...the real writer of the Dutch series. Despite grammar and head hopping issues, this book is still a solid story that reads like the author studied The Godfather, Casino, and a few more gangster movies, mixed them all up and came up with his own entertaining novel. I definitely will be purchasing book 2.

Angel and the gang were great.....i was glued to every single page!!!!!!! Definetly worth reading!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass the dutch","review":"I was so angry at the ending.

No Schubert lovers should be without this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book, must read if you make beaded jewelry","review":"I first became interested in this book on a recent trip to Colorado when I saw the author's incredible works of art displayed at the State Fair. Upon receiving the book I was delighted to see how MS Moring's talents extend to writing and teaching.This is a down to earth, easy to follow, how to book with colorful, illustrated diagrams. The instructions are so simple even I could follow them.Actually, this book is so attractive, we keep it on the coffee table.Buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so simple to follow instructions","review":"Although the designs in this book are very beautiful, even at the intermediate skill level I find the instructions sorely lacking. Not only does each pattern leave one wondering what they are supposed to do (evidently a lot of creativity is needed in understanding what the author intends) there are no instructions whatsoever on how to make the straps. So, if you want the strap to be symmetrical, recommend using another one of your beading books that has full instructions, or, for those more creative than I am just figure it out on your own.Not a book for beginners by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"More patterns from Moring please!","review":"Finally, not a book for beginners with more than half the book taken up with beginner instructions. The pictures in the book do not do justice to the beauty of the worked designs!

The author treats the subject of world power as if it were a patient lying on a psychologists couch - a foolish way to explain global politics! Obviously the Americans have done far more good for other countries than bad. Though many mistakes have been made in every presidency, America still remains one of the most financially generous and altruistic nations on the globe!I suggest the author find a more compassionate culture than that of the Americans - His search will yield up no other nation and it is because of our rich moral and ethical heritage.

Note on tritium, this \\"gas\\" glows like standard glow in the dark that needs to be charged by light like it has been charged 5-10 minutes ago. Confusing ? It's not near as bright as you might expect but very visible in low light.

Melodramatic and overbearing, Enrapture bludgeons the listener with a sonic sludge that is neither engaging nor enjoyable. The songs on Enrapture are not much to begin with, but the over the top production and performance, make the album laughable. This record is not worth the time or the money even as a punchline. Goths and Geeks alike will do themselves a favor by avoiding this band altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"The light shines through.","review":"This collection of stories combines uncommon craft with uncommon insight. The opening of the title story reminds me of one of Janet Fish's remarkable paintings of glassware.

It definitely deserves its rave review in the New York Times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret Connection Between Gladwell and LeGault","review":"This book was clearly retrofitted as a rebuttal to Blink as part of a marketing ploy. It is, in fact, a rant riding the coat tails of a bestseller. To add insult to injury, it is poorly organized and frustrating to read. Shame on you Mr. LeGault, and shame on your publisher. I await the publication of \\"St!nk\\"---an expose on how fickle the publishing world is. It will have nothing to do with the substance of Think or Blink, will promise to reveal all sorts of secrets about Malcolm Gladwell and Michael LeGault, and will, instead, be a book about weapons of mass destruction. If you read this review because of its title, you know exactly how I felt after reading your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble attempt at skewering a much better book...","review":"I can't for the life of me understand why a \\"rebuttal\\" book should sport a cover so much like its intended target. That said, throwing rocks at a better, more rounded and robust piece like Gladwell's while somehow turning it into a right-wing rant may imply a kind of talent. This author is gifted with the ability to completely misread even the most basic assertions of Blink, and has found ways to present his mangled interpretations in some of the most empty language I've read in a long time. A badly conceived and written book...if you still want to bother reading it, go ahead. You'll wish you read Gladwell's book instead. Too bad this is billed as a rebuttal, because it's clearly out of its league in its attempts to criticize Blink. Did this author even READ Blink?? Made me wonder.One star is too many. Save your money. There are so many good books out there waiting for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been a good book...","review":"The right person could have taken this theme and written a really valuable and useful book. Legault's attempt is a poorly organized mish-mash tainted by his own biases. Someone on the political left could have written a book with the same flaws and with mirror image biases and blind spots. And it would have been just as bad.Legault makes the case for critical thinking and this is good, but then he shows himself to be blinded by his ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book it claims to be","review":"Marketed as a rationalists response to Gladwell's \\"Blink\\", LeGault spends precious little time explaining the books thesis and inordinate time presenting his personal political viewpoints. For example, the author claims that the vast majority of scientists disagree with the threat of global warming, and he accuses those that believe in the problem of falling prey to poor thinking again, and again, and again. The author also feels that radical feminism is a serious threat to American culture (I still haven't met one of these mysterious radical feminists). In general, the author seems to think that simply being a contrarian makes one rational. If you think like he does, then you are being logical. LeGault's real thesis appears to be an attempt to conflate rationalism with conservativism. Still, if you can wade through the author's obvious biases, there are a few thoughtful passages that offer a valuable counter-point to \\"Blink\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title and premise","review":"Very disappointed with this book. As a trainer in critical thinking and problem solving, I am always looking for fresh perspectives. The author makes a good case for improving the discipline of critical thinking in the first chapter and then goes on to violate the very principles he espouses, namely evidence, exploration before concluding and rationality. Other reviewers have noted the numerous hypocritical and agenda-driven aspects to this book, so I will not duplicate. The saddest part about this book is that the people who read it and really believe that he is using critical thinking throughout are being grossly misled and therefore will be reinforced in their views. It does a great disservice to promoting the true discipline of critical thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless rant","review":"I purchased the book blink and thought that this would be the perfect book for providing a counter balance, but despite persisting (which has been very hard from page 100) eventually made it to page 160 have given up with trying to go any further.Michael LeGault use to be a columnist for the Washington Times and the book seems to be a collection of what someone would put in columns then padded out to be more in book format. That is someones opinions on everything from ADHD, computers etc.The first chapter when he tried to discredit Blink, if feel he failed miserably, Blinked taked about experts in the field having the \\"blink\\" ability, Michael just implied it to everything.A am sorry to say that I have gotten borded with his oppinions (albeit I agreee with most of them) as it does not provide any guidance on how to think etc.Unfortunalty I have to give it 1 star just to rate it I would prefer to give it none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think...my way or the highway!","review":"LeGault purports to offer a book on how to critically think and a retort to Gladwell's \\"Blink\\". He apparently did not read Blink because he completely missed what Gladwell was trying to say about \\"reading minds.\\" Further, many of LeGault's case studies are without references, i.e. an unnamed glass factory, and for one reference he goes so far as to reference himself. If you're looking for a book on how NOT to think critically this is it. Anyone who knows how critically think can \\"tear this book\\" apart with little effort. Oh yeah! See if you can figure out which award this \\"award winning\\" writer received--Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the book is a right-wing rant","review":"This is a \\"bandwagon\\" book. It's written by a right-winger who sets up Malcolm Gladwell's book \\"Blink\\" as a political target. The author deliberately distorts Gladwell's book in order to set it up as a phony straw-man target.The inappropriately titled \\"Think!\\" is an utterly worthless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads okay... sounds terrible","review":"As a frequent listener to audio books I was very displeased with the reading of this book by the author. The producer really should have stepped in and asked Mr. LeGault to have the CD version read by a professional, as the author was unable to verbally parse his own prose. The impact was twofold: first, that the language content became very difficult to interpret; second, that the author undermined his own thesis/argument by insisting that an amateur, from-the-cuff performance was somehow instilled with greater value than that of a trained voiceover artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink","review":"I didn't get my book after place order more than one month.

I wonder how they can ignore my mail like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've read the reviews first.","review":"I purchased this booking thinking that it had something to do with critical thinking. I was sorely disappointed. After ironically enough, loads of anecdotal evidence, I put the book down. This is nothing more than political ranting. I paid a whopping1 cent for this book and feel I have been over charged. The only thing I get from it is the perspective of a man who sees the world differently than I do. Welp, that's the start of critical thinking I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical thinking? Right.","review":"I came to this book hoping to get fresh and profound insights on how to become a better critical thinker. Instead of that, I get a book that says a few good things every so often that morphs into a irrational rant-filled book that seems to trash liberalism among other things. Very misleading title! What everyone else sums up their reviews is what I got from the book. Do not buy this book. Fortunately, I checked it out from the Local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very repetitive.","review":"I bought this book as the companion piece to Blink for my wife. Before she could get to it, I tried reading it. I found the initial story to be awesome (about the auto glass manufacturer), but after that it went downhill. I found Legault to say the same thing over and over but in a different way. I made it through the first 40 pages and couldn't go any farther. However, if you can wade through his ability to say the same thing five different ways, he does say some pretty profound things (don't worry, my wife shared them with me, that's how I know) which is why I gave it a two star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gladwell isn't political","review":"Another right winger who wants to bank off real thinking. Do not be mistaken, this book is a ripoff of Malcom Gladwell's awesome book. In Blink Malcom talks about the ability of people to make snap decisions - for good or bad. Blink didn't encourage people not to think, it just explained how your mind worked.This author (Think) obviously didn't read Blink, nor took the time to understand its contents. So much for Think eh? Sounds like he read the bookjacket of Gladwell's book and made a \\"Blink\\" decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"No critical thinking in Think!","review":"This book purports to explain why we need to depend more on critical thinking and analysis, but tries to do so without using any critical thinking. Most of LeGault's arguments are unsupported by any kind of evidence except for anecdotes. The author does his best to disprove his thesis with his own writing. Unbelievable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Brain Can Finally Breathe","review":"Finally, a book that acknowledges the decline of American intellectual culture, and this one tells us what we can do about it. It is flawed thinking that has led to this decline. And while case studies show the superiority of critical thinking over intuition, Mr. Legault analyzes the causes of the decline of logic and reasoning in America, and suggests ideas to turn it around. He does this without a political agenda - perhaps a comment that those with ideology are diverting too much intellectual energy. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think for yourself...This book may be of little use!","review":"Having enjoyed Blink (the book referred to over and over again in Th!nk), I thought I might like this book as a counterpoint. But this book merely plods through a list of \\"correct\\" ways of thinking. Unlike Blink, which was loaded with interviews and accounts of the author's personal experiences with snap decision making, Th!nk is almost all references to historians, researchers and pundits. The book is basically a third-hand rehash of other's ideas. Th!nk lambasts marketing, therapy and 'self-help gurus' for cheapening our culture, yet the book markets itself as a self help book \\"saving American culture\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As others stated, I too had hopes for a balanced discussion of the book's premise. Instead of finding the critical thinking mentioned, there were old arguments about culture wars. For a more thoughtful discussion of culture wars, see the February Atlantic article by E.J. Dionne, Jr. called, \\"Why the Culture War Is the Wrong War\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time reading this book","review":"This book is poorly organized and contains no useful information. Unless you want to understand why people should have commonsense there is no reason to get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Axe Grinding","review":"Written solely as an attempt to make $ in the wake of a successful and interesting book, this read is an unscholarly waste of time and $. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think!","review":"Purchased this on CD to listen to during my long daily commute. The author was the narrarator. Wish his voice had been more dynamic. A bit monotone and dry and it didn't help with the message he was trying to get across. The CD wasn't what I had hoped for and although I listened to the entire message, I won't listen to it again as I have other books on tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like you are reading a college mid-term report","review":"I bought this book hoping it would help me think. The author makes one claim that Americans are not thinking enough and backs it up with some well researched tidbits. However, this could have been written much more concisely, probably as an article in New York Times, but not as a 350 paged $25 hard cover book.Also, the author tries to refute an argument about global warming. Sure, there are still other skeptics and there is no absolute proof that global warming is due to man-made causes, or even there is global warming, but you have to have a thick skull to not believe this with so much data coming out. Just watch NOVA or 60 minutes reports.I want to read facts and good theories that I can use (like Guns, Germs and Steel), not an argument that debate team students need to earn credit.If this was published as a short article, I would say 'interesting article' but it is one star for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"Based on its title and implied relationship to Malcolm Gladwell's excellent Blink, I was hoping for insight into how the human mind works its way through making decisions. What I got was warmed-over socio-political prattle, yet another tired litany of right-wing culture-war talking points.I should have known better. Right there in the flyleaf the book represents itself as a counterargument to Blink and then proceeds to describe a book that may exist somewhere, but is not in any way similar to Blink. That is a good clue as to how much bearing the ideas on this book have to reality.Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical thinkers beware - critical thinking not much in evidence!","review":"Unreadable. Amazing that a book about the unassailable importance of critical thinking can evince so little of it and be so poorly written.Entirely polemical with no reasoned argument. Paragraphs end with dire predictions for the end of the world or \\"a theme tht will be revisited and analyzed throughut this book.\\" After being appalled for the first 40 pages I gave him 3 more chances. On page 49 he blew it with the paragraph opener: \\"Let's consider the importance of critical and creative thinking to something damn important: our jobs.\\"This is so pathetic that it has prompted me to write my first review to save you up to $25.

I was so hoping for some deep insight into the current state of \\"sleep\\" that permeates our culture. Instead I found ranting more irritable than Michael Moore's. In between the rants were sections of analysis with nothing new to report. This book is not worth precious reading-time. Perhaps, the author's comment on his need to make money explains its existence. It's certainly not a worthy comment on \\"Blink!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Right-Wing Dogmatist Blather","review":"Why does the right-wing attack the person instead of offering reasonings about the issue? The author takes to task several \\"left\\" writers and is dogmatic without offering much in the way of proof. Just believe me because I said so (like their leader, GW Bush).I did like the chapter on \\"stress,\\" but it didn't save the book. Too bad the far right-wing (not the moderates) are so negative about anything even centrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"As shallow as it is boring...","review":"Stink! would be more like it, as in \\"covered with the stink of the Neocon ignorati\\"..this, as some perceptive reviewers below have noted is not some masterly thesis on the value of critical thinking, it is merely the same old, tired, Neocon rants, very thinly disguised and, opportunistically, piggybacking on the (deserved) popularity of Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Blink\\". Avoid like the Avian Flu...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful attempt at a free ride","review":"I bought this after having gone through both \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\", both by Malcom Gladwell.Was expecting something similar I guess, however was greatly dissappointed.Found that many of the observations made in Blink seemed to me to be missrepresented in this work.LeGault seems to imply that in Blink, Gladwell is saying, dont worry, you don't have to microanalyse things, just go with your intuition.I however felt that in Blink, Gladwell was saying that there are times when people can become so familiar with their field of expertise that their intuition can be incredibly perceptive. He also gives good examples of where intuition can be dangerously wrong.Found my faith in this author damaged very early in the piece.I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the Point","review":"I don't think that LeGault even read Blink. More likely, he looked at the cover, scanned a few pages, and decided to write a cultural book as a \\"counterarguement\\" to a much better book that was really about human and organizational psychology (and in the process score a few extra book sales by piggy-backing on a much better and more popular book). Save your money. If you really want to read about decision making, I recommend Sources of Power by Gary Klein, and for business people, Certain to Win by Chet Richards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous attempt to cash in on Blink","review":"LeGault gives the idea that he's writing something self-consciously rebutting, or at least responding to, Gladwell's _Blink_.He isn't. Don't buy this book thinking that you're getting an informed perspective on the psychology, decision theory, pedagogy, or historical study of problem-solving or critical reasoning. It is none of those things. It is a rambling, tedious, conservative diatribe against \\"political correctness\\", social programs, and other neo-con bugbears.If you want Coulter-lite, this book is perfect for you. If you want an educated, coherent discussion of critical thinking or sound decision-making, save your money for Thomas Gilovich's _How We Know What Isn't So_, or Max Bazerman's _Judgment in Managerial Decision Making_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh Air","review":"It's about time somebody challenged Gladwell. I was beginning to wonder if anyone in North America has a mind of it's own. I read Th!nk in two sittings, and it is one of the smartest and most entertaining books written in the last 10 years. Political correctness, our culture of victimization, therapy, and consumerism are destructive. Th!nk offers answers instead of encouraging us to continue our slide downward into stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired old rant","review":"This book is such a disappointment. It seemed to promise sound argument and insightful analysis, but instead it delivers a sloppy rant, with anecdote substituting for evidence and tired old prejudices paraded as self-evident truths. There is the usual hit list for right wing polemicists - Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Europeans! This is the first book I bought for my new kindle. I'm sorry I didn't take the time to check it out first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much irrelevant information","review":"While this book is good at raising the question of how we might better use critical thinking to make better decisions, the author tries to cover too many other issues as a way to justify his position. Tearing down the book 'Blink', straying into greenhouse warming, and reiterating how poorly policitians deal with issues does little to further the case for the need for critical thinking. I wish he had concentrated on how to integrate our critical thinking and intuitive thinking brains. As it is, he comes across as just another radical looking only for data that supports his premise while conveniently ignoring other data from legitimate sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical Thinking Not Found In This Book","review":"What irony that a book about critical thinking was written without the use of any critical thinking by the author. In contrast, I see a lot more critical thinking in the reviews written by the irate readers of this book than from the author, editor, and publisher combined.The premise of this book is worthwhile, but it needed a real critical thinker and writer to execute."},{"rating":"1","title":"dichotomy in cardboard","review":"i looked forward to this book, but someone else should have written it. the author, the longer the book is read, disproves his own theory. he begins to write emotionally, taking potshots at everything from michael moore to global warming theories to the use of ritalin to psychologists in california, without the slightest evidence of critcal thinking. he states the obvious, and groups an entire people, such as the greeks, romans, americans, etc. as critical thinkers or not. actually the book, to me at least, would discourage logic. if this guy is what critical thinking produces, you can have it. it is a jumbled mess. a smart guy with a thesaurus, does not produce clear thinking. trying to separate logic from emotion is a fool's errand. it ignores humanity, which is what really separates us from the beasts. i guess i am trying to say is that this book, contains little logic. in fact, the whole premise is illogical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping it simple!","review":"This book is simple and to the point!

The current \\"Trackmaster\\" battery-operated trains that Fisher Price makes do run on this track, the puzzle piece end of the tracks are just different so that you can't use the tracks interchangably. Fisher Price did make a converter piece to allow the older Tomy \\"Road and Rails\\" tracks to adjoin to the newer Fisher Price \\"Trackmaster\\" tracks.I would only purchase this now if you had other Tomy sets and wanted to expand those, no point in getting a \\"starter\\" set for tracks that are no longer manufactured.

She pulled it off only as she could, and she deserves five stars for that!! Her raspy voice adds some attitude to the song. Now...if only it had NOTHING to do with the Rugrats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down besides the lyrics and the connection of kiddy","review":"Her song is like so cool!!! Ok it has some childish lyrics... and of course it has its connection in the Rugrats in Paris movie but its good nonetheless. I really would like to know when she sings more song. And what about the Huckapoo Solo? Raven got hers. And way more then that.( perhaps they really do have a Huckapoo solo but its not listed at Amazon) And cartoons *_* half of them are so weried, go watch some Invader Zim you want a cartoon. And then of course check out Anime. Know wonder about other countries animation... I rate this 4 songs because its a great song, nice rhytm just has kiddish lyrics. And things from Japan include J-pop this one singer called Mai Kuraki totally rocks on!!! But get this and ignore the lyrics. And yes despite bad lyrics every song has a meaning in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky, but keeps your games safe","review":"I got this in white, and I was surprised at how bulky it is. They say you can store a stylis in there, but what stylus were they using? The one that came with my DS doesn't fit in the holder (too long). You can only fit it in between the DS game holder. I also wish they had it so you could store a battery (and why would you need a spare) OR a GBA game. There is a lot of wasted space, but I guess it serves its purpose of protecting games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"The most important thing to know about this album is that it may not be what you are looking for.Since no picture was provided, I thought I was getting a CD of the album originally cut and released in the late '70s (with the picture of the iconic mansion in blue light).I got something else, that I have not yet opened. It may be great, but I'm not going to open it until I'm done being irritated with the seller, who did not bother to post a picture or list the titles of the tunes so that the buyer knows they have ordered what they wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last recording of Yank.","review":"Worth buying as his last.

(maybe it was just mine though.)We actually had to use pliers to get it open the first time which really scratched up the knob. But with a little candle wax and minimal sanding it slides in and out just fine now. Otherwise, I love this set! It's compact, looks great, and I don't have to worry about the box falling aparat and the peices disappearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeper","review":"We put this on our wedding registry and think it'll make a great family game to keep for years... as long as we can keep track of the pieces! The board & cards are much smaller than the standard $10 board, which is good & bad (less room for houses on the board but great that the deed cards are 1/2 size & easier to handle!). The wooden casing gives it an impressive presentation, folding down into something that resembles a large jewelry box for easy & attractive storage. We do miss the nostalgia of the original player pieces... the race car and his friends are replaced by small appliances, but if we want them that bad we can take them out of our regular set.Overall, very satisfied with the set even though the houses &amp; hotels are plastic (they are modeled to look like they're wood... but being plastic just means they'll hold up better over the years). We're excited to have this nice set to add to our board game collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An average reader","review":"With a very limited background in theoretical probability & statistics (as was the case for me), this book is no doubt a challenge and requires serious patience at times. However, the effort really paid off in the end, leaving me with a both intuitive and in-depth understanding of important statistical concepts. The only real frustration was that there are only answers to half of the exercises, and even these are not worked out. Having a solution manual with worked solutions to all problems would have EASILY made this a 5-star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but severely overpriced","review":"I used this book for a 300 level undergraduate probability course. I'm glad it's over now!Pros:1) The book is set up in a straightforward way, running from counting techniques to probability and then statistics.2) The examples were pretty helpful.Cons:1)PRICE!!!!!!!! Every college student knows that textbooks are overpriced these days. The companies seem to justify this by adding links to related web content, putting color photos/graphics on every page, etc. This book has none of this! It's all black and white! All the graphs look like they were done on an Apple II! Hey, I like pictures as much as the next guy, but but a 6 year old edition of 600 black text pages is not worth $100!!!!!!2)No solution manual--for some of the more complicated problems, you need the solution manual, not just a numerical answer at the back of the book.Verdict:If you have to buy this, but it used! Stand up to textbook price-gouging!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Actuarial statistics 101","review":"I found that this book was excellent in covering all the matierial that is required in order to pass the 101 course in stats for the institute and faculty joint exams. Everything is easily digestible with the right amount of examples. Especially for a person with no stats background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably expensive for the quality","review":"This is the kind of book that gives college textbooks a bad name. .... Let's see, that's, uh, 17 cents a page. To boot, the writing is lousy, bold-face definitions spoty and buried, and included disk basically worthless (you'd think they'd spend some of their profit on a CD that all computers can use, but they didn't...). As for the 5-star reader, how much you want to bet it's the author?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freund continues to surf the statistical waves!","review":"Freund's Mathematical Statistics remains an utterly fantastic book for the seriously motivated learner of statistics! I'd recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone who wants a good intermediate-level introduction to mathematical statistics. Although it seemingly lacks a CD ROM and solution guide (if there are any, please inform Amazon.com), I find it most challenging, and, quite frankly, exciting. A great source of information!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book on the Colombian resistance","review":"This book is not only the biography of one of Colombia's most famous popular leaders, it is also an excellent account of Colombian politics during the 1950s and 1960s. This is the story of Camilo Torres, a young priest who was born into the Colombian elite. While pursuing university studies abroad he became engaged with new ideas circulating in those times about the role the church could play in social causes. Upon his return to Colombia he took a faculty position at the National University where his political activities steadily moved him away from his establishment roots and into the fold of the leftist movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Books on Colombia","review":"This is one of the most important books in the world on Colombia. Camilo Torres is a priest and a revolutionary. He was born into the Colombian oligarchy but turned his back on the wealth and dedicated his life to the Church. His anger with the absence of significant social and land reforms in Colombia forced him to take up arms agains the state. This is a thrilling book. Walter Broderick makes Camilo Torres a martyr to the cause of social justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Japanese text for independent study","review":"Yookoso! Continuing with Contemporary Japanese Student Edition with Online Learning Center Bind-In Cardthis is volume two of the Yookoso Japanese language texts. Both books in this series offer Japanese in small, easy to digest bites. The pacing is such that the student may work at his or her own pace. If you are going to attempt to teach yourself Japanese with this series, be sure to get the audio programs that are made to go with the program. There are far cheaper Japanese texts you can buy, but I don't think you will find any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"great art, weak text","review":"As a showcase for Bob Eggleton's fantastic (and by this I mean superb as well as fanciful) artwork of sea serpents, this book is a feast for the eyes. Unfortunately, as a serious study of these creatures it comes up short, sprinting through all manner of mythical and real-life sightings of serpents which often does not do them justice (the section on the Lake Champlain serpent, for example, is only about 200 words and doesn't even mention the Mansi photograph). The fact that the artwork bears little resemblance to reported sightings of many of these creatures doesn't help matters any. This may be of interest for those who appreciate good fantasy art and/or have a casual interest in serpents and their mythology, but for the serious student of cryptozoology, there are many other, better books around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done book...","review":"This book is all you really need to envision sea monsters all over the place.BoB Eggleton did a wonderful job on the paintings and drawings in the book,and the prose and writing was good as well.I suppose my only crit might be a little less mythos and more dinosaurs ,but thats just my tastes.As books like this go it was extremly well done over all. M"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good method","review":"I have been playing guitar for 5 years now, completely self taught and I just started to learn to read music. This series is really good but not the best. I have 2 more pages until I'm finished with the book and I am satisfied with my experience. This was the first method book I ever used. It relies a lot on single notes studies instead of chord playing but for me, this is by no means a draw back as I use other methods to supplement everything. I would have to recommend Alfred or Hal leonards guitar method over this book though. Still 5 stars becuase it is a great method and I learned a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast service","review":"The fastest service I have received from anywhere.

Love it, both THC and these testers."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shute completists only","review":"I was fortunate enough to find a copy of this in my library. Had I spent $50 on it, I might have cried. This is not a novel, but a screenplay that Shute wrote to flesh out the Scandinavian backstory of his novel \\"An Old Captivity\\". It's impossible to say how it may have fared had it been filmed, but on paper it comes across as one of his weaker attempts. If you've read \\"An Old Captivity\\" there really is no reason to read this. If you have yet to read \\"An Old Captivity\\", you should defintely seek it out as Shute never wrote another novel like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts apples quickly","review":"This apple cutter will slice up an apple in a second with just one push. So far it has fit every apple I used it on. My only complaint would be that you can get a drop or two of apple juice sprayed on you when you perform the cutting maneuver, but it sure beats slicing an apple one cut at a time. If you had to slice a lot of apples at once a cutter like this would really help. I have never had or used an apple slicer before so cannot compare this to others, but it seems sturdy and is sharp and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"WESTLIFE","review":"HI WESTLIFE I LOVE YOUR GROUP MY FAVOURITE IS SHANE I CAME TO YOUR SHOW AT SHEFIELD AND IT WAS GREAT!

Remember, a coach is only as good as the players he has to work with. NBA teams are fashioned by the GM's, not the coaches. If you have great offensive players who can't, or won't, play defense, you have your work cut out for you as a coach.Having said that, the information in this book is in depth, advanced, and yes, perhaps a bit much for the average fan or basketball coach.But for those who really want to understand the complexities of a solid NBA defensive system and the different ways to play man-to-man defense, this is a great book. It will certainly challenge your basketball IQ and make you think about defense in different ways!Kevin Sivils - author of Game Strategy and Tactics for BasketballGame Strategies and Tactics for Basketball: Bench Coaching for Success"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't help the Lakers","review":"I can't believe that Del Harris wrote a book about so-called \\"Winning Defense\\" but yet he couldn't apply those principles to coach the Lakers to the championship. I remember when Harris was the Lakers coach, LA had among the top offenses in the league, but were towards the bottom in defense. And I think it's outrageous that Harris has Nick Van Exel on the cover of that book, someone who is one of the worst defenders in the NBA. It was Phil Jackson's defensive system that brought the Lakers back to the championship, not Harris's. If you're still not convinced, here's the score: NBA Titles won as Head Coach: Phil Jackson-7, Del Harris-0. I rest my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overall uninspired dance mix...","review":"The NRG level just isn't consistent on this mix. Starts off really boring. The first track is way too long and repetitive. Same for track 2. Track 3 is more of the same, with a bit of sexy vocal to spice things up a bit. Track 4 is vocal disco house, not so bad. Track 5 is the new mix of Loleatta's \\"Stand Up\\", but the Johnny Vicious mix from 1994 is still ten times better. Track 6 puts some diva vocal over the riff from Bad Yard Club's \\"In Da Ghetto,\\" and it's pretty hot. Track 7 is a thumpin instrumental, 8 is boring and repetitive. Track 9 brings back more intense vocal, 10 and 11 go back to boring, and 12 ends off with some boring vocal. Track times are:1. can I hear the drum (8:03)2. it's gotta be (5:26)3. set your body free (5:29)4. drama (6:29)5. stand up (6:37)6. music's gotta jumpin (6:14)7. on the drum (5:57)8. psycho (4:57)9.

If you are looking for a book based on hard science (with proper references) I recommend Your Brian at Work or Psycho-Cybernetics.To sum up the book, quoting from the book \\"Last week I literally had to stand at my kitchen counter and decide if I was going to extend grace and laugh or come completely unglued.

Our realities may not change but how we deal or react is a choice we can make. THIS IS A CHRISTIAN BOOK - very well written and based on God's truth. The emphasis is a closer walk with God, to saturate one's thoughts with scripture and to go to God in prayer. The overwhelming message is: God is on OUR side - He waits patiently, He wants us to succeed. For those who wish change - His promise is if we seek Him, we will find Him and He will be there with us along the hard journey to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Honesty","review":"Love the authenticity of this book.

In creating his characters and location it is very obvious that he is writing about what he knows and drawing from personal experiences. This book is a touch harder and gritier than most thrillers on the market and therin lies its strength. Combining this with a great command of the language and some of the most original descriptions I have ever read make this a powerful and captivating read. The characters act real and the twists and turns of the plot keep the action moving. Recommended if you are looking for something harsher and more moving than your average thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe readers are too jaded to see how special Chuck is","review":"I read this book when it first came out.

The story involves a college debate team's attempts to make emotional sense of their issues about their assigned topic: abortion. Arguing both sides, as debaters must, they come to terms with their true opinions and find peace with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to watch just for fun!","review":"The acting wasn't GREAT and the story line would OBVIOUSLY never happen. Who would actually tell something so personal as to getting an abortion after being raped to win a debate when she never told anyone else before? (sorry for giving a way part of the movie) But the reason why I give it so many stars is because it had such an affect on me that I've remembered this movie from when I was a child with fond memories. Going past all the bad acting and the far from being realistic it was moving enough to make me remember it. If you remember to watch the movie just to watch a FICTIONAL STORY it can actually be a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie and wish it would be released in a modern format!","review":"This is a heartfelt and emotionally resonant movie. It's cleverly written with plenty of memorable dialogue and powerful moments. Everyone in it is a familiar, if not beloved, face from 80's films and TV. Roy Scheider and Tim Quill deliver profound and truly unforgettable performances as the debate coach and debate star who both struggle with their need for approval, a need that also drives them in the validation-seeking world of debate itself. It's a crying shame this underrated gem isn't available on disc or download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master OF The Rare LASERDISCa Movies.","review":"I have it on LASERDISC,,LISTEN TO ME [ Kirk Cameron - LIKE Father LIKE Son] 'tis a great Romantic/comedy Movie ,LISTEN TO ME is a MUST SEE :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Debater in Fantasy Land","review":"As much as I'd like to think that my debate career was on the same line as College football quarterback, some how it just didn't have the same impact. I viewed this movie the same way geologists viewed 10.0 and Astonomers viewed Armageddon. It was pretty laughable. Knowing that Tom Miller, UCLA Debate coach, was the consultant for this movie explains it all. I truly believe that this movie expresses how he views himself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen To Me - THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!","review":"I watched this trash only for the purpose of looking at the then very beautiful Jami Gertz. She looked great, but as usual, she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. The story was corny beyond belief, especially the culminating scene with a college debate before the US Supreme Court on the abortion issue (I thought they had already decided that). I won't even go into Kirk Cameron's attempt to mimic an Oklahoma accent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The line by line was fascinating","review":"This movie came up with several important tactics that all debaters should incorporate:1. Always carry a salt and pepper shaker. 2. Never quote more than 3 pieces of evidence in a round. 3. Treat your partner like a sex object. 4. Ethics? Huh? 5. Of course, run plan in the 2AC.This movie even makes parli look academic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Look at University-Level Debating","review":"This movie attempts to portray the world of university level debate, and does a poor job at that. As a Parliamentary debater myself, I can assure you of this being an extremely poor interpritation. In the big final round before the Supreme Court for instance, the debaters use opinion as argumentation using brilliant lines as \\"abortion is wrong because God says so\\" and relaying a personal story about getting an abortion, all of which are totally irrelevant. Abortion is also pretty much not debated on any circuit because the arguements are cliche (much like this movie), and no one's opinion is changed. Even given the poor debate, the acting is miserable, and the storyline is dull and uninventive. I strongly suggest steering clear of \\"Listen to Me\\", unless you just want a good laugh at a poor attempt at film ;-)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Having read so many favorable reviews of this book, I was shocked at how bad it was. I forgot that for most readers, if the sex is hot and plentiful, the quality of the book is irrelevant. 147 pages of sex, torture, abuse. That's it. If you took it all out, what you'd be left with is about 20 pages, and I'm probably being generous. Problems: no character development at all, only enough plot to hang the sex on, and clumsy writing.What I was looking for was insights into the training of the slave, and the development of his mental adjustment to slavery. Instead, I found cliche after cliche, the most outstanding one being the slave going from hatred of his abuser to falling in love with him. From one extreme to the other with very little in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty pictures, great ideas","review":"Well, I've never gone to amazon and submitted a review, but I felt compelled to after reading Conscious Style.

It is a good book, albiet only 189 pages. Written in fisrt person, Windows on the River Neva is an incite into the thoughts of a privileged youth mixed with the reflections and opinions of his adult counterpart who has gained wisdom and maturity through his family's flight from Russia. Paul Grabbe never attemps to assert what he does not know, but he does unfortunately shift from past to present too quickly at some parts which takes away some suspense and itensity the book may have otherwise had. Nevertheless, it is worth reading and is filled with passages describing a mischievous, exuberant child caught up in life's splendor until swept away from his country by revolution. I give this book 4 stars instead of five because I feel some chapters were extraordinarily, awkwardly short."},{"rating":"2","title":"One look at 'Kane, A Contemp. Intro. to Free Will'","review":"--my point of view: PhD, geology, retired teacher, 74, minor present study of philosophy; main interest--'what's this Free Will stuff?'--I would suggest that Kane probably wrote this as a introductry college suplement to a philosophy class; as such it is very good. For the non-student, non-philosophy student it is a bit heavy in the technical terminology of philosophy; however, Kane writes well and provides enough explanation to 'slide around' some of the heavy terminology--it is still not a quick read.For me, this provided both an introduction to technical philosophy as well as some ideas on how experts in the field approach and think about Free Will. In that sense, the book did exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - deep but entertaining","review":"I bought a used copy of this book and it came within days, way before I was told it would arrive. I devoured it right away, and it exceeded my expectations. I have given free will a lot of thought through the years, but the twists and turns and alternate views the author presents expanded my mind enormously. Not only is it intriguing and thoughtful, it is as entertaining as, well, hell. I literally had trouble putting it down, like to sleep. What fun! The best chapter is 12 in which the author presents his own theory of free will, on which he does and excellent job. But all the chapters are great. Anyone who likes to think will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect introduction to the knotted Free Will problem","review":"An excellent basic introduction to the contemporary Free Will debate. Robert Kane, one of leading libertarian philosophers of free will, lucidly and concisely introduces the reader to all positions on the debate, and, what's most important, he's foremostly fair and unobtrusive about his position. The only flaw is, in my opinion, a much too short coverage of God's foreknowledge and human free will, but it does not deter from the general impression about this great book. A recommended read for anyone interested about the question of Free Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Obscure","review":"You may find some of these essays interesting because of the historical material (i.e., quotes from GA's and other church teachings and historical details), but, in general, the essays cover topics far too obtuse to be of interest to the general reader. However, if you are interested in 'deep theological questions,' you may find the discusssions interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too embarassed to let us see in the book","review":"I looked up this book with full intent of buying a copy. There are two main reasons I will not purchase it: 1. I could not look inside the book. I guess the publishers are very ashamed of it and hope to sell it sight unseen. 2. From what I have read I don't think this author knows what is theology and what is personal opinion or speculation. It is not uncommon for Mormon bashers to take personal opinion out of the Journal of Discourses, or aother literature, and portray it as doctrine.I don't know if this author does this or not. If the publisher were not so afraid to let us see inside, I may have known the answer and purchased the book. Of course, I may have given the book a bad review.

Bob LeBow's book succinctly captures the perversions and frustrations that have grown out of our free market approach to health care. Squeezing profits from the weak and vulnerable may be a way, but should not be the American way. Bob highlights the myths sponsored by the big money interests in the current system, and offers realistic solutions that appear entirely within our grasp. After reading Health Care Meltdown I am forced to reconsider what I do for a living. By serving as a safety net provider, by providing care for the poor and sick who are systematically excluded from our health care system, am I enabling our broken system to persist?

It is made for procrastinators like me who know we're made for greater things, but can't for the life of us figure out what. It is split into two parts. The first section puts you back in touch with your childhood genius (we were ALL geniuses) and helps you figure out what you love and what you want. The second section shows you exactly how to get it. It's simple, brilliant, and if I can do it, anyone can.

Barbara gives lots of positive reinforcement, but is surprisingly practical. By the time I had filtered through numerous chapters of discovery exercises, I was exhausted. I wasn't sure I would really find the focus I needed to define myself and articulate the next phase of my life.

I've consistently gone after my dreams and accomplished big goals, and I credit this to the approach I learned in Wishcraft about how to identify what I wanted and move through resistance. Wishcraft encourages us to put complete trust in our dreams and get support along the way so that we're able to keep taking steps forward. The tone is down-to-earth, encouraging and wise. The book is filled with amazing exercises that help people get really clear about their goals, and also feel brave and encouraged. I've bought this book for countless friends, and everyone loved it.Wishcraft offers support and ideas that really work, and is in striking contrast to the many self-help books out there that seem flaky to me.If I could own only one self-help book, it would definitely be Wishcraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set your goals?

I not asking to capitalize your I's or even use complete sentences, but pleas use periods and commas, at least. I'm no grammar teacher but come on. Anyway, I am thankful that Dax is still making music, regardless of what genre it fits in or doesn't fit in. His lyrics are still amazing and voice is wonderful. No, it's not acid bath but if you listen to the first Acid Bath and then go down the line to Agents of Oblivion and then to the first Deadboy and the Elephantmen album you can clearlly see this logically progression to this album.

Muscially this band has more in common with Nirvana, Misfits, Queens of the Stone Age and (Bone Machine era) Tom Waits, than what some short-sighted reviewers might use for comparison.Tessie Brunet's drumming is steady and propulsive. Her voice is a lightly sweet complement to Dax's evocative baritone.If you like any of the above mentioned bands, this band is very much worth a try.4 1/2 stars, possibly more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"Come on, you cant seriously believe this is a good album. I believe those below just cant bring themselves to say that Dax has put out a dud here. Im not some 'hung-up' Acid Bath fan either. Agents of Oblivion was a great project, and the first Deadboy album (If this is hell...) was incredible, just a shame Amazon doesnt carry it. This album is completely (i hate to say it) boring, and quite frankly soulless. The lyrics are superior, as always, but the music is spineless, and Dax's voice doesnt shine as much as past efforts.Find D + the elephantmen's first album, which is one of the best album's Dax has ever been involved in, and that is saying something. Im left bitterly disappointed by this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few hits, mostly misses with simple alt folk","review":"1 1/2With the majority of songs being written in very simplistic 2 or 3 chord change settings, any artist needs to be on the side of subtlety, crafting movements out of minimalism..Deadboy and Elephantmen use this formula to partial success..The singer is obviously very talanted in his delivery and conviction, and the space used in between the sparse arrangements is usually worthy of the White stripes/Black Keys comparisons..But alas, the album cannot hold up, with material eventually giving in to it's overall laziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disease disease disease, my friend","review":"I really don't understand why any of you folks think that this guy has a good voice, at all, ever, under any circumstances.

This is, quite possibly and very probably, THE worst thing that I have ever heard in my life. I suppose that in retrospect, and after hearing \\"Stop I'm Already Dead\\" a million-billion times, it becomes more like a joke and I can laugh at it.

I'm a big fan of NY crimefiction & political thrillers and was so excited when this cameout that I rushed out to but it. MISTAKE! It wasn't very well written, the dialogue was painfully amature and the suspense just wasn't there. And by the way, having read the author's bio, he thinks a little too highly of himself in his pseudo-autobiographical fantasy portrayal of himself as the lead character, not to mention that a number of other characters are thinly veiled screeds on real officials in NY city government.Stick to Tom Wolfe or the Waterworks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome sequel","review":"Megan Whalen Turner seems to have mastered the trick of writing sequels worth of their predecessors.

It is more sophisticated than the first novel and concerns politics more than the first two books. The Thief is presents a younger man who is concerned for himself. The Queen of Attolia move further away in focus, but deals with relationships. The King of Attolia moves even further away from Gen the thief.

Elegantly constructed, doling out information to its readers in small shards, with a captivating hero and heroine and a regular guy/guard, from whose perspective we see most of what goes on.There are wheels within wheels, glancing insights into truth and falsehood, perception and reality, love and loyalty, but all of this happens in the midst of a completely absorbing story.

Now that Eugenides is king of Attolia (to the anger of the queen's loyal subjects), he has a task: to prove himself to the Attolians, who believe him to be nothing more than an impudent and mischeivous boy set out to shame Her Majesty, never thinking that he could be smarter than he shows. The King of Attolia explores the subjects pranks and actions, the monarchs relationship, all through the eyes of a guard, Costis, who has been forced to become Gen's assistant after punching him in the face.

As soon as we installed this, our game went kerflooey! The bus didn't show up, the car pool didn't show. Every Sim became unemployed and kids had no school grades. You couldn't find a new job with either computer or newspaper. We had to uninstall and reinstall all the games, lost all our families, pictures, downloads, EVERYTHING!

This EP may slip under the radar, since it is comprised of mainly covers, and an abbreviated version of \\"The Road Leads Where It's Led\\" from the previous album- this is a bit of a puzzle....great song, but why cut out the album intro?? The good news is that the cover songs are great. TSM have performed all of them while touring tirelessly, and it is good to have them all on one disc, since they are otherwise scattered on import EPs.\\"Immer Wieder (De Luxe)\\" is simply majestic, and \\"Girl from the North Country\\" is given a startling psychedelic treatment awash with keyboards and processed guitar, all melded together with a melancholy vocal....this band is intelligent, incredibly musical, and deserves the raves they are receiving.

They brought in the best armed forces a person could ever ask for, Chip, Michell, father Bob Bailey, and the famous Loraine Warren...and this show was faked, rehearsed. Give me a break. I was married to a cop, and one thing I learned is how to tell when someone is lying. If you do you may get away with it once or twice, but you can't pull it off forever.

There is a problem, however. Most likely due to poor editing, there is a lag between visual and audio which is disconcerting unless the viewer is only paying partial attention. The audio and video are a bit out of sync; perhaps that's why Season Two is so difficult to locate - the problem was only detected after the video had been released and the distribution company pulled/recalled as many of the copies as possible (at least that's my guess).

I've put five and eight pound weights on it for another 24 hours, but as soon as the weights are moved, it begins to curl again. I wanted this product to prevent my 9-month-old daughter from pulling a speaker wire up, but the way it won't stay flat and stuck to the carpet makes it useless for my needs.I really wish I had read the first review on this page before trying to use this product...maybe rolling up backwards and putting it back in the box for some time is the key to making it work right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product...

I bought this cord protector so that I could hide some wires that I run from my computer to my TV. These wires include a coaxial cable, a VGA cable, and a simple audio cable. The coaxial and audio cables fit with no issues whatsoever. However, the VGA cable is just too bulky to fit inside the protector. A little more room would have been ideal... this could have been accommodated quite easily if the internal supports were spaced a bit more (like another 1/2\\").

The supplied tape does not adhere to the bottom of the plastic cord protector, and it pops up off the floor.So I am left with a piece of tape stuck to my floor collecting dirt, while the cord protector is loose and you can easily catch your foot on it. I'm very dissatisified with this.As other reviewers have noted, the item is shipped tightly coiled, and I expended a good bit of effort getting it straightened out by reverse-coiling it and flattening it with weights. However, the end which was in the center of the coil will not straighten out despite my best efforts.Because the tape does not adhere well to the plastic, it is virtually impossible to get this thing to stay flat on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cord Protector","review":"I had a difficult time locating this cord protector locally, so once again turned to Amazon.

This book is followed too by a new initiative into the school systems, where parents are about to lose the control of whether thier kids take drugs for mental problems or not. If you refuse, you apparently are not a good parent and they remove your child from the home. Now to think, they will not only remove your child, but also they now want to put them in an orphanage too.

I don't believe that it will get as much airplay as I have given Endtroducing but it still rates as one of the better albums on my rack. I think I was initially a little shocked as it is not exactly what I have come to expect from DJ Shadow, given the amount of vocals contained on PF. However after the initial shock, the new sounds are growing on me quickly. I think that true fans will not be disappointed and will be impressed at the range of music styles on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for clones!","review":"I agree with the reviewer above in that this album represents a compromise of sorts, but I do not think it is a clumsy one. Admittedly, the presence of vocalists on the tracks means that DJ Shadow can't be quite as adventurous as he usually is, but he still weaves an amazing range of material into his work, and on the whole I think the other artists add more to his tracks than they can be said to have taken away. Good album. Go get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was looking forward to this","review":"I have been a big fan of DJ Shadow since I bought the Mo Wax headz compilation in 1995. Endtroducing is one of my favourite LPs of all time, and some of the earlier UNKLE stuff is very good too.What a turkey this turned out to be. The LP sounds so cold and dull. Most of the vocal tracks are done to a formula. It tries to cover so much and misses on almost every track. The second to last song is one of the worst things ever put on record! What the hell is that???As for my 'narrow' views. I don't think so! Stay well claer of this and go and buy other mo wax stuff.

He was willing to work with outside artists and create a project that was really on the lines of the DJ Shadow All-Stars. The 9/12 tempo of \\"Rabbit In Your Headlights\\" works great, and \\"Bloodstain\\" is arguably the best track on this album, complete with a slight tribute to producer Timbaland. Like ENDTRODUCING, PSYENCE FICTION has a running theme, this time one of loneliness and looking for light at the end of the tunnel. While not perfect, it is a great album that seems to suffer from hip-hop heads to say \\"this wasn't hip-hop enough\\" to alternative people who said this was too \\"crossover\\". Forget about it, this is a great album. Maybe not a \\"proper\\" DJ Shadow album, but definitely an important piece of the Josh Davis puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Second Coming, but it'll do for now...","review":"I'm a big fan of some of the artists involved here (DJ Shadow, Thom Yorke, R.

Given expectations for the album of the century, I was left disappointed when what I purchased was merely a very good album. Like a lot of reviewers, I wish there were more of the highs (Rabbit..., Bloodstain, Main Theme), and less of the relative lows (Mike D's clumsy DOD 2, Chaos), but on the whole, Shadow's (and Lavelle's) vision comes through. Even on the \\"Ballbuster\\" throwaway. Also, it was cool that Shadow gave some exposure to the long-overlooked rapper Kool G. Rap. I barely even noticed his lisp! Shadow should work more with underground rappers. I think he needs them, and they definitely need him. All in all, Psyence Fiction is a great CD. If not the Second Coming, it's the blueprint for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected beats compliments truthful styles of the artists","review":"Play it as loud as your neighbors permit the first time around and catch the suprise of the present.

I like to ask this, what do you consider true Hip-Hop? I would like to know, so email me with your response. I am thinking that it may be as good as Endtroducing.

I find it hard to believe that Mr. Austin picked out the matches himself. I understand that WrestleMania is the biggest show of the year and are the most memorable matches (which is quite arguable considering all the PPVs each year.) But surely Stone Cold knows that almost all of these matches here have already been released on multiple DVD sets and are complete crap thanks to the horrific blurring of the Attitude era logo (especially for Mania 15 and 17.)I would've hoped for more In Your House and Unforgiven type of matches rather than duplicates of the WrestleMania and SummerSlam matches that have been previously released on DVD. Diehard fans of Austin it's a must buy, everyone else the documentary is a rental or worth waiting for when it comes to WWE Classics on Demand in about 6 months.

Every so often the author gives a perfunctory nod to the fact that it's supposed to be a mystery and mentions the crime or the policewoman (for whom the narrator clearly has zero respect, despite their on-again off-again relationship).

Staccato one note riffs that slide up and down the scales are just downright bad, and Froese didn't have the chops back then to pull it off.

Yes, this might be easier than to come up with a new implementation, but, is definitely not a good learning tool. I want to know what's behind each implementation so that I can abstract it in my head and apply it to other examples and problems. But for example, how is,int[] blah = new int(50);Array.asList(blah)lgoing to teach me about turning an array into a linear list or even a string? Yeah Java has the facilities, but it's all behind the fog (API).One other issue I have is that the author spends way too much time testing the Java API (about two chapters). And further, even as the book progresses, he keeps calling Java's internal, built-in methods and interface.It's not a bad book for the price, but don't buy it as a substitute for a text book or even a main aid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I bought a number of Schaum's Outline books simultaneously.

One of the reasons I am so grateful to this book is because one of the many ideas was to subscribe to the magazine Marriage which has really opened my eyes to a lot of things. But other than that the book has tons of little ideas that cost next to nothing, if anything at all.

Much of the content has been either relegated to an 'optional' section or removed altogether. In addition many of the more challenging questions in the 3rd edition are removed altogether.

However, the result of using this book for my first time was failing the class. The book was unreliable for independent study, in the sense that concepts are not clearley explained and the choice of word complicate more the understanding of the material. There are many equations in which the variables are not explained in the proceeding paragrahps, and the fanciness of the subcripts sometimes makes the equations confusing. The bottom line: it is not clearley written. There are a lot of derivations from line integrals and vector equations whose preceiding steps dont follow immediatley from its theory.

Should I estimate that the ball was being thrown at a zillion meters per millisecond? My point is that a lot of the questions seems lazy like they didn't want to solve the math themselves when they wrote it. I'm sure that's not actually the case, but it does seem like that. Their thought experiment questions are often poorly worded so you have multiple interpretations of the problem. Very few fun math problems. Many math problems are hard only because you aren't sure what they are asking, not because the math is difficult. The only thing it does do right is it's example problems are written very clearly.

Though it covers an incredible array of topics, the authors choose to use language far too complex and examples and problems far too enigmatic for students to decipher.

Instead of learning about physics, I become frustrated and give up on the topic of the day. Even the teacher of the class struggles with the solutions manual on a regular basis.

They are now in the trash because the tread has separated from the carcass."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I just installed these tires on my old cannondale road bike, along with schwinn self sealing tubes. I very easily put them on the rims(though time consuming), and took off. I hit 27mph with no problems. The only problem I have is the gum wall is out of round. It doesn't effect the rotation of the tire, but makes it look cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to the Weems family is a great read!","review":"Gentle's Holler was my introduction to the Weems family. Totally enjoyable! Although the book is listed under youth fiction, I (well past youth) found the book absolutely delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young girl's struggles in the 1960s","review":"Livey 2 (named after her late sister whom she talks and prays to) struggles through life in North Carolina during the 1960's. She has lots of sisters and not much food for the whole family, so she's constantly hungry. But the biggest problem of all is that her younger sister, Gentle, is blind. This story about a musician, (Livey 2 plays the guitar), is not as sad as it sounds. It uses no bad language and is child appropriate. I thought the characters were realistic and the plot was very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Help","review":"This book offers very little help. Contents and index listings do not lead to needed information; information is hard to find, i.e. tork specs. Trouble shooting does not cover all scenerios. This is a good book if all you need is something to sit on a shelf and gather dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clymer Manual is good deal.","review":"I found the book to be good help for the Outboard mechanic that knows what he is doing. The specs for each catagory of repair have their own specs in each area. These include assembly and Torque specs. If you are mechanically inclined the book is of great importance. It will save you a ton of $ for DIY repairs and maintenance. If deeper thought or specs are needed, then a dealer service rep needs to be consulted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun romp for elementary school readers","review":"A mouse and a hero with a quest, what can be more entertaining or relatable for a young reader? For those young readers who have already begun their love affair with books this will be especially appealing. You can almost smell the leather books in the bookstore that the mouse lives in. The Amazon editorial introduction is correct: you will be reminded of the Phantom Tollbooth with all the yummy and delectable words the mouse and the reader will munch on!The story is short enough to keep their attention while it's compelling enough to keep them reading. For those who enjoy reading to their little ones, the chapters are a good length to read one (or maybe two if they're good) a day/night.Depending on the reading skill level of the child, I'd recommend this for readers in Grades 2-5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tairrie B is a Queen!","review":"Ive been a big fan of Tairrie B, and her music since her first rock band, 'Manhole'. I feel My Ruins stuff is more put together lyrically and musically. Shes got a great voice, a terror inducing scream that could put any male of female singer to shame. Tairrie is at her sultry best on this cover of Tainted Love. The metalish guitars are a great addition to the song, the screaming at the end also adds a cool mood to the song. As you can see, I really liked this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"swamp water","review":"Was not readable on my DVD player. Was from a foreign entity, sort of like Obabma's DVD gift to Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Freud when applied to people the author never met","review":"I must agree with some of the other reviews that have appeared on this book. I got this book with the intention of learning something more about Toulouse Lautrec. I really like all aspects of his work and wanted to find something that would be more true to life than the the movie \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" Usually in most biographies of artists there is a more than passing interest in the work. I did not find this aspect in this book. Instead the author focuses on rather facile Freudian looks at the paintings themselves. As Freud himself observed, \\"sometimes a cigar is only a cigar.\\" Elements of composition are subjected to a desire to demonstrate some sort of unified field theory toward Toulouse Lautrec's art. I am still looking for a book that illuminate's Toulouse Lautrec's art and life for this clearly is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes.","review":"This book is full of errors. The \\"accompanying\\" web site to which book corrections or errata is published is no longer active.What a fascinating purchase. There is nothing anyone can do with this book, except perhaps to level a wobbly table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certified Macromedia Flash MX Designer Study Guide","review":"People this book is a waste. I studied this book in side and out and knew page for page word for word, question for question and anwser for anwser. I have been using flash for a year now and felt confortable taking this test. Once the test started I said OMG! This book does nothing for the exam. Turthfully I found three questions from the book on the test of 68 questions on the exam. I felt this book was [not good] for this exam. Starts out it's going be 400 and something pages then turns out to be 100 and something. Come on please make a book for this exam that makes sense..... Good luck with the exam but you will need it if you use this book as a guide...."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait","review":"wait for the Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Certified Designer Study Guide by James English, it will be out in Nov.The exam has 4 domains; Planning, Visual Design, Experience Design, and Optimization, Pub, Workflow.

Ok I'm very disappointed because the version of the book I got is only 112 pages. This book is way too small to be a study guide for any test. Each chapter only has 3 review questions. I was really disappointed with this book the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you get %15 percent off when taking the ($$$) dollar test. I think I will wait until someone does a better version of this book before taking the Flash MX Designer test."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 % Discount on Test","review":"We all pretty much agree that the book is rather thin and covers topics in a very minimal and thin way, but after all, we were going to get our free 15 % off on the test.I went to vue.com, after buying the book, signed up for the exam and just when i put in the voucher code a nice message came up:\\" This promotion is VALID TIL 31 / 2003\\".Great job!I don't recomed this book simply cause you can buy something better, covering all topics extensivly and in details.PLUS THE DISCOUNT ON THE TEST IS NO LONGER VALID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor guide","review":"this book seems to be done in a rush. few sample questions. no mock test no nothing. even the promised sample test at [website] is not up yet. too few examples and not detail enough. this guide is as good as not having it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read prayerfully...","review":"This is a very good book to aid in meditation. Each 3-4 page chapter focuses on particular human feelings such as suffering, sadness, or joy so that one can go to that particular meditation when in need of a reminder that Mary has been there too. Each chapter is divided into two halves, the first discussing how our Blessed Mother would have encountered such feelings in the course of her life and how she would have faced them. The second half is a series of thoughts to provide imagery which places you next to our Blessed Mother and helps you to feel her presence and unite your feelings with hers. Overall, a wonderful book to aid in prayer and union with Our Lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtually the best.","review":"K&N; is known throughout the automotive industry for making what is considered by many to be the best oil filter on the market.If you ask anyone of knowledge in the automotive industry, \\"What is the cheapest and most effective thing I can do to prolong the life of my engine?\\" the majority of the time, you will be told to change your oil and filter at the recommended interval, and more frequently with more severe activity (off road, etc.).Go to K&N;'s website to find the specific filter for you vehicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right filter, Amazon Prime","review":"This is the right filter for my '83 Camaro, and it came via Amazon Prime. No reason to not buy it along with the oil I like also on Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had heard good things about this book and was looking forward to reading it. Sorry but what a load of nonsense. I can't help but fail to see what the connection to how the shape and angle of your toes can say so much about your personality. I also do not see how it all related to reflexology. Furthermore I object to the authors statement in the beginning that if you fail to see and understand or take in what it is he is saying, it is because of your own denial etc. What I was expecting was more on the lines of, an indentation on the heal can indicate ..... (if no physical explanation as in an injury can be used). But it had nothing like that at all. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pseudo-science psychology","review":"This book is written with a degree of authority that this information is based on relevant data and has some basis of truth to it. In reality it is just pseudo-science masquerading as an alternative psychological system which has within in little actual truth.It is baseless and totally subjective and really has no connection to reflexology at all.
