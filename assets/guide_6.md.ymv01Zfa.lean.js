This is not worth spending money just for the sake of collection. The Front and Back of the collectible box has advertisement of some other anime. Funimation's DTB box release was way better. Though I gave it a 2 STAR, the Anime itself gets a 5 STAR.Anime Review:Animation/BGM:Pretty decent. Opening/Ending songs are quite catchy.Story (No SPOILERS):The story is centered around a 22 year old male, who is suffering from extreme Social anxiety disorder (SAD). The story explores the human psyche and how it is affected by our daily life. Issues such as social hypocrisy, conspiracy theory, social expectation are also highlighted in this anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!!!","review":"Great character studies and atmosphere.

Basically the movie started mediocre and rapidly went downhill from there. About two-thirds of the way into the film it hit bottom and apparently started digging. This movie is so horrendously bad that you can't even laugh at it as much as stare in horror. There's almost no plot, just constant droning misery and depression. The movie devoted about a half hour to an extremely boring and drawn-out scene in which the main characters look for their mentally diseased, homeless former friend.The movie gave me a headache and the soundtrack a stomachache. This is the first film I've seen with disease-like symptoms. I write this about 10 minutes after I watch it, and my head is still pounding. For the sake of your mental health, do not watch this movie. It would be best used as a torture device for government interrogators, though perhaps is too potently bad even for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Beginning Book on Subject I've Seen Thus Far.","review":"So far, the best intro book on the subject of advanced math for derviatives pricing theory I've found. I've tried several other books which claim to say you only need some intro calculus to follow along, only to be totally blown away after reading the first few pages (and putting the book back on the shelf). I guess nothing beats having a teacher by your side, but it would be nice to be able to follow along and least pick up some ideas on how the math works and what's behind it. This book allows one to do just that. For the math newbie (like myself), nothing beats a course on stochastic calc, PDEs, etc, to get you up to speed, and this book might be worth reading before taking those courses. This is why I gave 4 stars. However, the book could be vastly improved with worked out exercises and more graphical representations of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good first draft not a useful text","review":"I used this text for a graduate course on financial derivatives in an applied mathematics program. The text generally made a good selection of the topics covered, but often key insights and proofs were missing. There were few useful examples and the end-of-chapter exercises were both too few in number and were not well thought out. The material could have been better organized and less meandering. A more compact and rigorous theoretical presentation surrounded and amplified by lots of good examples--including some involving numerical techniques--would have been both deeper and more accessible to students. As an instructor, I found the text was usable, but required me to add a great deal of my own material for the students. Finally, the index is just about useless, making it difficult to use this work as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Starter Book","review":"I highly recommend this book. As someone with a pretty good math background who has read through other textbooks on modern finance and left with the uneasy feeling that I didn't really understand what was going on, Prof. Netftci's book was the first to give me an understanding of the big picture. Certainly it is short on details, but it is not meant to be a handbook--get that kind of information from something like Hull's book. I really like the way he puts in the simple version of the arbitrage theorem at the beginning, which in itself let me understand many pricing manipulations that had previously seemed like voodoo. Read this book and you'll be in a good position to decipher the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very lousy book","review":"The book quickly deterioates after the first 3 chapters. Quasi-mathematical non-intuitive statements are made with absolutely no proof. Presentation of materials is totally disorganized with concepts being used and then introduced in later chapters. Examples do not correspond to concepts presented. Exercises to enforce understanding are totally lacking. I am very disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book to read, even for beginners","review":"This was the first book I read (cover to cover) when I decided to consider quantitative finance. It was suggested to me by a friend.Unfortunately the book offers very little in return for investing your time into reading it. I find it poorly edited; the author repeats certain things over and over again. It's true that he gives an introduction to the BS world, but it's just way too lengthy for an intro.A good intro is Baxter & Rennie's: short, to the point, and informative. After that I find Shrieve's two volumes superb. Shrieve really knows what he is talking about, and I think he uses the right amount of math, and nothing more.Conclusion: don't waste your time with Neftci, there are much better books out-there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed but Comprehensible","review":"This booke really helped me understand topics for a class I was taking.

However, I found that it lacks a great amount of depths. You can't use it as a substitute for the real literature on stochastic calculus. If you want to play in the premier league don't waste your time discovering all the little mistakes in the book. Just use it when you are completely lost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I bought the book because of all the positive reviews; I did read the negative reviews, but decided to take my chance.This book is useful for reviewing materials that you have learned in the past but forgotten. In my opinion, it's not that good for beginners of mathematical finance (who wants to learn it seriously) because the presentation is so unclear, with lots of hand-waving and skipping essential steps. I am a beginner myself, and I would rather struggle through more mathematically difficult but clearly presented textbooks.I wanted to give this book one star because it was way below expectation, but I gave it two because at least it attempts to offer a layman's explanations (not a very successful attempt, but a positive thing, nonetheless) behind all the math. And it's not like I gained absolutely nothing from it. I guess I would recommend giving this book a shot if you could get it cheaply, perhaps a secondhand copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disservice to PDEs","review":"Yes, this is a friendly, introductory book, and that is no bad thing. The reader is very poorly served, however, by the author's treatment of PDE techniques. Ignorance of a field is no excuse to trash it, and the author betrays an almost complete lack of understanding of even the linear heat equation. This lapse is sadder for being completely unnecessary. Stochastic methods are beautiful and useful in their own right, and do not require a false comparison for motivation.Someone looking for intuition with their mathematical exposition should consider Baxter and Rennie's \\"Financial Calculus\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent background reading material for Hull","review":"I started out reading Hull, the classic on derivatives.

Anyone who doesn't like Styx (a lot) would not want this CD, and anyone who does like them already has these songs. The two new songs are an obvious attempt to suck loyal fans into buying a whole CD. Shameless. This is the first Styx CD I've ever refused to buy...two new songs or not! Return To paradise was another shameless milking! However, I'm happy to see that Styx is back in the business of releasing real CDs and busting their butts supporting them on the road. They have redeemed themselves, since this terrible mistake. And after seeing the latest tour, I believe their future is bright, even if there are no founding members remaining. The band I saw in 2000 was undeniably Styx! In fact, a new and improved Styx.

This contains some of the more popular \\"album\\" tracks, songs that were not considered \\"fillers\\". Nice to hear these songs remastered and contains two new songs, \\"Little Suzie\\" showcasing the drumming talents of new drummer Todd. \\"It Takes Love\\" is vintage Shaw/DeYoung harmonies.

There is foul language, questionable pictures, and subjects are for adults. Content includes Bigfoot pole dancing in order to make mony, and him partying with a bikini girl on his shoulders.

Let's define the humor - crass, tactless, gross, inane, all come to mind. If you are an adult that enjoys the lowest of lowest humor that includes profanity for profanity's sake, death and dismemberment, that type of garbage, then this book is for you. I think having a humor book on bigfoot is a grand idea, but in my view, humor should transcend across all ages of readers to be humorous, not the gutter type humor this author conveys. Think Calvin and Hobbes, funny to kids, funny to adults, not trying to be offensive to get a lift out of the reader, as this book does. Complete disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD can't be summed up in one sentence!","review":"Wow! This CD is absolutely awesome. While there are a couple small disadvantages to playing live (for instance John Popper is unable to background sing for himself, which can easily be done in studios), there are many more advantages that this band has completely mastered! I've bought live CDs in the past that I didn't think were that great, but this one is actually very cool! Blues Traveler really knows how to improvise and ham it up. I'd reccomend this CD set to anyone. It was an excellent addition to my collection, and it's especially cool if you already own some of their other CDs because then you can really tell how much more great music John Popper and the crew give you with this one. This band really understands music. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs I Heard/Harry Connick","review":"I'm very disappointed in this cd. Connick's trip back to his childhood is coy and annoying.

(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds flat to me","review":"My wife bought this for our daughter's nursery. Connick takes what could be a great album and provides a lackluster performance. The songs sound the same, with little inflection to keep a child's interest. True Harry Connick Jr. fans probably love this, but if you're looking for something interesting for your children, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soo disappointing!","review":"Since I am a mother of a 2 yr. old, I was very excited to see that one of my favorite singers had recorded an album of children's songs. Much to my disappointment I found this CD to be annoying and hard to listen too. Many of the songs are so...all over the place. His interpretations of these songs are awful! Even the more tolerable selections are NOT Harry's normal quality. I NORMALLY LOVE HIS MUSIC, but this CD is best left on the shelf. I feel ripped off that I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs I Heard Harry Connick Jr.","review":"Songs I Heard Harry Connick Jr, is good cd.

Somehow, I missed when this album came out but was pleased to have been sent a link to it recently. It's really a great album all the way along. HCJ, in the finest tradition of jazz and blues, takes songs we all know from musicals like The Wizard of Oz and Annie, and puts his unique spin on them.I enjoy listening to this album just for its own merits, but I also have really enjoyed sharing it with the three year old in my life. I'd recommend it to anyone, but doubly so to parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connick fans will love this! It's perky. It's nostalgic!","review":"If you are a Harry Connick Jr. fan, you're really going to enjoy this CD. The first time I heard Supercalafra...it was on the \\"Regis and Kelly\\" show. My first impression was \\"what is he doing?\\" \\"why this song?\\" but as I reviewed the other cuts from the CD I loved it! Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz, and The Sound of Music were my three favorite childhood movies.Harry Connick still keeps his smooth and very suave jazz style going strong on this CD. The best part is they are all songs we grew up with and they are songs that are \\"ageless\\". These are songs your little ones will sing and bounce to. Very perky and upbeat. A real toetapper. Way to go Harry!I am one of his biggest fans. Please go out and buy it you won't be disappointed.Sincerely yours,Korki in Toledo, OH : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry + Childhood Memories = Good Album","review":"Although I don't think this album showcased all of Harry's greatest talents, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is so fun to hear Harry's beautiful voice to the songs from some of my favorite childhood movies. My personal favorites were Eidelweiss and Oompah-Loompah. The best thing about the album was that I could sing along with him the first time I listened to it. I think Harry is enormously talented and I love his unique style of music. Even though he did do these songs differently than they were in the movies, he had obvious restraints. I enjoy his original songs better, but I still highly recommend this album. Harry fans will love it and anyone who likes these great musical movies will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Parents; So-so for Kids","review":"Much of what is good about Harry Connick Jr.'s music--his unusual phrasing, his unique song stylings--works against this disk from a child's point of view as he alters some well-chosen material almost beyond recognition.My family (which includes five children, 4-14) listens to all kinds of children's music, and the kids would rate this near the bottom (though most have grown to like his version of \\"Oompa Loompa\\").My wife and I, who own several of Connick's other CD's, enjoy this disk. But it would get a lot more airplay in the minivan if it were sung with kids in mind.If he set out to create an album of children's songs for adult ears, Connick has succeeded. If you're looking for something the kids will enjoy, do a search of Tom Chapin's stuff (especially \\"My Hometown\\" and \\"Family Tree\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I found this album to be far less interesting than i had hoped. I love HCJ and the list of songs seems full of exciting potential but i found the execution to be lifeless and rather dull. I was so disappointed because i enjoy his music so much.

It's old but still one of my favorite albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment","review":"I bought this for a 40 plus on his birthday. It was a flop as a gift.

Highly recommended if you like Connick, swing, big band, etc.Right from the start you know this is going to be a fun time.

Every time I here \\"Oompa Loompa\\" or \\"The Jitterbug\\" I just smile. Far from being just for adults, \\"Songs I Heard\\" is a great CD to break up the monotony of children's songs. I can envision my 4 year old sisters singing and dancing to these songs and loving every minute of it. In all this is a fun, happy CD that despite (or perhaps because of) Mr. Connick's restylization, takes me back to being a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classics made even better!","review":"When I saw this CD in the store I was both intrigued and skeptical. I love all the musicals represented on this CD, but wondered how Harry could turn songs like Lonely Goatherd and The Oompa-Loompa song into swing tunes. He pulled it off wonderfully! All of these songs are cleverly arranged and fun to listen to. This CD proves again what a terrific talent Harry Connick, Jr. is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduce your child to great music","review":"When I first got this CD, I thought it was so-so, and I thought my four-year old son would never like it. But he surprised me and it became one of his FAVORITES. He loves listening for the different instruments coming in and out (trumpets, saxophones, etc.), and I think it's been an excellent album to widen his musical interests. In fact, the CD got stolen, and I am back on Amazon.com re-ordering it because he misses it so much.

That makes them prone to breakage, and when they break they are almost impossible to replace. I've found quite a few stores that sell Skagen watches but none that sell Skagen armbands. I've been told that I would have to send the watch in, which would take 4-6 weeks and cost more than half the original sale price of the watch. Great design, but I'm not going to buy another Skagen watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than mountaineeering book...","review":"Ed Hommer's The Hill is more than a \\"this is how I got to the summit\\" mountaineering book-it's an inspiring story of transcending personal tragedy and pushing limits.Stuck on a pass on Mt. McKinley after a plane crash, then bush-pilot Ed Hommer and three others endured days of bitter cold as a storm delayed their rescue. Hommer lost both of his lower legs to the cold; two of his companions lost their lives. The heart of the story has to do with how he adapted to life as a double-amputee, both physically and emotionally, and ultimately made an uneasy peace with the mountain as he returned to summit it.The tone of Hommer's book is fast paced and folksy. He avoids philosophizing about his situation, instead he tells his story in a straightforward and honest manner. I recommend the book to anyone looking for an exciting and inspiring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hill","review":"What Ed Hommer accomplished was monumental, until you put in perspective that he was putting himself first... sacrificing his relationship with his children to climb. I met Ed only one time. I did not know him personally. I do know his children and ex-wife. It is a shame that he didn't \\"fix\\" himself sooner. While he was off climbing mountains, his children endured months at a time of only support (financially and emotionally) from one parent, their mother. It is sad that Ed died before he could fix those relationships! His children are wonderful people. It is sad that they will not have the opportunity to develop that relationship with their dad. I get angry at him (Ed) for what he put them through. I feel that he was selfish in his endeavors. He is viewed as a great man by many people. I don't see him that way. What he put his family through, specifically his children, overshadows his personal accomplishments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm Workout Pant","review":"I like these pants, got them in black, gray and navy.

Even though I may not try all the complete projects in the book, I did glean good information on fixtures building that I will utilize now. I especially liked the radius turning fixture and hollowing tools. I tend to buy woodturning books for technical information and inspiration rather than project ideas for myself. I have already used some of the techniques on my lidded boxes.

The most amazing project is the turned box inside a sphere.The projects are step by step and fully illustrated with clear well taken photograps. Springett also includes clear instructions on how to make the tools needed to make the lattice cuts and undercuts needed with the various spherical turnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"I was pleasantly surprised that the revised edition was better than the original publication (which I borrowed from the library).

This DVD let's you get behind the scenes and into the inner world of Godsmack. I am particularly impressed by the overall look of the movie. Very professional and cool. The DTS track in particular is amazing. The band has never sounded better. Andy Johns of Led Zep fame mixed this DVD- not to be missed.The Director and Producer was Dan Catullo who directed last year's Rush In Rio (one of my favorites). His documentary guy Andrew MacNaughtan also did this DVD. This DVD has a lot more flair to it and desrves to be on any music lovers shelf.I would reccommend this DVD to any rock lover.

As with most books written today on Wicca, the author mixes up a batch of \\"instant Wicca lite\\" and serves it with a big ladle. Today Wicca seems to be whatever anyone feels it is at any particular time of day. This \\"blind leading the blind\\" approach to Wicca is very puzzling, but seems to be what people want.So, if you don't really care what Wicca is truly about, and want just another idea whipped up in someone's backroom overnight, then this book is as \\"good\\" as any."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent intro to Wicca","review":"This book is one of the best and most clearly laid out i have seen, with easy find lists and sections so that you can cross reference as you read. But the real strength of the book is in the depth of knowledge and spirituality and in the beautiful way its written. All the necessary ingredients are there: working with the moon and the seasons; an excellent and reassuring section on magikal equipment; the wheel of the year; goddesses and gods; how to build a shrine and cast a circle. An unusual feature is the section on sacred sites. Though these are mostly British, they are wonderfully describes and show the Celtic basis which after all is important in Wicca, though this isn't a book heavy on Celtic symbolism by any means. if you are looking for a beginners intro to Wicca then this is definitely for you, but don't overlook it even if you have been practising for years as I believe In The Circle will have much to offer and something new for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is a great and \\"unusual\\" book because the author actually has chapters on how she celebrates Sabbats and the Moons. She talks about how she and her coven of four (with her husband)celebrate different seasons of the year.

But honestly to me, the recipes that I tried were so bad that I couldn't eat the food, it would taste better for me to just go dry - fruits, nuts, salads, that type of thing. It is possible that people who are more used to blander foods may find this cookbook totally fine though - I just advise people to maybe find a way to try a recipe first before making the decision to buy it. If you need to fast and feel that if you put time into cooking you still want some flavor (otherwise finding it more worthwhile to just eat plain, dry foods at least), then just get a mediterranean cookbook and use the vegetarian recipes, many can be made vegan, and substitute canola oil for olive oil. With that said, this cookbook does have recipes for those trying to go oil free as well - so that is a bonus for anyone interested in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Aeneid\\" it ain't...","review":"despite the beginning in medias respublicae.

As soon as water began to flow, it was at maximum. When shut off, the water stopped instantly instead of gradually, which caused the water hammer. These things are a COMPLETE waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"To all those Amazon.com shoppers out there, don't be fooled by good reviews for products like this one. They're usually written by friends or those who have a vested interest in selling the product. I bought Ladino Lives! on the basis of the three 5 star reviews only to find that I'd been duped. Ladino music is traditionally beautiful but this recording is not. It's an amateurish production and the singer, who misses notes and has a blackboard-scratch voice, should give it up. The instrumentals are okay but can't compensate for the other failings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"First, let me say that the sound quality of this disk is poor enough that at times I felt like I was listening to my Papu's old 78s. You might think that sounds nostalgic, but in this case it's difficult to understand what the singer is saying.Second, this disk relies heavily on the clarinet, which I found very disturbing. Ladino music has more in common with the musical traditions of the Middle East, than it does with a Klezmer Band.All in all, this was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game won't work on all Macs","review":"After purchasing the game, I had trouble opening it, and kept getting a message saying \\"this is not supported on your system\\".

The author creates a believeable world, peopled with fully-drawn characters, and gives us a story that holds our interest from beginning to end. It's a people-oriented story, and even the Great Fire of London and the Great Plague become minor incidents in the life of Jeremiah Mount, the hard luck acquaintance and erstwhile friend of Mr. Pepys. Everything is well told, from life in the underbelly of London to the steamy landscape of colonial Jamaica. You follow the life of Jem Mount with great interest and, even though you know he's not a very nice person, you always hope against hope that he does well in the end. To make such an unlikely person a character in which you have such interest is a triumph for the author, and a sign of extremely good writing skills.

This book is a perfect example of those who want to milk KISS fans for the money. There's no new story inside, no shocking truth, no new facts, even no new pictures. This book is more like a photo book, with giant pictures and little stories in between.

Its a tired album, lacking any spark whatsoever, and DOESN'T get better with repeated listens, in my humble opinion. Listen to Badmotorfinger or Superunknown, and then this. There really is no comparison. This is rehased, tired, limp. It seems the band were really struggling to come up with songs.

Check out 'Superunknown' instead and work from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite 'Garden album","review":"This is my favorite Soundgarden album. I admit that it is less grungy than Badmotofinger and Superunknown, but the psycadelic sound is wonderful. Also, in this album, Cornell really shows maturation as an artist. Both his lyrics and his vocals reach a higher level than they did on previous albums. Some songs are still relatively close to the traditional 'Garden sound, like my favorite song, Pretty Noose.

It has many good songs, including \\"Pretty Noose\\", \\"Blow up the Outside World\\", and \\"Ty Cobb\\". But many of the songs sound to similar and not individual, as they are on their other albums. It is a good CD though."},{"rating":"2","title":"way off","review":"Most of the reviews of all the Soundgarden CDs are way off. \\" metal that's cool to like.\\" No way! If you wanna hear metal, go get a Judas priest CD. I like Cds that start off good on the first song, and 'pretty noose' is great. \\"Alternative\\" is also a stupid word. They sound like a band who is just there to make rock music! 'Rock' to me means something loud that your parents won't like. When people hear the word 'rock' now, they just think of the Beatles. There is also a punk song on here unlike any other SG song I have ever heard: \\"Ty Cobb\\". It's one of those moshy songs that just want to make you say \\"Damn the Man!\\" I also love burden in my hand, blow up the outside world, boot camp and zero effect. I'm sure someone has already said this, but this is worth the money (most SG CDs are long, aren't they?) and so buy it and hit the repeat button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swan-song of one of the greatest bands in a long time...","review":"This record will always be compared and contrasted to its predessor, \\"Superunknown\\", maybe unfairly, perhaps inevitably. While not as consistent throughout, 'Upside' certainly has its moments...the opening salvo of 'Pretty Noose' reverberates and sets the tone for the rest of the album. Other notable moments--the Lennon-esque 'Blow Up..', 'Burden..', for obvious reasons, the tense 'Tighter and Tighter', and the closing track, which showed what direction the band might've gone in. Thats whats so frustrating about this LP is all the promise it showed of a band definetly going places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite","review":"I listen to this all of the time - it never leaves the CD changer. The bitterness of \\"Pretty Noose\\" and \\"Ty Cobb\\" are so apropos for my life lately. And maybe the cynicism is why this Cd made it so big! Get it if you don't have it - real, gritty Soundgarden at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best.","review":"What a great album and plenty of tracks too.This is their most satisfying album to listen to and much more varied in sound than \\"Superunkown\\" as good as that album is, this takes the cake.Very Cool, they've called it quits now and they knew when to go, and are a great band, unlike Pearl Jam who just don't know when to stop and since 1999 have put out dissapointmenting material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of grunge.","review":"I'm a huge fan of \\"Soundgarden\\", but I have to admit, this does take a few spins to get into, and it's also their only album that I often skip a few tracks on. Not to say anything here is bad, it's just not front to back flawless like some of their others. Of course besides those few weak points, \\"Down On The Upside\\" rocks like you would expect it to. It includes \\"Pretty Noose\\", \\"Blow Up The Outside World\\", and the excellent \\"Burden In My Hand\\". Other tracks that I love just as much would be the aggressive \\"No Attention\\", \\"Switch Opens\\", and the closer \\"Boot Camp\\". While some of their other albums were big parts punk, metal, and psychedelia, this one seems to be all of it together, and possibly the album they always wanted to make. Any real fan of the band should get this, whether as an import or used. Casual fans might just want to get \\"A-Sides\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down on the Upside","review":"This is the best of the old school grunge rock. With the new music considered 'rock' now intermingling with pop & I don't even know what to call it- I miss the 90's grunge & early 2000's alternative badly. Soundgarden is one of my favorite bands, Chris Cornell is my favorite singer/song writer of all time. This album was a little more mellow than their previous stuff, but great still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, encouraging, and enriching listening experience","review":"It is unfortunate that Paige Lagrone from Amazon.com gave such a poor review of this collection, because it DOES help the listener \\"feel the power\\" of God's love, strength and encouragement. Just as the other three collections live up to their titles, this one delivers what it promises - spiritual strength to go out be a testimony to the love of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best.","review":"I highly recommend this CD. I purchased this copy for a friend after having enjoyed listening to it. You will enjoy hearing these songs and and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading","review":"This book is a lot of fun to read. The information is, of course, dated, but the stories behind the scenes and the history of the Mickey Mouse Club are interesting. It was a story of an innocent time, and it was part of my growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I didn't like this book because the author really tore Disney down. Being a big Disney fan I didn't like that very much. This guy obviously didn't like the show. If you want good reading read The Official Mickey Mouse Club Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the power of relaxation","review":"I can't add much to the product description, but I can say that since I have been studying the principles of Systema, my outpower has increased greatly. Combining relaxation with timing and breathing has helped in a huge way. I suppose you may think that you already are relaxed, and maybe you are, but my guess is that you'll be able to do so even more if you study Systema's approach to movement and fighting.This tape is divided into two parts- one taught by Vladimir Vasiliev, the other by his teacher, Mikhail Ryabko. They have different emphases in their styles of teaching, but both have devistating effects.

Where as most books take away from his pictures with a crowded setup, this book gives his paintings all the credit they deserve. When I saw Chagall's paintings they made me all wet and excited, definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"just view the excerpt","review":"I encourage you to view the excerpt of this book; it will help you, more than any customer review, to see if this book is what you expect or imagine. In the excerpt, I found that chapter 2 starts with a bulleted list of items, without any introduction, any motivation, any explanation, nor comment, exactly like a table of contents. Next, using the same style (bulleted list or table of contents), \\"develops\\" each item of the bulleted list. I feel that this type of book would not give much help to write anything. To buy this book is like buying a power point presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple short text, good for 3's and 4's/","review":"For preschool teachers and parents who like books which address reality (and issues)this story subtly addresses the pro's and con's of a work-at-home parent. It also shows Mom working at he computer and Dad as an artist. Very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money on this book","review":"The book's content is inspirational but it provides no practical information. The author makes enormous claims of offering some secrets to establish wealth but ends up just rambling. Many of the book's chapters are just redundant. After reading the book I felt that I had been conned out of my money. It took about 2 hours to read the whole book and I could've spent the time better doing something else. The author wastes time going into detail explaining businesses of his that failed in the past. This book gives a good \\"pep talk\\" to get your motivated but if you're looking for actual secrets or guides to establishing wealth then you won't find it here.After reading the book I did some research on the author, Gerard Spinks. Although early in his career he made millions of dollars in a dotcom business, he later lost all of his money and was homeless just prior to writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow and to the point","review":"This CD represents the artist at his finest. The \\"Sanford and Son\\" theme is a real treat, and \\"Ai No Corrida\\" is still one of my all-time favorite songs.Quincy Jones has traveled a long and distinguished route in his business, and his accolades are well-earned.

I need the strap off for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"BH-700 is a good looking light weight headset.I've used it with many mobile phones & I've found that its performance is bad for the following reasons:-Range is about 2 meters (6 feet) only. Nokia claims 10 meters (60 feet).-Range goes down to 1 meter (3 feet) if not fully charged, and disconnects even if it were in your pocket-Continuously disconnects from the phone-Not comfortable fit.I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product; Well Worth IT","review":"I love Nokia products and so specifically looked for a Nokia Bluetooth to work with my Nokia N800. I was having trouble with the headphones that came with it when I use Skype. The BH-700 is amazing. There is a little static sometimes but overall it is great. The volume control is great. It fits very nicely into my ear, but my wife says it is too big for her. I read other reviews that said it would not go far but I set the N800 in the middle of a classroom I was cleaning and was able to walk the entire room without interuption. The best thing about it is that I can just turn it on and off and it automatically links to the N800. It is a great product, which I would recomend for any Nokia lover!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"After my first experience with a bluetooth headset, a Jabra BT500, i didn't use one for 2 years.

I had high hopes for this NOKIA product because I am big fan of NOKIA Phones. I was disappointed with the fit of the headset, I think it is made for people with big ear canal. The earbud does not fit securly in my small ear (with or without the loop). The bulk box product does not come with extra earbuds (I am not sure if complete box comes with it or not) and it such a bad fit that I had to get another one. It has a great sound quality but nothing out of the world. I bought Jabra BT8040 and it is the best fitting in-ear headset that I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it...","review":"I returned this a week after I got it. Although the sound quality was good, the ear bud was just too big, and got painful after a while ( I wear it constantly) or fell out a lot. The earloop was useless. I also did not like that the answer/end button was right on the other side of the ear bud, so when I would (inevitably ) go to readjust it, I would accidentally either call or hang up on someone.... I'm shopping now for something better.. too bad, I've always sworn by Nokia."},{"rating":"2","title":"most bluetooth headsets are junk. this one is AWESOME","review":"this thing is great. it could use a bigger power button, but other than that is is just perfect in every way. it has a fairly large in ear knob, which allows it to sit in the well outside the inner ear canal, so it doesn't get waxy or nasty but won't fall out even if the ear loop isn't used. sound for mic and ear is great, connection works perfect with my nokia 6126. the 6126 didn't work correctly with my moto h850, which i didn't like, and it was supposed to not be made to work with the nokia bh800. i guess they are upgrading what i thought was a simple standard in bluetooth. anyways this thing absolute perfection for my phone, get one unless you have a nokia that is supposed to be paired with a bh800 - check the nokia site to see what they recommend for your phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"It comes with proper cable so you can hook it directly to your motherboard.

I was really disappointed and then spent a lot of time and effort returning the product to PC Universe. They were accomodating only in the end but they gave me a hard time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG I love it. . .","review":"Don't be fooled by the picture. It isn't as 'clean' looking. I still give it five stars because it's awsome. I've had it for about four months now and I still love it. It's stayed completely together so I know it's durable. My only problem that if a headphone jack is too think it won't plug all the way in. For example, when I hook my iPod up to a tv to watch a show or movie I have to take it out of the case. Plus it won't fit in any dock with the case still on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best new music in a while...","review":"I would recommend buying any of Banhart's albums. You could debate which are better, but they are all so good it hardly matters. His music is original, sometime sounds poetic, silly, psychotic or all three. You could name any number of influences, but his work is really just it's own thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up. Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for. The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well. Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do. That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful. I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.So, the moral? If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet. I highly recommend \\"Cripple Crow\\", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, \\"The Black Babies\\", which is my personal favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"music?","review":"Is there someone who can explain me why we can call \\"this\\" music?

His record has to be some kind of inside joke, or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual. Sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but I want a bit more substance to my music. I found this record personally insulting because it's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with \\"strange and fantastic\\" lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it's 'unique' and that your uncool if you don't get 'it' (whatever 'it' is). If you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out Bright Eyes' \\"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning\\" or Damien Rice's \\"O\\" and steer clear of this insult to good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"...This guy is unreal !!!!","review":"Why the hell isn't this guy EVERYWHERE ?I've NEVER heard ANYONE play guitar like that !!He has the power and command of Stevie Ray, and the finesseof Clapton, the voice of KennyLoggins/Stevie Wonder, andthe writing of the very best of all of them !

Some are more shy (Parrotlets), some are more agressive (Love Birds), some can stand cold (Quakers) and some must be kept warmer with individual heaters or lights. Some are unreasonably sweet (Cockatiels) and some are little devils.Of course Athan might say she never met a companion bird that was a little devil.

The elastic strap is very sturdy and holds in drive in place. The additional mesh pouch is just the perfect size to hold the power cord. It's a little bit tight when I want to zip the pouch closed, but I prefer having it be a little tight than too loose where the drive and cord may go bumping around.

On line, it looks a lot like a Case Logic case I already own (that my second, identical hard drive is in) but the case that shipped was actually smaller and I had to return it. What was Case Logic thinking when they shrunk the case, and why did Amazon recommend this case to be paired with the Seagate Free Agent Go for Mac when it doesn't fit in the case? The photo of the inside of the case even features a hard drive that looks like the Seagate Free Agent! Thanks for wasting my time. From now on, I buy cases in person with my hard drives in hand.

I'm in a very dusty environment and the case seemed like a wise investment for the $100 HDD I would be using. They arrived seperately, case first then HDD second. I noticed after the HDD arrived that the case was too small for it. I have to admit I was pretty pissed that Amazon would advertise an accessory that wasn't compatible.

This seems counter intuitive to me, but alas, upon other recommendations, I discovered this case. Ultimately, I purchased this case due to size (it can accommodate either size of the WD hard drive), as well as it's formulation (hard back case vs. neoprene).

It has no foam or multiple layers, or anything to cushion the WD Passport Essential. I feel that if my WD fell (while in the case) it would not be protected. If there was some cushion inside, then possibly it would be far more protected and safe.

I found the correct track on the CD \\"Blessed Are...\\", which was the album that the song first appeared on in August, 1971. She recorded that song for the VANGUARD label, not A&M!

That's what I did many years ago and it has helped me become a more successful, prosperous and happy person! I know full well about all the recent publicity surrounding this philosophy but it is about making this world a better place to live and as you know, we could use that at this particular time in history. Enjoy satisfying your own curiosity, read this book and pass it along. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty but Decent","review":"Not exactly intuitive. User interface is pretty horrible. Takes some reading to understand all functions. Although the analog to digital conversion is impressive, it's difficult to use as a recording device. The mic on the thing is absolutely horrid, but when hooked up to self powered condenser it sounds darn good. I was disappointed that you can't see or control the level of the input for recording. One other down side is that it's not the most stable piece of equipment. I use it daily and about twice a week the thing freezes up on me and I have to resort to a hard restart (taking out the batterys for a min). Although their is a lot to be desired this is the only product on the market at it's price that gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleargh!!!!!!","review":"ok, heres the deal. as previously mentioned, the manual was written by a chinese orangutan. the software was a little tricky to get up and running, but i did it without that much difficulty.it worked great. for a few months anyway. something came up, causing it to shut itself off arter a few minutes. then, after i tried to download the firmware update, it died. Died! it has absolutely stopped turning on. i emailed the techsupport, but got an automated message telling me that THOUSANDS of other peolpe are also emailing them with problems. so, it says it could take around 72 hours for a reply.and who's going to reply? a baboon with mental retardation!?so, if it works, its good. if it doesnt, then it sucks.oh, yeah, i forgot. dont lose ANYTHING that comes with the product. you'll get charged for missing stuff, and you cant get a refund without a receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this! ! !","review":"This digital recorder worked good for one month.

I had been really impressed with the product until having to deal with Pogo Tech support regarding replacing the item. I was basically told I was a liar and the damage would only occur if the device was abused. I was talked down to, demeaned and they refused to budge on a $15 repair charge. I do not recommend purchasing a product from Pogo unless you consider it a disposable product, not an investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The features on this product are very intriguing.

This book, however, deals with a group of people who pay big money for high tech induction sessions that take them back in great detail to times in their own youth and childhood.Mike, the protagonist, begins these sessions with the aim of mining old memories for monetary gain. We join him in his journey to the past, and also in his present-time encounters with the mixed-up characters who run the facility and the lost souls who are fellow clients delving into their memories.Not an easy book to put down before the last page, Dreamer will take you through a range of emotions.

Admittedly, there are a few clunkers on this former 2 record set. But most of the album just soars with great vocals, horns, rhythm and Johnny Otis on the vibes. It is worth the price alone just to hear Esther Phillips sing Cry Me A River Blues -- which I believe is quite possibly the best 3-4 minutes of music on any CD anywhere anytime!! Johnny Otis assembled an all star review that is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willie and the Hand Jive","review":"One of my favorite albums that my husband Ray brought home from the pawn shop back in the early 70's.

Rachel has a wonderful voice and she does a great job of not letting the powerful music overpower it.

I saw three physicians to determine the nature of the allergic reaction, ended up on prednisone for 9 days, and I have since returned the remaining androgaphis bottles I had purchased.

Also, not much is written about late stage lyme.I really don't care to know where an herb came from or how it is harvested, I just want to know what works and how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Any Footnotes or Transparency for All Statistics, Claims, and Referrences","review":"I found this book very troublesome. The book presents itself as a technical and thoroughly researched guide to healing Lyme- and nearly every page is filled with statistics that claim to be derived from clinical trials - however, absolutely none of the clinical trials are sourced, making it impossible to fact check. I find this lack of transparency highly problematic. If you quote statistics from clinical trials, you should include a footnote so that readers can see what study that information was derived from. This book presents itself as very technical (and is very difficult to follow); it is packed with statistics and claims, and absolutely none of them are sourced. To me, this suggests that there is actually no clinical evidence to back up any of the claims made by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review","review":"This book is too much for professionals ...I will return it.

The artist uses color in a very flashy dramatic style while capturing the feeling of the animals he is depicting.

I can handle the \\"wicked people\\" mentioned by others although I wonder what my little guy thinks. The thing that drives me nuts is the fact that the redemptive rainbow at the end of the story, which means God will not do this again, is missing! A good book for learning about animals, but not for learning about God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hierloom quality, to be passed down through the generations.","review":"I was introduced to this wonderful book a few years ago by our pastor. I was awestruck by the wonderful illustrations. The text is very interesting and thought provoking, leading me to an even deeper amazement of God's incredible creation.

I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT book for your toddler!","review":"I highly recommend books by Lucy Cousins - especially this one.

It's a wonderful version of Noah's Ark. The animals are so distinct and cool to look at, with lots included you don't usually see, like snakes, worms, butterflies, etc! My version had great endpapers full of many of the animals that were on the ark, and my daughter can spend long periods of time just looking at those. The story is very simple and easy to understand, but doesn't leave out the basic point of the people on earth being evil---not that I want to emphasize that point to a toddler, but the whole tale doesn't make a lot of sense when you read versions that don't say WHY God is flooding the earth! Just a terrific book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda scary for little ones","review":"And I quote, \\"There were also many wicked people in the world. God wanted to punish the wicked people, so he said to Noah...\\"I shall make a flood of water and wash all the wicked people away.\\"Not exactly the last thought I want my son to have before drifting off to sleep.

Nice illustrations though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations","review":"This book was the text for one of my introductory Bible classes in college, and I was not expecting much from it. However, I can say that it is an extraordinary book that I plan to keep for years to come. Plantinga tells the story of creation, the fall, redemption, consummation, and Christian vocation in a straightforward, intriguing manor for young and old audiences alike.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the 5 Points","review":"If you are looking to delve past the 5 points of Calvinism and into the worldview that Reformed theology teaches, this book is a great help! Plantinga communicates clearly, conveying simple yet profound truths that are overlooked or simply ignored in many Christian circles and, sadly, churches. This book was very helpful to me in understanding the story arc of the Bible as well as the concept of all things being redeemed. Reformed Theology truly is more than 5 points, and this book attests to the beauty, profundity, and hope that exist in the story of redemption that God is bringing to pass.I highly recommend this book to those wanting to get a better understanding of the \\"big picture\\" of the Bible, as well as those who want a broader understanding of Reformed Theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meat and potatoes","review":"This book is a clear, simple, relatively uncontroversial exposition of basic Biblical theology. It is quite well-written, with extensive references to other influential Christian books (i.e. from C.S. Lewis, John Calvin, Nicholas Wolterstorff, etc.). The author has a pleasant style, combining intellectual rigor with clarity of exposition as well as deep conviction. It was nice to review what I already knew as well as remember some things that I had forgotten. It also nicely shows, in my opinion, how well the Christian faith stands up without an insistence on hyper-literalism in reading the Bible. The basics of the Christian worldview (Creation, Fall, Redemption) all survive intact even if the book of Ruth is a pastoral novella and the Flood didn't really happen. All in all a very good book, a precious resource for Christian college students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I have not finished the book yet, but I have gotten well into it and overviewed the whole thing. It is an excellent explanation of the basic themes of the Bible: creation, the fall, redemption. Very encouraging practically and theologically sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Broad","review":"I did not like this book very much, and felt that it was simply a re-statement of what the Church has been telling Christians. It was too similar to many of the Christian books that I have read, and there wasn't very much that really seemed to make a difference upon my life. Being a student at a small Christian college myself, my peers and I were unimpressed by the material and I did not personally feel as if I learned from it. The book is culturally relevant, though, and has few good points in the concluding chapter, which was my favorite of the five. If you would like an invigorating read, try a work of Andrew Murray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. It is a small leaflet stapled in the middle.

This is a crappy approach which allows \\"novices\\" of Nazareth's fans to get easily disappointed. I have composed 3 (!) my own \\"greatest hits\\" CDs from Nazareth tunes... It seems the producers were not familiar with Nazareth's 30-year efforts at all. Only tunes 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15 and maybe 18 may present Nazareth as one of the best groups in 70's thru 90's.

These are the little ones that fit right on a little cracker. Yum!They're also not the easiest to find in stores, and since sardines tend to be seasonal, you can't get them any time you want during the year.I enjoyed these little cross packed sardines and will likely buy them again.

That's the case here, with Thornel Schwartz on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. Smith is among the most playful of jazz artists and two tunes (I COVER THE WATERFRONT and MOSTLY MONKISH) feature this side of Jimmy wonderfully. WATERFRONT sounds like a completely different tune as Jimmy fools around with it, and MONKISH is definitely that, though with Smith playing with tongue very much in cheek. FIDDLIN' THE MINORS finds Jimmy almost on fire as he works his way through the riff tune, and I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE has a solid medium groove going in it. Perhaps it's just my ears but the Hammond organ would gain a warmer less buzzing-bee sound in just a few years after these 1956 recordings were made.

They provided no relevant or reasonable explanation and could not explain how the wrong content was delivered - twice. I eventually got a refund, however I am now very suspect of the Amazon Instant Video service, and frankly have little confidence in their ability to manage the system.

Soon other stations are begging for her to sign on so they can air the show, all the while Kitty is trying to figure out who has it out for her, or it's curtains for her.I found the story to be pretty interesting, it was different from what I have read as far as vampire, werewolf and other supernatural elements go. There are a few things I disliked about the book, such as the description she uses when talking about the wolf.But other then that, it was really good. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good supernatural story unless you are a little sensitive to rape. There is a small scene in the book, that may make some readers uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read lots of reviews before you buy this book","review":"Poor example of the genre. the book is chock full of werewolves and vampires, but characters are cliche and shallow. The plot and setting were so full of holes that I couldnt suspend my disbelief enough to just enjoy it as a junk food read. I really regret paying for this book. Check out the Mercede Thompson series instead for werewolves, or Robin McKinleys Sunshine for some vampires."},{"rating":"2","title":"werewolves and vampires, interesting...","review":"KITTY AND THE MIDNIGHT HOUR is the first of the Kitty Norville series of books. Kitty is a late night disc jockey who is also a werewolf. This is what intrigued me about the story. There are so many vampire books out there, and not enough werewolf stories. But guess what, this has vampires also. Neither group likes the publicity that Kitty brings, and hence the story. Some of the characters that call in are just plain silly, but fun. There is a lot of character development that needs to be explored and I am sure they will in the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I just finished \\"Midnight Hour\\" in one sitting, and can recommend it to anyone looking for a fast, mostly lighthearted read with a likable, human (mostly) heroine. I can see the beginning of a fun series here and can only hope that, unlike Anita Blake, Kitty can keep her humanity. This series could stay mostly light and enjoyable, or could get gratuitiously dark really quickly. I intend to read the sequel as soon as it comes out.Thank you Carrie for a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really liked the premise of this book but the more I read, the less I liked Kitty. She was a victim pretty much throughout the book. She has a few stand up moments but ultimately she whines and someone else saves her or handles clean up. I know that the author was trying to show her making a transition from a victom to a strong empowered person but she fell short. In the end, Kitty just ran away in my opinion. She had not evolved very much. I really do not care to read another book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty? What a Name for a Werewolf!","review":"I can not remember who recommended this series. I think it was someone on \\"Novel Ladies.\\" I am fond of paranormal, fantasy and series and this covers all the bases.Kitty is a werewolf. What a name for a werewolf, right? She is a talk radio DJ and one night, she gets a call that changes everything for her. She begins an advice show for the paranormal: werewolves, vampires, etc. The powers that be don't like it and try to get her to stop but she does not. Kitty goes from being the most submissive of wolves to damned near alpha.I didn't care much for the representation of werewolves and vampires but I am quite curious as to how this will evolve over the series. The next is \\"Kitty Goes to Washington,\\" followed by \\"Kitty Takes a Holiday\\" and the, so-far-last \\"Kitty and the Silver Bullet.\\" It's a good thing I read fast with all these series that I now Must Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty is here and she rocks!","review":"The book was great.

Kitty is a great character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"The story was slow moving & I wasn't crazy about Kitty. The plot was predictable, the characters were shallow, & I just wasn't left with the desire to read Kitty's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was glad I borrowed from the library and didn't waste my money. None of the characters except Kitty even had a last name. This tells me that the author didn't invest much in the characters she created. You had to read well over half of the book before you found out why Kitty was such \\"whiner\\". Not sure if I'll attempt to read another from the series, but if I do, I'll make sure I check it out at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read...","review":"I was introduced to this series when I took advantage of a two-for-one Kindle offer. I like the first three books in the series best because they seem more character-focused than the last three, and had more tension/excitement. They're all fast-paced, with interesting dilemmas and plots, and I enjoyed the world the author built (urban fantasy is still relatively new to me). If you like this one, you'll also enjoy Patricia Brigg's Mercy Thompson series (also urban fantasy). I enjoyed it more than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another tiresome paranormal","review":"I keep trying every new paranormal hoping to run into a story with teeth and substance. Instead I keep running into chick lit with a non human character thrown in. Instead of a strong book with strong characters I keep finding books with misunderstood, put upon heroines. I couldn't even get past the first few chapters. Borrow this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light fun supernatural read","review":"I started on this series expecting a sort of typical dark supernatural vamp werewolf type world and was a bit surprised to find it didn't really even take it's darker elements completely seriously. Instead of being disappointed as I would have expected however I found I very much liked the way it played out. Kitty's inner monologue never ceased to amuse me.By the middle of the book I knew I was hooked and got the next three just to be ready. I rate 4 instead of 5 simply because it was such a quick light read, I would have liked there to be a little more but would definitely still recommend it highly as it's a lot of fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kitty","review":"I enjoyed the character development and story line.

The stories are interesting, the people he meets are so special, and the places are not to be missed. I'm glad I have the opportunity to read them again. I had missed a couple, so I've received these too. I ordered all of them on Amazon, got some used, and some new. And in fact I didn't think I had any in my bookshelf, but I did have The Untamed Coast, so now I have 2 of that book.

I still love her music though, and this album's modern sultry with little jazz influence is really fun to me. Sultry without jazz does not come often, and she's really got something special here. Her fans love it, but her non-fans might not understand it.For those of us who like music on a higher level, I'm sure you will enjoy this. Beware boy band lovers, and those just looking for remixes of Tom's Dinner, because they do not appear here.Caramel is definitely a 5 star song, just awesome. And seeing her perform this one in concert was a real treat (no pun intended).Buy this Vega fans, female jazz vocal lovers, and mellow music lovers; you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album that you'll never tire of!","review":"I first heard this album during a college trip a year ago, and since then I've probably listened to it over 50 times.

I can't wait for a new album from her..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from beginning to end","review":"In Nine Objects of Desire Suzanne Vega is a songwriter on the very top of her game. Intelligent songwriting is a quantity in very short supply these days and Vega makes it look easy, with each song telling a different story. One would think that the music might suffer when so much attention has been paid to the lyrics, but this is not the case, musically each song is very well crafted. Many of the songs have a haunting or spooky quality to them, perhaps most exemplified by \\"Headshots,\\" which probably got the most radio airplay, but they are all very evocative. \\"Nine Objects...\\" is what every album should be like, no clinkers among the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to rain on others' parade...","review":"but despite adjectives like \\"unique,\\" this is BY FAR Vega's most convention (and boring) work.

A nice premise falls flat when the lead character proves himself to be an idealistic wimp. Some of the supporting characters are well played, notably the two major female figures, Frida Hallgren and Helen Sjöholm as Lena and Gabriella. In typical fashion for a post-1960s film, the church is portrayed as corrupt and hypocritical, causing me to wonder anew whether there are any screenwriters or directors out there with a spiritual backbone. The so-called climax of the movie is laughably unconvincing, when an entire audience is won over by a motley choir voicing nonsense syllables on stage. (This ranks right down there with the ridiculous town hall meeting in \\"Field of Dreams\\" for shallow audience manipulation.) Don't bother with this promising flop. It does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I endured about 30 minutes of this corny, cliched forced tripe.

The English subtitles are whisked away so quickly from the screen that although I am not a slow reader, still at times I did not even get half of the written text, let alone had a chance to even glance at the acting.

It explores such heavy and difficult topics as partner abuse, infidelity, sexuality, religion, love and many many more. The range of emotions explored is wide and the topics are carefully and deeply explored. The characters are believable and more ...

The density, complexity and decency in the treatment of the different characters are also remarkable. Just run to see this extraordinary film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"The plot is predictable, and the film maker exploits every cliche and stereotype about those who experience trauma in their lives. It's simply too much for one movie, and it does not leave much to the viewer's imagination. There is little left to wonder about after the story is told. Perhaps one could be captivated by the relationship of this or that character to another, but for the most part, the characters are too thoroughly explained. The music, however, is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives.

Most of the content is simply video of group lessons where a class of teenage students go through various drills. This is the kind of thing you can watch at your local tennis facility for free. There is little discussion of technique and in fact there is little discussion at all. There are a few chapters where Jimmy and one of his guest stars discuss an aspect of the game, but these are very light in content and really don't justify the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Tease","review":"This is a very good overview of the sport. Although it is hosted by Jimmy Connors, there are many different points of view presented at various skill levels. The instruction covers almost all aspects of the game, however, it leaves you wanting and needing more detail in each area.

I did like the main character, until she decided to change her morals. The leading man was ok, he just thought with the wrong end.

They also figure out there's been a series of misunderstandings that have kept them apart. They clear that up and, we hope go on to live happily ever after. I really liked this story. Initially I gave it four stars. After removing my own bias of too much time being spent on what the characters were thinking, I gave it the five stars it deserves. The story was written during a time when we the readers were more contemplative about who our characters were and what made them tick. Nowadays, we want to figure that out based on the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wat ik even kwijt wou","review":"Ik zou zo graag dit boek eens lezen en ik denk dat als ik het zou lezen ik het boek toch wel een volle 4 sterren zou geven.

This work is a standard reference in the field. The presentation of most material is very terse, but that is great if you already have a good feel for the material and need to look up some details about some algorithm or technique. There isn't much about neural networks here, but for the rest of the pattern recognition techniques, this is almost always the first place to start. Another strong point for this book is the use of realistic examples, which illustrate many of the statistical techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard reference and a classic text but with flaws","review":"I do not like to consult this book for the following, quite superficial reason.

I was not disappointed; I have since purchased my own copy for reference in my food writing. The book is erudite, of course, but delightfully so. The origins of many of our food terms may indeed be obscure, but now that I have feasted on this little masterpiece, I no longer feel comfortable eating things with titles I cannot explain. Martha Barnette does go off on tangents that some may find vexing, explaining word relations that only begin with cuisine, but in doing so she adds richness to the stew. Both food and language are quintessentially civilizing; she's melded the two into an important book for any culinary or literary shelf.Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at www.stylegourmet.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but could be improved with food photos.","review":"I enjoyed this romp through gastronomic etymology. But the publisher should have printed in a more readable type-face, included pictures of the foods discussed, and edited out some of the redundancies.

Obviously I needed that specific drive, and so I decided to accept the damaged drive as the parts that I needed were intact.

If and when such a day comes to pass, this book will have a role to play. Until then, engineers, physicists and mathematicians alike have better alternatives, such as the inspiring texts, with complementary qualities, by Burke, \\"Applied Differential Geometry\\"; by do Carmo, \\"Riemannian Geometry\\", or by Spivak, \\"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry\\".Even more advanced books such as Lang's or Petersen's are more readable: in them the extra formalism brings the reward of more powerful results. Here the retentive attention to the trees at the expense of the forest is merely a barrier to entry for the uninitiated.

As I said before, this CD has lots of energetic songs and can be listened to over and over again. Maybe it's true that most of the songs sound similar and that Crow is not that convincing as a singer with a message, but this CD is fun and that's what counts the most!

This does not reflect this album's musical merit or its longevity as an artistic highpoint in her career. Here are some of Sheryl Crow's rawest, best musical expressions - think the \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" album. Most know \\"Every Day Is A Winding Road\\" and \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" but it's the tracks like \\"Oh Marie\\" and the very Beatles-esque \\"Home\\" (with very Harrison-ish guitar) that are the real gems. In my opinion, she has yet to match this release for consistently 'great' tracks throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sheryl Crow Album","review":"I'm in love with Sheryl Crow... not in a creepy stalker way but in that there is no substitute for her music.

I hope she wins some more awards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funning, Grooving, and Bopping Ecstacy","review":"Not like I really know what ecstacy is supposed to be anyways, but this album certainly puts you in the euphoric mood where you wouldn't care! 'Change' is a sure moodlifter and 'Home' is perfect as its complement to inject a little reality into life. Playfullness parried with harsh realities is the best way to described Sheryl Crow. Every coin has two sides and music that shows just one of those sides doesn't fit into the scheme of things. Sheryl's music definitely fits and she's set for a bright future.I wouldn't necessarily call the album grittier or poetry. Its definitely no concept album and the cuts don't relate much to each other except in style. The songs are meant to individually take you on a ride - and when the album's done you wanna get back in line and do it over again!May take a while to grow on you - since her style is unique. The good part is that its enjoyment is not short-lived; I've been enjoying it for a year now.Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland!","review":"This is the most overrated album I've ever heard.

So I took that off, and read the instructions to \\"clamp\\" the needle in. Did that - while I was tightening the needle clamp, the cheap plastic clamp cracked! I wasn't exerting much force. I didn't notice the crack until I began sewing with the 2nd needle they give you, and then it got jammed again! Since the needle wasn't broken, I don't think there is a way to get the needle out, that is stuck in the bottom bobbin, other than to break it. So I broke it, and have a broken needle clamp as well. Any suggestions to get a replacement part for this thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this product","review":"I have two scouts in the family and I don't sew. I thought that buying this inexpensive \\"sewing center\\" would save me a few dollars or finger pricks by letting me easily sew on my children's patches.I was dead wrong. I think the model I got is missing a piece because the thread bunches up from the bobbin underneath and the machine freezes up after less than an inch of sewing. I have followed directions in threading the machine, but when I look at the photo of the bobbin case there seems to be a bit of metal that my machine does not have.I am so disappointed and am just going to have to throw this little time waster away. I could have sewed on several patches by hand in the amount of time I have spent trying to get it to work today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for Troubled Times","review":"Father Dave Heney has written a great book for difficult times. It is a bridge over troubled waters. Catholics will get the most out of it for it clarifies with clear and apt examples helping them understand the conflicts. However all people of faith will profit from reading it because it gives clear guide lines to help us understand important moral issues. Personally I appreciated his starting with his cards on the table. Morality consists of Equality, Freedom,Goodness,and finally Service to others. The author says, \\"Most likely, we will never be sinless or perfect in our life but we can atleast be honest about it.\\" The book's great virtue, to cover all the moral dilemmas, may be its biggest fault no one including the reviewer will agree totally with his take on each issue.

If, like me, you find the whole idea of intercessory prayer to be unbiblical, then you are going to have significant issues with this book.And then, on page 373, we find a poem by Fanny Crosby which makes reference to the rapture. Again, if you regard the rapture as being cultish and unbiblical (which I do), then you are going to have a problem.Sadly, there is no mention on the book's jacket about who exactly this book is meant for. To say that it is for all Christians is simply dishonest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for guided daily prayer.","review":"I received this book the other day (just in time for February).

I asked how many of these die like mine did and they said 5%! They also refused to give me a refund and I'm not sure if I want to wait a few weeks to get another one that may die also. Amazon customer service was a little more helpful, they agreed to send me a new one right away and gave me 30 days to return the bad one.

I returned the item to amazon which promply shipped me another recondioned juicer. THis time i didnt have to open i could see the same chip in the same spot as last time. I beleive it has to be a design flaw or maybe the way the machine is packaged for shipment puts to much pressure on this piece.

She uses it a few more times, no problem. It sits for about a year and the first time she goes to use it again, boom--motor dies. Breville tech support is no help. No troubleshooting guides online.

I'm guessing it's the fuse (seeing that's what everyone else w/this model is having a problem with). I'm in the process of repairing it, but I'll have to take it to a small appliance shop to get it fixed, which is going to cost me about $40. Considering how much I paid for the machine you think they would hire someone to tell them you shouldn't put an 8amp fuse on a 850watt machine...duh! I'll be replacing mine with a 10amp fuse & hoping for the best.I agree w/other users- why in the world would they souder the stinking fuse in instead of putting a fuse holder in- that would make the repair SO SO SO much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breville JE95XL Two-speed Fountain Plus","review":"This juicer works great!

She hated the 200XL - noisy, difficult to clean, jumps when you turn it on, spills the juice... It was so bad the we even had a fight over it one time - it was so noisy that I bitched her out for waking me up with it - the only time I can say that we fought over an appliance. Well this model seems much, much better. Even on the high speed it is significantly quieter. Soft start keeps it from jumping when you turn it on. It is easier to clean. The mouth is wider so you can feed larger items in. Overall a nice improvement over the 200XL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good juicer, better support","review":"Before I bought this juicer I read on this forum that Breville support sucked. When my juicer arrived damaged (the spout was broken off), I absolved that I would need to return it to Amazon. However, I decided to throw caution in the wind and try to contact Breville. I got someone on the second ring, she was polite and helpful - all she needed was my address and product number and she shipped the part out to me the next day. That's what I call service!As for the blender, I've tried it and it works really well - so much better than the champion juicer I had before.

I got one glass of juice from it that was delicious. I was psyched. I purchased a whole fridge full of veggies. The juicer died on the second glass of juice. This led to a series of about 10 emails with Breville. They have this poor woman who answers you with phrases obviously written by the PR department about your \\"quality\\" juicer. It was obvious from their response that the motor dying is a constant problem. They would not refund; they said they would replace it with a new one. The only thing that saved me from having paid $120 for two glasses of juice was that Amazon refunded. Thank God for Amazon. Even so, what a hassle.

Juice didn't make much foams, and I liked that.One thing I didn't like was that I had cut my apples for juicing. The apple I used was just regular size apple. It was not big at all. But still, I had to cut for fitting them in that juicer.So, \\"juices Apple whole!\\" is not true... Sorry, Breville.overall, this juicer is good to buy.

By appearances, the juicer operates well on low and high speeds. However, I need to strain the pulp each time to get a reasonable amount of juice. Typically, I increase the amount of juice by 50% by running the pulp through a strainer. Even on low speed, the juicer produces massive amounts of froth and wet pulp, with relatively little juice.The froth separator does a poor job of separating the froth so once again, I end up straining the juice.

Every track is edited to its shortest version possible. The album is useless for all those DJ's probably wanting to include some italo disco classics on their sets. Even for the ordinary listener and for those who want to get a snapshot of 80's eurobeat this album could be really disappointing because of the absolute merciless editing. Some of the songs here were entirely created for the club and DJ scene, so never had a real radio version. Probably, the editing here is even worse than radio editing.Instead of this I recommend the \\"World Of Italo Dance\\" compilation by ZYX Records and, even better, the huge \\"I love disco\\" series by the Spanish label Blanco Y Negro, which features complete and 12\\" extended versions.Here you have some examples of cruel editing:P.

In the past, he has worked with The Rembrandts, Patty Griffin, Paul Simon, John Mellencamp, and Ani DiFranco. Loteria de la Cumbia Lounge gets its title from Ramos' studio. \\"Cumbia\\" is a popular, accordian-heavy music from Columbia, cheery ans sometimes cheesy music of the peasants. This is a mellow Latin martini, combining danceable urban grooves with an occasional nod at borderline kitsch with a twist of grit and traditional Latin instruments. From the intriguing Latin pop of \\"El Indio\\" and \\"Mexicanos\\" to the mid-tempo instrumentals which recall Sergio Mendez or Esquivel (\\"Romanticos Desperados,\\" \\"Volcanico\\"). Multi-instrumental Ramos performs some of the album himself, inviting guest musicians like Brian Standefer and Russell Scanlon to add to the remainder of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm & Cozy","review":"This was an impulse buy after I caught a review on NPR. Some impulse buys pan out, some don't. Luckily, this one did. I teach English at a continuation high school.

The music is a different direction than traditional artists. Pyre of Fire comes through as with alot of emotion and energy to it. Aftermath plays with a theme of the Phoenix rising from the ashes. All of the songs have good energy, beat and transitional layers prominent in the genre of trance/electronica. Although you can not compare this to Blue Planet, Doof or Sasha (yet..), this is fresh and bold from a talented artist. Looking forward to continued works and the tour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the stories, not this","review":"This novel is a disappointment to many Ron Carlson fans. I've read his two most recent novels--not the newest due out this next week--and all the short stories. This novel feels under-imagined and over-scripted--as if someone who knew perfectly well how to write twenty pages were trying desperately to stretch it to two hundred. It's not a terrible novel, but he's a better writer than this. Though I usually prefer a novel over short stories, I love Carlson's stories more than almost any novel I can think of. They are funny, aching, and explosive with insight about the human heart. Read The New Yorker review excerpt above and then go read Carlson's brilliant short stories. A Kind of Flying is a good place to start, but also be sure to read At the Jim Bridger, which I've handed out like candy to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving book with memorable characters","review":"While these characters build the ramp on the edge of the river gorge they get to know one another and as they relax their stories emerge.

Your music will keep you alive with us forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice is still smooth as silk","review":"While Richard Carpenter took time off from working on music, Karen Carpenter decided to record an album without her brother. The songs here vary from disco-ish to ballads. Some reminiscent of teh songs she recorded with Richard and others were a completely opposite of what she was sued to recording. Karen shines through it all!This could be her \\"adult\\" album. None of the schmaltzy songs that she had recorded before. She stretches her horizons on this CD. I love it! One of my favorites.My most favorite song is MY BODY KEEPS CHANGING MY MIND. The vocal arrangements are incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work!","review":"With her solo album Karen Carpenter put together a gem. Every song on the album is top notch and she sings with a renewed excitement. Phil Ramone, Bob James, Rod Temperton and the other producers and arrangers did an excellent job in creating arrangements which suited Karen's voice and personality perfectly. This album has soul and a bit of funk to it. I just love it!My favorite tracks are:Guess I Just Lost My HeadIf I Had youRemember When Lovin' Took all NightIf We TryLovelinesMake Believe It's Your First TimeThe only song I don't care for is \\"My Body Keeps Changing My Mind\\".I just wish Karen would have lived long enough to record another solo album as her first solo was outstanding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Never Been Released","review":"This is no where near the caliber of Karen's previous releases. Richard, Herb Alpert and A&M were right. I bought this CD because of my memory of Karen's beautifully clear vocals. I was extremely disappointed with this effort. Totally uninspired recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"Karen carpenter's solo album can best be described as a wacky,directionless recording session. No one can honestly say that this is a good album.-and that is the basic reason it wasn't released in 1980.This album tries to pass karen off as a top 40 pop-rock singer and she's NOT a top 40 pop-rock singer.Karen Carpenter is a torch singer-and this should have been the album that solidified her standing in the jazz world.(next to her peers Ella Fitzgerald and Rosemary Clooney).The material on this album is very weak,her vocals are too high on several songs and the overall production is poor.(although I admit \\"if we try\\" is a good track-minus the rousing horn solos).What amazes me is that a horrible album like this was recorded right after a masterpiece like CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karen needs Richard","review":"We must hand it to Karen for wanting to break musically from Richard in 1979, but this album proves that the group was at their best when they were collaborating. Most of the songs are lost in the shuffle, and the disco ones are plain horrible. The best songs are \\"If I Had You\\", \\"Still Crazy after All These Years\\" and \\"Make Believe It's Your First Time.\\" Most of the others are average or substandard. \\"Still in Love with You\\" is catchy, but the music doesn't match Karen's voice. The whole album seems like she's trying to hard to sound good with the music. It's a little too contrived. Good experiment Karen. With your voice, I'd be creative too, even if it didn't work in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Karen, but no the Carpenters sound, crappy CD","review":"I am a Huge Carpenters fan, but this CD is a real disappointment, even Herb Alphert of A&M; had to reject it and it layed dormat for 13 years.It's Karen alright, but ver vocals are not used to the max, the songs just dont have that magic as most Carpenter CD's do.If your a huge fan, buy it for your collection, otherwise there is not a whole lot to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karen Carpenter Goes in a New Direction","review":"After listening to this album several times and accepting that this is Karen Carpenter performing material which is quite unlike her usual fare, I have come to really like this album. She sings in a higher register, and the arrangements are much lighter and more jazz oriented. There is even a disco number, \\"My Body Keeps Changing My Mind,\\" which is great listening for my power walking. The songs have a definite sexual edge, which, I suspect, is one of the reasons that the album was not initially released. I'm sorry that it was not released during Karen's lifetime, because it probably would have been successful and given a boost to her career. If you are a Karen Carpenter fan, I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different listening experience.","review":"Anyone who truly loves the Carpenters will notice right away that this is a different sound. It is the record of Karen's journey into a new kind of singing and a new kind of song. I did think that many of the selections sounded alike, and in that I was disappointed. But I am never disappointed in Karen's singing, and regardless of the selection, she sounds great. I have to admit that I miss some of the recording sounds that have come to be characteristic of the Carpenters together. But I am never unhappy at another opportunity to hear Karen, her magnificent voice, her wonderful control musically, the rich timbre of her voice, her ability to phrase the words so that they make sense to the listener. This is a new listening experience for the Karen Carpenter fan, but it is worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, soulful and at times shiveringly wonderful","review":"For a lover of choirmusic - this album is a pearl!

The book wastes entire pages on goofball quotes that have little or no relevance to tracking.

His work is mostly a rehash of college history 101. Indian Removal/genocide was certainly part of the dark side of American history...as if American is the only country with historical baggage. Most foreigners, however, have only a vague appreciation of it. And, like all self-respecting critics of American society, Hertsgaard joins the MacMovement. Enough is enough: if you don't like McDonald's, well, don't GO there! On the whole, he could easily condense this 200-plus-page effort by focusing more on really important issues like American hypocrisy on trade/aggy issues and, something he glosses over, American military presence in the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of my List","review":"As an author myself, I recommend that you purchase this book for personal study. \\"The Eagle's Shadow\\" is an informational packet that steered me more into the realization of American Euro centric cultural perceptions of right and wrong.

Unfortunately, Mr. Hertsgaard chose to re-hash 40 years of liberal criticisms of our foreign policy, consumerism, corporations, bureaucrats, media, television, and the biggest evil of all...capitalism. What I learned is America is disliked because we are rich and arrogant and the solution to all these problems is to turn off the T.V. and start talking to each other, but more importantly, Mr. Hertsgaard states that the reforms necessary to solve our ills and improve our appearance in the eyes of the rest of the world are beyond the scope of his book. Perhaps I should have titled my review \\"Gargage in....nothing out\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as billed","review":"Mr. Hertsgaard is a good writer, but his title is misleading. He spends little time talking about how America is viewed by the rest of the world. He begins each chapter with a few words along those lines, then trails off into a long exposition of his personal political beliefs which are left of the left wing.

I read it but am still largely in the dark as to how America is viewed by the rest of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains Almost Nothing About What Foreigners Think","review":"This book devotes only a few pages to recounting meetings with just a few individuals overseas. Almost all of the book's 200+ pages are devoted to an unexceptional exposition of the author's opinions. The book sometimes implies, without providing any support, that these opinions are representative of what foreigners think of America, but usually not even that effort is made to connect the author's opinions with the alleged theme of the book.If you are an American who keeps up with the news, you have already heard what the author has to say. If you are a liberal you might even agree with it. If you are not, you will find this book especially tedious. Hertsgaard is preaching to the choir and seems to assume that you will believe whatever he says. Whatever your political view, you will not find any fresh insights in this book.I can recommend to all that they skip \\"The Eagle's Shadow.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK I EVER FINISHED","review":"What a sucker job.

Kind of like watching a movie that is so bad its actually good. Oh yea...and I'm suppose to feel stupid because I did not know what the HARLEM RENNAISSANCE was in U.S. History.

However, I have been to the U.S. and I find it amazing that this book is able to confront the same issues, which I found interesting and disturbing. The ones who ranked this book with only a limited number of stars, are primarily from the States. However, the book is indeed illustrating how I view the U.S. and perhaps it is because I view you from a distance, that I'm able to recognize many things in the book. Therefore Europeans will probably laugh and feel a bit sad when reading this book, but that is what makes it so good!! Nevertheless, Americans seem to have a different view upon it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Mark.","review":"As a US citizen who has for the past decade or so spent half of each year living in Denmark, I am grateful to Mark Hertsgaard for this guide to our national myopia. Without failing to mention the many positive aspects of the American experiment, Hertsgaard shows the reader what many throughout the world are really thinking about us and our self-centered national policiies. Sharing the experiences of his wide ranging travels, the author brings a wealth of background knowledge to bear on several of our important problems, pulling no punches. This is a book that should be read by all Americans who would see our native land move closer to its ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Hertsgaard: An Exceptional Journalist","review":"This book takes a much punditized subject and addresses it with the intelligence and depth so lacking in media pundits today.

Agree or disagree with Hertsgaard's insights, this book is well worth reading for people interested in the subject.And I'd also highly recommend his \\"On Bended Knee\\" -a truly great book about the nature of journalism-- written in the days of Ronald Reagan, that great teflon communicator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here.","review":"Thank God I didn't buy this book, but sat and read part of it (enough of it) in the bookstore.

In the last several years, I've sort of lost interest in this band. However 'Warszawa' proves that Porcupine Tree still has some life to go. A nice pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording with the best of three worlds !","review":"Porcupine Tree is one of the finest bands around and this cd, recorded during the Lightbulb Sun tour, delivers in a big way. First off the material for the recording was culled from a Polish radio broadcast with a specially invited studio audience and features the bulk of the \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" cd (recently re-released in a gorgeous remastered form/5.1 surround) as well as tracks from \\"Stupid Dream\\" and \\"Signify\\", for me three of their better recordings (although serious kudos have to go to \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Deadwing\\" and \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" all fine recordings of their own especially thanks to Gavin Harrison's absolutely phenomenal drum work). The recording itself is crystalline and a big improvement on the sound rendered on \\"Coma Devine\\".If you're seeking a fine example of what Porcupine Tree can do live, look no further. this is the recording to have. Trust me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PT at it's best when playing live!","review":"Warazawa is PT's live effort in Warsaw Poland.It was broadcast and recorded on Polish radio.This material comes from the tour of the Lightbulb Sun Cd.Every track starting with the song\\"Even Less\\" is spectactular.The band holds you mezmerized to every song.Some songs also come from the cd Stupid Dream.If you have never seen PT live then this is the next best thing.There are too few great bands these days but Porcupine Tree is one of them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light colored - good value","review":"These are a good deal and very comfortable, high quality shoes (as with most Rockports). I would caution that it is predominantly a lighter tan than the pictures seem to show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"After reading this book, I still haven't decided whether the author is a genius or a nutcase.Most of the main characters ultimately die a particularly useless and gruesome death, and the book never seems to arrive at a particular point. Even the prologue drags on endlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wes Craven In The Old West","review":"The final installment in the Lonesome Dove series is more of a macabre romp worthy of Wes Craven; a Nightmare on Laredo Street.In some of the most gruesome mutilations and deaths to destroy the myth of the anti-hero, author Larry McMurtry is seemingly writing for himself; burying the characters who survived the initial three novels in what ultimately becomes a very predictable plot of the oftentimes tragic battles within families and the consequences of venturing into a world that is driven by the coldest of hate.The Epilogue of vignettes finally pushes the story to its rightful conclusion and has a plot that is actually a bit more intriguing than the main work.While the book should be mostly viewed as a means for a reader to conclude the series, it is not one of McMurtry's finest moments, unless this is actually a bizarre nod to classic horror fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel to Lonesome Dove","review":"This was an excellent novel. I had a hard time putting it down. Not quite as rich as Lonesome Dove, but certainly a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book!","review":"A very good continuation of \\"Lonesome Dove\\". A psycho train robber who is a crack shot with a rifle is spreading panic and fear in the South and Southwest. Texas Ranger Captain Woodrow Call is called upon to stop him. The hunt for the young train robber begins. There are many twists and turns in the trail.Call and his troops have many adventures on their treck. They finally wind up reunited with PeaEye in Texas. There are some exciting encounters for Captain Call during their hunt. Many interesting characters are introduced during the telling of this story. The ending is very good. This is another McMurtry classic that you will enjoy. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"I originally read this 10 years ago and I remembered not liking it, but I decided to sit down and read the Lonesome Dove trilogy back to back. Lonesome Dove is an incredible book. You feel like you are there with the characters. Commanche Moon is a blood bath, but at least the writing is good. Streets of Laredo, on the other hand, is one huge disappointment. The plot line itself is at least tolerable, however it appears to be one big advertisement to try to sell more Lonesome Dove copies...whereas the book ought to be able to stand on its own, the reader is constantly treated to gratuitous dull flashbacks to scenes from Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous cartoon using Lonesome Dove characters.","review":"The aimless wanderings of Call mirror the writer, who apparently knew he needed alot of violence, but couldn't quite string the segments together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I found this book to be a huge let down. How can you follow up a Pulitzer Prize winner without some disappointment? He should have left it alone. The characters were flat. The story line poorly planned out. The relationships unbelievable. Everyone had either died off or married someone that they should never had a chance with (ex. Pea Eye marries Lori. In the first book she hated Pea, and he was so dumb.) Lonesome Dove was fantastic, while this book did it no justice at all. I wish I had never read it b/c the way it played out was not the way I saw things happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Call...rides again!","review":"while this is not of the level of Lonesome Dove; it is still a great read.We see The captain, Pea Eye, Lorrie, Claire all later in life and how they aged and where they went with their lives.Call of course doesn't doesn't change as much as most, just a aged version of the Lonesome Dove boss. But time has caught up to him and he stubbornly sees these changes and still drives himself.Lorrie and Pea Eye...I read that part 2-3 times, still a mystery to me!All in all, I'd recommend it to any fan of the western culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words can't describe it!","review":"I bought four of McMurtry,s Lonesome Dove series books (Dead Man Walking, Comanche Moon, Lonesome Dove and, Streets of Laredo) after being delighted by the Lonesome Dove TV series. I always thought that a book was better than its corresponding movie, especially after producers and scriptwriters were finished doctoring things up. I bought this collection on that basis (Lonesome Dove)and was sorely disappointed. I can't imagine that the author received the Pulitzer prize for any of these stories. Each book was a little too raw for me and in each one, McMurtry seemed to be in search of a suitable ending; in short they were too long, inane and disjointed. Have you read any of Tony Hillerman or Zane Grey?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped at three","review":"First, I have to say Lonesome Dove is a masterpiece of the American West. Second, Comanche Moon and Dead Man's Walk are very enjoyable. I think McMurtry should have stopped there. What made Lonesove Dove were the wonderful characters and the wonderful adventures each of them were having. Every character, wether you loved or hated them, had a story that drew you in and held you. Unfortunatly most of them are killed off in Lonesome Dove leaving little to start a new novel with. The ones that have made it are so dramatically different it is hard to relate to them as the same people. This novel also never really draws you into the story at hand like the previous. There are high points and overall I am glad that I read it just to see where McMurtry went with this saga. However, as a whole it was a great disappointment from the earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I read the other reviews, and I can see many of their points. However, this is simply a great book. Up there with Lonesome Dove, better than Dead Man's Walk. Great. Read LD first, then read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Western - good ending to a great series","review":"The fourth book in the series (Lonesome Dove was written first, but is actually third), Streets of Laredo is the most reflective and least adventurous story. There is still plenty of adventure, but the focus is on one character, the aging Call on a quest to find a killer. As usual, McMurtry writes a story that goes nowhere and everywhere at the same time. His stories are realistic and detailed, almost prosaic, but they are also universal and compelling. Some reviewers say that McMurtry is not a great writer. But by what standards are they judging, and what difference does it make? It's hard to beat McMurtry at sheer story-telling power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streets of Lumbago","review":"Nope. Didn't work. Not even close.McMurtry kills off most of the really interesting characters in Lonesome Dove - Gus, Newt, Deets, Jake. Then expects to make a sequel with the remainder? Clara and her ranch are absent from \\"Streets\\" with some plotlines left unanswered from LD (did July and Clara ever...?).Pea Eye marrying Lori??!! A villain who burns his victims alive??McMurtry is really stretching it here. He should have rested on his laurels for Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the way he writes.","review":"Always keeps your attention and you are never sure what will happen next. Spins a good story with enough facts to seem very real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Joyless","review":"First let me say I loved Lonesome Dove. I believe it's one of the best novels ever written. This, on the other hand, is far from it. All the things that made Lonesome Dove so great just aren't present here. The lyricism, the poetry, the sense of wonder are gone. Those things and all the interesting characters. This isn't giving anything away but almost all the interesting surviving character from Lonesome Dove dies before Streets of Laredo even begins. The few left are the ones that don't talk much. They have nothing interesting to say and very little interesting to do other than suffer. I'm not particularly interested in watching people suffer. Reading about it either. The first part of this book just recounts how everyone died in the intervening time. And that's the fun part. It gets worse from there, much worse. I've never been more happy to end a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book supposed to be a joke?","review":"I don't understand the author. How did McMurtry ever come up with this hideous ending to one of the best books (Lonesome Dove)ever written. I just wish I had stopped with The Dove & never read this book. It haunts me to think about such an ending. Does anyone who read The Dove ever believe that Lori Darlin' would have ever, in a million years, married Pea Eye? Why have Newt killed off? I have so many questions about this book that just have no answers. If you loved The Dove, don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same dirty town and same dirty characters","review":"As usual McMurtry writes an interesting book. Each book continues like a western soap opera, but they usually keep you til the expected end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Poorly Copy-Edited","review":"The book is good, quite grim, without a lot of the charm of Lonesome Dove.That said, I was appalled by the poor quality of the copy-editing in the Kindle version. There was an entire stretch that felt like it had been OCR'd by an intern and put into the book without a second glance.I am by now well used to uncorrect-ed hy-phenation in Kind-le editions, but this was of such poor quality that one had to puzzle out the meaning of some of the words. 1 V/ant to read rny |(indle books, n0t decipher them.I knocked a star off this review for the poor production value."},{"rating":"2","title":"some of the great tracks are here...","review":"Ok, I realize how hard it would have been to make a cd compilation like this. Word has it that Bob himself chose these songs so I guess it makes little sense to question why \\"Bulldog Skin\\" was chosen over \\"Little Lines\\" from Mag Earwhig or why \\"I am a Tree\\" was chosen over \\"Sad if I lost it\\" from the same album....Gbv are one of my favorite bands ever, and I am happy this was not my first introduction to them. I would have made the assumption that they were just a good band, rather than the great force that they were circa Same Place the Fly Got Smashed,Alien Lanes, Bee Thousand, Under the Bushes... If someone is curious about GBV and is reading this, try one of those records first, and you will be a changed person for life. This record might not do that for you...not to say it isn't good - it is, but this is the Coles notes of GBV. The whole story is much much more involving."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're not all here, but you get a good first taste","review":"This album does not tell the entire story of this amazing band, but it is a good introduction. I believe that this is a good introduction to GBV because even though you don't get other classics off Bee Thousand, Alien Lanes, and the others, you do get 32 amazing songs that will strike your curiosity and hopefully encourage you to buy the others. I think that the first time listener will be happier with this record because it gives you an overview of their material and lets you go off on your own and explore each individual album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic collection","review":"I missed Guided by Voices when they were contemporary, but heard a few of their songs a couple of years ago. Having none of there other albums, this is a fantastic collection of music. I like every song on it, and there are so many. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"They should just change the name of BEE THOUSAND to THE BEST OF GUIDED BY VOICES. The rest of their stuff is pretty mediocre if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is exactly what GBV sounds like","review":"This collection --- a CD completely filled with smart, simple rock songs --- continues the Robert Pollard \\"shotgun\\" method. He releases as many songs as he can, knowing that some of them will be winners. Dedicated GBV fans have the task of sifting through dozens of albums (and hundreds of songs) to find the cream of the crop. You'd hope that this compilation would do the sifting for the casual listener. But no. Out of 32 songs, less than half are keepers. The others are okay, but each is slightly off for one reason or another: bad production, too simple, too short, too little of something to make it worthwhile. Instead of a true 'best of,' this is a condensed version of the whole GBV catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chang, chang, chang, blah,blah,blah.","review":"If this is the \\"Best of GBV\\", I can't imagine what their worst is like! Every once in a while I try to listen to these guys...mainly because someone tells me \\"you would love GBV\\". And everybody raves about these \\"indie underground cult Gods\\". I am sorry. But I find every song to be a complete, annoying repeat of the previous one: strummy guitars, sloppy drums low in the mix and warbly, whiny vocals blathering on about who-really-gives-a-damn. I pity the fools who get taken in by these kind of phony-baloney \\"lo-fi\\" artful wannabes. Played front to back, this album is the equivalent of turning your radio dial between stations: droning white noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"greatest hits albums are for bands like Great White","review":"this is not a greatest hits album. its a collection of great songs (anything up to Alien Lanes) and junk (anything after Alien Lanes).

The shaft is silverish and stamped \\"Chrome Vanadium.\\" BUT, the actual driving head is black and the color easily abrades off with use. Two problems I have with this tool:1. The shaft diameter is almost twice the diameter of the T20 driving head. That means that it will not enter any recessed fitting more than about a half inch, if the recess is sized for T20 hardware2. Whatever metal is used for the driving head, it seems soft and easily stripped during its first use.I would avoid this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i got this as a present for my sister and she loves it. its really pretty and came in awesome condition. its a really good price for this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not XTND Versions, USELESS","review":"Don't waste your time or money, all songs are short radio versions & useless to true DJs.

This album represents, for me anyway, a time when things were less complicated and the music was for the music's sake. Depressing piece of reminiscing? No way - a celebration of how fortunate I was to stumble on these unheralded guys (In Australia at least) and now to trip over the cd while surfing the 'net in China.

I have this particular album on LP, and have continued to listen to it for ages. Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee were older than my parents when I first saw them live. Sonny's wailing harp and Brownie's blues guitar will change the way you feel about yourself and others. If you only buy one blues album, make this the one. Trust me friends, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Laurence Welk plays the blues ...","review":"With all due respect to the reviews which follow, this is not Sonny & Brownie at their best. This is strictly a commercial cocktail party effort - and there's nothing wrong with that exactly. But by appealing to mainstream tastes we sacrifice the integrity of the blues for commercial gain. Believe me, I am no snob. It doesn't take a fine-tuned ear to hear in those back-up singers and drum pieces a cleverly-crafted effort to draw in rock fans. If it succeeds in turning on more people to the blues, fine. But I'd go elsewhere to get the genuine sound of these two terrific performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blues masters - not at their best","review":"This album by Sonny & Brownie is fascinating - I am astounded at how well Arlo Guthrie blends in on Sail Way. On the Road Again shows the interplay between Sonny and Brownie that make them such a dynamic duo. While this is not their best, this album reminds you how much better they are than most even when not doing their personal best. In short, don't insist that everything the masters do is perfect - just sit back and enjoy their mastery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonny and Brownie and friends go electric","review":"What makes it great is the collaboration with a variety of rock/folk/blues musicians. Also, Sonny and Brownie are treated to a very professional back up band, which gives them a much fuller sound than usual. For what its worth, the songs on this album are what inspired a friend and myself to break out our dusty guitars and (try to) play the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breck Must Have Needed the Money","review":"First, let me say that I am a great fan of Peter Breck, so my only way of rationalizing why he made this movie is he must have needed the money. I had read a review prior to buying this that said, if you're a fan of his, pass this one by. True, and yet, I couldn't resist the temptation to see him in a starring role. This movie is outrageously brutal. His character is devoid of any redeemable characteristic. He is scarred by an old lover and wears a half-face mask made of leather and seriously creepy looking. He now hates all women and everywhere he travels, he seems to happen upon a vulnerable woman who is conveniently alone and he proceeds to assault her. A brutal odyssey ensues while he is being pursued not just for his murderous rampage, but money he has stolen. I can't say the movie was at all enjoyable but then, I do want to have as complete a collection of Peter Breck's work as possible, so it is now on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Breck Is Wasted In This Violent Film","review":"This movie was a big disappointment to me. Peter Breck is a fine actor but this film was definitely beneath his acting talents. Mr. Breck is the ultimate cowboy hero, from many television shows, like, \\"Big Valley\\", and \\"Black Saddle\\" Also, countless other guest-starring roles over the years. He is an all around top rate actor but I sure wish he had not wasted his talent on this violent and disturbing movie. If you are a big Peter Breck fan,I do not recommend this movie.A.H.

My impression of this series 'Invasion' (I watched all of it) is that it is a parallel to the invasion of immigrants who have come to the United States illegally. One view of this problem seems to be to accept it because we can't do anything about it which appears to be the view concerning the aliess from outer space.

No such danger here. This book offers an ideal mix of analysis and advice, all delivered in a highly readable way. Brent Green is also very realistic about the Baby Boomers - he is not simply a cheerleader for how big and important the market is (although this is perfectly true), he also points out the challenges that this age group will face going forward, and how those impact on marketing communications. It's all too easy, as many advertisers are showing, to jump on the Boomer bandwagon, throw some old rock 'n roll lyrics into your commercial, and think you've done all you have to do. Brent Green shows exactly why this won't work, and what you should do inside.

My daughter loves ducks and let this book sit untouched after initial readings for about 10 month until she was 2. She now likes the pictures, which are great and colorful. Also the plastic ducks float upside down in the bathtub. If you want great colorful pictures, I would rate this as 5 stars.

I've read lots (and I mean lots!) of books about eating disorders and this was one of the most honest works I've read. It's real, straight-forward and at times raw with honesty. Nothing is held back here. It depicts eating disorders for what they really are and does not glamorize them. Ms. Arnold writes fluidly and and with meaning. I found this book to be hopeful and inspiring and full of good insight. Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"I made the mistake of buying this trimmer last year. Right out of the box I had to adjust the valves to get it to run properly. After about 3-4 months of use, the carb was gummed up thanks to the high ethanol content of our fuels. I had to tear the whole carb down, clean it, reassemble it, and then it ran fine for a few more months. Rinse, wash repeat.This weekend I decided to clear a large area. One of the clutch retracting springs broke. After chasing a spring down that worked, I got the unit back together, only to start having problems with the speed spool head. Basically the lines break off right inside the head, and this happens ever 5 minutes or so, no matter how proactive you area about bump feeding more line.All in all, I don't think there is a worse trimmer on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"They evidently updated this product so that it will start reliably and quite easily. I purchased it because it was a 4-cycle and it had the detachable shaft to work with my existing accessories. The problem with this beast is 1)it has no shoulder strap, 2) is has *heavy* vibration. There is no vibration padding on either of the handles. 4-cycle engines are supposed to be balanced and smooth. This one is clearly not. As the rpm increases the vibration only gets much worse.

Last year while using unit I noticed moisture on my hand and discovered a defective bubble in gas line which had produced a pin hole stream of gas while running, fixed that but unit still internally dripped fuel and oil. Recently sent to Home Depot for service as it quit running, repair company has had this unit for over 3 weeks they now say unsure what needs replacement, they will have to try a few different parts and get back to me with a repair cost in hopefully a week or two.

Engine seized","review":"Shame on me for not researching this weed triming before purchasing. It is heavy, hard to start, but worst of all, the engine seized after only using it twice. Upon taking it in to an authorized dealer for repair, they blamed me for not keeping the oil level to it's proper level.

I spend more time unjamming the line than I do actually cutting. I go about 30 feet and then one side of line falls off, then about 10 feet later, the other falls out. I have to take off the line cover, pull out the string, re-insert into into the feed holes and then put back together. It then repeats the same thing about 30 feet later.

What do they expect me to do? Get out there and weed eat with a pair of scissors?!?!?! We have a very small yard so it wasn't used very long at each use. The warranty dealer said he has been getting a lot of these in his shop. Many people are having lots of problems with it. Something on the inside melted together on ours.

I first thought that having a 4 cyle engine was a good thing. Not. First it is very unbalanced and heavy. Second, it is very difficult to start.

Oh, they also tell you to make sure you replace the valve cover gasket everytime you do this. The engine was anything but smooth running and replacing the line is a real pain.

The spark is fine, the plug is gapped correctly, the carb is totally clean with no blocked orifices. You can adjust the idle but not the mixture.

Only a 5 minute process but I spend more time re-stringing the head than actually trimming grass.The overweight and out of balance engine shakes the whole unit and creates a buzzing that before long will numb your hands. This may be compiled with the fact that you're only cutting with one string because the second string has been sucked back into the head and since you're sick of fixing it you just tough it out hoping that the 2\\" of string remaining will hold off long enough to finish that 5 foot section that is left.... it won't, I can promise you....."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Gas Powered Tool","review":"I have owned this trimmer for a couple of summers and gotten much less use out of that I thought I would. Many of the same problems I have had, it looks like other reviewers have had as well. Difficult to start and difficult to keep running. Typically once it stops running I can't get it going again until several hours later. The line gets welded inside. I wish I had back the multiple hours I have spent trying to keep this trimmer running and re-loading the line. My neighbors will probably pay for a new trimmer for me as my yard seems like it is always is in need of trimming due to the unreliability of this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems","review":"Like many reviewers this trimmer has given me trouble that no one seems to be able to fix. The trimmer is almost three years old and the head spits out about two feet of line every time you rev the engine. Replacing the inner spool, cleaning the head, using different string, etc., made no difference. Talking with Troy-Bilt tech support was not helpful. The service tech knew less than I did about the design of the head. So now I have a perfectly good motor on one end and a useless string trimmer on the other. I should mention this problem started suddenly. Prior to the line spurting out the unit functioned very well. It still starts easily. When new, it was hard to start and would quit frequently. As it got more broken in it ran flawlessly. The trimmer IS HEAVY. If you are a bit frail get something lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't run, finicky, worthless","review":"After going to get the special gas required; and following the ten steps required before every start; and holding down the throttle for the required 60 seconds before actual use - this thing sputtered and died with each attempt to get it past half choke. After letting my shoulder recover and trying again it wouldn't start at all.Looking at the number of bad reviews here, \\"Troybilt\\" (or whatever shoddy manufactuerer wears the Troybilt name) should never have let this product out. It makes me suspicious of all their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troy bilt difficult to use for more than a few minutes","review":"I purchased a TB575ss from Ace Hardware. Took the first one back because it would not start. the replacement started but it starts missing and the power drops if I use it for more than a few minutes. Then it becomes harder and harder to start. If I let it cool down it works better but never as good as the first few minutes of the initial start. Very frustrating to use and get my work done in a timely manner.

I throughly enjoy his works becuase they are insightful, colorful, scholarly (I don't often see academia and faith beautifully melding with one another) and plainly written.

His habit of rhetorical paradoxicalism wears thin rather soon. At one point, the strong influences of the Arab philosophers promised some interest, both historically and philosophically, but soon we were back to the amazing shyness and amazing amazingness of the Saint, who had the distinction of asserting that Catholicism involved reason, in the face of actual reason wafting in from the ancient world by way of Aristotle.All in all, thoroughly dated, both in Chesterton's gushings and reflexive Catholic jingoism, and the underlying philosophy, such as it is, of Aquinas."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Thomas Aquinas \\"The Dumb Ox\\"","review":"I disliked this book very much. I have just recently read it and maybe my version is different. (I read the 1933 version of the book) I would have liked it better if Mr. Chesterton had gone into more detail about St. Thomas Aquinas. He was very wordy not getting to the point and at several points in the book he bored me to tears. So thats my review i am a religion student in high school so you may not regard me as you would an older person but I have read a great many books by great authors who I have praised but this book I think was no written as it shoud've been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classical writer tackles a classical saint...","review":"G.K. Chesterton is one of my favorite writers. St. Thomas Aquinas is one of my favorite saints. So how could I not love this book?What is nice about this book is that it is easy to read. Most books on St. Thomas Aquinas tend to go deep into St. Thomas' theology. This book, however, offers a fun biography of the saint, touching upon Aquinas' genius and explaining the controversies in which he engaged. G.K. Chesterton, ever the gifted story teller, recounts many of the interesting incidents Aquinas faced in his life, answering many of the questions we might have about him. For example, how did Aquinas, considered the greatest theologian the Catholic Church has ever produced, get the knick-name \\"the Dumb Ox.\\"Chesterton knows, and Chesterton tells, holding the reader in suspense as he builds up the story. This is just one of many interesting incidents in Aquinas' life Chesterton touches upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Divine Writer on the Divine Doctor","review":"G.K. Chesterton was an amazing freak of nature: a writer of surpassing wit and skill who could also get to the heart of a subject with relative brevity. His biography captures the essence of Aquinas, perhaps the most complex thinker who ever lived, an all but impossible task. Read this biography together with Chesterton's bio of Saint Francis over a weekend. You will come away much wiser about the human condition than when you began."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book","review":"I wanted a book describing the life of St. Thomas Aquinas. This is not that book. It goes more into his philosophy's and studies rather than focusing on his life. I already read a book about his philosophy - he has written many himself.

I think that if the main point of this book were true the easiest way to prove it valid is searching in history people that said that Jesus was an invention of this family or any other family. In trials only the eyewitnesses can testify; where are the testimonies of people of the same epoch saying what Atwill are trying to prove 2,000 years later??? If you don't have an eyewitness testimony you don't have nothing.

In other words, that the Romans used Christianity to control Judea and first, and finally, their empire.Yet Atwill's central assumption is questionable, i.e., that the author of the New Testament is the same person who wrote The War of the Jews. The problem is, the New Testament wasn't the New Testament when the War of the Jews was written. That is, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John weren't the canonical gospels until at least 200 yesrs later.This is Atwill's central assumption, and it doesn't hold water. Again, while I think Atwill is right in seeing Christianity as a means of control, I don't think that his argument can work once you remove this central assumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't this listed under fiction??","review":"If you think the US government caused 9/11 then you might believe this book. This fictional story explains how the Roman emporers created Christianity as a means of control; has Mr. Atwill read the history of the Romans their culture?? Their brutal tactics of slash and conquer were in no way akin to the creation of a complex religion that completely denied their own form of worship.

The first book was entertaining, not great literature, not historically accurate, not populated by well-defined or believable characters--just entertaining. This book is an embarrassment. The hero is a self-pitying, embittered, and arrogant boor with one or two redeeming qualities. The heroine is irritating, impulsive, spoiled, self-centered, and totally lacking in common sense (among other things). The author describes her as charming, refreshing, and witty. The two characters fall in lust-at-first-site (can't imagine why) and the whole book flows from there. It is supposed to be set in Regency England, but could have been set in 21st Century Manhattan without changing the characters (just their wardrobes). There is a possibility, I suppose, that the book got better after page 195.

I enjoyed to Marry a Duke very much. but not so with this book.Clara doesn't trust her husband as far as she can throw him, but demands he trust her blindly. She acts very childish and makes no real attempt to see what is really going on with her husband. Seger had some bad turns but he is honest with Clara and the same cannot be said for her. I thought when they started writing letters that perhaps we were going to get some character development. All it ended up to be was a race to the bedding.Seger ends up being the bad guy and he really does nothing wrong. Shock plays a big part in his reaction but does Clara stay and find out what is happening? No - she runs away like a spoiled child because she assumes she has been betrayed. Sometimes you wonder if she actually likes her husband with how she treats him.I was really hoping for better.

Although it was a little more expensive than what it would have cost to replace my Brother, I've found thus far that it's been well worth it. CNET gave this printer good reviews, and now I know why. Microsoft Vista ready (which I needed, as we had upgraded shortly after the Brother failed), several connectivity options, easy to plug in and go, works well with our home wireless router, nice print quality, very quiet in standby mode ...

The gardener, of course, is the duke, and being a charming sort of fellow, he sets out to test her.

The new tracks \\"Feels So Good\\" and \\"Time For Love\\" are incredible tracks! \\"Feels So Good\\" originally appeared on Bad Boy Bill's Behind The Decks (CD+DVD) and was not released as a single until now. Both the funky, more laid back original and the hard Disco-House remix are top-notch and a much-have. \\"Time For Love\\" takes on the European Peak-Hour House taste similar to that of Eric Prydz and Steve Angello. A bit different then what we're used to from JJ Flores & Steve Smooth, but they pulled it off quite nicely.

A close second is the essays often included.

Sammy is a strong character, as always, and I especially liked the way the teacher goes nuts after her bird disappears, Sammy feels quite guilty about that. It was a very pleasant read, but the mystery part itself wasn't all that compelling, and for me it wasn't laugh-out loud funny like the Art of Deception, but it's definitely at par with other Sammy Keyes books. It features a strong moral in terms of sticking up for what's right even when it's the tough choice. Wendelin's Shredderman series is hilarious and Flipped is also a really good book, whereas this book features some fun pirate talk but not much in the way of the funny and embarrassing teen romance scenes that cropped up in the Art of Deception, and the mystery bit is never tense or particularly exciting.

I leave the adapter on the lens with a skylight filter just to protect the objective lens element, which is exposed. Looks good on the S-3 so I just leave it there. Only problem is--the tabs that lock into the bayonet mount around the S-3 lens are undersized. The adapter locks into place OK, but then it's a little loose and rattles in the mount.

I didn't see any mention of raising energy (which is important) and the index left much to be desired.Something that I really liked about the book was that Morrison also gave example rituals to perform on each full moon, with it's name and historical information - not just slapped-together sabbat rituals.As I said earlier, it is a good \\"101\\" book, but it should not be the only one that someone refers to when wanting to walk down the path of the Old Ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I have read at least four other books before I read this one, and I found alot of information is repeated.

It is very well written, and also good introduction if that is how you think. But if you want something more balanced, then look eleswhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nerdy wicca","review":"This book just seems a little too stupid. Magic rhymes and rituals that as an adult I would feel like a nerd performing in front of other people. I wonder if wicca as a religion is ever going to grow up?

It's really boring, simple, and goes over the same old thing again and again. Morrison has a gift for writing beginers witchcraft books. They are fluffy and fun, but I'd prefer reading books that say something about life and has some kind of meaning and message. Morrison would do well to take up writing children's books, but forget about writing more beginner's Wicca books."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to wicca","review":"This book has helped me a great deal especially the reference material in the back of it.

An illegal Haitian immigrant is hired by a divorced wife to be a governess - unlike the other characters, mother and governess are both very decent people, although the mother can be neglectful and not as strong a person as the children need. The strength of this novel is in its portrayal of the children, caught in a bad situation. The Haitian angle and the governess' back story add interest, the father is charming and chilling, and the children's barber is a well drawn, interesting secondary character. It took me quite a while to get fully caught up in this book, but it was never dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH A READ","review":"I read an older HC copy of this book but I couldn't get into it. The characters were too dark, and weird, and parts of the story didn't make sense to me. I'm glad it was only a little over 200 pages. I paid $1 for it at a local grocery store for charity. I'm glad that I didn't pay full price for it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong midrange, booming bass, thin treble","review":"Purchased to replace stock Ford speakers. Bass is much more prominent than the OEM speakers, to the point that we don't add bass from the EQ. Midrange seems similar to the OEM speakers. But the highs are very thin and quiet, to the point that we need to equalize the highs up quite a bit. If these speakers are to be used standalone, I'd suggest looking at different units with a better tweeter. If they are to be used as midrange speakers in a combined system, they'd be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nursing Leadership","review":"This is a text book for my MSN/ED program--It is interesting and has much information to offer.It was shipped promptly and arrived earlier than expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A required read","review":"Working on my Master's in Nursing, I have had to read many textbooks (egahds). This book was worse than most. Very dry and not too applicable in today's world. The writters need to enter the workforce and see the struggles that nurse managers face and offer concise advice that can be used in practice, not just theory. A review won't help as the book for many will be required for class, but you may want to see if your library can loan it out, and check with your school library as they can borrow it from other facilities throughout the U.S. and may save you the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, well-researched political junkie book","review":"For those of us who love modern political histories, this a very good book. It examines campaign finance in the real world, with highly detailed and researched insights into how one modern election was approached by candidates and those with money. it has some fascinating inside scoops and details that washington-insiders and those who follow politics closely will love. For example, it examines the role of gingrich and other republicans during the budget debates and government shut-down, providing details I've never heard before (and I read the Wash. Post each day and review articles and books on this subject often.Bottom line: if you want a good look into how money really corrupts our politicians, and a glimpse into how much power the interest groups have, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reasonable beginner text","review":"If you tried Nancy Lynch's \\"Distributed Algorithms\\" and only care about web apps, this might be the book for you. It's readable, useful for people developing web back ends, and up to date. However, it doesn't try to cover the complexities of general fault-tolerant distributed systems. Besides Lynch's classic text, I recommend Gray and Reuter's \\"Transaction Processing,\\" a seminal text that should give you a clear idea of how to compose arbitrarily reliable systems out of unreliable components."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"This book was put together in very poor quality. The writing in the inside of the back and front cover are upside down, so I have to flip the book to read whats on the inside of the covers. The pages are loosely attached in the middle of the book, making it look as if the book is about to fall apart. I am very disappointed in its quality. I purchased this book brand new, and if it was not for the fact that I needed the book for school and didnt have time to return it, I would have. I purchase from Amazon all the time, eventhough usually from sellers not directly from Amazon, this may have been the first time, and I was not very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I am currently using this book as a MSW student.

Its extremely frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly analytical","review":"As many have written, this text was extremely difficult to follow and its discussion on cybernetics was not especially relevant to the field. As a practicing therapist, this text did little to improve my understanding and did much to muddy the waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I agree with several of the other reviewers. This book isn't difficult but it is terribly written. Consider the following sentence on page three, \\"Thus, if you, and especially if your parents as well, were educated in Western society, you likely were immersed in a perspective derived from the thinking of John Locke, and those who followed him, about the appropriate rules for theory construction and methodology in the physical sciences.\\" - Uh... come again?The pretentiousness of this sort of poor academic writing betrays it as a kind of intellectual kitsch, analogous to bad art that declares itself \\"profound\\" or \\"moving\\" not by displaying its own intrinsic value but by borrowing these values from elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"It's not that this book is too difficult, it's just poorly written. The Nichols/Schwartz book is much better. This book was assigned for MFT Theory class, and I ended up throwing it away (literally) and getting the Nichols/Schwartz book. I probably read 150 books on my way to getting an MFT education, and this was the worst book in the entire curriculum.

There is something smooth about these two in same studio that drives me crazy! Having just started to touch the surface of Milt's recordings (with Dizzy, Trane, Ray Charles), I really have to say the instrument sounds a world apart from the cliched and sterotyped cheesy theme tunes I used to associate with the instrument. I guess that's age creepin! Ok, boss guitar is here, Milt drips the soulful blues from his mallets and you know it's gonna work. The exciting part for me is the pairing of Sam and Philly Joe Jones (no relation), who just smoke and funk and rock and explore ever nuance the two leaders leave them. My fave is jingles, with Sam Jones all over the bass, funky style! Check them on 'Everybody digs Bill Evans.' Whilst not in the same realm as Lafaro and Motian, they get the best out of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"FourAndAHalf","review":"I agree with other customers who've rated this book very highly for content and presentation of material. I'd give it a 5-star rating if the publishers had used a good editor to get rid of some of the grammatical errors and poor syntax.

The story switches back and forth between the characters several times through each chapter, keeping you up to date on what they are doing, but by the time you get to the end of the book nothing has actually happened. The reader is no closer to the next step of the story than before beginning the book. It was a very frustrating and unfulfilling book."},{"rating":"1","title":"filler","review":"Lurid, disjointed, unfulfilling...Her Wolf books are interesting and Dragon Queen was written well enough that I bought Raven in hardback, but this book is a bit offensive.

I then picked up The Raven Warrior and although I made it through the book, I was disappointed in the modern dialogue that permeated the book.

When I think of melodrama I think of unbelievable characters and unbelievable plots. In this film we have a witness to murder who waits ten years and then cracks a safe to steal the murder weapon, a lawyer who is employed to uncover corruption but doesn't find any, and a gigolo who marries a girl as part of an attempt at blackmail! I can't trace all the plot holes - it gives me a headache trying to unravel it all. Valentino is smooth and casual in his portrayal of a gigolo, very effective. The overall impression I have of this movie is this: it's a production-line melodrama where the plot doesn't matter much, just give the audience some plush interiors to look at and some dramatic moments, and rake in the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"True tale of homeless girl who made it to Harvard","review":"I saw this one when it first came out (on Lifetime) and am delighted it is finally available on video/Dvd.

They were produced at a visual aspect of 1.85:1. However, they have never been released on DVD at that ratio. They have been slashed down to 1.33:1 ... the so-called \\"full\\" screen ratio. \\"Full\\" screen is the rip-off industry's euphemism for \\"mutilated\\".

However, my review is not so much on the movies as on the product itself. A lot of these double-features are simply two movies, on one double-sided disc, and this set is no different. This format has proven itself time and again to be unstable. So far, I have not had any problems, but I would prefer them to each be on their own disc. I purchased this for $7.18 with \\"FREE\\" shipping courtesy of Amazon-Prime, so I guess I can't complain too much.

This is the THIRD time these movies have been released on DVD. This is also the THIRD time Warner couldn't see fit to release these in their original aspect ratio (a.k.a. WIDESCREEN). This really is unbelievable. My eyes lit up when I saw the listing with the new cover art and the words \\"pre-order\\". So here I am thinking that maybe.....just maybe they finally got it right. Third time's a charm, right? WRONG! You know with the first film, Warner saw fit to release the widescreen edition on Blu-Ray, and yet the DVD format gets three releases, and all of them \\"modified to fit your TV\\". Shame on Warner for doing this to fans of the films. It really is a huge disappointment. As much as I LOVE these movies, and as much as I'd love to have them sit atop my DVD shelf, I refuse to purchase them in this manner.

It is unplayable on my system, specifically in conjunction with my Pioneer Elite VSX-03 receiver. As others and I have discovered, the English audio setting (DTS-HD MA 2.0) does not play on Grumpy Old Men (the French and Spanish tracks play just fine). This makes the disc worthless. Some others have found that if they fiddle with the output settings on their Blu-Ray player they can get the audio to work, but that is a ridiculous expectation for WB to make of their customers.

As two irrascible, but likeable geezers in these movies, these great comedic actors play off each other in the uniquely American type of deprecatory humor, while hiding great affection for each other. Pitted against one another in the unlikely pursuit of lovely Ann Margret in the first, and the symetrical but equally unlikely matching of Matthau with beautiful Sofia Loren, sparks frequently fly, while the problems of advancing age loom in the background. It's all handled beautifully by these two, with a little help from Burgess Meredith (Jack Lemon's horny Dad) and of course from the two lovely ladies in nicely complimentary roles. Of course, the Blu-Ray format is outstanding. This two movie set makes for a great way to spend a lazy afternoon. The Blu-Ray format is another favorite making for crisp clear viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"double feature","review":"I bought Grumpy Old Men on Bluray last fall and was happy to finally get this movie in it's proper widescreen format.

Have they made any more ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blend of alternative and classic rock","review":"If you mixed equal parts Zepplin, Deep Purple, Counting Crows and Husker Du, you would end up with a pretty fair description of Tonic. This is a solid album, containing both hard rocking songs like Casual Affair, Mountain, Thick, Wicked Soldier (best song on the cd), and ballads such as Lemon Parade and My Old Man. I originally bought the album for the two singles Open Up your Eyes and If You Could Only See, but after a few times through the cd, I decided they are probably among the weaker tracks on this disk. I would have given this album five stars, but for the fact it tends to get a bit tiresome more quickly than a truly great album - possibly because Emerson Hart's vocals, while quite decent, are nonetheless rather non-distinctive. Good liner notes containing full lyrics - this seems to be a vanishing trend, unfortunately. Overall a solid album that won't generate many regrets from purchasers."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT album","review":"This band is SO under appreciated. They should've sold a TON of CDs.

Head on Straight is also good."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you could only hear...","review":"The song \\"If You Could Only See\\" was haunting me for months, never heard who the artist was any time I heard it on the radio.

A soundbite gave me the confirmation I needed, and I purchased a great used copy from one of amazons marketplace sellers.The rest of the CD is pretty good, but obviously, you know what my favorite song is! For the price I paid, even if that WAS the only good cut, I still got my moneys worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you could only see how little talent we have!","review":"That should be the name of this album. Granted they have about four good songs on this album, and in this case I use the word album loosely, but the rest of the songs are pure CRAP!! I had hoped for a better effort after I had first heard their song If You Could Only See the way She Loves me on the radio but I am GREATLY disappointed. I won't even bother trying to sell this one to a used CD store for fear some other misguided soul may actually accidently purschase it, god only knows how this crap might damage them.

I really only bothered to listen to a few songs on the album but, those were enough to make me want to hold on to it. Track one,three & four are my fav's. My point, if you could call it a point, is that IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE & OPEN UP YOUR EYES are trance inducing songs. The words & the lingering guitar drag me in every time I listen. I start to daydream about where I was when I 1st heard Tonic. The funny part is the daydreams are never the same but they are always just as real & just as warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another forgettable and boring band","review":"This disc found its way into my home and turns out to be indistinguishable from any number of other generic, boring, unoriginal bands.

I mean when I heard If You Could Only See on the radio, I was like \\"Wow! This CD has to be good. Also all these people are giving it five stars.\\" Well the rest of the songs are not like that one hit. Its totally different. The reason why I got this CD was because of their new hit \\"You wanted more\\" on the American Pie Soundtrack? SO I thought this album was gonna be tyte. But the first 3 songs are the only catchy songs. The others are just boring and seem to have no catchy hooks. Or they are upbeat, incontrolled, songs that sound like \\"BLAH\\".

A really good crack indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feelgood hit of the century.","review":"This book touched me in places no other novel could. I felt so impressed by Amis' ability to handle drug abuse in a way that wasn't belittling or mocking as far as the victims went. He makes it very clear that these are people who deserve all the help and sympathy we can give them. Page after page, Amis' empathy flows while he presents truly alive characters who any one of us would want to meet and help. If you want a book that makes you feel like life is worth living again, this is your book. You could make the difference. Help an addict today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In a list of great things, Dead Babies are near the top.","review":"This book was very interesting.

It's a good read if you can keep your mental images from becoming too graphic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Initially, this book looked rather promising. Amis's stylistic touches were nice as usual and for the first hundred or so pages it seemed as though this was really building up towards an intense and revealing climax. Unfortunately, Amis failed to make the plot nearly as interesting as the setting or characters. The ending was horrid and sudden and although it appeared to say something, it really said nothing about either our condition or the mindset of the characters. All in all, an easy read with its fair share of good lines and amusing scenes, but ultimately as unsatisfying as the drugs the characters intake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, funny stuff!","review":"I enjoyed reading the war stories of different mothers and fathers!

Both her continuing characters and her new characters are interesting and well developed. The mystery is well done, and the story is wrenching but believable. (This is one of the saddest stories that I have ever read.)I would recommend this series to fans of Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael. Of all the series that have been likened to his, this is probably the closest in spirit. The characters are believably Medieval and Frevisse is a nun with a real vocation; the spirituality of the characters is portrayed very well - deep and real but not saccharine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curelty of Greed","review":"The medieval mysteries of Margaret Frazer get better and better with THE WIDOW'S TALE.

The carelessness of King Henry allows this travisty of justice to happen as a reward to a court hanger-on-er.This story highlights the strange loss of the French lands in 1449 and brings Lady Alice, Duchess of Sufffolk and Dame Frevisse to the remote manor of John Say to retrive a document said to be held by Cristiana that would damage the Duke.

Some production aren't worth keeping in our library, and this may be one. The view jumps frequently and annoyingly, especially during the dance sequences. Flashing to a closeup for half a second may have been fun in the editing booth, but is distracting on the screen. We couldn't tell if the choreography was bad, or simply looked that way due to inappropriate cuts and camera angles. A suggestion: when everyone's on stage in a big dance number, show the whole stage instead of jumping from one closeup to another.The story's funny, which is why we bought the DVD, but I can't recommend this DVD to anyone who expects to get the feeling of a live performance. It isn't even up to American Playhouse production (ie; low budget) standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the taping...now the DVD","review":"Was in the audience when this DVD was recorded.

What a dreadful production, especially if you know the fine MGM musical of the same name. The singing is fair, the dancing is poor, the dialogue is mostly shouted (although the actors are miked), and the comics are totally unfunny. The sexual innuendoes are neither errotic or amusing.

Like watching a network sitcom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Original Cast (1953) Instead","review":"IMHO, none of the cast could hold a candle to the original with Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, etc. These shows are all about the music - if the music doesn't make it, the whole production isn't worth two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance, poor technical factors","review":"I saw the PBS broadcast and was favorably impressed by the performance, sufficiently so to buy the DVD. While still enjoying the performance, I have a few complaints about the DVD:1. Poor video transfer. Darker areas of the screen blend to black and the colors are garish at times. Too much edge enhancement with associated artifact. My homemade VHS tape has better picture at times.2. Odd sound mixing - Nominally this is Dolby 5.1 but the stage sound and singing is highly concentrated in the center channel so there is no sense of movement as the actors move on stage. The left and right channels serve more for audience noises. Makes you think they only had a mono tape and generated the mix off of that.I wish they'd taken the time to do a better job with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"im a major musical theatre fan, and up till seeing this performance, i thought that this show was so-so. Suddenly, when watching this on pbs, my heart drops. Brent Barret and Rachel York are made for these roles and make these roles. And Nancy Anderson great laugh. From Tom, Dick, and Harry to Kiss Me Kate this show is incredible. Rachel York does the perfect \\"So in Love\\" and Brent Barrett does an incredible \\"So in Love (reprise.)

The beam produced by this flashlight is somewhat yellowish, but bright enough to see the tip of the vertical stabilizer on a B767. If you can purchase this flashlight for less than $90, it's very worth it. I did have my eye on the next one up, the Super Stinger XT HP, which was supposed to be nearly twice as bright, but I opted not to because the flashlight was a bit longer than I was willing to carry around all night (if you are someone that is over 6' tall, go for the Super Stinger)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Garland(and Al Jolson and..)Revisited","review":"I am a sucker for anything by Red Garland-and I love 'Red GarlandRevisited';but on 'Grey Skies',he does the Al Jolson standard'Sonny Boy'-which is the beautiful tune-beautifully played,that I measure everything else by.Red is accompanied here by Charlie Persip on drums and Wendell Marshall on bass,rather than Arthur Taylor (d) and Miles Davis rhythm section cohort Paul Chambers (b) and this trio does some great stuff with 'St. James Infirmary','My Honey's Lovin' Arms','I Ain't Got Nobody','Baby Won't You Please Come Home','Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen' and 'My Blue Heaven'.Regardless of tempo,Red is always beautifulto listen to.Reportedly,he once went a few rounds with Sugar RayRobinson-and I believe Sugar Ray learned something about how todeal with 'time and space'-from Red.

The highlight here is Red's interpretation of MY HONEY'S LOVIN' ARMS, a tune usually associated with trad bands. Done up-tempo, Red swings it nicely with just the right modern touches added to it. On SONNY BOY, the old Al Jolson tune, Red plays the verse very slowly and unaccompanied, but then things pick up somewhat when the rhythm joins in.NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN, is taken just a bit too slowly and goes on for almost 12 minutes, though Red really gets into a blues groove near the end. Red's locked-hands chordal approach is evident throughout the album (that's the sound from Red that Miles liked the most). I think Garland produced more successful albums than this one, but it's a good one just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Amazing Release From Red Garland!","review":"\\"When There Are Grey Skies\\" is another exemplary demonstration of the Red Garland Trio.

It was released in 1988. They had fantastic songs back then. This cd is definetly one of their best. It would rank up in my top 5 personal favorites. It conveys very good songs and melodies that are just extraordinary.It is a challenging decision on voting for my top 3 favorite cuts from this record, but here they are. Tracks 3,5, and 6. Limelight is a terrific piece with various good solos. Innocent Soul is a moving, mellow song with an awesome piano part. Tom put effort into this one. No Man's Land is a good song with good beat and has a superb introduction. Jeremy Wall produced a lot of good songs during the late 80's.To condense, this cd is one of their best, undoutebly.

I also think everyone is overlooking \\"Yosemite\\" this to me is the best song on this album by far! Along with \\"Claire's Dream\\" the whole album is a gem.

Williamson had a knack of involving the reader emotionally in his protagonist's plight, and I still have a deep fondness for this short novel, which I first read when a very young man. The pure affection Williamson had for his characters permeates his story, and it stands the test of time, which is, of course, the theme of the book. The love portions, brief and a bit overwrought, do not detract from the overall pace and development, and, frankly, were just fine when I was younger.

As with all the best Godden books, the story is built through slivers of narrative and conversation, shifting voice and persepective from page to page, sometimes from sentence to sentence. The characters come into focus gradually, but there actually is a real plot, a critical path of present action amid all the recollection (future as well as past). The ballet community is vivdly portrayed, and the physical characteristics of the theatre are depicted in loving detail.Godden's books are a tad melodramatic and a tad romantic, but this one is suffused with an autumnal sadness that stays with the reader after the story ends. I adored this book when I was a young teen (and not involved in dance at all) and passed it on to my daughter, who is a dancer and loved it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misleading Dissapointment","review":"Firstly, the two star review is because of the DVD itself, not the material contained on it. The episodes are from the first season of the original cartoon series, which I loved then and still do. I enjoyed reliving my childhood, but was not overwhelmed. The addition of Scourge on the cover (a character which did not appear until much later) made me expect espisodes that took place after the movie, when the characters and stories were much more indepth and intriguing. The remastering to DVD is laughable. Nothing on this particular DVD is superior to what a VHS version would contain.

Unable to doom his homeworld, Prime allows Cybertron to come through, and in the process may doom Earth and its inhabitants. And the fun doesn't stop there!

It is rare that a modern horror movie encourages empathy. It is a challenging film but Mr Parkinson should be applauded for bringing to the screen that rarest of gems, a story that encourages us to think whilst it entertains.

No breakoff, no accidentthough it is my first time to adjust a watch strap by myself and obviously I am not anexpert in this.The bad thing is that they changed a seller to send me this tool.......... from China!Almost took 3 weeks to reach me (this broke their 5-7 days promise). Good thing isthat time is not a problem for me in this case. But I am wondering how they makemoney from selling this guy even I know I can get this kind of tool in China with onlyone buck.Anyway, don't hesitate. if you don't make a huge mistake, this tool definitely worksand should be your choice to save some money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is like a toy","review":"I used twice, and then broke! I really do not recomend this product. Is not a good product for watch fix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy and tip breaks easily.","review":"Be careful when using this tool. Also putting the links back together with this tool is hard. I suggest looking for different options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I only bought this because I broke the small pin off of my old one. I only expected to receive the actual tool. I received not only the tool, but a few links and the pins that hold the links in. The tool and spare parts? Can't beat it for a few bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"This tool is good if you are patient and are handy with tools. What you have to be careful about is when you are ready to screw in the handle to push the pin out. You have to make sure that the tool is right on the pin because if you dont, and you think the pin is hard to come out, and you keep screwing in the tool, you can easily strip the plastic threads. You gotta remember it is only a $ 3.00 tool made out of cheap plastic. Ive resized bands on three watches already and it worked fine. In one of my watches the band was 24mm wide and it didnt fit even with the push pin unscrewed all the way back, so I filed off some plastic from the side where the pins come out and it worked. So keep in mind if you have a watch with a band 24mm wide you will have to do that to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap junk","review":"this is a simple design that should work without any issue. The first time I tried to remove a watch pin the device broke. I replaced the pin and tried again with the same result. this was the \\"cheapest\\" similar device and I got what I paid for I guess.

When I found this one I was a little hesitant to order it because of the low price. I decided to order the tool and try it. When it arrived I used it right away with no problem adjusting the links in my band. It worked great and because I did not have to take the watch to a jeweler it saved me several dollars ,and I can use it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap design, bits break too easily. Dont waste your time and money","review":"Well for 5 bucks i wasn't expecting much, but this is by far an inferior and cheap product. Its hard to line up the pin holes with the bit heads, and even when they are aligned the bits bend and break. I stopped trying after 2 bits broke and threw the thing in the trash. Better to go to a jeweler and pay a couple bucks to gets links removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"After this I have blood pressure problems..I blame this thing.","review":"This remover comes with six pins. I bent or broke all of them. They're made out of really soft metal. I was trying to take the pins out of a Citizen watch, and I managed to get two (out of the four I needed) out. I also used a dental tool, a pair of pliers, a dime (to raise the platform enough to fit my watch on it), and a paperclip. Since others didn't have so much trouble, and I managed to get it to work for two pins, perhaps I just wouldn't recommend this for Citizen watches. I suppose you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great!","review":"So inexpensive and did the job just fine! No need to try pins or paper clips! I took my time and it performed flawlessly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"skip this product. You don't have to buy a really expensive set either. Just get those kits with the tiny hammer thing, the pin and the watch stabilizer and you are good to go. This item is not built smart, there is no way to adjust the width of the tool, so if your watch happens to be just too wide, (I tried it on a woman's watch and even that was too wide) then you are out of luck. I ended up just using the pin only and a hammer I had to get my watch fixed, stabilizing my watch was a pain. Oh well, it was only 5 bucks.

The 5 extra pins weren't even included as advertised. The thing broke after 5 minutes of using it. The metal in the handle snapped off so it could not be used to push the pins out of the hinge on the watch band.Do not waste your time or money with this product. Spend the extra 10$ and have a professional do it the right way so you don't scratch your watch. It's really not worth the aggravation this product gives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...you get what you paid for, I guess!","review":"Like the title said, \\"...you get what you paid for...\\" This product is useful, but when it really counts, the pins get bent out of shape. The housing is made of really cheap plastic and the pins (as mentioned) are made of really cheap metal. But, for a couple dollars, there's not much to complain about but review this item as is.

The watch cost me a pretty penny but the cheapskate in me didn't want to pay Tourneau $25 to add one link to the band. Decided to give this a try because the price couldn't be beat. The item is exactly as described in the description and the other reviews...it's a piece of molded plastic with several, different sized metals tips. Not especially well made but I see how it could get the job done.So I lined up the watch, threaded the metal tip into the pin, and was able to push it about 1/4 out, but not any further. Something about the design of the metal tip...it wouldn't go any further. Maybe it's just the design of my watch. Even tried pulling the pin out with pliers, to no avail.Anyway, I ended up bringing it up to a Tag retailer, who adjusted it for free. Giving this product 2 stars because it looks like it could work for some people...just didn't work for me. For this price, it's worth a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product Really","review":"I read the reviews about this and thought, \\"I can use this thing correctly,\\" in spite of the negative reviews. Well, I couldn't. I was able to remove some links from a new watch, but couldn't finish the job because the little pins that come with this thing bent and broke.

I was careful to be sure that band was properly aligned and that force would be applied to pin to be removed in keeping with the direction of the arrow shown on watchband. After bending two of the supplied mandrels, I stopped. The tool was not capable of holding the watchband square to the mandrel. The tool is not up to the job, and the cost of returning it would be more than its worth. Save your money! I have bought several products over the years from Amazon and previous descriptions of product capabilities proved to be accurate, I relied on their word - Somebody really goofed on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy small tool","review":"This tool is really a money and time saving tool.

But then you can't see the alignment of the pin remover with where it makes contact with the pin on the watch. I broke a few pins on the remover just trying to line things up.2) Just as important, the pin on the remover wobbles as you screw it in toward the watch band. (It's VERY loose.) It's like trying to twist a corkscrew, into a narrow space in which you can't see, and have the point on the corkscrew hit the head of a pin dead on.

When you read the other reviews, keep this in mind - the pins ARE SUPPOSED TO BEND OR BREAK because if they were as strong as your watch band pins then you could accidently ruin your band, links or pins - these are designed to fail BEFORE you damage your watch - so be careful - follow the instructions and everytime you do a watch band yourself think of the money you saved in gas driving to the store and the money you pay for the repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different product, same review.","review":"See my review for \\"16 PCS Watch Repair Kit\\".

Its plastic, but if you know what your doing, take your time and treat the watch and this tool like its more of a delicate instrument instead of a hammer and chisel, this item works great. I have removed links in 4 watches so far. Slow careful pressure on the tool and make sure its all aligned properly and the tool works great. Not sure why people have so many issues. And its only $3 bucks. Even if it breaks the next time I use it, it will already have paid for itself. Great little tool if used properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The pins are very slender and fragile, and to line this tool up so that the pin does its job without bending takes surgical precision.

The results are somewhat dull, but Bela Lugosi helps enliven the proceedings as the sinister plastic surgeon who has a few surprises in store for Japan's Black Dragon Society. A pre-Lone Ranger Clayton Moore plays the disgruntled romantic hero. Ideal for nighttime viewing, with a lurid twist ending. Another Monogram quickie from producer Sam Katzman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorized Black Dragons.","review":"No movie with Bela Lugosi in it can be a total bore, but this one comes too close. It deals with a Nazi doctor performing surgery on Japanese spies to make them pass as Americans. This is done to ease their schemes at sabotaging our war effort. It is a cheap movie, a slow movie, but would not even suffer too much for these flaws if it did not also rely on a long and awkward flashback sequence near the end, snuffing out what suspense had been built. The quality of the tape is not bad, but either you like colorized movies or you don't. This reviewer does not.

Lugosi is a plastic surgeon who transforms some Japanese businessmen into American fifth columnists who set about trying to destroy America's war effort from the inside. The film is poorly constructed and Lugosi looks bored. This film is an insult to his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this film on its own.","review":"This is one of Lugosi's poverty row movies, from the period when his career really started to go downhill (although he did make Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man later than this one). There's a series of murders and people go around trying to figure out what's going on, and it all ends up in a second world war era anti-Japanese anticlimax ending. It's quite boring, definately one of Lugosi's worst movies (although not as painful or embarrassing as \\"Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla\\".Of course, Bela Lugosi fans know that no matter how bad a movie was, Lugosi's acting was always sincere. He always did a good job, and you will want to see this no matter how bad I (a fellow fan) say it is.

I like Bela Lugosi, but so far, I have only seen about twelve of his movies. However, this is probably the worst of those. Lugosi is good, as usual. Some of the other actors are decent and some are not so good. The weakest part of the movie is the story. It's not interesting or thrilling (it's supposed to be a horror-thriller). It's just boring.Don't waste your money on this.

This production permanntly archives the rapidly deteerorting super 8 film that was sitting in a box in some forgotten storage unit.Billions of people bike and hundres of million of people use mountain bikes and at some point everyone asks - \\"when did people start biking over steep hills?\\" and \\"did road biking come first or the mountain bike come first?\\" Now we have the answers to these questions.On that note, the film's producer did a magnificent job capturing not only the rare footage, but the humor and the atmosphere of the 70's.

I waited for Blu-Ray DVD players to come down in price thinking I would be able to view movies and content from other 1080p devices.

The real problem is that most game and other content vendors push 1080p through component and HDMI. So while you will be able to see a 1080p signal when TV stations start sending out 1080p broadcast you will not be able to enjoy 1080p external content unless it's from a firewire device. I'm totally disappointed by this as I payed a lot more than $1,700.00 for this set.

It does tangle, badly in my hair and it seems to be over-heating even after only 5 minutes. When I turn it off for a few seconds (to untangle my hair) it won't turn back on for at least 5 minutes. Needless to say, it makes for an irritating, extended experience. I purchased a Conair previously that I loved for my hair type but it broke after only 3 months which is why I bought this. Well, I am considering trying another Conair because at least I loved how it made my hair look.

Then I would go back to it and 30 minutes later, if I chose to use it again, it would work for a few minutes again til it apparently was overheating again.

You don't even finish drying one small strip of damp hair before bam! it's off. I thought it was overheating, but so quickly? No, it's just a junky product, because this \\"overheating\\" bit starts almost right away. I was vigiliant that the brush stayed clean. It's easy to remove the barrel for maintenance.I bought mine at Walmart (or Target, can't remember which), and went through two of them before I finally got it through my thick-head that it doesn't work.

They discontinued the trusty Conair I used to have and I tried this model, which appeared similar. Not only was the barrel itself much shorter, but my fine-textured rather straight hair that usually curls quite easily did not curl at all when I used this. Didn't do much more than a barely conceivable bend. I rarely write reviews, but hope that others don't waste their money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, but doesn't last very long","review":"My wife has been using this product forever and really loves it but she goes through about 1 a year, she uses everyday.

However, I have discovered that the 1\\" & 1 1/2\\" barrels are interchangeable on the base. Therefore, I have bought the 1\\" Hot Air Styler & put the larger barrel on it. Biggest problem is that overheats. Do not turn it off until you have finished styling your hair or you will need to let it cool down (approx. 3 min.) before it will work again.Helen of Troy has a similar product which I purchased b/c I could not find the Vidal Sassoon version...very cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this hot air styler","review":"This is my fourth Vial Sasson hot air styler.

It has always lasted a long time, and I use it exclusively almost daily. I just started using the 1 1/2\\" Vidal Sassoon Air Brush, and I love it!! I have tried other brands, but none do as great a job because of the metal barrels creating \\"lines\\" in my hair or because the bristle brushes are more difficult to work with for me. This product is my favorite. It allows me to style my hair quickly without it getting stuck in the brush.

It is not about saving lost souls ('Rarely,' she says, 'does a religious novel find an audience among the unconverted'). It best not be full of religious jargon or Bible-quoting zealots.\\"This is shocking, to say the least. Christ commissioned his followers to PREACH to the lost, not to go out and simply entertain ourselves. Now, if we are able to entertain ourselves while leading others into the truth, then so much the better. But the vast majority of Christian fiction on the market is watered down slush that is powerless to change lives, let alone rescue souls from eternal destruction. Fiction is a tremendous venue for speaking the truth to a lost and dying world. What a tragedy it is to waste that venue on our own fantasies and imaginations.Reviewed by \\"A Bible-quoting zealot\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Girl's Review","review":"I love all of these books!!!!!!

I Have African Cichlids up to 5\\" long and these nets work well.There are a few little things that could be better, but I was able to rig it up easily enough.The suction cups that hold it up are facing up, so the net needs to be hung from the tank lid.Not very practical, so I had to hot glue different cups that would hold the net to the side of the tank instead.Now they work perfect, they hold the Momma fish until the she spits her fry, then it lets the fry grow in safety.I've tried others and they were either to small or nothing would keep them near the surface of the tank. So forthe money and a minor adjustment this will do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies Galore","review":"This net is a lot bigger than I thought it was, however it fits nicely inside my 20 gallon tank and I can see the rest of the tank plus the babies within the netting. The only downfall I have with this set up is that it collects dirt and debris from the tank and gets stuck in the netting and is nearly impossible to get out and clean it back to the orgional state, and the suction cups have a tendency to get worn and not hold anymore after a while. It does work for its purpose however, as I have managed to successfully raise 17 different batches of Guppy babies in it thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks decent but quite flimsy","review":"At first glance, the product looks pretty neat. Some may say that its size is too small, but 10.3 inches is 10.3 inches. So no cribs on that. However, the net is of extremely poor quality and had started ripping off the bottom seams when I received it. In case you want to use this breeder net, I recommend that you glue the bottom seams (with silicon sealant)to the plastic base after you slip the net on. The other problem is with the suction cups. They fit loosely into the slots provided. It is better to apply some silicon glue to the suction cup slots once you have placed the suction cups. So in case you still decide to purchase this product, make sure that you do have some silicon glue on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"silver spur","review":"Kerhaw makes great knives.I have carried the silver spur and silver spur ii for some time.

I LIKE players who grow from record to record. To me, that's the essence of jazz.The funny thing about it is that Branford has managed to do it it all very quietly. I guess we have come to expect this kind of consistent genius from him.

Not a great solution but I am hoping that dust mites cannot get through duct tape. In retrospect I wish I had spent a few more dollars and got one that would have held up better.

I did manage to get through the movie, but it was not as good as it could have been with a different star, or with the same star after a shampoo and shave.

This movie is short, fast, colorful, and supremely superficial. Wilde's famous epigram seems ironically suitable here: those who look beneath the surface do so at their own peril. In this case, there's nothing underneath the glossy, sexy cover. The ultimate cinematic c*ck-tease. In the end, I think it's Araki's desire to be ultra hip that undoes this film. When fashion and taste have moved on, this movie will remain mired in its own particular cultural moment. And that in and of itself is ok, since many great films end up that way. But that's all there is to this movie-- no commentary, no message, no critique. Just low-budget teenage sexcapades with all the depth of an uninspired fashion spread. it's intensely disappointing.

Campbell and Campbell have put together a book that describes how six schools across the United States have provoked change within their educational systems. Each of these six schools has some common characteristics but has shown differences in their MI implementation. The clear storyline and visual charts in this document make this book an easy read that should inspire teachers at all stages in their careers. You do not need to be involved with an MI school to gain many insights from this book. Its reflective situations and structured organization will increase your foundation on MI theory as well as inspire you to look at the learning styles of youth in a whole new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, a little expensive","review":"I liked this, but it was a bit expensive, I thought, considering I could only get about 7-8 masks out of the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A map for the expanse of the Human being","review":"True to the word integral Wilber has done much for bringing together multiple frames to present a more cohesive picture of human beings.

The first half of the book consists of Dürer's letters to Wilibald Pirkheimer, written while Dürer was in Venice (1506). These are fascinating, Dürer's description of the Venetians and of his artwork completed during his Venetian stay are especially of interest. The second half of this book is a record of Dürer's journey to the Netherlands (1520-1521). It is quite dull when he is merely recording how much money he has spent on what and where he has eaten. But he does describe things such as the great procession of Our Lady's Church in Antwerp, and he writes about his fears after Martin Luther is taken prisoner, which makes having to read the dull bits worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Bath Repair","review":"I got my new router yesterday and I noticed on the box it was made in Mexico All my older porter cable tool are made in USA and the one amazon ha pictured here is as well I gess the tool is fine but i hate the fact you cant buy american made tools anymore after all they are an american company right"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple to use and inexpensive enough for a beginner","review":"I've used my 690 for close to 2 years now without a problem. It has power to spare and is rock solid. It has outperformed every other tool in my shop. In many cases I've found a way to use a router in lieu my other tools. I have great confidence it will last for many years. My dad's 690 is over 10 years old and still running strong (I've put a few hours on that one too!)I use it exclusively for hand work using the fixed and plunge bases provided, opting instead to use the bigger 7518 in my router table.I highly recommend this router to anyone.

Purchase came with a really cool free dovetail jig so I am keeping it. However, the unit is sold with a sub-base that has a center hole that is too small for its own factory supplied collets. The collet will hit the base when the base adjustment is retracted. Larger bits (with a circumference larger than 1.25\\") can cause the sub-base to get dangerously caught between the bit and the collet rotating edge. Secondly, the control switch is poorly located on the upper motor housing. I would recommend you choose carefully depending on your intended use. You will be disappointed if you are using bits with any portion of the profile/contour larger than 1.25\\" Diameter. You must make an optional purchase of P-Cbl 2.5\\" sub-base part number 42188 to get around the sub-base hole size issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!

So, I went out and bought this Porter-Cable router so I could use my dovetail jig. Like others, I find this router to be great for doing hand routing, and like other reviewers, I don't like where the switch is located. I'm so afraid that I'm going to do a number on my arm sometime when I'm not careful, because you actually have to lift one hand off the router in order to turn it on and off. That said, it has a very solid feel and I use it for all my hand routing needs (the Craftsman router is now permanently attached to my router table)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect first router","review":"I have the older 1.5hp version of the 690. I haven't used the updated one but the basics are the same. It glides through wood without hesitation regardless of the bit style or depth(within reason of course). It spends 95% of it's time in my router table where it lives quite happily. In this application, I find it to be ideal for my hobby needs. Even the older screw-type motor lock works well.If you are looking for a first router or one to put under a table, look no further, you've found it. The only thing that is a drag is having to use two wrenches to change bits, but not many routers in this class have a spindle lock. The collet design is outstanding, by the way, so you don't have to worry about bits sticking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter Cable 690lr","review":"Bought my first Rockwell router in 1974.

The improvements on the 690 are great and I especially like the cam-type depth adjustment lock. the on-off switch is a little harder to use than the old toggle switch, but the oversize handles make it much easier to work with. This my second 690 (the other is permanently set in my rout-r-lift router table) and if this 690 lsts just half as long as the old 100 I'll never have to buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Router","review":"I like this router, it's powerful and accurate.

I'm a 20-something, college educated, art-loving female punk musician from New York City (have I impressed you yet, Sarah??), and I am certainly unimpressed by Sarah Vowell's ability to randomly name-drop and brag about the artists, musicians, and authors she likes.

I believe that is all of them. I thoroughly enjoyed three of them and would strongly recommend them. With for Radio On, her first book, she seems to be in a different place. Radio On is a diary of Sarah listening to the radio. Although the concept is interesting, the result is a lot of very short entries in which there is little opportunity to develop anything. But the real reason I didn't like Radio On is because of Sarah's perspective at that time. She is a very critical person in this book. Nirvana is the greatest band ever, and The Grateful Dead is worthless. Whether it is music, politics, or a variety of other topics, you get the clear impression that her opinion is right and any others are wrong. Radio On is a very mean and negative view of life and our world. The worst case scenario, though, is someone reads Radio On first and doesn't read Sarah Vowell's other books.

He's an excellent jazz violinist, still cutting his teeth, but able to swing and improvise like a pro. His youth and inexperience are probably reflected most in the slower ballad numbers like A HANDFUL OF STARS where he sticks pretty close to the melody. He can tear apart up-tempo numbers, though, and IF DREAMS COME TRUE is a real roof-raiser. Bucky and John Pizzarelli offer solid support, and what a treat (and learning experience) it must have been to have Houston Person guest on tenor sax on a few numbers.

We can't even pick up our local channels in our home using the best antennas money could buy. Called customer service and they were very unhelpful...told us that if the tv picked up cable channels, then there was nothing wrong with the tv reception. Cust Serv continued to tell us that we had poor reception in our home. However, we pick up all local channels with every other tv in our home using the same antennas we tried with this tv.

When we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken.

Whenever a scene comes up that has the potential for being exciting, the author glosses over it with an easy solution. Everything about the story is typical. You can guess what will happen next, and it does. Sappy line after sappy line, you can't help but roll your eyes at the way the author writes the dialogue.The one character who could have been great, the heroine Chumani, is destroyed at the very beginning of the story.

The alarm sounded, there was a thud, and it wouldn't power back on. In both cases, the TV was not on!

My biggest complaint is that when the power does finally come back on, the HTUPS-500 doesnt automatically turn back on, which means that my DVR doesnt come back on, and I miss TONS of programming, even if the power was only out for 10 minutes.

I've bought 4 pairs of clippers now (including these) and i think they were definitely the best purchase yet. They were also the most expensive, but its like the old saying \\"u get what u pay for\\" and these are definitely worth the extra money. They are very precise with every cut!! nothing even comes close to these clippers!! I like how they have the \\"steps\\" on the side, it helps alot with the fading or tapering, it actually gives something to fade from instead of just having to guess. The only bad thing i found is that they get HOT after u have them on for about 20- 30 mins but other than that i dont think they could get any better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clippers!","review":"Clippers do a really great job!

I used them right away to cut my son's hair (fade). They worked 10 times better than my cheap whals. There is a definate difference. They did get very hot and I actually have slight burns on my fingers. I would have to say that its probably cus I'm not a pro and it takes a long time for me to achieve a tight fade. It took me an hour (I know that's sad, but the fade is tight) and the clippers started getting really hot after 30min of continuous use. Most pros have 2 or 3 clippers they switch between as well.

I have had enough with the cheap $15 clippers that break and don't do a good job of cutting, so I splurged on these clippers which cost me $100. I have been unable to use the clippers at all because they apparently need to be tuned or something. They are incredibly loud, the blades are not centered on one another, and the blades swivel very easily. I am by no means a professional barber so maybe I am missing something here, but for $100 I expect a piece of machinery that is ready to go right out of the box. The instructions told me to tighten a screw on the side of the clippers if they were loud, but that does nothing. I am going to have to send the clippers back home to my brother hoping that he can bring them to a barber for a tuning and return them to me. Way too much hastle for what I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, but soon disappointing","review":"I loved these clippers when I first bought them, but after a few months and under ten uses they started giving me problems.

I guess things change and every company is cutting back (no pun intended) and tightening their belts, but when I bought these years ago they came with guards, a pair of scissors and a small clipper brush. These I received didn't have anything with them but the clippers and a small thing of blade oil, WTF!!! When I opened the box I thought that I had gotten a bad shipment, but the clippers are new and they cut real well and are going to be a great replacement for my old Andis pro masters, but what is a pair of clippers if they don't include the necessary tools to help in cutting and tapering hair?So great clippers but only 4 stars for not including the basic and needed hair guards.

It is interesting to learn about a famous poet from the D.R., but I could not connect with the characters and they lacked the approachability that \\"les Mariposas\\" had in In the Time of the Butterflies. The plot is a little sketchy, and it jumps in time periods so it is hard to figure out what is going on all of the time. However, it captures the feeling of the woman who has lost her mother at such a young age and has had to live with the her oppressive legend for her whole life.

It contains key tracks from his 1960s albums, but obviously this is NOT a complete portrait of his music career. The major flaw with this collection along with volume 2 is the overall sound quality. This may be a hard collection to find online or in music stores.

Also if this is a CLASSICS collection were are the classic renditions of \\"Cabaret\\", \\"Flamingo\\", \\"America\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", \\"Wade In the Water\\", and \\"Bittersweet Samba\\". I mean, why should \\"Marching Through Madrid\\" be on here? It's time for upgrades as all of us say. We need an anthology, not just twenty definitive hits with thirteen TJB songs and seven solos.

In my opinion saving on the computer or printing out the finished auction and the emails between seller & buyer is more accurate, more complete, and simpler.

The suction cups are not designed for the product. They are the type that go into a hole and the unit has no holes. It does have four pins, but then they would require the hole to be in the suction cup. There is no way to attach this thing to the side of the tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and encouraging","review":"The artist primarily shows his sketches using 7B or 8B pencil, with watercolor washes. He gives examples of just about every subject matter, indoors and out, including landscapes, houses, industrial structures, animals, winter scenes, trees in every season, flower arrangements, and still lifes. He shows final paintings worked up from sketches, primarily in oil or acrylic. Some of the sketches are pastel on toned paper. His narrative is encouraging and instructive, without being preachy. This may not be the best book for an absolute beginner, as it does not show steps in the formation of any sketch, but he does show some alternate views of a given scene to show how point of view can change the picture. I have many books on drawing and watercolor painting and keeping a sketchbook, and this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Watch","review":"This watch looks better than the picture.

It is a techno-remix of classic Van Halen songs. Some of the songs do not even resemble the original. For example, Hot for Teacher only repeats the word \\"Teacher\\" numerous times in the beginning, and then later repeats \\"I got it bad\\" again and again. The guitar solo is actually in there, but it is sped up and sounds synthesized. Don't expect any cool remixes unless you are a huge techno fan.

I dont think it would be as bad if it didnt have the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to hot for remixes","review":"Let me start of by saying I love VH, techno music, and remixes of songs. However this Cd is soo butchered its like a crappy DJ made this for his first ever remix set. The techno over powers the lyrics in more than one song. There are only a few songs that have the entire lyrics in them , otherwise they are just poor cuts and loops. If you were to seperate the techno and the covers you would have two good seperate cd's.Dont get me wrong I liked the versions of \\"Runnin w/ the devil\\"and \\"Unchained\\" not much more than that though. Maybe next tribute will be a little better, lets hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke","review":"I saw this CD at a record store and didn't know what it was.

Nevertheless, I felt that it belonged with my VH collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE","review":"Rather than writing a long critique about this sorry excuse for a Van Halen tribute cd, I will just say that I agree with the prior reviews.

A techno tribute to Van Halen? That may not be such a bad idea. But, why are there heavy metal artists doing it? The songs hardly resemble the originals, and to me, the CD defeats it's own purpose. They should have just done a techno album of original music - I would have probably liked it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"corny collectable","review":"This book from the early 60's, written by a couple with 6 (!) children, is interesting from a cultural standpoint.

If you like Wes Montgomery and don't know about Grant Green then you need to. I enjoy Mr. Green's inflection of blues in most everything he does.

He serves the music well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good start...","review":"(I'm always a little suspicious when an item- after getting all four and five star ratings- suddenly gets an uninterrupted string of one star reviews.)As a young musician myself, I can tell you this is a wonderful book for the lay person to approach music. It avoids talking about the music theory of pieces (trust me, if you're a non-musician, this is a very good thing), and gives a good (if brief) look at the lives of composers. I rather welcomed the introduction of the authors knowledge of surgery and medicine when he brought it up- I enjoy hearing about how my favorite composer died.If you're someone who really likes trivia of all sorts, this is a great book. I wouldn't study for an exam by it, but it is a high quality coffee table or nightstand reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your money","review":"I've worked in public radio long enough to have read a number of these types of books regarding which this author rather naively maintains his to be the first of it's kind. The only remarkable thing about this work is that the author has rendered such a poorly written attempt, yet managed to remain so full of himself. Read the Goulding book, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!...","review":"Mind, I take no pleasure in assigning a low rating to a book whose author appears to have been commendably avid, ambitious and well-intentioned; but--given the many, many competing titles that are far more comprehensive and altogether superior, I can't bring myself to recommend this book very highly.To, er, illustrate how this first edition intermittently seems not-quite-ready-for-prime-time, I noticed that the respective miniature, black-and-white drawings of Berlioz and Liszt are transposed. (The picture of Liszt introduces the Berlioz section, whereas the picture of Berlioz--laughably--introduces the Liszt section!) Considering that the author evidently didn't have the wherewithal to forestall such a glaringly embarrassing boo-boo BEFORE his beloved book went to press, how can the reader wholly trust, and comfortably digest, the remainder of this volume's innards? :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time - very disappointing story","review":"Based on the reviews, I purchased this story and another story by the same author. In both stories, the author seems to have supreme difficulty developing her characters. The characters aren't particularly likable or believable. Fortunately, they are pretty well swallowed up by the gaping chasms in the plot.I didn't believe that the main characters really cared for each other at all. The hero only really seems to care about embarrassing the heroine, showing her what she is doing wrong, making her jealous, and driving her out of \\"his\\" house. The heroine spends her time cleaning a house that might not belong to her, neglecting her brother, and envying her rather rude cousin. The author would have been better off omitting the profuse details of cleaning a neglected estate and focusing on developing her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The plot line of this novel had great promise but a number of conflicts were either not developed or simply ignored. The story begins with elements of mystery in the true ownership of this property; that is never really resolved.

I bought it because the price was to good to pass up. Buying this saw can save you hundreds over the enclosed stand model. It's the same saw except the motor is 3/4 hp and mounts on top of the base. In my opinion the 4 leg base offers more stability than the enclosed stand model. I have to say that Delta pays attension to fit and finish (outstanding). The saw went together with no problems. The flywheels have 9 spokes versus 6 on the [other] model. This saw offers great value and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT skip this book!","review":"From the introduction, you can obviously tell this is going to be a book to help bring back some HUMOR to your pregnancy!

It's absolutely the funniest book I've read and the humor is not corny!

This book is the most sarcastic portrayal of pregnancy that I have read thus far and I thought I would really appreciate it...but the lack of true, genuine knowledge about pregnancy really made this book go downhill fast. This might have been a good read if it was the first book you happen to pick up about pregnancy but after you have read even a little about what happens to your body this book ceases to be funny when it makes fun of and pokes fun at every little minute detail.Read it if you haven't read anything else on the topic. Don't read it if you want to be intellectually stimulated and learn something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"This book would be more appropriate in the Humor section.

After a bitter history of being labled as less than, ugly, ignorant, etc., James Brown bought to the nation and the world the real truth. We were Black, we were beautiful and we should be proud of that fact.I am forever in Mr. Brown's debt for giving Black People everywhere a real national anthem, a song we danced to, sang to, got empowered and believed in.

I love all types of Music, so the Diva concerts are the highlight of April. Tina got the show of to a good and origional start. Elton suprised me, for I didn't think he could nold his own. I was surprised that only one Cher (solo) track was included (but considering she lip-synched her other one...). Brandy, even with a sore troat, shined, even when joined by Faith, and the larger Divas. Faith herself was excellent as a guest (she rocked on Divas 2000, too), so was LeAnne. Whitney was marvelous. Mary J., though she had only one song, greatly effected the concert with her presence. Chaka Kahn was nice too, as the surprise guest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Ordered the DVD and received the CD instead. The vendor was kind enough to give a refund.

Tina Turner is clearly the standout and should be considered the headliner. Whereas everyone else on the album tries so hard to reach Diva status, Tina achieves with a mere flick of that mane. Too bad they cut out the extended banter of the \\"Proud Mary\\" cut and Tina's soulful rendition of \\"Let's Stay Together.\\" The actual Diva show was pretty much over one half-hour into it - once Ms. Turner exited the stage.

I completely agree with the ideas behind this book. Unfortunately, the tone of the book felt self-congratulatory and every example in the book ended with a rosie, unrealistic finale. I also felt like the book was describing very obvious solutions. I think that modern day, educated parents are not raising children in the way the book describes. Of course we are kind, of course we don't allow small children to watch violent things on TV, of course we respect the earth....I just found the tone patronizing and i guess not very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent book and an original one about positive education","review":"First thing I did when I read this book: I contacted the author to tell her how great her book was!

This one is different. It is way more global as an approach. It shows how to be kind and therefore teach kindness to your children with a greater view at the end: teaching kindness is feeding the world with kindness.All parents with an interest in positive education and respect of nature should buy and read this book.

There is true depth in his lyrics and the the lyrics are better then ever. Bizzy Bone truly shows that he can make it on his own. The high pionts of this cd are \\"Don't be dumb\\", \\" Before I go\\", and \\"The Whole Wide World\\". Not to say that the other songs fall to far behind. Each song has it high point and to say the truth, this seems to be the Best solo project from a Bone Member Ever!

Without Bizzy, they are just Bone Thugs, cause he holds all the harmony.

There are a number of extras included on each of the 4 discs, the most interesting being a plethora of silent Fleischer cartoons and a couple of extended documentaries on the history of silent animation and Popeye himself; the \\"Popumentaries\\" are very brief and an amusing addition.

They're very funny & entertaining, with fun music & great gags and very likable, classic characters. This is some of the best cartoons ever produced.

As usual Milwaukee comes through again with a collection of fine tools at an affordable price. I've tried the \\"Big Yellow Ones\\" but they don't hold up like a \\"Milwaukee\\". I guess the only bad comment I can think of about the whole package is the sawzall seems to use up batteries pretty fast. I would recommend having at least 3 total if you plan to use the sawzall for extended periods. By the time one charges up the other is completely dead. The hand saw, drill and work light seem to operate forever on a battery. I would highly recommend this product if you do a lot of quick in and out jobs where you don't want to drag extension cords and tools around. The contractor bag works great keeping track of your tools and ease of transportation.

The book itself feels nice in your hand and the typefaces are comfortable too. Now; are the translations the best? There are no \\"best\\" translations of Goethe; are there any \\"best\\" performances of Bach's \\"St. Matthew Passion\\"? No, that's why I have three sets of Bach's masterwork. But I can tell you that after reading much of about eight different translations of \\"Faust,\\" the one here ain't too shabby. Perhaps the translation of the great \\"Italian Journeys\\" is the \\"best\\" here, but the translator didn't have to make it rhyme or anything like that.

The set also seems far smaller than the size listed for it - too small for making a trail meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap price for a nice product","review":"I bought this for a trip to Hawaii that was to include an overnight camp out. I wasn't expecting much out of this cheap little mess kit, but I liked the idea of the little pot for water or soup and figured it would serve as a basic set of containers as to avoid the dreaded paper plates. The overnight got rained out, so I can't review it's use over flame (though the non-stick surface seems legitimate and well done), but as a bowl/2 plate/cup set this worked quite nicely and was easy to store (it all fits into itself.) I was with a group of hikers with some nice equipment, but we used my stuff first when we prepared meals. The only minor annoyance is the bolt that keeps the kit closed -- which you have to completely unscrew to get into. This is a common feature in these things but was a hassle when trying to get at the cup for morning coffee :) Oh, and that cup is a lot sturdier than it looks in the picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Nonstick\\" MESS","review":"The idea of me spending more money was so that I would get a better \\"deal\\" right? Well this was absolutely not the case. I just got gypped out of an extra $10. First of all, the whole messkit doesn't even fit together. I have to bend the bar to even get it to shut. I've owned messkits in the past, and this just does NOT go together properly. It was supposed to be nonstick... that was a joke. Even with oil in the pan, things stuck to it just as bad, if not worse than a regular pan. Also, the pot looked fine, the cup looked fine... and the lid looked fine... but the pan itself came to me (was supposed to be brand new) completely scratched up. It honestly looked like it had been used for a few years, then scrubbed down real good to look and smell clean and then thrown in here.

Though this era from 1971-75 pales in comparison to his classic 60's hits to many, this CD proved that James was continuing to work out his grooves at a high level. Even without milestone singles like \\"I feel Good\\" and \\"Papa Got a brand New Bag\\" in this complimation, this is his most potent batch of funk jams (in my opinion). This complimation finds James settled into his style. As a result his music is harder and looser than his earlier funk hits.No disrespect to his 60's era which is also great, If I had to pick a favorite era of songs, it would have to be this era. Brother James was not only the Minister of Super New New Heavy Funk, his music was the bible of the genre (and hip hop)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"We love this game.

Now, depending on how you look at it, and I'm not implying that this is how it was written but the way I listen to this song he is telling a tale of a dream in which he had another dream in which he further had another dream about the person to whom he is singing.

But I thought the romance part lacking. I did not feel any real chemistry from these two, in fact I don't see what or why they are attracted to each other. The only thing I can figure is Hastings is so grateful that a woman believes in his innocence he mistakes that for love. And Alice feels so bad about believing his guilt and trying to kill him, she mistakes the guilt for love.The mystery was really good, I never figured the person who was the master mind, but next time the author needs to develop the chemistry of the two main characters. I read the other reviews and this is my first Veryan book so I don't have anything to compare it to. I am going to read the first two, hopefully they will be better then \\"The Riddle of the Reductant Rake\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"More New \\"Old\\" Books","review":"As a loyal Veryan reader, I think this series lacks depth-inits plots, in its people, even in its locations.

Survival of the Fittest had no character development or understanding of its one dimensional antagonists whose motive was 'just because I can'. Such a disappointment. Dr. Kellerman, where are those clever books with credible characters and plausable situations keeping your readers on the edge of their seats? The conclusion of this book was not worthy of the story leading up to it. I miss When the Bough Breaks and many of the earlier stories with psychology woven tightly with the mystery.

Perhaps Dr. Kellerman should read more about their culture before he makes generalizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kellerman, but not his best","review":"The storyline was, to say the least, horrifying.

Book after book, Alex's life changes slightly and that is incorporated in the books, a nice touch. The large part of this book is usual Kellerman fare, with unsual cases from Delaware and Sturgis coming together coincidentally. And as the plot unfolds, the pieces slowly come together. In the end, our hero usually saves the day. In _Survival of the Fittest_ however, he is knocked unconscious and really doesn't do much except fight to stay awake. Just like I did by the end of it. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The first Kellerman novel I have ever read. The build up in characters and plot is scarce.

I spent less time concentrating on the plot and more time wondering if this man knew how to write.

And no description... just dialogue after dialogue...you don't have to be a writer to know that dialogue is the easiest thing to incorporate into a novel. Since I didn't know the characters, I didn't care about them...I couldn't wait to get through it, and once I reached the end, I wished I hadn't bothered. Anybody want my copy? Heck, I'll pay YOU to take it off my hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kellerman Does It Again!","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is, in my opinion, one of the best authors of suspense around today. While he brings us a continuing character, he loses none of the appeal. In this latest addition to his works, he brings us two new characters to become attached to in this marvelous novel.One believes that he does not tire of breathing new dimensions to his existing characters; but rather continues to love them as much as his readers.The storyline is compelling and he does not cheat us one iota.I, for one, would like to see his newest characters reappear in addition to his tried and true regulars. (Whether they be together or in a new series).Do yourself a great favor and read \\"Survival of the Fittest\\". I do not think that you will be disappointed in the least.Unlike some others authors (ie: Patricia Cornwell), his characters remain fresh and even more engaging.Get this book, curl up with a blanket and a cup of coffee (or tea if you are so inclined) and prepare for a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Little Book","review":"This is a terrific book.

When dealing with scalding hot liquids stability is a must. Very dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! Safety issues","review":"I've used my mother's juicer for years, an old aluminum banged up thing. It worked great but she lost it. I was so excited about this beautiful sturdy juicer. I absolutely love the glass lid that makes it so easy to check the grapes progress without losing steam. It has a pan for water that makes it nearly impossible to boil dry.But it has 2 problems and the second problem is a deal breaker. One is that the juicer basket on top holds enough grapes to make 5 quart jars of grapes but the bottom only holds enough juice for about 4 quart jars but you have to be very careful not to let the center section overflow, a pain when you make 50-100 jars of juice like I do. But the deal breaker is this juicer's spout is so high you can only get 1 3/4 quarts of juice out of it before you have to tip the whole unit forward to get the last 2 1/4 quarts out. That is just dangerous, especially for one person. I gave it one star for safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok","review":"Received our first steamer two weeks ago. The spout where the juice comes out was bent just a little and when we filled it with water it leaked. It is not welded just press fit. We returned that one and received a new one in the mail in a week. We juiced crabapples and it worked ok. The spot where the juice comes out is high on the side of the pan it means to get all the juice out you have to lift it and tip it which is tough since it does not fit together very well.Of course amazon is great and easy to use. The return was quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet Canning Aide EVER","review":"The Norpro steamer/juicer is the absolute best purchase of my entire canning and jelly-making career (some 45 years of it!). It is easy to use and gets the most juice from whatever fruit you are working with. I can't imagine trying to make grape, blackberry, plum, etc jelly without the Norpro steamer/juicer. I borrowed one from a friend and after using it once, I knew I had to have one for myself. Based on my recommendations, at least two other local friends have purchased their own (even though I offered to loan mine). It is the best idea to \\"come down the pike\\" in a long, long time. Thanks Norpo KRONA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a winner","review":"I gave it 4 stars because we haven't used it yet. However, the construction and quality appear to be excellent. The handles are heavy duty and will support a lot of weight. The boiler pan (very bottom part) has a very thick bottom for even heat distribution. We really like the glass lid. That will allow someone to check the overall process without losing heat / steam, or being burned by the steam because of unnecessarily lifting the lid. A nice bonus was finding out we can also use it as a steamer for blanching vegetables by taking out the middle pan, or just use the bottom pan by itself with the lid to boil large quantities of something. We're very pleased with it, so far, and will be excited to try it out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicer","review":"Haven't had a chance to use it yet. Fruit not ripe.

After three years, I can say that I've NEVER been in a situation that it couldn't handle (I don't do heavy demolition work). Its reciprocating mechanism is smooth, the variable speed is precise and its weight and folding design make it a very comfortable tool to use. I've compared it to the corded version, and it looks like they are basically the same tool. I've used reciprocal saws from other producers but have yet to find one as comfortable to use as the Hatchet. It cuts slightly slower than some other brands due to a lower motor speed, but it vibrates your hands a lot less as well and is much quieter. I just purchased a second one to have in reserve since Milwaukee stopped making this saw. What a pity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one thing..","review":"I generally agree with first review. I just want to say that you WILL NEED 2 batteries. If you are buying the tool for home use and will not be using it daily, be sure to cycle the batteries anyway.

This book was my introduction to Gordon Dickson, who has been one of my favorite SF authors ever since. This is a deeply plotted story that develops with the characters. The scope begins at a simple, personal level and builds to galactic proportions.

While there is a wealth of information on Victorian era customs and daily life, there is very little on the Regency period. Even when the book makes general statements these statements are often applicable only to the Victorian era. As a Regency writer myself, I would caution other writers not to rely on this book for Regency period information.There were great differences between the Regency and Victorian eras, obvious differences such as changes in fashion, or the rapid industrializiation, and more subtle differences such as transformations in public and private behavior.Recommended for Victorian authors, but for Regency authors you would be better served to seek out a copy of \\"The Regency Companion\\" by Laudermilk & Hamlin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to quality of its peers","review":"This work is structured more like a history book with various topics of life.

However, if you have major demo work to do, grab the corded Sawzall. The corded Sawzall can't be beat for big, difficult jobs, but this is the one to take when you have a few cuts to make or need to get into a tight space. The battery run time is actually quite good, but it you are in an attic or crawl space, you might want to take a spare battery just to make sure. It can be used one-handed, and the folding handle makes the saw very versatile.

When I used it to cut acopper pipe or one (I really mean one) 2x4 is ok. The worst is the Ni-Cad battery. On a full charge, its runs about 5 minutes and then the battery runs down and heats up to the point that it needs to cool down for 10-20 minutes before it can be recharged. As such, the tool is useless. More then once, I gave up and finish the job with a hand saw. They offer a Lithium ion battery/charger upgrade for $200! So, the message from Milwaukee I get is thus, spend over $200 for the hatchet kit and if you really want it to work, double the money. This is a upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"very useful design, terrible motor","review":"I loved the compact, flexible design-- my plumber sub borrowed it to saw a pipe that he thought would be impossible. Unfortunately, the Hatchet only came with one battery, which seemed to constantly be dead right when I really needed it (on a roof, 40 feet up, with no extension cord). So I bought another battery, which cost another $100 at Home Depot, and the stupid motor died. I had owned it for a year-and-a-half, so no warranty, even though I had used it fairly infrequently for most of that time (due to the constantly-dead single battery). So I was stuck with 2 batteries and a crapped-out tool. Useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milwaukee 18 volt---Exceptional!","review":"Excellent item!

I use it for dumpster diving in New York. If there's something too big to carry home on foot, I just pick the best part of it and use this baby to saw it off. This thing sawed through several 1 inch thick bolts in no time flat to release an interesting hunk of industrial debris... It is an indespensible tool for salvage or demo.

The sentiments are nice, but those texts are so incredibly cliche for weddings! Luckily, this book exists to save you from tired & trite wedding readings. \\"Into the Garden\\" has tons of non-religious poetry & prose on the subject of marriage & love, & even 1 or 2 unique biblical passages.

If you're looking for passages about love, commitment, and/or marriage, this book has something for everyone's taste. It also contains sample ceremonies for different styles of weddings, some of which are more creative than you will find in any \\"wedding planning\\" book.

I now give a copy to my kids when they reach about 9 years old. My youngest son who just turned 10 is in the middle of it now and is enjoying it as much as I did. It's a cute story with an interesting story line and surprise ending. I would also recommend it to adults as a fun read. Give it to a child that has begun reading. It would make a great kids movie. Give it to an adult that needs a break from Real Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be a clasic some day","review":"Heinlein, at his best, was probably the best pure storyteller of the twentieth century, and he is at his best here. The characters are delightful, especially Lummox, and the story just flows. You want to read it in one sitting, and sometimes I do.Heinlein, at his worst, was an annoying ideologue, and he avoids that here, simply letting the story tell itself. That is not to say there's no lesson here. Oh, no! You leave this book thoughtful. About pride, pretension, and the folly of underestimating those who aren't \\"like us\\", among other things.But don't be scared off by that. This is \\"juvenile\\" Heinlein at his best, which means it's juvenile only insofar as its protagonists are young. People will be reading this (willingly!) When his \\"adult\\" fiction is forgotten.

What do you do when the townspeople start rioting over your pet - and a delegation of Lummox's species comes to Earth to bring him home?This is the premise of Heinlein's \\"The Star Beast,\\" a humorous and comforting science fiction book. The cheerful resilience of John Thomas and his pet Lummox provide humor even in the book's darkest moments (which aren't very dark at all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Star Beast is a charming, sensitive look at ourselves","review":"The Star Beast is a delightful look at the different perspectives vastly different psychologies can have while telling a very entertaining story.

The characters have real motives and feelings. The plot hold up. The images engage the imagination without bogging it down.

It is less useful than a cheap laserjet. It takes forever to warm up to do a print job. It goes thru toner cartridges like a wino thru cheap wine -- it is NOT cheap on a per copy basis. And it is very cranky: when the toner cartridge is low, it not only warns you, it makes you jump thru hoops to get it to print anyway.

Don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupidly expensive at 15 cents per page","review":"I've owned this printer for over a year and it prints fine.However, I bought it because I thought it would be economical over the long run. I am going from memory, but when I bought it I think the promotional material claimed 4,000 pages per black cartridge and overall cost 4 cents per page. My last few cartridges I got way less then 1,000 pages. At $100 per, that's 10 cents a page right there. Add in all the other toners and I conservatively estimate 15 cents a page.That's terrible.

I contacted a service center and they want $100 just to look at it and $95/hr to fix it! Not worth the money we paid and this is the second Lexmark that has fallen apart. I realize that we have had it for 3 yrs, but it has not been used hard and why should we pay the price of the copier again. When it did work, it worked ok.

This printer doesn't read the instructions in these menus, consequently the only way to change tray type and paper stock is to manually make the changes on the printer itself which makes the printer useless in a conventional office setting with multiple users. After extensive discussions with Lexmark, they refused to fix the problem. At one point they said they would exchange my c530 for a c532 because it would work, then they retracted and said none of the c530x line works correctly with those menus. Other than that its very fast,and provides accurate colors,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toner fog on every page","review":"This printer works great out of the box, but once you've printed a few hundred pages, every page will contain a light gray background (toner fog). The only solution to this problem -- Lexmark customer support, with whom I have become VERY INTIMATE since purchasing this printer, has provided NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE -- is to purchase a new toner cartridge, which costs, at minimum, $89. This is what I did -- and guess what? After a few hundred pages with the new cartridge, toner fog on every page again.BUYERS BEWARE: I am not the only person to have experienced this problem with the C530DN.

You will burn through cartridges, deal with constant jams and spend a great deal of time trying to repair it. The Customer Service is awful as well.

I also own a Dell 3100CN, and whatever its other faults, printing the same load it gets 30% MORE than the nominal capacity. My Dell may cost a penny or two per page. The Lexmark is a hefty multiple.Otherwise, it is a superb printer. It prints beautifully, handles different papers with ease, and has a fantastic and easy to use menu system. It also integrated with my network with no problem whatsoever. In terms of quality and speed this is the best printer I have ever seen.

We bought 4 of these printers and I regret the day that we chose them. Out of the box it seems like a great printer. The first photos we printed were great. However we have gone through thousands of dollars of toner cartridges in a year and a half. And setting everyone to just print black and white did not help - we are still loosing toner in the color cartridges as well.

In We Are Not Alone, Breaking Benjamin further explores their musical possibilities with results which keep you humming along and bobbin' your head. I would say if I like any albums by Fuel you should give BB a try. Also, WANA is not necessarily a softer album, just more refined. Some of the verses are hard but are better blended in.

But I listened to \\"So Cold\\" on alternativeaddiction.com and was hooked. I bought their first album and, although not horrific, I didn't think it was was that great. But I was still dead set on buying We Are Not Alone.And I got it for $6.99. And I would pay $18. Which is a lot for this poor, recent college graduate to say :). The album is great for driving to and singing along. Stand out tracks are \\"So Cold\\", \\"Follow\\", and \\"Breakdown\\". I don't listen to a lot of music like this, so I can't compare them to many bands. But they are definitely better than anything on the radio right now. 3 Days Grace... those guys aren't too bad, but BB rocks :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!!!","review":"My friend and I are driving 5 1/2 hours to see them in a concert this summer n are so excited!

I liked the first album, but this one is contagious. They have melodic songs and songs that hit hard. \\"Forget it\\" reminds me of an 80s song.

Great job, I've become a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% awesomness","review":"this cd just down right kicks a--. there is not a bad song on the whole cd. this is a band that i think will be huge. their last cd saturate was a great cd, but this one just blows it out of the water. so cold, sooner or later, break my fall all are awesome songs. if you're trying to think weither or not to buy this cd, don't think anymore just buy it you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"There are a few wonderful songs on this cd.

I had not listen to breaking benjamin previously released cd's so this was all new for me. If the single so cold makes you wonder what else is on the cd and if the other tracks are any good, I have the answer to it, it is stunning!!!! About 10 out of the 11 songs are all great. Been listening to the cd for sometime now and still has not become old. Support the band and buy the cd.

Each song sounds the same, with that mass-produced \\"heavy\\" sound, save for two or three songs that are a little lighter (which, oddly enough, sound just like one another). If you really like what you heard on the radio and don't mind something unoriginal, get this disc and knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think we have a bunch of morons reviewing this CD!!!","review":"This CD is pretty average. The only good songs on the album are:1.So Cold (10/10)3.Follow Me (8/10)7.Sooner or Later (9/10)9.Away (8/10)Worth checking out only for those four songs... Buy it somewhere on eBay, i'm sure you can find it for less than $5 there. BTW, the last song on this CD is a total disaster. So stop giving it 7/10 or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleh","review":"I do admit, this album does have its problems and it is following a formula that a lot of other bands are following right now, but the big difference is, Breaking Benjamin is following the formula a lot better than most of the other nu-metal bands out there are doing. Also, there are some songs that you really can't help but love, like Follow, Away, and Forget It (the three that are in my opinion the best this band has to offer) and sometimes I start humming one of the songs off here and don't even realize it...so honestly, it just depends on which side of the river you camp on.

So needless to say that I was on pins and needles waiting for there newest release. Fast forward a little bit. I went out an bought the game Smackdown vs. raw, and the song \\"firefly\\" pretty much drives the soundtrack of the game. At first listen the song is amazing, but unfortunatly, it didn't take that long to get old. Yet it was good enough that I went out and got We are not alone as soon as I could and I must say that it did not dissapoint in the slightest. From start to finish this is an amazing album, and in fact it is an improvement from the first. I strongly believe that this album is going to be the catalyst for something much bigger for breaking benjamin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sophomore release from Breaking Benjamin","review":"A great cd from an awesome band. I don't think it's as good as their first album, but close. For those Tool fans that say this band has too much of a \\"mainstream sound\\", and doesn't live up to Tool; well then that's a good thing, cuz Tool is as \\"mainstream\\" as they come. Have an open mind with rock music. Cuz it's much better than the rest of the junk on the radio. So go buy/download this cd, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"breaking benjamin","review":"man breaking benjamin is really good , plus i like there influences, nirvana , korn , tool. what more can you ask for this album has some of the best songs ive ever heard,, saturate is really good too but i dont think its as blissful as we are not alone. i wish everyone in the world would get this album because this is probably the best thing happening in heavy rock music and just to note this on my oppinion the best song on the album is break my fall, its just a well written song and i wish i were the one who wrote it... id be dead right now from suicide but i got this album two days before i was planning to overdose and the music really helped me get through a rough period in my life,, thank you breaking benjamin."},{"rating":"1","title":"11 songs, all the same","review":"All the songs are the same, with the exception of so cold and simple design, which are are basically the same song. It's not lyrically they're the same, but they're all set up the same. Guittar rift, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, rift, chorus, every song is set up this way, and it becomes quite apparent after a few listens. I just listen to the first 3 songs, then give up and listen to something else. Here's the main problem i have. 1) I love the first 3 songs a ton, a ton, and every song is very catchy. 2) But it's so repetitive. These two things tell me that breaking benjamin has a lot of talent, but just got lazy and wanted the easy way out, which was make every song mainstream like. They didn't even make an effort to mix the songs up a bit, maybe put their 2 best songs - 1so cold and 2simple design in random places on the cd, just some effort. It really disapoints me that they have so much potential and did nothing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This is a great CD!! While it is a little poppy, it still has plenty of hard rocking beats and is a great addition to my collection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical follow the pack group...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I respect Breaking Benjamin's work as musicians, but it would be much more effective if it had come before the countless streams of mainstream rock bands with Maynard sound-alike vocals. I am not criticizing the vocalist's natural singing voice, but criticizing his knack for emulating Tool vocalist Maynard's style to every last sigh and slur. The album has some standout songs such as single So Cold, #3: Follow, and #7: Sooner or Later. However, even these songs fall into the void of forgotten music after a few listens.Bottom Line: Breaking Benjamin's We Are Not Alone sticks with the listener at the beginning but in the end falls short. Tool stepped \\"out of the box\\" to make their music and ended up creating a new \\"box\\" that artists such as \\"Breaking Benjamin\\" need to get out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a few decent songs....","review":"these guys are nothing new really. just a bunch of people who can play guitar and beat a drum who also use an annoying screaming voice in their songs. they do produce a decent song every now and then, but i cant stand the stupid sounding screaming. if they took that crap outta their songs, they might be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... at least it beats Greenday","review":"The good thing about this is that it is better than most mainstream piles of garbage. While Breaking Benjamin is in no way a \\"great\\" band, it is okay. Much better than Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and all those no-talent losers who have no right associating themselves with the word \\"rock\\".However, compared to real rock, in other words, the stuff you WONT hear on MTV every 5 minutes (or ever in fact), this album blows. If you like Green Day and crap like that, maybe buy this as a transition into REAL bands, like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, etc. After all, switching from poser-punk-pop like Green Day straight to Megadeth is a huge jump.If you insist on buying Mainstream crap, I'd say this is some of the better stuff you'll find on MTV. But if you want real music, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, they're so close...","review":"It's a shame this band is pretty much ub3r-l4m3 because their lead singer would win the award for coolest looking face in a pop-rock act.Plus, they are in a boat of about 50 bands trying to be the nice version of Tool that you can hug and go for walks with and bring home to mom and they won't try to slip their hands down your pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old canned pseudo-hard-rock bull squeeze","review":"What an unfortunate waste of $18.

But as far as 'professional' goes...you'd have to pay me to listen to any more. There are thousands of bands ready and, unfortunately, waiting to replace this one. Radio/mtv endorsement does not always entail an act of terrorism against musical standards, and most 'underground' bands never should have left the garage, but if you think this is the best rock has to offer then please, I'm begging you, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, you are alone and its because your album sucks","review":"I am a huge fan of \\"Saturate\\" and the sound of Breaking Benjamin, but \\"We Are Not Alone\\" pales in comparison to their other work. It stinks so bad that I almost cried while listening to it, given how much I loved BB's previous album. My expectations were very high for \\"We Are Not Alone\\" and I was sadly underwhelmed and disappointed. \\"So Cold\\" sounds like it was created during the \\"Saturate\\" sessions and is a great song in its own right, but it stands alone as the only song worth a second listen on the album. I'm not sure where to place the blame on this weak creation--the vocals are less rich than on \\"Saturate\\", the lyrics are lame (give \\"Firefly\\" a listen), and music is blah. Don't waste your time or your money. Pick up the new Earshot or UPO CD, where there's definitely some quality musicianship. I'm hopeful that BB will come back strong on their next album, but its hard to rebound from a stinker such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn + System of a Down - Original lyrics = ...","review":"Breaking Benjamin. When I first heard So Cold, it was yet another tone that I knew I heard before but couldn't quite remember. I realized where it came from a couple days ago when listening to System of a Down. Every song on here follows the same style that Korn came up with over ten years ago, and takes tones and beats perfected by some of the good bands that came from that. A better description of this cd would be The Deftones using a weaker voice and much simpler guitar riffs. There are even moments where he tries to sound like the singer from Tool.The Mix of so many other bands might have almost made this cd sound original, if it wasn't for new cd's by the Deftones and Korn comming out within a year of this one.Sorry Breaking Bemjamin, but you guys are about five years too late to be original, and four years too late to be worth anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I don't listen to this garbage anymore","review":"Ahhh, how nice it is to have broken the spell that nu metal casted over my music taste.

This 2nd release from BB is solid all the way through, and the cd goes by so smooth and quick that you are disappointed there isn't more, so you listen to it again. They have definately improved and made it to the 2nd cd when so many bands cannot seem to duplicate the magic of their first releases. A must have cd in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a let-down","review":"I was lured in by \\"so cold\\" which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome track, but I felt the rest of the cd was mediocre.

The movie has a decent foundation to build an acceptable horror/slasher flick, but on all accounts they just pissed on it. The acting isn't terrible, the music is actually really freaking good, but it lacks any kind solid story, and you can find more believable violence on daytime public TV.

Night Shyamalan (sic) films.If you are (like I was 24 hours ago) not an X-Files fan, just check this one out.

The player then has to complete the track and finally race the track under a certain time limit. If the track is not drivable in that time, the puzzle has not been solved correctly.This is great fun and adictive. It is a new idea and those are rare these days.

I tried installing the game on 3 different computers, but it only worked on one. I could live with the installation hassles if the program was easier to use, but the navigation and usability is terrible. There is no online help (except for one file which describes the installation process), and no printed documentation.

I wanted one that had more than 3 levels - on-off-heat, I wanted on-off-low-high, this works better for me since I have long hair and have to stay under the dryer for long period of time. I like the bonnet, because I don't have to stay in one place inorder for my hair to get dried.

So I do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna. (Not sure why the byline says \\"from a 12-year-old reader.)The high setting does a great job activating the henna, but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if I did not hold it up manually. Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is \\"cooking\\".It may work better with rollers, but the best idea would be to make a lighter bonnet that puffs up on its own, like the one that came with the old Carel dryers.When I called the manufacturer to tell them that the bonnet acts that way, they were defensive. If they could fix that problem, they'd have a much better dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeouch! This dryer gets way too hot!","review":"So frustrated with this dryer.

If you plan on buying this unit and only use it in the home or car, that's fine. But if you plan on using an external pack supply,(for example an Lithium ion battery pack) forget it. I was told by the company the there is NO EXTERNAL BATTERY SUPPORT, period. If I had know that I wouldn't have bought this DVD player. I've seen others in the same format that can be supported by an exteral power supply. So be forewarned before you buy, you can use it ONLY AT HOME WITH THE AC ADAPTOR OR IN THE CAR WITH THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADAPTOR.

I sent it back after a few days.Comes in a nice carrying case, and the design is very good, but picture/sound are bad. Don't buy it.It's too bad that it isn't better, because there are not many screens this small to chose from. Sharp does not get down to this size.rjp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great convenient unit.

These were drying my daughter's hair even further. First of all, you can spray this formula just once and the hair was detangled without a lot of massaging or combing. I could comb through her hair without the tears. It creates a beautiful shine and it is not oily!! It dries quickly so you don't have to worry about using it in colder climates.

If you are sensitive to menthol I wouldn't use this, but for those with extra-sensitive and/or razor-bump-prone skin pick this one. I have a complicated routine where I use American Crew Pre-shave oil(fairly expensive) on my face before applying a small amount of this gel in my hand, adding a little water, and working into a lather. I use Nivea for Men Extra Soothing Aftershave Lotion for extra moisturizing after the shave and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Foaming Wash(not available on Amazon!

Really, the fact that the code didn't work is ridiculously unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have returned this item. It did not work as it should. The alarm is deafening.

DO NOT buy if you need the away mode. Actually, I do not even think that when you are inside the home, this will help you for the same reasons. The window unit is funny. If you close the window, it stops beeping... In a nutshell, another way of wasting your money.

The main alarm is quite loud, defeaning almost, as when we tested it (we placed in on an unused side door) we had to place a sweatshirt over it so as to not wake everyone in the neighborhood. The smaller (window) alarms are not as loud, but will get the job done just fine.Simple, yet effective, I would recommend this system to anyone who has only 10 minutes, a screwdriver and a need to alarm their windows/doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super simple security system","review":"I bought 2 of these & covered all pertinent doors & windows, installation is a breeze, use is easy.... alarm is loud ! the chime is nice too.

However, it was difficult to hear the alarm from two rooms over, and it would definitely not wake me out of bed. I noticed that there was some controversy over the loudness of the alarm in previous reviews. So I measured the loudness objectively with a SPL meter. Three feet directly in front of the alarm, the sound level was 92 dB. Three feet off to the side of the alarm, the sound level was 86 dB. So optimistically, the alarm is 28 dB lower than advertised. 10^2.8 = 631, so the alarm is 631 times less loud (in terms of energy) than advertised. 92 dB is about the sound of a truck from 10 meters away, as opposed to the sound of a jet engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't always work","review":"I purchased enough door and window alarms to arm my entire ranch house. Arranged to have my handyman come over to install the system.

My house is not unique. In my area all the houses were built this way. No where on the packaging did it stipulate what type of windows you could use the product on. We brainstormed everything we could think of but they just don't work. I'm sure it's a nice product if you can use it. I just wish the company would tell you certain types of windows aren't able to accomodate the units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very LOUD alarm set!","review":"As many has said, this alarm set is extremely LOUD!!! Especially the door alarm. I feel much more secure with these alarms at home. The three window alarms will stop alarming if you close the door, so as some customer has said, this could be a drawback.

While I understand wanting to save money, the 120DB sound can cause potential hearing loss and after having the thing go off twice, my left ear is hurting and one of my pets is traumatized. Whether hearing has been affected remains to be seen. I can't imagine anyone with children or pets wanting this device in their home. If it goes off while you're not there, it seems to me that it could kill your pet with their sensitive hearing. If an intruder comes into your home, he/she will certainly regret it, and so will you. The warning about hearing loss is in very small print and not even noticeable unless you read the entire little booklet.

I've accidentally set it off twice so far. You get a lot of noise out of three AAA batteries.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This item was terrible. The window alarms are rather useless as they either make a very loud chiming sound or a mediocre volume alarm. Their main flaw is that the intruder can immediately silence the alarm by either breaking this small device or TURNING A SWITCH. There is no passcode for the window units. The door unit is even worse. The device doesn't want to accept the passcode sometimes. Sometimes it simply flashes a red light when the door is opened, even though the alarm is on \\"home\\" mode (which means the alarm should immediately sound when the door is opened). All of this basically means that I do not trust the alarm and I am so annoyed with it, I am sure I will not use it. I cannot even return the thing since it comes in one of those plastic molded containers that force you to mutilate the package to get to the product. Thanks amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of crap","review":"I bought this package hoping it would work so I wouldn't have to spend money on a monthly home security system like ADT and Brinks.

I have a two story home with all the bedrooms upstairs. I mounted these alarms on the doors and windows downstairs.

It's very easy to install. The only thing I would like it to have is maybe some kind of indication that the alarm (in Home mode) is on. Sometimes I forget that I had set the alarm the night before and open my door and the alarm goes off! But the sound is very loud, considering it's a small unit. (Enough to scare any thief away and your immediate neighbor to hear.)Also, my husband actually suggests that I carry the smaller window alarm piece with me when I walk at night so when I need help I can trigger the alarm with the switch. :)Best of all is the price. You get a peace of mind for just $25!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This word sort book is an awesome resource that I use in my class during Word Study. I also have the other books in the series (each one focuses on different skills/grade levels.) This particular book is for K-1 readers. There are a pictures instead of words for the word sorts. I use this series in my classroom as a center activity and sometimes as an activity for the entire class."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned","review":"Not at all helpful. I bought two of the series and returned both of them. Mostly education jargen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocket science","review":"I have had nothing but trouble trying to use this. PiMover is a great idea, but unfortunately the documentation is written in something that looks similar to English, but makes little sense! It's one of those where foreigners write the manual, and no one reviews it for English sensibility. I managed to transfer a few files by playing around with it, but even now don't know how I did it, so trying to repeat it means starting all over again. For me, this has been a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Palm OS 3.1","review":"I'd give this gimmick zero stars if I could. I bought this not realizing that I would not be able to access the programs directly from the memplug. In order to use the files, you have to move them back to the internal memory. Which means you might have to move a file from the internal memory over to the memplug. Who wants to play musical programs? The company has come up with a \\"fix\\" for the problem. They have a new program called \\"pi direct\\" which allows you to use the programs directly. BUT THERE IS A HITCH!! You can ONLY use pi direct if you are running Palm OS 3.5. If you have 3.5, chances are that you using one of the newer machines with more memory anyway. If you have a Solo or Deluxe, save your bucks. I sent my memplug back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physician","review":"Being a physician, I need lots of memory to store my medical programs and I was excited about this product. But I found that the PI Direct program did not always work, my system continued to crash and it was not reliable. This is not good when a patient is dying and I need information quick. So I returned it and I am still waiting for my refund. If it did work, I would be very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Worst","review":"I bought a visor Platinum specifically for the ability to increase the memory.Of the modules sold , or companies that produce modules, the MemPlug seemed the best option as it has a smartMedia (or other) card. I can then transfer info, etc. I planned to put a lot of medical information on the card.It is awful. I get no help from the company. I am unable to read anything from the cards; I cannot transfer material back and forth and use it. The instructions are non-existent and there seems no way to get any info out of the company. But then they have misspellings in the module directions....I would not have gotten a Handspring if I had known this! I will probably purchase another brand, either Palm or Sony that does have a memory expansion option.I will be telling other to not buy a Handspring product, IF memory is a need, especially the other physicians in my practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware reliability weak","review":"Product works great for a few months, then becomes unreadable despite all updates, Visor stops recognizing the module."},{"rating":"2","title":"MemPlug is the Best HS Springboard","review":"I have to say first that at the beginning I went through a few resets but it was mainly my fault. I was using bad hacks. After everything was repaired it became my life. I would never leave home without my MemPlug. I'm using a 32MB Smart media Card and I think I have less than 8MB left. Can you imagine that? I thought a 16MB Flash Module was big but I was wrong. MemPlug is a killer module for the Visor that makes other PDA's look like cheap organizers. Yes, my Visor Prism is much more like a LapTop with a MemPlug."},{"rating":"2","title":"works like a charm","review":"my visor pro has become an 80 MB device (64 MB smartmedia card + 16 MB visor internal memory). now all my technical specs and school notes are stuffed into my PDA. this product handled all those files very well.i have a couple of smartmedia cards used for my digital camera and its great that i can use it on both camera and PDA. an added bonus is that smartmedia cards consume less current therefore less battery charge than compact flash or memory stick.my advice - if you need more room to grow, buy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Come Close to this [thing]","review":"Fell apart in my hands upon first use. Software not preloaded, indicating that it proabably had never been tested. Mechanically fragile-and memory card doesn't fit cleanly. This module is for backup of important data--well, you won't feel very protected using this thing since it could fail upon the first attempt to retrieve your data. If this was the only way to back up your Handspring, I'd say get rid of the Handspring and go back to paper and pencil since with this you'll probably lose that important data just when you need to retrieve it after a Handspring hard reset.STAY AWAY FROM THIS [thing]NEGATIVE 5 STARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad With Visor Deluxe","review":"The MemPlug may work just fine, with other visor models, but it needs Palm OS 3.5 if you want to run app's or access files directly from the module. The Visor Deluxe comes with Palm OS 3.1. You can still store stuff on the card, but you have to move apps or files back to RAM any time you want to use them. It makes retrieving data a slow and cumbersom process."},{"rating":"2","title":"I send this to everyone I know who has a stroke","review":"It sounds horrible, but as I get older, many relatives are prone to strokes. I've had three in the past couple of years. Each time, I have sent them this book. To some extent, a lot of what's in this book are things that he is largely repeating from some of his earlier ones; but it is condensed (without most of the autobiography of other works) into lessons for life, particularly after a stroke, that are inspirational and surprisingly uplifting, without being too treachly or trite.Sometimes people complain \\"why should ws listen to someone just because they're a celebrity?\\" This book is a counterpoint to that - it reminds us that just because someone is a celebrity, doesn't discount them from reminding us what real life is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so...","review":"Do not buy this book. Not really worth it. I think the perl black book would be better and teach you more.

Keeping with the philosophy of perl - there is more than one way to do it - the book shows you ingenious ways to work with this powerful language. This is a true hacks book and meant mostly for the advanced user. Before reading this book, I didn't even realize what I didn't know and I rate myself just short of contributing to CPAN. Even if you have read all the popular books - Perl Programming, Perl Best Practices etc. you'll still find a lot of gems.Simply put if you like perl, you'll love this book.

For a book which is only 220 pages in length, I thought that was a big let down. Instead, it was all about Lisa and her antics and how she tries to get by without her husband. Very BORING! I liked Alex's character when he finally shows up but I never liked Lisa which doesn't say a lot about the book. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"I loved this book. The heroine showed a depth of emotional growth, and along the way, she fell in love. The hero is well drawn and I thought the plot was engaging. The humor is classic Criswell. I don't think fans will be disappointed. I sure wasn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort to find","review":"Ne'er do well middle child Lisa shocked her parents and flew to Vegas with a man she barely knew and got married. After three months of living with his stuffy wealthy parents, she flees back to Philly and struggles to find work (despite no marketable skills) and a new life without Alex. After several weeks, Alex decides to woo his woman back and became the type of bad boy she goes for. Off with the Brooks Brothers suits and on with the Levi's. Adding intrigue is her controlling Italian mother.I love Millie Criswell, but this book just didn't cut it for me. There is no real chemistry between the leads, in fact, Alex is doesn't make an appearance in the book until half way through. And the controlling mother is a little too similar to the smothering Italian mother in her Baltimore series of books (\\"The Trouble with Mary\\"). With a stale plot and no real chemistry, this one is for real fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying and insulting","review":"It's hard to believe that readers will find much pleasure in the antics of this dim-bulb heroine. \\"Immature\\" doesn't even come close to describing 27-year old Lisa, who lives at home, can't hold a job, has no marketable skills, and marries a man she has known for a whopping three weeks. Alex, the estranged husband, labors mightily to win back his bride, but the biggest question has to be, \\"Why bother?\\" Reading about the antics of a woman determined to be a screwup is a waste of time. Stereotypical mothers-in-law and a plot that goes nowhere make this a disappointing effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Relaxing","review":"Lights off, a few candles, glass of wine....it doesn't get better than this!
