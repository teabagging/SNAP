But soon, secrets from his past start to slowly destroy the new identity he created for himself. Everyone starts to wonder why he is so different and why he really has all the crazy Friday night parties. All this leads to the end in which a huge disaster takes place, which also reveals his crazy obsession.Jake Reinvented has quite a unique story which shows exactly how much some people do to become popular. Everything is described in an excellent way as well so you can visualize everything easily. Jake Reinvented is written very well and has a lot of amusing bits as well as some high action bits and some sad bits. It is gripping through out.

The ceremonies of the Sacraments are equally astounding. Maybe the part I like best, though, is the various devotions for before and after communion.I can't go to daily mass, but I do follow along using this missal. I like to read the brief commentary on the particular day, be it a feast of a saint or Mary, or whatever. I never heard of some of these saints before!The book itself is wonderfully crafted.

How come we hadn't heard of these before - they would have been pretty difficult to keep secret.

For $105.98 (after 6% MI sales tax) I got the same amount of memory (1GB) and expandablity in inexpensive MD Cards. So for $150 I could have gotten a 1GB Ipod Shuffle, or I could get the Sony MD Mp3 Player with 6GB or more!Overall this Mp3 Player is a great option if you do not want to pay a fortune for an Apple Ipod.

I found this book unorganized. The authors did not take the time, for instance, to seperate paragraphs for the partner and the bed rester. Consequently, you'll be reading something meant for you, and suddenly realize that part of the message is actually meant for your partner. Also the two authors did not always agree on things, which is fine, but because the book is so poorly organized, it just comes off as contradictory to itself. They spent much too much time on things that were not entirely pertinent to our situation, and would throw an important piece in here and there.I read The Pregnancy Bed Rest Book by Amy Tracy and loved it.

The exercises are fairly good, particularly in the area of conversation. Some of the listening comphrehension exercises could be better-written though. The audio segments are rather long and divided into only 2 parts.I'm a big fan of the entire North Star Focus on Listening and Speaking Series (It's in 4 parts--basic, intermediate, upper-intermediate, advanced.).

Once again, character development is lacking as are development of relationships between characters. She turns her characters into lovers without giving the reader much of a reason for them to be falling into bed with eachother.There are also some MAJOR plotholes in this story. In fact, this story has one of the biggest plotholes I have EVER read in a published book. I don't want to give too much storyline away but the plothole I am speaking of involves one of the police suspects for murder. The author tries to make us believe that the police would suspect a 14 year old girl for the brutal rape and beating death of her mother??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ride","review":"\\"Blood Drive\\" has an inexorable tug to it because the main character is so strong. I don't read (much) paranormal fiction but I found Anna Strong to be completely compelling because she's so grounded in her two worlds, so in touch with her desires. She makes mistakes, but she keeps moving and stays focused. She's impossible not to like. The writing is strong and consistent and you feel her anger at the demons who prey on the innocent and feel a sense of relief when she confronts a surprising enemy. Anna Strong thinks things through, follows her instincts, and never lets go. She's in the hands of a writer with a master touch and never-wimpy, ever-tough style. The book is sort of like the great opening line: \\"The guy squirms against me like a worm on a hook.\\" Enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you sympathise with the stupid??","review":"After an OK debut in the series, for some reason the lead character has a brain explosion that leaves her oh so stupid that it removes any joy in seeing the world that Stein has created be developed any further.

The light cover is kinda ugly IMO. While the shape is nice, glass looks like it was spray painted to make it more opaque. Unattractive. My biggest objection, however, is the light output. This fixture only uses two candelabra bulbs, which come in 60 watts and less. In the evenings, I feel like I'm eating by candlelight, which is not the effect I desire. I'm disppointed.

You could fit about 1/2 of a large escargot in each hole, and the hole wasn't deep enough for the escargot to 'bask' in the garlic-butter. The garlic-butter would have spread across the entire dish, very thinly. I'd be surprised if the garlic-butter didn't burn. The butter that would've remained in the holes wouldn't be enough to soak toast points. So, I ended up sending these back and buying, more expensive (Revol:Revol Belle Cuisine BC1012-1 7 Inch x 6.25 Inch Escargot Plate, 12 Holes), dishes that held 12 escargot per plate. The holes in the Revol dishes are nice and deep, though they'll still hold only about 1/2 of a large escargot.

One has the \\"onion soup bowel\\" handle and is hollow with a breathing hole so dishwater can get into the inside cavity - not good!. They will now go to the garbage. My second set is close to this one but has smaller recesses for the escargot and that's okay for escargot only but they can't be used for stuffed mushrooms as an alternate dish which I can't imagine if you like escargot you would be opposed to, so they will be thrown away also.I have four of these and trust me.... they will get plenty of use in my Snowbird group in Yuma.If you buy some of these and you do not like them (can't imagine that), attach a reply to this and I will buy them off you for a slightly reduced price or hey! maybe you would like a set of my other ones in trade?This is a \\"can't go wrong\\" purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great escargot plate - you can also use it for lobster bites","review":"I like this product and I prefer the version made out of white china to the stainless steel. The price is great, the only thing I do not like that it is made in China (we simply import too much from there and the other reason is that I am afraid with Chinese products that there are problems like with the Chinese drywall or toys, otherwise I would have given it five stars).

It delivers neither. It's not a true 'chill out' dance CD - just having mellow music with attempts at soft beats or rhythm doesn't really count. The Flamenco playing is mixed way too low and while I don't claim to be a Flaminco expert, even I can tell it's pretty weak playing so I'm not sure who would really be happy with this CD. It's also not world or new agey enough to use as mediatative as I think most everyone will be displeased with the weak musicianship associated with this CD.

If you listen closely you can hear some delightfully clever variations thrown in by some obviously brilliant musicians. You can almost see the members of the orchestra smiling at each other's surprising ingenuity. This is classical music as it was originally meant to be played -- these musicians are not slaves to the score, but rather, look upon the score as a starting point for sharing with the audience their own fresh musical insights. In this case, those insights happen to be spot on, emphasizing the warmth and almost Mozart-like playfulness of this music. In short, there is no better recording of Handel's Water Music, nor a finer example of classical music at its most exalted, or most intimate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narratives within the Quantum Universe","review":"Susan Strehle has assembled a group of contemporary novelists whose aims are to pursue \\"art\\" and \\"actuality\\" within fiction.

Here, English philosopher Jonathan Wolff carefully and lucidly reconstructs ASU's main arguments. Along the way he points out numerous problems and holes in ASU -- raising huge difficulties for its libertarian approach to politics -- but he is scrupulously fair and acknowledges that Nozick has changed the face of political theory.

The Bible clearly states \\"who\\" we are in Christ, and as Christians, we are told to \\"meditate\\" on Him and His Word. If you are a Christian, then take note that the author is using techniques that do not line up with the Bible. While she uses scripture as reference, the reader should know there is another side to her teaching. There is a book by Currot, a Wicca witch, in which the above techniques are also found.

I found Picnic to be very suspenseful and well written but am left with more questions then answers. Highly recommended for those that don't mind filling in the blanks about what might have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picninc at Hanging Rock -Fact or Fiction","review":"I read this book and was fasinated. I saw the movie and wondered why they left out the final correspondence which seemed to be pivital to the death of the head mistress. After further investigation, even though the forward leads you to beleive that this was a real incident, this did not happen nor did anything like this happen. Even the begining of the movie suggests that this book was based on real events. Sort of disappointing. However it is a quick and worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much description and bordeom.","review":"This book has way too much description and it doesn't leave the reader to imagine anything for themselves.The mistery is not too bad but the story line is not capturing at all.

It is Lindsay's only piece of fiction work (nothing in it is true), and we should be thankful. Her story is haphazard, inconclusive and without any meaning. Her 'extra' chapter, which has a punt at explaining the disappearances, is ridiculous and disappointing. She is, however, able to emulate the style of writing fairly successfully,and creates some kind of interaction between characters. Not a must read, more of a i'm-very-bored-and-there's-nothing-else-to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Weir's genius is perhaps best displayed","review":"in his ability to perceive that a masterpiece of a film could be made from this very mediocre book.

Go reread Jane Austen or Patrick O'Brian."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 'Pro'....Many 'Cons'.....","review":"Pro: The raised handle allows firmer cleaving.Con: First of all, this is NOT a 'chef's' knife. Chef's knives have a rounded blade that allows the chef to rock the knife as it is used. This one is along the lines of the Santoku and is more cleaver-like.Stainless steel will eventually dull (Remember those cheapo 'Never Needs Sharpening' knives?) and will have to be professionally resharpened.The country of origin, although not mentioned (Japan is hinted at.), is likely China where virtually all the Calphalon cookware and knives are produced.Do yourselves a favor, spend a little more and get a real chef's knife from Wusthof or Henckels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edge Prone to Cracking","review":"This has happened twice to us with these knives. The first one, I sent back under warranty. The second time, I think I'll just stop using the knife. The thin inner layer is prone to cracking if the blade gets just the smallest chip. With other knives, you can sharpen these chips out, with the Katana, it forms a crack the goes all the way up to the layered cladding. I think the materials design, at least in the 8\\" Chef's knife, is lacking. We aren't cutting nails here, either. If you have one of these knives, be very careful not to allow it to bump up on anything else in the sink or dish drainer. In Calpalon's defense, we have several other kinves in this line and the 8\\" Chef's knife is the only one that exhibits this tendency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Casual?

Ideally a play should do what *only* a play can do that no other medium can; Delillo understands this. Here his theme of media-saturated alienation finds a heightened, poetic expression, at once more theatrical, more immediate and more accessible than his novels. For those with a little imagination looking for a highly distilled dose of Delillo that really packs a punch, look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a fan of Don Delillo and can usually defend him against most accusations of pretentiousness, unbelievable plots and dialogue and one dimensional characters. But I'm afraid I cannot defend him against these accusations with regards to Valparaiso. Perhaps as a performance - it is afterall written to be performed - I would view it differently - but I don't think so. Valparaiso is not a good story, it is not a good play - Chuck Palahniuk's Survivor is far more successful at dealing with similar themes and it's that book which I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"a blatantly obvious satire","review":"Writing satire is fun and easy. As long as your work is satirical, you don't need real dialogue, well-formed characters, or an interesting plotline. Delillo satirizes the media, so he is allowed to get away with laughable dialogue and characters with one dimension (at best). I agree with another reviewer who said that Chuck Pahlaniuk's Survivor was superior to Valparaiso. Survivor, which also satirizes the role of the media in today's culture, is funnier, more inventive, and a much better read. Please do yourself a favor and skip this play. The only bright spot to reading it will be that while it will waste your time, due to its short length it will not waste too much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review may be longer than the play itself.","review":"I poured milk on my cereal as I began Valparaiso. My cereal was still crispy when I finished the final words of this all too short piece. Is it a testament to how short our spans of attention have become?

The Amazon product description says it is cord/cordless and accepts worldwide voltage. WRONG! The MS-5200 does, but the MS-5100 doesn't. The 4 differences are: 5100 won't operate as a corded shaver if the battery is low, 5100 only accepts 110 voltage, 5200 has an extra battery meter, and 5200 has 5 extra minutes of battery life in reserve.

It seems remington wants 200+ dollars for one like i had been using & no way I would waste my money fore that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Shaver Made me Dread Shaving","review":"This shaver cut my neck every single time I shaved. It also took a very long to time to shave (5 minutes) and the battery life was the worst of any shaver I've ever had. There was no quick-charge nor can it be used while it plugged in. I got only 2-3 shaves per charge. Also, the pop up trimmer broke and was stuck in the up position. Moreover, the foil cover broke after only a few uses.I bought this shaver because I used my previous Remington for over 10 years. However, this one was clearly much lower quality. I switched to a Panasonic and now my neck never bleeds! Shaving is now pleasurable and is now much faster. The battery life is much better, too. I am so glad that I gave up on the Remington MS-5100. I will never buy Remington again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor razor","review":"This is by far the worst razor that I have ever bought. It misses so many hairs that I spend more time going over the missed hair using the electric razor than if I were to just use a blade. By the time I get done trying to get all of the hairs, my skin is pretty much raw as well. Also, it is extremely loud! It also doesn't operate as a corded razor so if the battery runs out then you have to wait all day for it to charge. I honestly can't think of a good thing to say about this razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over 5 years, still going strong","review":"I've had this electric shaver for over 5 years, the longest I've had any single unit. Some observations:*Very comfortable shave*Ample cutting devices included to get every detail*Durable*Battery has held up really well - Manual says you can't overcharge the battery. I thought I knew better, but this is true. The battery has held up so well and I leave it charging all the time.Although you can't use it with the cord, it's really not a big deal - especially because the battery is so reliable and durable. And as far as charging internationally, you can use a voltage converter.Extra nose & ear hair trimmer works very well. I use it weekly with rechargeable batteries.The only thing I really would've liked is a charging stand.

I can tell the razors are dulling a little but that's to be expected. Still getting a close shave.

I think I paid $25 can't beat that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold battery charge","review":"The shaver gives a good shave but after 2 weeks of use, the red charge light would come on after about 2-3 shaves and had to recharge it...I called Remington and they were very good about the problem and said they are sending me a new razor immediately........Very good customer service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has really dropped","review":"I have used this same line of shavers for over 30 years and I was always very happy with them. I bought this to replace the prior model, that began to fall apart and was much poorer quality than previous versions. This one is a major step down. These razors were always loud and missed whiskers, but they gave a close shave and they were convenient. This one is really loud, loud enough to wake up family members sleeping on another floor of the house. Also, this particular one only works on the battery, not when plugged in with the cord. It still gives a close but much less comfortable shave, worse than a blade. It is also suppose to be washable but when I ran the heads under the tap the whole housing leaked water from the cracks. It still ran but I worry about safety and durability.

So the dog doesn't correlate the noise with the barking any longer, he doesn't know what is happening. Secondly, even when it goes off it doesn't phase the dog at all. But think about it, if someone said, I have a powerful sound blaster that will really annoy the humans next door, it will stop them in their tracks. Then said \\"Just let me hook it up to these 4 tiny D batteries\\", you would laugh at them. But here we expect the same thing for an aggressive dog. There was an initial effect, i think the dog was just curious. But after a few days it wore off and the dog just assumed that noise was natural. Now he barks like before. Sorry, it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"bak solver X40","review":"Dont waste your money on this. You can only return it if its unused. Well, how do you know if it works or not if you dont try it. The dogs were a little quieter at first but now they are used to it and they don't notice it at all. I've only hade it one week. It goes off with every sound so the dogs dont relate it to there barking. So Im back to square one. Its realy not my place to train the neighbors dogs. I just want them to STOP BARKING.Big wast of my money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last very long","review":"I left it outside, as is to be expected, and turned it off for a few months.

Our German Shepherd would start to bark and sleek away, but then our Pug would go ballistic and cause our Shepherd to bark. Another thing is we do not have a perfectly square or circle backyard, so when my dogs would bark on the side of the house, down our 100ft. RV path, the Bark Solver could not reach. I tried moving it about my backyard, but it could not cover the entire yard (which isn't really that big). We would need 2-3 Bark Solvers angled in different directions. This just did not work for us. Good idea, and may work for someone with a smaller yard and hopefully it will not make your dog worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"Hi allI ordered this product because it was advertised \\"range up to 200 yards\\".Unfortunately I had to learn that this unit is completely useless and has no impact on the dog at all (distance abt 40 ft).So I returned the item. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a try!","review":"This is a recording on period instruments, which I am never a fan of. Instruments of this period had a lot of problems with intonation and they can be quite difficult to play. Thus, a lot of the recordings one hears with this variety of instrument can be substandard. And me, I personally like the sound of a full modern orchestra, even for the Mozart Requiem. I purchased the Abbado recording with the Berlin Philharmonic as well, but I'll have to say I prefer the Gardiner. His tempos are brisk, especially in the Dies Irae, which I really like. And it sounds really good. What more can I say?So for those naysayers, give this a try. I don't think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy buena version,altamente recomendada","review":"Escuchando varias veces esta versión me doy cuenta que la perfomance mostrada por Gardiner en las obras de Mozart es exquisita,en esta versión del Requiem los tiempos son buenos (salvo en el Kyrie,debió ser un poco mas brillante),el coro y los solistas sobresalientes(cantando como en la época de Mozart,sin un vibrato operístico),la orquesta tiene un rendimiento muy bueno ya que tocar con instrumentos de la época no es nada fácil especialmente en la afinación. En cuanto al campo musical las frases estan claramente definidas y los matices son buenos y ni que decir de la ejecución con el carácter necesario para interpretar Mozart,fenomenal realmente,Gardiner como siempre no decepciona y sigue muy bien dirigiendo Mozart en todo sentido,vale comprarlo!!RECOMENDADO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart's Requiem?","review":"If you don't know the Mozart Requiem this is one of the recordings that will make you think the work is overestimated. The orchestra sounds thin, the violins sound like cat-singing, but on the other hand - you might say they match the standard of the soloists. If you want to hear artistic singing from singers who know their job you go to Seefried, Simoneau etc. on Bruno Walter's recording. Walter will also tell you that this is a wonderful work. The worst part of this Requiem is not really the orchestra or the singers. Gardiner contributes very much to the misery with his very \\"forced\\" way of conducting. as if his attitude is that the music is so lousy, that he - Gardiner - has to improve on it. In stead of studying musicology he should study Mozart. Beechams once said that musicologues knew everything about \\"ology\\" and hadn't got a clue about music. This recording makes me think he's right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY AT THIS PRICE","review":"I bought this off here for under five dollars maybe....a month or two ago....this is a cheap, easily breakable (portable like) mini doodle pro...and I just saw it at target for 4 dollars.....so if it doesn't go back down from the ridiculous price of over twenty dollars....someone is trying to rip someone off!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"This sphygmomanometer was not calibrated properly and was deemed not usable by my home care agency.

The license is a piece of paper so the FCC may track who is using GMRS frequencies, nothing more. They used to do the same for CB users in the 70's. They do not track FRS freqs because of the low output power of FRS radios. Range is affected by output power of the radio but mostly by obstacles between you and the other radio. Trees, walls, buildings, hills, etc. reduce the range considerably. A true test of range is on open water or unobstructed Line-Of-Sight from one hilltop to another. (Not everyone has a boat) Buy three different sets from different brands and try them near a lake to test, return the ones that are not to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed.","review":"Only one previous reviewer has mentioned the huge flaw in this recording that prevented me from listening to it with any enjoyment. This is that, unfortunately, you can hear the prompter whispering virtually every line to the singer before it is sung, the prompter becomes part of the performance and that is inexcusable. I can't understand how the producer let this happen, surely they could have recorded a few performances where the prompter wasn't needed. The funny thing is quite a bit of this ring isn't 'live' but was recorded at rehearsals so there is no excuse for the audible prompters. Hopefully in the future they can find a way to remove this part of the soundtrack, if they can then this will go straight into the top 5 recordings of the ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like being in Bayreuth!","review":"This live-recording of \\"The Ring\\" was my 2nd encounter with Wagner's gigantic masterpiece. The problem in finding the perfect recording of the Ring is that no one recording is perfect throughout all the four operas; i.e. the Sieglinde may be great in Die Walküre, but the Hagen in Götterdämmerung lacks in voice characterization. However, Böhms live-recording is the most \\"equally\\" cast and conducted version. The conducting is lively and dramatic - sometimes too rapid, like in the foreplay to Rheingold. The singers are generally very good, the best of the late sixties. Of course, Nilsson is stunning, and Windgassen, with his characteristic voice, is a worthy adversary. But the \\"minor\\" roles are cast well, too: Greindl as Hagen is terrific, and King and Rysanek as the twins in Walküre are moving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful performance","review":"Bohm is a meticulous conductor who sticks closely to Wagner's score. In many ways he reminds me of Furtwangler in his 1950 Ring in Milan. The singers are quite good and are able to act as well as sing their parts. At times the tempo is a bit fast (i.e., the singers sound like they're on speed), but one gets used to it and even exhilirated by it. Nilsson can sometimes be shrill and grating in her high notes. I think she's better heard in person (what an experience!) than on a recording. The sound quality is very good and captures a nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. The Bayreuth anvils in Das Rheingold are truly terrible, but not as bad as in the sloppily conducted Knappertsbush 1956 Bayreuth recording. You'd think Bayreuth of all places would get the anvils right. This set is an outstanding performances of the Ring that you can listen to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great start then progressive decline","review":"The novel starts out with great promise but loses steam well before its anticlimactic ending. In \\"All That Lives . . .\\" , the Bell family of a small 1815 Tennessee farming community is haunted by an other worldly force that visits during the night. The force is referred to by many names throughout the novel: The Spirit, The Devil, The Being, The Demon, The Witch. It tortures, taunts, tricks, kills, and rescues. Although the author does a good job of capturing the language and atmosphere of the period, the story lost interest for me when it became apparent that the background story of a vengeful and punishing, yet loving and compassionate God seemed too didactic for the type of fiction I prefer reading. I borrowed this one from the book exchange at my office so nothing lost financially in the experience but the time invested here could well have been better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This book was long winded drawn out and down right boring.

I can't understand the hype over star writers and artists.

Noirish text and drawing style with stark flat panels, no perspectives, grotesque figures. Why enthuse over artwork like this? For goodness sake, this is a comic.As usual, this Batman story comes across as any other Batman story - some unsolved crime blah blah blah, throw in a grade B villain Killer Croc, Penguin, then Scarface, throw in two new villains Fat Boy and Little Boy, then the Joker and at the end, Batman has roughed up a lot of villains and we are still left with a muddled plot.

No. We serve it frozen on a stick.Going up?(elevator scene) No. Today is the day we go sideways.Care to see a menu?

Much of the comments in the book after reading seem very familiar as if you heard this before and it feels like it solidifies or at least allows you to re-acknowledge the advice you were given years ago. Much of the education section the authors talk about hit home in some ways and I slightly disagree in others, but that's because I've been through education and worked at universities and colleges. Mostly, the biggest self-help I get from this book is that you should never expect to be Mozart - but then again, would Mozart ever read a book like this? The point being, if you're an artist struggling, this book gives an outlook that could mean success if you continue on your path to finding who you are.

It makes the best bread (Jim Lahey's Bread book recipe)! I'm very pleased with my purchase. I had considered pots in all price ranges but decided, since I did not know if the bread baking method was what I was looking for, I didn't want to invest a great deal of money on the pot. The recipes are fantastic and the pot performs to perfection. You do, however, need the stainless steel knob to be able to bake in a 475 degree oven. I have used the pot on the top of the stove also and are very pleased with its performance there, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery looked used, not new.

Like many of you I paid extra to get this battery because, unlike the cheaper ones, it showed a picture of an APC brand battery. I also trusted it more because it was sold directly by Amazon not a third party. The description also says \\" APC Replacement Battery Cartridge RBC4...\\" I received an ABC battery instead. I am not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Included return shipping for spent battery works great","review":"The key item in my decision to use APC as opposed to an off-brand is that they include a return shipping label for recycling of the spent battery. If you price the cost of taking the old battery to a recycling dealer then the APC compares equally to the off-brands. And you get the APC warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book I've ever read","review":"Thankfully I got this book at a thrift store so I didn't pay full price! I tried to read this book twice before and never got past the first 50 pages because I was bored to tears. I forced myself the third time to read it to the end because the reviews said it was so good. I kept waiting for it to get good, but that never happened. There was no \\"mystery\\" to this book, no twists, no turns. A guy leaves his wife because he doesn't like his life with her. Totally understandable after getting to know what kind of woman she was. And the rest of the book is just page after page of recounting the same information from everyone else's perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good 100 page book spread over 400 pages","review":"I read this book because the two ratings on this page were both 5 stars. I couldn't believe they said it was \\"riveting\\" -- I could barely get through the first 150-200 pages or so until you actually heard from the guy and what he had done. This initial part was hearing from his friends again and again interpreting his every breath and words for deep psychological analysis courtesy of the author. I ended up skipping about 50 pages and truly missed nothing in my reading of the rest of the book. The writing was dry and, most of all, I never cared about any of the characters. If you have your own fantasy about escaping to lay over your reading of this book, you may find it as good as the other reviewers. But if you are just a normal reader like me, in my opinion you will find it tedious and biased, and cringe just a little every time the author adds yet another quote bashing the ex-wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"This is an extremely ugly calendar.

After putting in the CD and hitting play, if you want a track 4 or 5 tracks in you cant hit \\"skip track\\" to fast, or it will freeze and not play at all. It has all the basic alarm features, digital clock, snooze, 2 alarms, and you can set the alarm to CD or Radio. Lastly, the buzzer noise it has to wake you up is horrible.

I have enjoyed so much more than I thought I would! I've driven my husband crazy telling him about all of the things I've learned. The author's insights into crime and punishment in Jane's era make me feel like I was missed out on so much of the cultural significance of certain crimes and events she mentioned in her novels.

She may fit into it when she's 2 or 3 years old.My earlier review stated:I really doubt this is sized for an infant, it seems way too big, so I'm a bit disappointed that it will be too big to bring my baby home in from the hospital, and by the time it fits the baby, it will be summer already.Also, I don't like that it was not packaged, it just arrived in the mailing envelope with no package or tags.

This is certainly not one. Colin Davis may have been instrumental in reviving an interest in Berlioz in Great Britain, but he consistently failed to live up to the great force and beauty of this composer's music. His reading is simply boring.Further problems with this recording are that it includes very inadequate singers. Berit Lindholm as Cassandra is the worst. Her voice is ugly, and so is her diction. It appears that there was no French coach during the rehearsals, as poor diction is symptomatic of the entire cast.The Clair de Lune duet between Didon and Eneas, probably the most beautiful in the entire opera, is poorly performed. At one point, Jon Vickers even sounds like he is yawning!The two stars I am giving this item are due to Josephine Veasey and Ian Partridge.The Berlioz Bicentennial came and went, and no new, and better, recording of this, his signature opera, was released. It's too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is a fine recording of LT. The vocalising and acting are generally good, especially by Vickers and Veasay. The big drawback is diction: it's poor. You can tell these singers are not French, which takes away quite a bit since a big part of the appeal of French opera (to me, at least) is the French style. Too bad Vickers and Veasay weren't French, or this would really be a 5 star recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful booklet for simple easy recipes","review":"Over the past decade or two I must have purchased at least 35 copies of this book, mostly to give to people who want to know more about becoming vegetarian or vegan.

The last copies I bought were for people who canoe, kayak and backpack, who wanted to dehydrate entrees for their outdoor cooking. The back of the book has great tips on that and also recommends various recipes which are easy to dehydrate.

I consult Nelson's Pediatrics often as well but usually find that Rudolph's provides more complete information on etiology and more up-to-date treatment recommendations. Rudolph's is generally more thorough than Nelson's. My only unfavorable comment on Rudolph's is that the index is not as extensive as Nelson's so that one has to search somewhat longer for the relevant section. Still, I think Rudolph's Pediatrics is an essential reference for all pediatric residents and practitioners."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sold it!","review":"Big, heavy, not many diagrams or photos.

As to what the other reviewer said about the treatment strategies in this book. Honestly...Don't read the big texts for therapeutics. THese texts take years to print and edit, invariably sometimes the therapy is outdated or there is a newer therapy. That's what journals and up to date and emedicine are for.

Gourevitch, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego and Shinn, ex-CEO of Dialogic and now visiting professor at Georgetown University, uncover complex relationships between key market players. Are workers and investors natural allies, for instance? Well, in markets where job protection laws are widespread, safeguards for investors are weak. On the other hand, global capital moves like a magnet to companies and markets that feature the most minority shareowner protection-thus creating jobs.

The Concerto, in fact, is THE best I've heard. Tempos in the Concerto are fast yet comfortable, with a lot of flexibility. Ashkenazy brings out all the bravura, but also achieves much lyricism, which seems to elude most pianists. Haitink and the Concertgebouw accompany him beautifully. The Rhapsody goes very well, although I would not say that it is better than Entremont/Ormandy or Pennario/Fiedler, let alone the classic William Kapell/Fritz Reiner version. The only reason I have not given this CD 5 stars is the sound engineering. It is certainly clear enough, but is lacking in body. The sumptuousness one expects in Rachmaninoff's orchestrations is merely hinted at, an ailment all too familiar from early digital recordings. Nevertheless, the Concerto demands to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read.","review":"American readers' two loves, Civil War and mystery, brought together in a single work.The author's period research and understanding of soldiers and the American Civil War is informative and entertaining.

The other characters, as well, possess depth whose experiences offer insight to day to day life in mid-19th century America.

For me, Faded Coat of Blue satisfied all those interests and more. Through the eyes of Abel Jones, the quirky immigrant hero of the book, the reader sees another, more complex side of America than is usually portrayed in Civil War literature. It is also a remarkably contemporary story that deals with murder, corruption, valor, racism, immigration, substance abuse, religious tolerance, class and justice (and a few other things besides!). Best of all, it is a page-turner you will want to savor. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War Suspense","review":"Owen Parry, by now the known psuedonym for Techno-thriller writer, military and international affairs analyst Ralph Peters, is a gripping novel.Written in the prose of Cold Mountain, but with a more direct story line, this novel excels at keeping your attention. Mr. Peters' command of Victorian Era vernacular and insight to how the various ethnic and cultures intermingled before melding in our great \\"melting pot\\" is most commendable.All historians will appreciate that there is no presentism here. It is written very much in tune with the period and conveys a tremendous amount of research to make it period sensitive and historically accurate.Not since the Flashman series have I had so much enjoyment reading a historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings About Our Past","review":"I was very impressed by the content and style of this Civil War mystery that turned out to be so much more. Captain Abel Jones, the engaging hero and narrator, is hired as a secret agent to investigate the murder of a young Northern volunteer. During the process of his investigation, the reader is exposed to a diversity of characters living in Civil War America. They are faced with several social issues, especially slavery, miscegenation, and prejudice as America of the 1860's is brought to life. The story immerses the reader into a culture and society that is our heritage and I, for one, am left with mixed feelings. On one hand it's embarrassing and shameful to know that some Americans behaved the way they did; on the other hand it's reassuring and with gratitude to know we recovered as a nation and continue to work towards unity. Any writing that can stimulate reflection upon our past is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch was DOA","review":"I purchased the watch for my mother this Christmas and upon receiving it, the watch did not work properly.

The MagnaFlow system was shipped right away and got here much sooner than I thought it would. No issues with the shipping or the product as delivered. It sounds much better then the old flowMaster system (not quite as loud) and the pipes are a larger diameter then what FlowMaster offers. The only issue I have is that the fit of the MagnaFlow system isn't as good as the FlowMaster. It was a little bit more difficult to install it compared to the FlowMaster. Also, one pipe is too close to the spare tire and the both tail pipes appear to be angled down a few hairs at where they exit compared to the FlowMaster pipes. Other than the fit, I like them and would buy them again.

Nearly every version I've seen has the first song labelled incorrectly - its \\"Introduction\\", not \\"Beginnings\\". Not only is this an unofficial release, but Chicago has also been fighting its release since the first of many versions came out back in 1978, shortly after original guitarist Terry Kath's death.So if you're looking for a piece of history, or that one missing piece in your Chicago collection, its worth the $7 to buy this CD. If you're looking for a decent live Chicago CD, check out the following, in order of quality (best to worst):1. Chicago Live in Japan 2. Chicago XXVI Live 3. Chicago at Carnegie Hall 4. Chicago (any CD having the same track listing as this one)There are also a few excellent live videos available, like \\"Live at the Greek Theatre\\", and \\"And the Band Played On...\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of advice.","review":"This CD is terrible.

From the technical point of view, in none of these areas, the book gives enough details for anyone to obtain sensible understanding on those technologies.

What Williamson does not mention, is the bulk of atrocities committed against Native Americans occurred decades *after* Columbus's death. In the end, after so many years of injustice and genocide, will Native Americans feel betteror be \\"healed\\" by simply dropping Columbus Day? How naive.

Spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes abound. (And I am sorry, but continually spelling \\"choose\\" as \\"chuse\\" or \\"show\\" and \\"shew\\" does not turn a modern novel into something of the Regency period.)If you are looking for a more-Austenesque novel to read, try Janet Aylmer's Darcy's Story or Julia Barrett's Presumption.(Of course, this book is head and shoulders superior to the utterly vile \\"Bar Sinister\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively dull","review":"As an Austen fan I regularly read all sequels I can find. This one is mediocre at best. The subject is highly improbable (Mrs. Bennet as a scheming shrew, angelic Mr. Darcy, weeping Lizzy and repentant Wickham!). The author are fond of long sentences but quite forget about commas, so all heroes (including Elisabeth) are speaking without end and often without sense. The book is slightly better than \\"Duty and Desire\\" by Baders and Tennant's works, but far, far worse than \\"Letters from Pemberley\\" and \\"Bar Sinister\\". You may read it if you have much spare time and nothing to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good actually","review":"I admit that I bought this one to satisfy my JA fanfiction obsession, but it was very good!

As a result, I enjoy exploring the various sequels which exist for this timeless classic. However, I was highly disappointed with this poor attempt to recreate my favorite literary characters. Austen's unique style and delicate prose would be difficult to replicate, and unfortunately, this author tries to remain precisely loyal to the original work without Austen's own flair for plot, entertainment, and character development. The book would have been much better had Shapiro taken a note from other successful sequels by following her own path instead of attempting a poor copy of a great original work.The plot was boring. The character alliances were beyond redemption. The language was simply too much. Moreover, Lizzy and Darcy were rendered one-dimensional and absolutely boring. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I DO NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the original","review":"The author has a weird habit of quoting the original directly as though a new thought, and a great deal more research into manners and morals would have made a great improvement. She copies that Mrs. Bennett called her husband Mr. Bennett, but has Elizabeth call her husband \\"Fitzwilliam\\" and discuss his personal habits with her sister... There are many such lapses that I found less than diverting. The storyline is next to impossible in the morals of the day, but not enough to make it some form of comedy. The grammar is poor as well as modern, and the vocabulary is limited. I'd leave it off the reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pretty bad","review":"This is not a good book. Based on the plot and characters of Austen's original P&P, the storylines are positively unbelievable and over the top (as noted in detail by other reviewers). As for style, I don't understand why the author continually puts two or three sentences in a paragraph, then simply puts a comma between each sentence so they all run together. My edition is brand new, but some paragraphs were intermittently printed in a larger font than the rest (?)Also it was humorous that where Austen originally left it to the reader to divine subtle points about her characters' personalities and traits, Shapiro comes right out and tells what the trait is. In case you didn't know Mr. Collins is a buffoon, she will state it in plain English for you. Kind of like telling a joke and then explaining the punch line.Overall the book was mildly entertaining if you have nothing else to read and can't get enough of Austen sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively Mundane and Bizzare","review":"This was a most disappointing book. It had an extreme amount of quotes from P&P and I tired of reading what P&P fans already knew. I expected a new story, not re-runs. I was also disappointed because we had so little time with Jane and Bingley. The author's plots were bizarre and unlikely. All of the quicky relationships and weddings were uninteresting and unrealistic. Caroline Bingley staying with the Darcys? Mary at Rosings? Kitty as Godmother? I was hoping to read about Elizabeth as mistress of Pemberly but our time was wrapped up in another \\"traumatic\\" (mundane is more like it) episode with the Wickams. Couldn't the author come up with her own ideas? Don't waste your time on this weak attempt. I recommend Pamela Aiden and hopes she writes a sequel when she completes her Gentleman trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively Disappointed","review":"This sequel suffers mightily from weird punctuation. Having to re-read, slow down, back up and start again simply to get the gist of the narrative is very frustrating. Call me old-fashioned but a few hundred extra commas, placed correctly, would have greatly improved this book. Jane Austen created complete, authentic finely-drawn characters; Ms. Shapiro coarsens them all. Even Lady Catherine could not have stopped so low! Add to all this the shallow, weak plot and you have one very disappointing book that cannot hold a candle to the original. \\"Sequel\\" is too strong a word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively disappointed!!!","review":"What I was most disappointed about was how Darcy's character was...a bit of a wimp. The book lacks imagination in that it uses lines from the P&P movie incessantly, which was not only annoying but contrived. There was no real development in the witty repartee b/t Elizabeth and Darcy, save the times the P&P lines were recycled. It seems to me that this book is supposed to neatly wrap up their story in a very weak way. I will give the author credit in that she does have Darcy and Elizabeth live happily ever after, as JA intended, however I believe JA would have represented her characters more intellectually stimulating and less smarmy. This book must have been quickly written as it lacks depth. In short the story line so contrived it is hard to swallow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excessively Diverted-A Must Have for all Jane Austen Lovers","review":"I truly enjoyed the book Excessively Diverted. I could hardly put it down. I have read many sequels to Pride and Prejudice and Excessively Diverted is by far the best and most enjoyable. I think Ms. Austen would have been proud. I have been a fan of Jane Austen for many years now and have done a lot of research into her writing as well as her life. Ms. Shapiro must be an heir to Jane Austen as her style is much the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"Beware!

And while Shapiro used the Austen-era language well, could someone PLEASE get this woman an editor? There were commas where they were unnecessary, and the absence of them when they were needed. Sentences ran on and on and ON. She would do well to learn that it's quite acceptable to use a semicolon, somewhere, anywhere!

The problem with this novel is that it is written in an entirely different style than its predessor. In addition, the introduction to the story and characters by way of what occurred in the original work lasts well into the novel. (This becomes extremely tiresome for those of us who already know the story.)I'd instead suggest reading \\"An Assembly Such as This\\" by Pamela Aidan. This retells the story of Pride and Prejudice from the point of view of Mr. Darcy. The style of writing is well matched, and you can feel the same sense of wit Jane Austen provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Excessively Good","review":"This book is the best sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I have read.

So arriving home, a visit to the CD library to hear the entire recording completely satisfied. Though this recording is now fifteen years old it remains one of the more eloquent, sensitively played, humanistic surveys of Mozart Sonatas 2, 3, 4 and 5 available.Mitsuko Uchida is a poet, one to whom the fire of the big concerti is undaunting, while remaining one of our most understated artists of the delicate works such as these four Mozart sonatas. Her approach is gentle, straightforward, and clear in definition: her result is Mozart that appeals as much to the heart as to the mind. These are beautifully shaped and immaculate performances, ones that draw you back time and time again. This is one of Mitsuko Uchida's finest CDs. Music for the beleaguered soul. Highly recommended.

Every phrase is spot on, the dynamics are fantastic, simply a great job.The recording is fine, but not great. As mentioned before, it is very warm. I find that it has too much hall sound, not enough stereo image, and a very indistinct high end. It does not take advantage of the possibilities of high-end sound, but it is also a digital recording done in 1985, when digital recording was still fairly new and was not capable of resolving all those wonderful high frequencies that we treasure.The performance is also noise-free. There are no massive bumps, creaking chairs, burps, floor squeaks, or loose barnyard animals to be heard.

After learning about the atrocities and people hurt/killed...Truman and those who flew the Enola Gay have a lot of blood on their hands. I say this as a human being.Good film. Strangely optimistic and upbeat.Barefoot Gen II is just as interesting and lively to watch as the first. Although it was produced 3 years later, the second movie is really good too and picks up on Gen, his mother, and Ryuta as they struggle to survive. This film is just as optimistic and feel-good as the first, despite difficult tragedies that occur.Gen continues to live strong like the wheat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Anime","review":"Excellent movie to show kids from middle school to high school.

Frankly you're better to read the original than sit through this sentimentalized and trite offering. While there are moments of spectacle (the bombing and the horrific aftermath), it's basicaly a \\"good feeling\\" movie set in Hiroshima.While it might've been worth renting, it's definitly not a \\"must have\\". Much better you spend your cash on the masterpiece \\"Grave Of the Fireflies\\".The DVD includes some liner notes but no additional information.

Not that this CD isn't enjoyable -- it certainly is. But, it is refreshing to have arrangements that are so sophisticated and well-crafted.

They were all defective 34 minutes into the film. They would black out and then lock up the player so that it had to be turned off manually. I contacted the IFC - who were very helpful - and they put me in touch with Lions Gate Films. They were rude and simply blew me off and could not have cared less. The Amazon folks were very helpful but could not supply me with a viable copy.Too bad. It is a great film that captures the feel, the people, and the music of appalachia. I was born there and this film is right on the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back and enjoy the music!","review":"I probably would have rated this movie 4 stars just for the music alone -- absolutely sensational. The story itself has a few weaknesses but the acting is excellent (particularly Emmy Rossum as Deladis and Pat Carroll as Viney Butler). You don't watch a movie like this for the plot, anyway. Just sit back and enjoy the music and the cinematography.By the way -- a bit of a warning here for those who want to rush out and buy the soundtrack. Although the soundtrack is excellent in its own right, it is NOT the same as what you hear in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD 'Songcatcher' from Amazon","review":"I have loved this movie forever so I looked it up on Amazon & wasn't disappointed.

What's the point?","review":"There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard. But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole? Nothing. So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MUSIC IS THE STAR - THE PEOPLE ARE THE STAGE","review":"The mountain music is so well done in this film. Pat Carrol is real and warm, and the cast carries the feeling of the life and times into a memorable trip in the turn of the century mountains. The soap opera part of the work, the lesbian teachers, and the feminist point of view are the distractions, but not enough to overcome the wonderful music and the scenery. The realistic depiction of the life and scenery of the mountains, as well as the camera work in the interiors and the great scenes at the dance, makes this worth seeing more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I ended up not watching the film past the first minute or so because it is not a letterboxed presentation, as it should be; instead, the film squeezes to full-frame if you do not have a 16x9 television. This creates and off-kilter, headache inducing experience. I was not able to make any adjustment to my TV or my player that would do any good.Lions Gate should recall the disc and repress it so it can be watched on either type of television."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Journey Into the Past","review":"With all of the completely unwatchable movies at the theater these days I am surprised at the harsh criticism Songcather has generated. Not every film has to compete for Film of the Year or make millions of dollars to be valuable.Having spent a portion of my childhood in North Carolina I found the characters quite believable and some very familiar. If Songcatcher contains a few stereotypes it should be remembered that such notions are usually based on some reality.Songcatcher is a pleasant diversion from the action films that do little besides blow up buildings or kill large groups of people. I for one enjoyed Songcather and would like to see more of this type of film.If the songs in the movie are unpolished it should be remembered that folk songs have been passed on by ordinary people for centuries, many who cannot sing that well.I would recommend seeing the film and ignoring the negative comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"The synopsis doesn't do justice to what this movie is about or how good it really is. Every second is a learning experience. The acting is terrific, especially Pat Carroll. You'll think the producers had found real mountain people to play the parts. And you'll leave wanting to go straight and buy the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got this movie based on the rave reviews here and expected to hear tons of old time Appalachian music in real mountain settings but what I got was a typical hollywood drama. That is so sad because this movie has all of the potential in the world to highlight the music it extolls but fails to deliver.I found that \\"Where the Lillies Bloom\\" offers a much better and realistic Appalachian experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"agenda\\" film that needs an \\"R\\" rating","review":"Songcatcher has all the elements of a beautiful story, rich video and lovely audio work. All that is ruined when the real motivation for the film emerges. It is a no-holds-barred advocacy piece for lesbianism with graphic sexual content that should have earned the film an R rating. How it recieved an PG-13 is probabally another political story...Sure, these movies are made and sold, but the buyer should have some idea of what they are getting.

I was never so disappointed in my life! The book, by Sharon McCrumb, is a brilliant story and this movie does not, in the least reflect that story. I was so disappointed by what the filmakers did that I want to share that. It is most insulting to a wonderful story/writer. If I were Ms. McCrumb, I would suit for defamation of character!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, but thats about it.","review":"This film does a great job of capturing Olde Time Southern music in its original time and place. Music that makes the toe tap as well as, putting shivers down your spine, its all there. The cinemotagraphy, while doing a decent job at conveying the grittier side of moutain life, overall is a little dissapointing. Tthe story takes place in one of the most beautiful parts of America, yet the only time you even see a mountain range is for 2 seconds. Adain Quinn is awesome as the pipe smoking, aloof but educated mountain man. But the lead actress's, (wanna-be Dr Quinn Medicine woman) overacting is alomost too painful to watch. If they had casted someone better, the movie would have been superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Stuff for the Men Hater's Club","review":"Hearing that this movie was the winner of an award at the Sundance Film Festival my wife and I greatly anticipated watching this film. The scenery is beautiful. The music is wonderful. However, the overtones in this movie are horrendous, unless you are a feminist who hates men. If you are, then you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly Lesbian Film","review":"Yes, what looks like a great family film is actually a disturbing vehicle to promote lesbian values. I was so disgusted by the lesbianism and partial nudity that I didn't even finish it. YYUUUUCCKKK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"Wonderful music and we will buy the soundtrack. But the movie could have been good if it weren't for the lesbianism (most of us do NOT want to see it portrayed on screen in such a flamboyant way), feminism, and dull ending. It's too bad they messed up what could have been a well made film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive...","review":"The cover makes you think that you're getting a family-friendly, \\"Hallmark Hall of Fame\\"-type movie. In reality, however, you get a movie that accepts and condones adultery, homosexuality, and anti-Christian stereotyping. The main character is an adulteress, her sister engages in lesbianism (including some brief nudity and sexual kissing), and the \\"Bible-believers\\" rail not only against homosexuality, but also singing and \\"book-learning\\". The music of the \\"mountain people\\" is a sidebar in this relativistic, 21st-century, \\"do what feels good\\" independent movie. I wish I'd never seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"part wonderful part big letdown","review":"this movie is so beautiful visually, and the \\"songcatcher's\\" story of capturing the music of the hills is a rewarding adventure.the crushing of men and the sweetness or strength and character of women is rather severe.the main \\"plot\\" of the story comes near the end, and is such a letdown from the beauty of the songcatcher story.my impression was not at ALL that this was a feministic, lesbian, oppression story. what a letdown. as if the women had to turn to each other because all the men were such pigs.this could have been such an exquisite movie if the overall plot had anything to do with the songcatching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Advancing an Agenda","review":"Why do otherwise wonderful movies feel a need to advance an agenda? The time spent on the homosexual scenes combined with the retribution and the church condemnation scene add up to an intentional focus on the minority actions of our society -- homosexuals and bigotted Christians, both of which do exist, but neither of which represent anything close to the norm. This movie depicts both with a definite slant toward homosexuality and against Chritianity.Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songcatcher - Winner of the Sundance Film Festival?","review":"I love a good movie, unfortunately, this was not one of them. The main reason why I believed what was reviewed before was that it had Aidan Quinn in the movie. He is a great actor! You can't go wrong with him in it. He did great, some of the music was ok, but some of the acting was really horrible. This is one that I wish that I watched from a download. Not worth a tinker's dirty socks in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed (leave the film in the trash )","review":"I love folk music as well as the mountain people. When I first started watching this movie I found it very enjoyable. Then the scenes between two lesbian teachers not only once but twice totally ruined the film. It was quite disgusting. The film is rated PG13 but I find that too mild. I would not want my teenagers watching this let alone any smaller children.I would suggest buying the soundtrack but leave the film in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story too complicated -- didn't match the simple music","review":"Overall, I didn't like this movie. I appreciated the music and the photography, and the acting was fine, but the screenplay should have been written more simply. The story should have been about the unexpected music and the unexpected change in the heroine's life, instead of being so much concerned with homosexuality, evil corporate industrialists, and adultry. The music in the film can touch people in a universal way, but the film loses something when it starts trying to cover so many non-universal things.The movie had some nice moments -- especially the lovely music and the sad young love story -- but it failed to suspend my disbelief because it was trying to do so much. Overall, seeing this movie left me feeling kind of queasy. It took me places I didn't really want to go at the time, which detracted from the lovely feelings which the music and main storyline could have left me with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Feel-Good Movie","review":"SONGCATCHER is not a feel-good movie but it will stick in your memory for a long time. In spite of the sombre tone, the film is satisfactorily resolved at the end. I am glad I saw the movie and I recommend it. The acting and directing are superb. Pat Carroll as old Viney Butler stands out in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed response","review":"The music was what i grew up hearing.....my Granny was a singing woman.....i was born and raised in the mountains of Western NC and Eastern Tn. My Great Granddaddy was a music teacher from Keen Ireland.....i know these songs and the people they came from......they are my people...the hymns were as much as part of the air as the songs in this film..hymns were as much a part of the culture as the secular songs....yet, they were completly absent from the movie, giving a very distorted view of the culture. Also, the attitude of the church goers toward the two gay women in the movie was not the attitude of the church people i grew up with ...the moviemakers operated out of the same narrow judgemental perspective as the church goers in the movie. Wonderful character development, Emmy Rossum's voice and charachter portrayal was right on target, as ws some of the others. A few of the more subtle values of the \\"highlander\\" culture were wonderfully presented in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Music, great idea, pendantic drivel","review":"Love the idea of this movie, but I completely agree with the people who have pointed out that it is is a series of smug sermons on the injustices of the past. Yes, mountain people were exploited and women were oppressed but in this movie they all have great skin, teeth and access to hair mousse. I was especially irked with the scene where the two women were caught kissing in the woods. Lesbians or \\"spinsters\\" from that era would never, ever ever have taken such a risk because they knew the terrible consequences if they were caught. That's opression for you. This movie (despite a great effort from the cast) was contrived and patronizing - even though I agree with most of its politics. If you want to immerse yourself in the culture, just get the Songcatcher II CD. Those who voted for this at sundance were probably voting for the music and the message, not the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songcatcher","review":"I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

The story background themes may be a bit cliche, but it's not important, as the real story is the music itself, and the importance of preserving it.One point I would have to argue is the emphasis on the music coming from England. These ballads were mainly Scots/Irish, and it was mentioned briefly, but there were too many references to the English ballads. If the music is to be revered and preserved, its true origins should be accurate.However, I would definitely recommend this movie for all true music buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"consummate myth-buster","review":"not for religious fanatics adoring the magical \\"free market,\\" or, where would capitalism be without the zealous intervention of government"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary darkly humorous honesty","review":"Popov shows us a glimpse into Russian society that we have never had before. His stories range from the ridiculous to the sublime, each one telling tales of life's absurdities and hilarities. Many stories discuss alcohol abuse in Russia and it's effects on the culture. The book begins with Five Stories about Vodka, five sad yet funny tales about the effects of drinking on the people and the state. Popov is highly recommended reading for me and I believe that anyone who has spent any time reading Russian literature, either classic or modern with find this writer refreshing and familiar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Weird","review":"I'm still trying to figure out what on earth that floating body was about at the very beginning, and that's just the START of the confusion. Dominique's character just wasn't likeable at all, and I had no sympathy for any of the characters. Henry Thomas was the best of the lot, although even his character was a bit strange.Fortunately I didn't buy the DVD for this film - I bought it for the excellent short film in the extras. Any fans of 24's Carlos Bernard should watch it. The Director of Dead In The Water redeems himself with this little film, and despite being only 25 minutes long it is far superior to the main feature. Thought-provoking and intelligent. Worth buying the DVD just to see this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool summer flick","review":"It felt like summer after watching it. I loved the feeling it gave me. It had some beatiful scenes of Rio de Janeiro. Dominique Swain was very good as well as Henry Thomas who played a creepy character. Although I think most people will hate it due to the slow moving nature of its story. But be patient as it gets really good and includes a cool twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've seen","review":"Dead in the Water has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes it is slow paced. That is not really the main problem. The problem is that nothing ever happens. I can handle slow pacing if it is used to establish intersting characters or an intricate story, but this movie has neither. Basically nothing happens for the first 40 minutes. There is some expository dialogue about trading stocks that is confusing and completely uninteresting, and does nothing to establish the characters or the story. When the \\"big turning point\\" finally happens there is not much reason to care. The features on the DVD are hardly noteworthy. There is an alternate ending that makes no sense whatsoever. There is also a short behind the scenes featurette and a short film made by the same director. My advice is to avoid this movie and save yourself the nearly two hours of sheer boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Poor","review":"Boy, what a bust. On all counts. The story goes nowhere. The actors, who have all done good work in other films, have nothing to work with. As a suspense/thriller, which is apparently what it is supposed to be, it fails miserably on every level.And the DVD itself? The only feature of interest is the writer/director's short film, with a commentary track, that is more interesting than the feature length film. Inexplicably, an alternate ending to the feature is included that not only has no audio (and it IS a dialogue scene), but makes no sense whatsoever in context with what we've scene in the finished film. And the Production Featurette? 3 or 4 minutes of raw video footage of a handful of scenes being shot.Stay far away from this one, it's not even good for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"ET,phone home!\\"","review":"Yes,that's Henry Thomas,the kid from \\"ET:The Extra Terrestrial\\",as part of a love triangle involving Dominique Swain,her boyfriend&a; cute(?)

If there's one thing I learned from this it's that when Daft Punk performs, they rip their stuff to shreds.It starts off cheesey, give it until they start the real stuff, Da Funk and the Rollin' & Scratchin' parts will get you moving. Personally, I think this is worth the money just for the last ~5 minutes of it, where Alive is performed. If you thought the album version was amazing, all I can say is brace yourself. There's also, a lot of improv. Nothing to be worried about, it's all well within the lines of Homework-quality house and techno beats.Well, the cheers of the people during the performance say it all, each song they introduce gets whistles and cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"45 minutes of Daft Punk bliss!","review":"Forty-five minutes of live Daft Punk action recorded in Birmingham, England, in November, 1997.

You might be thinking that 45 minutes is long to listen to, but it's never quite boring. Fans of Daft Punk will love it, hearing the originals is one thing, but when you listen to this CD you get a sense of being there in the crowd, as there is a lot of audience participation. At times it seems to slow down but it's always building up to a crescendo of funk that will make you want to dance and go crazy. Overall its a nice CD for hardcore Daft Punk fans, but not necessarily essential to own for casual listeners or fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good CD, but I liked Homework and Discovery better.","review":"I got this CD after owning Homework - and I loved it SO MUCH! Well, I thought - Live CD, from 1997 (same year Homework was released) Must be great! - well, it's pretty good I guess. I don't regret my purchase at all, let's just say it doesn't stay in any of my CD players as often as Homework does or Discovery will (ordered it; haven't got it yet; heard most of it). But it's pretty cool, still. It's kind of like a megamix of some Homework tracks and some original stuff just for this concert, plus the fans screaming and it's 45 minutes of entertainment. My only nitpick is that they didn't do Around the World - must have done this concert before they made that track - cause it's the best song in the world, it really is. =) Oh well, at least we hear Da Funk (the second best song in the world)!If you aren't sure whether to buy or not, compromise and get it used for half the price - but it's worth getting new just for the neat lil stickers!! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I paid $12.71 for this light.

Moon Pix is a bit like the Velvet Underground, Kristen Hersh, Mazzy Star and the Cowboy Junkies all rolled up together but never as good as any of those, yet still good. Moon Pix is not great, but it could be. Moon Pix is full of MOMENTS and all those beautiful melting moments have entranced me. The music is there, although at its worst its repetitive.

They fight. Later, they have to pretend to be in love. They don't actually ever do that on screen, but maybe they're doing it between chapters or something. Then they have to fight some more. Then their companions remark that they must really be interested in each other. The main character decides that he must be, because other people noticed it.

First I accept him and now never blame him for what he is. He has more self esteem now and a happier person. It is a great book. It has my underlinings almost at every page.For those interested in coping with what called 'ADD' children,I can also suggest 'Nurtured Heart Approach' by Howard Glasser. This approach also worked wonders at my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only the whole world could understand this....","review":"First of all, THANK GOD for Jeffrey Freed.... and all others who care to look into such matter with a great level of tolerance and understanding. I borrowed this book from a library and I will definitely buy a copy. Now I know that I'm not alone. The huge problem is to convince the majority of us to understand and accept the message that this book has in store. This world has definitely been left-brained and where I come from, it's no exception. Although I have thrived on being a right-brainer my whole life, I believe that only few of us have achieved a great deal by using our \\"right-brain\\" ability to our benefit. Again, it's another form of discrimination. Even our brains are coloured. It's not about a learning disability. It's really about teaching disability. This I strongly agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best book on ADD","review":"Since my son was diagnosed 2 weeks ago I've been absorbing as much information as I can on ADHD. This book is the one (out of 5) that stands out the most so far. Freed hits the nail on the head with this book. There is potential and brilliance in these children that most schools (even the Montessori school my son is in) just don't know how to tap into. My son loves doing the reading, spelling and math exercises suggested. If you have a child with ADD/ADHD this book is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never taken the time to write a review, but!","review":"I downloaded this book yesterday and spent the whole day reading reading it. I am the mom of an 8 year old boy with ADHD and as a Social Worker I work with many ADD/ ODD/ and otherwise classified children. I have know my son was different and experiencing difficulties since he was a toddler. He is so bright, funny, loving and so emotionally attuned to my moods that I tell my husband he is an empath. Out of desperation, after much deliberation, he has been on Ritalin for a year at a very low dose and this has allowed him to remain in the same grade as his twin (very left-brained) sister. But I have so much insight now and can't wait to start applying the techniques. So many of the things I have observed and intuitively knew (oh found out I am very right brain too) about him, are explained in this book. And I see him in a POSITIVE light and have the vocabulary to share all the strengths I already knew was there. Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read!","review":"Right Brained Children in a Left Brained World is an excellent book. I've read so many books since my child was diagnosed as ADHD six years ago, and this is by far the best. Now I'm just trying to figure out how to convince our local educators to read it. It could help so many children that are currently struggling in school. Our son is now 12 years old, is not on any medications, is going to a Montessori school, and doing just fine. After reading this book, I've found it so much easier to understand him. I wonder if Jeffrey Freed does any public speaking on this subject. I sure hope he does. We need to get this information out. I will be taking this book with me to our local public school meeting on Curriculum and hoping to get the teachers to pick up a copy and read it over the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"As a foster parent who teaches left brain/right brain theory to other foster parents, this books makes great sense. For several years, I have been saying that the information I have read about right brains (and experienced since my husband is right brained) and ADHD were too similar to ignore. Now Mr. Freed confirms what many of us has suspected: our ADHD youngster is smart, creative, and emotional. Thanks for pulling it all together"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously flawed","review":"While I suspect the basic premise of the book, that most ADD children merely have a different learning style, is correct, I felt the authors ideas on teaching were seriously flawed. Teaching reading by having a child memorize whole words by sight, and then add \\"a dose of phonics\\"later on,(that the author already states these children can't learn anyway) is seriously wrong. There are just too many words in the dictionary for anyone to memorize and retain, and this method might actually hurt the dyslexic who is likely to read \\"was\\" as \\"saw\\" and \\"on\\" as \\"no\\",without left-to-right training. I felt his techniques in other areas were equally flawed. I\\"d like to see the author do some serious scientific studies on his method for about 10 years, complete with control groups, and then come back and write a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"mujahed ahmed M.D.","review":"This is truly one of the best works I have read.

Her work has resulted in delightfully soothing, relaxing instrumental music - slow music for fast times, indeed. I found the best cuts to be in the middle, such as \\"Photosynthesis,\\" \\"Driftwood\\" and \\"Open Me Slowly,\\" but all songs seemed to be polished and produced to bring out the mental image of the music flowing over me. \\"Driftwood\\" is a delightful weaving of orchestral instuments into electronica, resulting in a wonderful ambient album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodramatic","review":"I thought that Paul Schatzlkin's biography of Farnsworth read like a daytime soap opera. His overly romanticized version of Philo Farnsworth's story only seemed to get in the way of a truly remarkable character and the journey that he embarked upon. I was hoping for a serious look at Farnsworth's life, career, and scientific pursuits, but what I got was movie-of-the-week caliber writing, which bored me to no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you want to remove sap from your car, DO NOT BUY this product. I followed the directions precisely, even repeating the process a second time, and absolutely nothing happened. The sap is still on the car, looking as though no one has even tried to remove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful...","review":"Tarminator will remove tar, and much more if you let it. The directions say it is safe on paint and clearcoat, but it is not to be used on bare plastics (trim mouldings, headlights, etc). The passenger side of my car was coated with tar from road construction, so I bought some Tarminator to remove it. On the fenders and doors, the tar was remove with no problems. However when used on my side skirts, which are painted and clearcoated, it started to melt them. Be careful when using this stuff on any kind of plastic whether painted or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on dried tree sap","review":"I park under an ornamental pear tree that drops these little berries every fall. I usually try to avoid parking there but this season forgot and my white coupe got pelted all night with them. The little berries leave these little tobacco-looking stains that are impossible to get off. I tried home remedies, but nothing works well. In desperation I tried this product, even using it 2-3 times as per directions. It succeeded in absolutely nothing. I don't recommend it for this application. I realize that this isn't specifically sap per se, but close enough as far as I'm concerned. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work","review":"I have used it a couple of times and it seems to be working.

I do not think he knows what he is doing or that he is decived himself.He will lead you under the Law if you let him. For even the Talmud teaches to hate the Christians because they followed a New Law \\"NOT\\" the Law in the Old Testament \\"Hilkhoth Teschuhah (111,8)\\" In this book he speaks of a Conspirasy, but maybe not telling you all the truth is more like it.In short I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Futurism","review":"A new twist to an old lie.

Someone has the audacity to tell it like it is!

I can only imagine \\"The Church\\" would like to see this man go away. The insight Mr.Rood has into the Scriptures has alreadyrocked their boat and he's just getting warmed up. I hate to use a line so worn out- -but it's a fact, you won't be able to put The Mystery of Iniquity down once you start. If you want to read more TRUTH then you've probably heard in \\"Church\\" in the last 20 years, then get your copy now and read it quickly. When you've read it, you'll run looking for those you love so you can share the TRUTH with them. They will never stop thanking you! (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUCH! BUT THANK YOU ROOD!","review":"I highly recommend this book to those who are earnest about seeking truth, can humble themselves & test what they've learned from the pulpits with the scriptures! Rood's challenges to mainstream Christian teaching points out with clarity that there has been MAJOR twisting of the scriptures! I give thanks to the GOD of Israel for lifting the delusion that I was under from the errored mainstream Christian teaching that helped me to be a know-it-all, sloppy-grace, casual Christian. I also thank Rood for foresaking everything of this world, humbling himself, and being obedient to GOD in speaking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth It","review":"This pump works great.

Its worth the money. Remember to pull hose out before filling container is full.....there will be some fuel left in the line....this will avoid spill overs....thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to glue the barrel to the top.","review":"Tried the pump out and it was drawing air in at where the gray barrel meets the black plastic outlet and pumping water out. I superglued it and that fixed the air/water leak and now the pump works fairly well. If you have superglue around then this might be a good pump for various uses. I had to pump out a cover that filled with water and you can start pumping with this transfer pump and if you can put the hose lower than the water, it will then self-siphon. I had planned on transferring fuel from one boat to another and glad I pumped water first. With the leak I would have had fuel spraying out of the leak and that could have been dangerous. Considering the price, this is a really cheaply made transfer pump. I would also strongly recommend trying the pump out with water first before ever transferring any flammable liquids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get whisked to the year 4010A.D.

Marillier is a true artist as a writer, and even though it slightly, only slightly, lacked the emotional roller coaster found, and therefore expected in all her novels, it is still a novel that cannot be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foxmask - Wolfskin - loved them both","review":"I think both Foxmask and Wolfskin are great books - yes there are parts that are slow in each book and parts that are predictable in each book - however, that happens a lot with any book. They are both fine pieces of writing and I enjoy this author's work and research to make these books so enjoyable.Foxmask's characters are strong - you either love them or hate them. Creidhe is a strong heroine. I enjoyed reading about her immensely. She did compare somewhat to the Sevenwaters women, in her own way. However, I really think she made a name for herself.I enjoyed the book and I'm sure anyone who likes this author or historical fiction will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage","review":"Unlike the first book of this series, This book was alot more to my liking. It was truley an amazing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scrumtrelessant Book","review":"If you like all of Marillier's other books, then you'll love this one. This one is actually my favorite so far. It was so touching-i actually cried. yes, i did. It really is great, and if you like the way Juliet Marillier writes so far-why would you want to change it. And it's not like the plot is exactly alike. The heroine has a completely different personality than all the other heroines in other books. i would definately recommend this book and it definately deserves 5five5 stars.

It was stuff like this that got me hooked.I can't add a lot to the previous reviews except to say that this is a strong, bright recording of some generally cheerful, upbeat baroque concertos. Hardenberger's playing is tight, precise and yet never mechanical. I have a lot of trumpet concertos featuring a variety of soloists - no one is any better than Hakan - and many do not have the fluid yet concise playing of this soloist.Anyway, I totally recommend this and any of Hardenberger's recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lacking in information","review":"As a Registered Respiratory Therapist, I took PALS last year and was very impressed with a different PALS book used by the hospital. I was hoping that this PALS book by Barbara Achlert would contain similar information. But this book contains very little information and does not even cover the basics like toxicology (a major cause childhood ER visits) and cold-water-near-drownings. And the information that this book does provide is extremely sketchy with many important factors missing that are a vital part of the picture. I can only recommend this book to people who are not health care workers and who want to know little more than the basic CPR, and even in that situation, it would be a very weak recommendation.

I was very disappointed to find that Cinder Edna's triumphs are all compared to Cinder Ella's failures. Cinderella is portrayed as self indulgent, vapid, stupid, and these things are played for comedy. I felt the tone was very judgmental and really quite mean towards Cinderella's desire to be pretty and her use of the fairy godmother. I like Cinder Edna's part of the story but it wasn't necessary to be cruel about Cinderella to be proud of Cinder Edna's spunk.Overall I was disappointed and will not be reading this to my daughter again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever but hard to read aloud","review":"... This is a great book-- the message is not feminist. ...[It's]about making your dreams come true versus waiting around for them to come true; about being sensible rather than trying to live a fairy tale. While Cinderella gets lucky, Cinder Edna makes her own luck. Cinderella cries at her misfortune and dreams of a prince to save her, but Cinder Edna makes lemonade out of her lemons, and also gets a prince.The book is a little long for the younger set-- my four-year-old can barely sit through it unless I read it fast, hence the one objection I have about pronouncing \\"Cinder Edna\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a fairy tale with values, and verve.","review":"Wihtout giving too much away, Cinder Edna is the cleverest Cinderella story of them all. This story is a subtle compare and contrast of two overworked, underappreciated heroines, Cinderella, and Cinder Edna.Cinderella's story is true to form but Cinder Edna is a new bread of heroine who makes her own luck. Less emphasis is placed on her aesthetics and much more on her ingenuity. Cinder Edna is all personality as she charms a near-sighted prince.By the way, little boys like Cinder Edna too - its just that good.This is a really fun book to read with girls of all ages. And its never too early to teach your daughters how to spot a prince, or that happily ever after is relative.Send a copy to your still single sister on her 30th, 40th or 50th birthday.

It is very entertaining to children, and parents you will love it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best picture book ever--great for teens AND kids!","review":"I am a teenager and I read this book as part of an assignment in class. The book of Cinder Edna shows the plasticy-type \\"teenager,\\" with a perfect, paper thin look, versus the homely, sensible girl with character. Cinderella marries the prince and has to sit through royal meetings and all of that, and Cinder Edna gets to marry the not-so-handsome prince and live happily. and have fun.Any teen like me who ISNT one of the pretty or popular girls will get a boost of self-esteem when they read this book.

Your child will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top preachy","review":"As a card-carrying feminist, I bought this book for my five year old daughter who, to my horror, is enamored with all things princess. I wanted her to have some positive, empowering messages about being a girl, to counter-act the passive princess characters who only find happiness when a man bestows it on her by choosing her as his bride.

The subject of Neanderthals, and whether they died out or were bred out, is an extremely controversial subject. It is controversial primarily because no Neanderthal fossils have ever been found in Africa. Hence, while scientists will never come out and say so plainly, which ever side of the argument turns out to be correct has monumental implications regarding the equality, or inequality, of the races of mankind.This PBS Nova documentary manages to present all sides of the debate in a fair and balanced manner.By the way, if you want to see what an totally biased treatment of the subject looks like, view the Discovery Channel's \\"The Last Neanderthal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete nonsense","review":"Typical of postmodern \\"theory,\\" the writing is needlessly complex, which, also typical of postmodernists, hides the fact that the author is substantively ignorant of the topic and has no insight to offer. If you can sort through the jargon, this book basically argues that serial murders would not happen if we just ignored the killers, because they are part of a \\"discursive\\" loop, in which the killers are a sort of performer who kill to please their audience, which is the public. The author is oblivious to work done in psychology, criminology, sociology, and FBI investigations.

Unfortunately, ever since that crazy guy (\\"I loved the shave so much I bought the company!\\") sold Remington and Spectrum Brands bought it, the quality of the product has declined. They still give great shaves - as long as the shaver lasts, which in this case isn't long. The head assembly is held in place by very small, very thin, PLASTIC tabs. They cannot survive normal handling. It must have been designed by a first year engineering student (who probably flunked). The first shaver lasted less than a month. Spectrum Brands graciously replaced it with a new shaver. The second one lasted 5 weeks. The tabs break and the head assembly can't be held in place. You get a great shave - as long as the tabs hold out.I've given up on this one and switched to a Braun 360. The shave is almost (but not quite) as close as the Remington. But at least I don't have to keep shipping it back to the manufacturer every few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaves well but poorly designed shaver head","review":"I bought this shaver about 6 months ago.

The new head broke this time after only 1 week. There is definitely a design defect..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily, cuts poorly. Stay away.","review":"I've had this for 2 months now. I was impressed with the cleaning system and it has an excellent battery life. In use, it takes a long shave requiring multiple passes to achieve good results. It now has a broken latch that secures the head; It only uses 2 very small catches to hold it in place, and even with gentle handling breaks easily. Stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss my Braun","review":"After many years of reliable service, the battery on my Braun razor finally could not hold a charge. I received the Remington MS 900 as a gift and it worked for about 2 weeks before the infamous \\"broken head tabs\\" problem. Stay away.It cracks me up that people give this product 5 stars with reviews like \\"works great until it breaks.\\" The point of these reviews is to help others avoid your mistakes. It is as if folks need to reassure themselves that they made an excellent purchase --except that it was a bad product. Silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design - close shave","review":"I received this shaver as a Christmas gift about 6.5 months ago. I can honestly say that I have never had a closer shave, but the shaver is not without its caveats. To begin with, the original charging base never quit flashing, indicating that the shaver was not fully charged. I called the company and the customer service representative was friendly but not knowledgeable. She thought that the base was probably OK until I pointed out the correct operation of the base in the shaver's handbook. I was told that a base would be shipped to me and that I was to return the original base in the box in which I received the new base. I was also told that I would be reimbursed for shipping though I was not. Then, after a few months of blissful shaves, one side of the screen would not stay attached to the shaver, rendering the shaver useless. I give up. I will use a blade until my new Braun arrives and I will not be going back to Remington."},{"rating":"2","title":"MS-900","review":"Excellent product as long as you dont use liquid.

No more Remingtons for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one flimsy shaver","review":"I bought the Remington ms 900 about 3 or 4 months ago. The tabs that hold the foil head to the shaver broke and it is useless. Appears to me a design flaw after reading all the other negative reviews from folks with the same problem. Fortunately I bought mine very cheap on sale as it is so flimsy I don't want it fixed or replaced. I just want it gone. Will go back to a good blade razor and forget I ever heard of Remington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"This shaver is a dud. The tabs break that secure the plastic head that holds the foil rendering the shaver useless. Remington sent me a new foil and plastic head with no questions asked. While that was nice, it indicates their ful knowledge they have a defective product in the market. As close as a blade? No way. It takes many passes to get a reasonably close shave. I have resorted to one final pass with a dry blade to finish what I expected this shaver to do. The cleaning base leaks fluid so that's useless as well. Do not buy this shaver. You will most likely regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this product","review":"I received an MS-900 as a gift. Shortly after, the base started leaking. I called for a replacement, which was sent. In fact, since I asked for a replacement for the $5 bottle of cleaner, they just sent an entire new unit. Within a couple of months of that, the head would no longer stay on. I went back to the first shaver with the new base. Within a couple weeks, the head wouldn't stay on. Called Customer Service and they said they'd send me a different model. Sent a F-720. This one is not self-cleaning and only has two heads. Though a price check reveals that the suggested retail price is higher, it sure does look, feel, and shave like an inferior product.Next time I need one, I'm going back to Braun. Had one of their recharables for over 10 years until the battery would no longer hold a charge. I should have kept it and used it with a cord; would have been better than these Remington products.Oh; by the way, neither of these shavers gives a very good shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This product is a very poor design.

It's the \\"hair catcher\\". This is apparently a known issue among both customer and Remington. A rep with Remington said that they're aware of this issue and would ship me a \\"redesigned\\" part. But they shipped me the same plastic piece. I have only shaved with it and put it in it's cradle since I've owned it. I don't abuse it. It just keeps breaking from regular use. After Remington replaced this piece for me 3 seperate times (it broke a 4th time), they are offering me a full refund if I send the unit back to them. I'll give them kudos for their customer service.

I read the blurb on the back, and I knew I had to get it, since my favorite general was mentioned, Belisarius.I regret the choice, and the lost money. This is the worst SF novel I have read since BATTLEFIELD EARTH. While the plot is not bad, the execution of the plot is terrible, and the style of writing is both lame and slow. Belisarius is converted into a kind of Superman, able to learn anything, do anything and kill anything.While David Drake shares the cover and the copyright, I refuse to believe he had much to do with this novel.

Unfortunately, I was left sadly disappointed. While there were moments of brilliance, I felt the battle scenes stagnant, the characters one dimensional, and the plot irritating and ponderous. It seemed to be a fluffy version of the General series set during the Roman era. The writing style was so mundane that those expecting a David Drake military experience should not waste their money. His name might be on the cover, but the book was definitely not his."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Could Be The Start Of Something Beutiful","review":"A great start to a alt. history series. Between Flints quality character work and up-beat nature and Drakes great historical knowledge and ability to write battle scenes, this series is starting with a solid pedigree. Especially noteworthy is that Drake has already take one approach to this story in the Raj Whitehall series, with very similar characters and settings (Raj is essentially Belisarius).Something I find especially intriguing about this novel is that it is both a alt. history and time travel book in one, with both sides being supported by a being from the future, somewhat indirectly.As is common with these books, the heroes are hyper-competent and the villains are semi-competent. The white hats are very white and the black hats are very black."},{"rating":"2","title":"An great example of mixing historical and military fiction","review":"This book is proof of why I am such a fan.

Much to my surprise this book turned out to be much more than its cover or authors would indicate. This may well have been Drake's way of saying that he can do better than potboilers. It may be that he and Eric Flint are natural collaborrators.Whatever the reason, this is a book chuck full of history, geography, culture, combat, intrigue, complex characters and good old fashioned SciFi and a great read.

Simply the best science fiction series of its time if not the best SF series of all time. Special effects may be getting better, but not acting. B5 had superb acting, three-dimensional characters, intricate plots, and surprises galore. You really got to love some of these characters and what they believed in. Yes, it's space opera, but it was also great science fiction in its own right. Why buy the DVDs?

I found the B5 series to be a breath of fresh air compared to what Star Trek TNG & DS9 were comming up with. The B5 series was, at it's heart an epic with a beginning, middle & end. The entire 5 season run was a long, singular story with many interwoven arcs. There is a lot of character developement that seems to be missing in many ST shows. There was also a real sense that not everything could be resolved in 1 hour. Many of the conflicts were not resolved happily (an entire race, one that had a few big spotlight roles, was wiped out, the cure comming a few days too late) It was this sense of frailty & real character developement that drew me to this show. I would have to highly recomend it as an alternative to the ST series."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SHOW IS GOOD AND THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.","review":"THE PACKAGING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

THE EPISODES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE, BUT I EXPECTED THAT SINCE IT HAD ONLY BEEN OFF THE AIR A FEW YEARS WHEN THE DVDS WERE MADE. THESE DVDS WERE ABOUT LIKE STAR TREK THE ORIGINAL SERIES.

If you havent seen B5 this is a chance for you to see them ,however do not get your hopes up about it being a complete series.The original first episode DID not have Ivanova on the show that part was played by a very beautiful oriental lady....thta wasnt even included.So how are you to understand whats goin on if you dont have the very first episode, or any sembelance of order to them.

Ends with \\"God sent me\\" -- fabulous moment. Sometimes you just want to have the DVD's from a show to remind yourself of the pleasure, sometimes just so you can see an episode here and there, but I have gone through the entire story arc on several occasions, and the pleasure is still there.

There is a complex story-arc with a clean ending (as opposed to show that just drag on season after season until they get bad enough to be cancelled). It's not perfect, though: the special effects are a little low-budget (but hey, this is 15 years old so you've got to give them a little bit of a break) and some of the acting is pretty bad. The last season was a little awkward; it almost seemed like an add-on after the main story thread had been resolved. Still, overall, I've loved this series and would highly recommend it to any Sci-Fi fan.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, lousy picture quality and packaging","review":"I have been a huge fan of Babylon 5 since I first saw \\"The Gathering\\".

Big Mistake! I actually am looking forward to the new DVD formats (HD DVD or Blu Ray) so I can replace this set.Picture Quality: I own several other Warner TV series on DVD and have always found them to have high picture quality. This series has fuzzy and out of focus scenes throughout and the prints used to master the DVD have scratches in virtually every episode. I have watched episodes of the series online and even the low bandwidth version has better picture quality.Bad Packaging: The DVDs are held in place by plastic inserts that are glued to cardboard. These are not well secured and have fallen apart.Think twice before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, awful packaging","review":"This, to me, is the best Sci-Fi show ever made (Firefly and Trek enthusiasts, feel free to disagree!). It comes off even better when watched on DVD on a modern HDTV and with 5.1 sound than it did when originally broadcast. Of course, the quality of the video and the sound isn't up to today's standards, but the story remains fabulous. The audio levels are sometimes inconsistent, which can be annoying, but that is fairly minor.The way the disks are packaged is awful - the hinges on these plastic multi-dvd cases break, and you end up with a bunch of loose disk holders rattling around. Not really a big deal, but annoying.Overall, this is a good deal, though, and B5 is really worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series but WATCH OUT!!!","review":"The series is very enjoyable, although the computer effects are sometimes rather fake-looking (but good for the time.) But if, like me, you're new to the series STAY AWAY FROM THE EXTRAS! The commentaries and documentaries are sprinkled with awful spoilers. A documentary on the last Series 1 disc tells us about a character who will turn bad halfway through Series 2, thus spoiling that whole episode, as well as all the episodes before that where you're supposed to be getting fond of that character. Enemies which are supposed to be mysterious are named and discussed in a commentary halfway through Series 1.

Unfortunately, this review includes the quality of the product. The cases that this set came in were terrible. Granted, they aren't quite as bad as the cardboard folders that the Stargate SG-1 complete series came in, but the plastic that holds them is extremely low quality and had broken in all five cases by the time it arrived at my house.

I liked this book enough to read it twice. I enjoyed the way Davidson tackles not only the subject of goal-setting, but also the different areas of life people would most want to improve.Sure, Davidson makes it clear that goal-setting is a process that must be quantified and timed, but how does one really go about setting goals? Davidson's answers are ingenious: from contracting yourself to enlisting others to monitor your process to conducting self-assessments.I am shocked to say that an Idiot's Guide was so helpful in making me a better planner. If you are ready to make your financial, social, family, even spiritual life better, then you should really give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"What I liked most about this book wasn't just the practical tips on how to move closer to your goals but also the motivation for you to pick and set goals in your life.

As a student of self improvement books for 7 or 8 years this is not one of the best I've read.In fact Jeff Davidsons book worries me that it might give the wrong impression on those first time readers that is really in need of self improvement.

I just bought this video, and 5 minutes into it I feel like I am watching an exercise tape. The girls were a cheesy touch... They don't show you fingerings, they just show Frank sitting on a chair and playing nonstop for 75 minutes. Furthermore, he's playing scales up and down the neck. yay. This tape is too standard as far as knowledge goes. Strictly a technique and speed tape to show him doing chromatic runs. You'd be better off trying to dissect a Stevie Ray Vaughan tune. While it may be an OK tape for an intermediate player, it's definitely not worth the price tag. Way too much money. Go for the Paul Gilbert video, or Steve Trovato, or Steve Morse.

He sits on a chair playing through chromatic exercises and playing scales. If I wanted this I could go to a website and then go to guitar mania. This video is no good! It didn't teach me a thing.

But what I really like about this book is that Picasso was the inventor of Reduction linocut printmaking technique, and here we have great example of his creative process as he digs deep within the materials and sees what comes of it. There are some prints that are absolutly amazing, and to Picasso's credit, they are incredibly imaginative and so simple. Some prints just look like gouges in the sand,..no biggie,..just not my thing.

I say a little because I spent a little, so expectations weren't high. First, it fits the stock okay but not securely enough to stop it from wiggling around and shifting during shooting. The material isn't very good quality either because mine is starting to rip apart at the seams and is getting worn out quickly. The biggest disappointment is that it doesn't even lessen the recoil all that much. I mean, it helps but doesn't reduce it enough to make it comfortable to shoot 25 to 30 shells.

Not worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this product","review":"Good idea, but it fits very awkward, it adds about an inch to the length, now it does dampen felt recoil, but after every shot the gel pad moves to the side off center from the back of the butt and has to be readjusted making follow up shots a pain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the kicks out","review":"As advertised, the unit slips into place on the butt-stock and, with a little adjustment, conforms to the overall shape of the gun. There are a couple of inserts that I left in place, as this item was to help soak up the recoil of a Mosin Nagant M19/30 rifle that was mounted in a synthetic stock and I wanted as much padding as possible. Overall, the unit did OK at the range, but I found that it did have a tendency to move about a bit and I had to readjust my hold.

Although a few of his ideas are insightful and make one think about hydration on a different level, he falls through the cracks with his gusto for how many eggs he can consume and his belief that water, no matter what the quality, is some sort of insulin.He's gathered wide attention with this book, but what many fail to see, is that he is trying to turn water into some miracle treatment itself. He disregards everything else and prompts the reader to treat their symptoms rather than to eliminate their symptoms altogether.Dr. Batman, I have not had anything to drink for over eight months now, and I lack thirst, dehydration, or any of these symptoms water seems to cure.

Fortunately, he was wrong. Duodecima make a magnificent job of what both the composer and I think is his best work, which lasts well over 18 minutes.The other pieces are superbly played as well (although the \\"Sonata\\" by the Uruguayan composer Guido Santórsola may be too modern for some tastes).The total time of the album is 44'59\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Real Page turner!","review":"I couldn't put this book down!

In some cases, Emeril will call for a certain amount of one ingredient, but it will never be called for in the instructions, or he vice versa, he will call for something that wasn't listed in the ingredients.

The Zen philosophy is clearly the road map for this journey, and Wallach is able to pull together aspects of the sport's traditions, frustrations and beauty to show us how golf is far more than just a game. The chapter about playing golf in Scotland and the one on meeting Peter Martin, a golf professional in New York state's Adirondack mountains who believes golf can enlighten us, are the two most enjoyable passages in this book.

She argues not against the particular biases of museum curators or art history departments, but against the common, vulgar didacticism that so often accompanies the presentation of art. She demonstrates how aestheticism and trained objectivity have been mugged by interest-group politics. She gives voice to ideas that are often thought but rarely so well expressed. I recommend this book to anyone who cares about art and high culture, and I commend its author for her insight and thoughtfulness on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, Sad Conervative Rhetoric","review":"The underlying premise of this book is that if the piece of art isn't a nice painting of horsies or kittens or that the piece is politically charged in the least, then it is not art and merits scorn.

It is important and necessary to understand the cultural context in which not only makes the book seem relevant, but also why Munson herself feels compelled to add her voice into this debate with her brand of intellectual populism. If you read this book, I would recommend reading any other book that might offset it and provide a perspective on why the nature of art is being examined and deconstructed in the first place. Trying to take art out of a political sphere of analysis, as Munson does in this book, is in itself a very political act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable blather","review":"A friend showed me this book. She didn't think it was very good, and neither do I. It's ironic that a book subtitled \\"Art in the Age of Intolerance\\" is itself so intolerant. It's also shallow, poorly written, and not terribly well-informed. Munson's only real talent appears to be for personal character assassination, which is applied selectively to the book's villains.In short, this is a book for people who already know what they want to be told, and are either afraid or unwilling to learn anything that breaks the mold now set by the reactionary right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaden, overblown; a complete suckfest.","review":"Every number here is played like the musical equivalent of walking through frozen molasses.

They were extremely grateful when I let them borrow my book. The Perlmutters know how to make an informational book interesting and enjoyable.

WDW for Lovers was a very good book, in particular their discription of theWDW resorts. This book had many other nice tips and information. If you have already read WDW for Lovers do not waste your money on WDW for Couples.It seems to me that this is a rather underhanded way to write a book. If an author is going to copy a previous book, almost word for word, I believe thepublic should be aware of this...in large letters perhaps, on the front jacket, \\"This is a duplicate of WDW for Lovers\\".

Lots of little, out-of-the-way sights are described, things you'd never otherwise know to look for. The descriptions of the Disney resorts are especially thorough -- this is the only guidebook I've seen so far that has MAPS of each resort!If there's a fault to this book, it's that the authors seem to love absolutely EVERYTHING they find at WDW - their most scathing restaurant reviews say mildly, \\"Well, this wasn't to our taste.\\" But the descriptions of everything are thorough enough that you should be able to decide for yourself whether any given item is something you would like. And frankly, I think the Perlmutters' reactions to Disney are closer to my own honest reactions than any of the guidebooks that go out of their way to find fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Buy It When It's Re-run on TV","review":"When TV shows are re-run after primary air, they edit out as much as 2.5-5 minutes of actual show in order to cram more commercials in.

I actually watched a few shows but I didn't care about Ross and Rachael. I just found it mind numbingly boring. I tried to find the humor when NBC renamed Wednesday \\"Friendsday\\" I just couldn't.

Like most of their previous publications, this one's full of good solid information and it includes a few photographs of key cards; however, anyone thinking of buying this book to use as a price guide should keep in mind that this was published in October of 1999 and is therefore not an up to date representation of current sports card prices. Depending on the player and issue, sports card prices can change dramatically in a very short period of time. If you're strictly looking for a price guide, then I suggest you pick up the most current issue of a monthly price guide magazine which will have pricing information that more accurately reflects the current market. This guide will put you in the \\"ballpark\\" in terms of pricing, but I recommend it more for research and information than for accurate pricing. Overall, a useful read for anyone interested in sports cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad if you like incomplete checklists...","review":"I just recently purchased this book off of Amazon, and once I started going through it, I quickly became disappointed. I have a very small stack of about 20 Bob Feller cards, and a few of them were not even listed, so I'm sure that there are several other Feller cards that are missing. I bought this book because I wanted to collect every Bob Feller card ever made, and now I am right back where I started - without a complete Bob Feller checklist. Also, though no fault of the author's, this book only goes up through 1999, so nothing from 2000-present will be listed, and the prices listed for each card are sure to be a little out of date.The good things about this book are that every major player you may want to collect will be listed, and they are in alphabetical order for easy reference.Bottom line: Nice book if you just want to collect a handful of your favorite player's cards, but if you're going for a complete collection, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SpiritWalk - Howard Lyons","review":"Hauntingly beautiful music comes from this CD.

In a world where it will never be a utopia (no matter how hard we try), it is essential that every person is able to recieve value for a purchase.

It reads like a rambling late-night conversation between two people with a lot of shared background knowledge; proper explanation of points is in short supply. Also, on the copy I bought here in Dublin, its back cover blurb is woefully misleading: \\"a compelling and shocking account of society's greedy over-consumption\\" that \\"paints a bleak picture of our increasing obsession with cheap goods\\". It is not! It's a how-to for retailers and businesses who want to negotiate the sticky world of cheaper, cheaper, cheaper, not an account of the real cost of low-price goods.A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, illuminating read","review":"This book is so good that I read all 250 pages in two sittings.

There was very little new information to improve my current program. Rather than informing you how to create your own program, most chapters highlighted programs from other businesses and your option is to attempt to squeeze a few ideas out of whatever chapter is similar to your business. I did find a few ideas throughout the book that I may incorporate and there is a good chapter on games and activities to energize the session.

But I was shocked and appalled when I first played the disc. The great glory of Gregorian Chant is that it is to be sung unaccompanied -- yet on most of the cuts on this disc (10 out of 17) an organ is heard none-too-discretely intoning the opening sequence of notes and then underscores the entire chant! It was very disconcerting hearing this, but there are other problems, too. The singing itself is some of the ugliest I have heard on chant recordings -- nasal and throaty. And in addition, on some tracks you can hear what sounds like doors slamming shut, things dropping on the ground... all manner of intruding noises. I have tried my best to overlook what I can only call defects in this particular recording, but I've finally decided I can't and will be unloading this disc pronto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaders of THEIR Time","review":"Leaders of Our Time is a biography-style book which depicts the lives and careers of thirteen of the world's most famous leaders around the year 1965.

Let's just say this book was not hard to put down. There were some interesting points though. Seeing which leaders are still talked about in our history books today, is an easy way to determine the actually influence of the leaders in the 21st century.

He was a chemist in one of the IB Farben complexes. His short but powerful story shows how stronger people were consumed, while a flexible youngster survived the camps by doing what he had to do to stay alive.This should be required reading for those people who deny that the Holocaust happened. It is also a reminder that the general population should always remember these events.

It didn't hide any swirls even after 2-3 coats of it. The color didn't change on the paint after applying the wax.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Holocaust was not a fairy tale","review":"The subject of this novel is all too real, and spinning it into a version of a fairy tale is totally inappropriate. The novel is cleverly written, and the author has contrived the facts of the Holocaust to fit into a fairy tale story. This trivializes the actual events, which destroyed millions of lives. The Holocaust was not a story to be cleverly twisted and \\"spun\\" into something else. It really happened, and a novelistic treatment of it still needs to respect the tragedy of it, and not use it for a clever exercise. I don't know what drew the author to write about this subject. Judging by her name, she isn't Jewish, Polish, or German. She apparently has no first-hand knowledge of the Holocaust, has never been to Poland, and has no other apparent connection to the events of this novel. So creating this novel was just an outlet for her creative talent, without true emotional content. This subject should not have been used that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for children..","review":"I was so disappointed with the crude language in this book. We have been doing a WWII unit study for school and have read MANY holocaust books. THis is the worst one we have tried to read because of it's terribly gross language and description. It is not for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected read","review":"I read this book as part of a book club. Did not know what to expect as this is a twist on some of the \\"lighter\\" stories we have been reading. Although I have studied and read about WWII I found it difficult at times to keep reading. It is still amazing and hard to fathom the terrors that occurred during this time in history. The author had a creative way to intertwine the story of Hansel and Gretel.This is not a book I would naturally just pick up and read, however, I am very glad that I did. My grandfather was a B17 bomber pilot in WWII - he never talked about his experiences, can only imagine what he encountered along the way at a very young age. It is a good reminder of history and makes me challenge my ability to stand up to injustices that occur in the present (no matter how small)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Some books have the power to stay with you for awhile and this is one of them.

Scenes so well defined that you can feel the cold and desparation. It was a total surprise to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grown Up Fairy Tale to Chill your Spine","review":"Following the outline of a children's fairy tale, the author places the characters in World War II Poland. The Jewish Hansel and Gretal are hidden from Nazi occupiers by unlikely and unpleasant collection of outcasts, making the story a complex examination of ethics.The ending is a little too pat, but the power of the tension throughout more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary Violence and Demented Minds","review":"How could anyone imaginatively add more grotesque and unspeakable horrors to an already tragic event in world history? Perhaps the deranged mind of Louise Murphy. And then deceptively entitle the book, \\"The True Story of Hansel and Gretel\\" when in fact there is nothing TRUE about it, save perhaps the setting of the book.It's one thing to read true life accounts of this most tragic event in the 20th century but to add fictional and morbid events to this for the pure enjoyment of entertainment is a bit peculiar to me.I read through about half of the book before deciding that I could no longer stomach the morbid and violent gibberish contrived by the author.Save your money. DON'T buy this book. Unless of course you are entertained by things like the raping of a young girl, purposeful and violent disfiguring of young innocent children and babies, and twisted accounts of erotic blood transfusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Fairy Tale","review":"More hopeful yet darker than the tale it is based on, this book had me in its grip from the first sentence. In short, this is a modern version of Hansel and Gretel set in Poland during World War II. The author managed to weave elements of the original tale into the story without being forced or obvious. This is a beautiful tale of the darkness and the light that humans hold and act upon and a prime example of a modern day fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Story of Hansel and Gretel","review":"This was a selection for my book club, so I didn't really know what to expect. It is a compelling read and a unique approach to the subject matter. Dispite the often graphic horrors depicted the overarching feeling is one of hopefulness. The characters (the good characters) rekindle a belief in the goodness of man and the power and selflessness of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful tale of Nazi-occupied Poland.","review":"This book tells the traditional fairy tale from a different angle. What if the witch was really a misunderstood old woman? What if the father and stepmother left Hansel and Gretel for a good reason? The story takes place in Nazi-occupied Poland, and describes how two Jewish children--called Hansel and Gretel by their stepmother--survive. I thought the writer did an excellent job of describing what life was like in Poland then. Not only the Nazi aspect of it, but also what it was like when Russia occupied it before the Nazi's did. It is a brutally realistic story. The only flaw I found with the book (and why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5) is that the character's motives sometimes aren't explained very well. For instance, we never fully learn why Magda changes her mind and lets the children stay. And what was her life like before the kids come? Not much explanation is given to that either. But overall, this is a remarkable book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morality play","review":"A couple who are close friends of ours recommended this book. The man is a Polish American who was born in a Jewish slave camp during WWII. If the parallel to the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel doesn't bother them, then it doesn't bother me. This tale is well-written, well-researched, and deeply troubling. The characters are complex and well-developed; the entire novel is a beautifully orchestrated morality play. One part of the story is so horrific that I skipped five pages or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I found this book to be very good. My definition of good is it kept my intrest, I couldn't wait to find out what happens and I felt like I was there. Louise Murphy wrote a dark story, but I think there was elements of unselfishness and understanding that many families, however they are composed face. I fell in love with Magda, the grandmother, maybe because she reminds me of my own, but what she goes though and utimiately gives up for Hansel and Gretel is tremendous. The book also shows the SS as the cowards that they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deleted it from my Kindle without finishing","review":"BEWARE -- SPOILER ALERTI work at a bookstore (lucky me) and someone came to the checkout with the book. The cover intrigued me and the customer said he heard it was a good book.

I saw no reason to take this book any farther."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"This story was amazing. The author was ingenious, taking this fable and using it to tell the story of two children who have to fend for themselves during the Holocaust in Poland. I was intrigued with the setting of this novel since I am part Polish. The author chose The Bialowieza Forest for the setting of this story after seeing a television program about it. Reading about this makes me want to research it myself. Ms. Murphy also wrote a very detailed and disturbing description of the horrors of WWII and the murder of the Jews in gas chambers. This made the story almost like it really happened. This was an unforgettable story. One I highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effects of the ravages of war on children","review":"An 11 year old girl and her 7 year old brother are given the German names Hansel and Gretel to hide the fact they are Jewish before being hidden deep in the forest in Poland by their father and stepmother as they try to flee the Nazi's in 1942. The story follows the children's struggle for survival after they are separated from the parents, along with the lives of the various people, German and Russian soldiers, villagers, etc. (I don't want to give anything away here) that they encounter. The author says that the story of Hansel and Gretel was the fairy tale most frightening to her as a child, and she parallels the frightening and cruel aspects of the fairy tale to those of the war very powerfully. An absorbing story with wonderful characters and effective setting. Last 100 or so pages were very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"Street racing is illegal and so is murder, but that does not stop the sell of guns, same as that does not stop the sale of Hot Wheels.

As I have worked with abused children for several years, I can attest that this book holds very true to the reality of too many children's lives.

The main character Bone, grabs your heart and never lets go. It sends a powerful message about child abuse through the thoughts and experiences of a juvenile. This will not lift your spirits, but it will make you more aware of how vulnerable abused children are. Unlike some reviewers, I do not believe all the family members are white trash, they are merely numb to these ways of life. Bone's grandmother on her mother's side is her salvation. Overall, this story shows the power of how family members can hurt or heal you. A wonderful novel for anyone who loves family sagas.

We should be proud that Dorothy Allison survived what she went through, wrote her story, then girls who are in similar situations read the book and get out of abusive situations.

An excellent read for anyone who appreciates good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful realism: an education that hurts but is worth it","review":"This book is unforgettable. Searing truths about an abused child in a tortured family. There are no easy answers, possibly because this book reads like biography, not fiction, and there are no easy answers in life. For anyone seeking understanding of how such things come to be, and what it does to the human beings involved, this is an amazingly educational book. For someone seeking someone who understands what they too have experienced, I imagine this book would be affirming. The main character does find a way to take care of herself, and some of her adults do come through for her, but the story, like life, is unfinished: you leave it knowing she has much work to do, and hoping she can do what is necessary. thank you Dorothy Allison for this gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"The title grabbed me first.

Well, I kept reading nonetheless, and I'm glad I did. \\"Bastard Out of Carolina\\" is beautifully and honestly written. The characters shock you with their realism.

The supporting cast of characters all blend into two prototypes: the drunken, violent male and the hardworking female. The plot device of the birth certificate stamped \\"illegitimate\\" seems tacked on to the beginning and end in an attempt to give the rambling narrative some point. The ending of this book annoyed me. It was a cheat. Disturbing for the sake of being disturbing. The mother character gave no hint of being capable of such behavior.

Is allison for real? Does she expect us to sympathize with characters so stereo-typed that they become unreal to the reader? The men in this book were all a bunch of drunks and if it were real life, they would have died of alcohol poisoning by chapter 3. Also, the book could shed a hundred of pages or so. There were many paragraphs that had to do with nothing. I would finish a whole paragraph and wonder what did it have to do with anything!?!?! And the masturbating bit got a little old. Sure she was abused, but did the author really have to describe Bone and her sister masturbating every other chapter? The author told how Bone shut herself off to the world. Well, the author shut Bone off to us as well. We don't get to see a lot of Bone's deepest feelings so we can relate to her. In other words, I don't think she was developed enough as a character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Jaymi","review":"Ruth Ann Boatwright is the name of the young girl that grew up in Greenville county, South Carolina. She was given the nick name ?Bone,? by her family and friends. The author Dorothy Allison, has a way of making her readers believe that this story could really be true. Allison gives a lot of detail to each scenario in the book. For instance, Bone takes a lot of physical and mental abuse from her step father Glen Waddell. Allison also gets very graphic in each scene, making her readers very involved and absorbed in the scene, not wanting to put the book down. Although sometimes very intrigued by her writing, people may also become very anxious while reading this novel because Allison tends to get very detailed on topics that are not very significant to the books purpose. In spite of this, Allison develops so much of Bones emotional baggage and carries the reading to a climatic ending that makes the readers heart pound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough girl out of carolina **spoiler alert**","review":"Allison writes a tough story about what can happen when a mother's love life comes between her and her children.

The events of this novel are very true to life of the Deep South of the '50s, and I do credit Allison for telling us how it really is up until its bittersweet end, where our justice is not satisfied, but Bone has a chance to end the cycle of violence.

I found it boring and I could not wait to finish it, this was the only time that I perfered the movie over the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bastard out of carolina","review":"I had read another book I had really enjoyed, so, this one came up recommended. I just couldn't get it to go anywhere. It seemed to drag, and was a struggle to finish. This one, hard as I tried, just didn't make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"voyeuristic and cheap","review":"How can anyone have such a sick mind as tu publish a book that is so awfully voyeuristic, so cheeply depressing? Why is the American public so thrilled to hear about horror, detress and above all - this is what one reads about by every other novel written by a female author these days - child abuse? Why are all these readers so impressed by a book so unsubtle that you just know there must be more complexity than this. The author has picked and searched the most awful details, brought the story to such a climax of sadness that I was left empty, with no feeling but embarrassment at having not put the book down before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"At this point, whether or not this book is well written is irrelevant. The story is so overwhelmingly depressing that I cannot imagine anyone enduring such a horrible life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is entertainment?????","review":"This book was very well written, but very, very depressing. I wonder if it was autobiographical -- surely someone who had not experienced such a horrible upbringing could have imagined living the life this author describes. Guaranteed to make you feel bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From your average ninth grader","review":"I have two points to make. The first one is that I think that Bastard out of Carolina should never have left the editors office. It is too long and many of the paragraphs, indeed whole sections should have been taken out or given some sense that it belongs in the book.My second is that though the last third of the book was packed with emotion, it seems that it is just that: packed with emotion. The first two thirds of this book seem almost devoid of any emotion relevent to the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"I read it in four hours. You cannot put it down. The characters are so interesting, likable, and they are so real. Then it ends all wrong. I do not want to read this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, yet disturbing coming of age book","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The writing is like poetry, yet at the same time its subject matter is harsh. Allison is a master at bringing the reader right in with her, and experiencing some pretty crummy stuff. The novel is not uplifting, but it is thick and heavy with emotion and suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and pain intersect","review":"In \\"Bastard out of Carolina,\\" Dorothy Allison adeptly portrays a world where love and pain intersect. Allison portrays \\"crab in a bucket\\" syndrome more truthfully and painfully than any other writer I have read. Allison's descriptions of violence and sexual abuse are accurate and painful, managing to convey Bone's shame as well as her physical suffering; the reader feels raw and vulnerable for days after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pool of tragedy","review":"I selected this book as an optional assignment recently while working on a master's degree in Southern culture. I have no regrets about my choice. Allison sucks the reader in through the eyes of Bone, a child that is the town joke as a babe due to the horrid red stamp proclaiming \\"bastard\\" on her birth certificate. Bone searches for identity and love through her family, the notorious Boatwrights, known for drinking, womanizing, and shooting, sometimes all at once. Bone also becomes the victim of a stepfather's lust and jealousy. Tragic moments and violent abuse grasp the reader by the collar and won't let go. Allison's prose is a pool of the unfortunate, exposing and in some instances celebrating the unspoken class, white trash. Do not deny yourself the pleasure of Bone, Alma, Raylene, Anney, and all the rest of the Boatright clan. They will make you laugh, tremble, cry and want to drink white lightning while listening to Patsy Cline records."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd stay away...","review":"What surprises me about this book is that although the author has positioned her work as a pathway to deeper intimacy, it actually is based on some disturbing and self-justifying postulates that rationalize the author's own denial and issues around true intimacy and love.I think it's dangerous for an author to define their reader's assumed experience and understanding of intimacy rather than to just offer methods and tools to enhance it. Some of her ideas around separation and independence within the framework of a relationship are puzzling and inconsistent"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Comprehensive and Dynamic Book on Partner Yoga","review":"This book is a must for yoga enthusiasts, partners wanting to deepen their connection and for anyone interested in reconnecting with themselves and others on a deep level. Elizabeth and Rex have written an easy to read, beautiful book that allows the profound work of partner yoga to be accesible to everyone. The hardcover version stays open easily making it user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"On the surface, from reading the inside flap, summaries and excerpts, I felt this could have promise. I liked the pictures and graphical design of the book. After reading most of the book, it turned out to be a somewhat amateurish essay, advocating an idealistic but unrealistic and impractical portrayal of the actual reality of intimacy and relationship, and the \\"magic\\" benefits of the author's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much fun","review":"I rarely come across a book that I don't like or cannot find some redeeming value... until now.What a huge disappointment!I struggled with the first few chapters hoping it would get better, but I truly could not finish reading the entire book as the author seemed to be making it up as she wrote...I practice yoga and have for the last 3 years or so. Being an actor, yoga helps me relax and I thought that my husband and I could try it together. No such luck here.I am sorry but I would not recommend this book to others.As I stated previously, I rarely find a book that I won't finish. This will be one of those.... sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I have been practicing yoga for several years and was looking for a way to introduce it to my partner. I found this book to be poorly laid out and I did not feel it had a cohesive theme. The poses were awkward, did not have the insight I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"There is often some difficulty when a book is translated, but this book is more strange than most.

I had purchased several workbooks for my son to use in preparation for his ACT, and he was more or less unimpressed. However, when I showed him the TSA-2400, he was actually pretty interested in it. Although we haven't received his score yet, I am quite sure the pocket tutor helped him do better than if he hadn't used it. It is a little pricey, but I think well worth it.

Dean Cain seems to be making a lot of these movies where he is stuck in a prison/bomb shelter being stalked by a monster or supernatural force. (Do a search for \\"Boa\\"). There is some strange camerawork with multiple split screens. It doesn't work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful Aweful Aweful","review":"Aweful. That's the word that best describes the movie. While I love the actor, he can't save the day even if were the real SuperMan. I think what destroys the movie more than the bad script (which us dragon lovers are used to), is the repeated dragon clip they use for most of the dragon shots. 1 shot moving down a hallway.. same shot, reversed. Oh wait lets do it again, and again and again. That's the entire visual effect of the Dragon. 1 clip being reversed like a pancake. Same shot mind you, going left then going right. That's it. That's the big Dragon effect. OMG, just shoot me! I even love B movies but this one was just aweful. I mean, even a bad script can survive if the cgi was halfway decent to make it a B movie but this one is definately F for Flush it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lower Budget Reign of Fire","review":"Although it's starting to look like there's a Dean Cain genre,of people trapped underground (under water) with him leading them out, this is one of the better entries.The Dragon may not have had the same budget as the one in Reign of Fire but it's decently executed.On the other hand despite some mis-steps the script for this one is actually better.If you like creature features like Boa, Crocodile, Komodo,Python etc you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"Everything from the acting to the visual effects in this film are rediculous!

He is an excellent non-famous actor and I hope he gets famous someday. Good movie, everyone was good in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon Fighter - Worst Movie - stay away","review":"Waste of money for producer to produce, waste of raputation for a actors / actresses to act, waste of money for consumer to buy, waste of time for movie lovers to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"I love dragons, and I love dragon movies, I also like B grade movies, but this one is bad. The acting was woeful, I mean really really bad, the story was ok. I tried and tried to like this movie, but I just couldn't.It might of been because of lack of money, but the same shot of the dragon over and over, flipped and played again was a bit much.The over use of multiple split-screen shots got a bit annoying, they work well when done right, but in this move they where done all wrong.If I where you I would stay clear of this one, but then again watching this will make other bad movies better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad","review":"I don't think i've ever seen a worse film than this.

Stay away from this film!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoutely Horrible","review":"This movie didn't deserve the 1 star that I gave it. I only put 1 star because you can't put zero. To start off with, my friend, who is an amateur film maker, can do better special effects. The front end helicopter shots were horrendus!! It was all 2-D and just not realistic. The shots of the dragon were a bit better, but hardly high quality.Now the acting was a big shaky. Dean Cain, who I respect as an actor, lost a lot of my respect from this film. During too many scenes it looked as if he was trying too hard to fit the part, and it just wasn't working.Well enough of my gabbing about how horrible this movie was. My advice to you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO RENT OR BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There can be only one dominant species!","review":"The story line isn't what's important here. It's the ol' \\"Playing with science can lead to miracles or...MONSTERS!\\" theme. It doesn't matter how predictable it is -- this is roaring good fun. Fans of Dean Cain will especially enjoy him in this role as the security chief in an underground military bunker. The dragon created by military scientists playing around with cloning ends up growing to full-size, escapes, and begins to wreak havoc on the world. Will the earth and humankind survive? Grab some popcorn and enjoy the ride! Some of the special effects are terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cow must-have!","review":"Great book if you are thinking about getting a family cow, really the best book I've found on the subject.

This anthology of creative storytelling at it's finest is a journey of laughs and screams through the Halloween season.I loved the idea of an adult storytelling party, and I am not offended in the least by Mayhew's last chapter that gives detailed instructions on how he does it. Yes, each will add their own touches to make the party their own, but a pattern that works is always a nice feature. Thank you.I hope there will be future editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to your day jobs...Not what expected","review":"I was really excited when I ordered this book from Amazon.com. I try to read a Halloween themed book every October to put me in the Halloween spirit; this book fell short of my expectations though. There are a handful of good stories, about 5 of them, that made me feel my money wasn't totally wasted. But the rest are sub par stories written by non-professional writers. There was really something lacking. It was a stretch at best for some of these stories to even be in the book, because they didn't deal with Halloween, only loosely hinting at it. The idea behind the book was pretty cool; a compilation of stories originally read aloud on Halloween Night at a series of Halloween parties over a ten-year period. All I can say is that if these were the best stories from the parties, I am glad I wasn't invited! ."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"I detested this book. There is nothing of Harvest Tales nor Midnight Revels in it, only one nihilistic depressing story after another.

I really really do not ever want to go to a party where such tales are read. Bletch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Gems But Mostly Predictable","review":"The one line summary says it all.

Nineteen stories and poems, all different but sharing the spirit of All Hallows Eve. It is the mix of fantasy subject and style, from humorous to macabre that makes this book so very appealing. A delightful, spooky volume for a stormy autumn night.Harvest Tales and Midnight Revels is really a prize; and the story of its creation, detailed at the end of the book, is almost as remarkable as the tales it contains!

It's a great book to get if you want to put the finishing touch on your Lackey collection, and it gives you some nice background on both Lackey and Dixon. I especially liked the story about the animal rights activists....it was very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"It was obvious that Mercedes Lackey just threw together a pile of previous works.

I was born in Eastern Kentucky, in the Appalachian Mountains, and am personally offended by this book. Adams and Smith deliberately sought out to find the most backward people they could, and pass them off to the rest of the nation as mainstream Appalachia. Portraits slaps the face of everyone from the Appalachian area, and keeps the extremely unfair stereotype of Appalachia alive. It is a very culturally biased piece of work, and both Adams and Smith should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flawed early science-fantasy","review":"I tend to agree with the second reviewer! Hodgson's bizarre world is fascinating but he has a weak idea of plotting and no concept of character development. I found the ending to be manipulative and absurd but the atmosphere is superb, better, really, than Jack Vance's treatment of the same idea in the otherwise-wonderful collection \\"The Dying Earth\\". I would strongly recommend Hodgson's \\"The House on The Borderland\\" for aficionado's of the weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lost Classic","review":"This is one of the lost masterpieces of the twentieth century. This is a shame, because it is also the most imaganative ever written.It concerns the future. The sun has gone out. The stars have too.And the land is infested by monsters. Humanity is confined to a great pyramid. But, one man must venture into the Night Land to save his lost love.If you can get past the weird linguistic style, it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets be honest here, you're reading a 1-star review to see whats wrong with the book.","review":"I picked up this book after seeing a drawn map of the Night Lands, and was amazed at the sheer imagination and wonderment that I felt going through it. The first half of the book did not disappoint me, wowing me with a practically ancient idea of science fiction, struggling with trying to describe things that he simply did not have the language for, like we have invented.Of course, after about the half-way point the entire book changes to how the author desperately wants to own his star crossed lover and have it be considered a natural state between genders. Pretty much from the 50% mark to the 85% mark(God Bless Kindle) is taken up with the character either obsessing over the desirable qualities of his lover, or being completely enraged that she is not an obedient servant. It honestly knocked me so hard out of the immersion, that I struggled to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"goodnightland","review":"a boring melange of mysticism, horror , & scifi.

Pointless whining by spoiled jerk who was lucky enough to join his favorite band, and paid them and their other fans back by ruining the band with self-indulgent noodling, then wrote this little yawn fest about it, thouroughly slagging all band members except his equally lame soon to be music professor cohort. Full of insights into one weenie's sweaty feelings of self importance, and love for a ballerina. I couldn't possibly be more sorry to have read this. Worse than Jack Chick. Way worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribe","review":"I couldn't believe how bad this book was. As a fan of the hardcore/punk scene in my teenage years I found almost the whole book to be unreal. I was actually rooting for something bad to happen to Frank because 1)he started to annoy the hell out of me, and 2)I just wanted something interesting to happen. The dialogue was totally forced and unrealistic and scenes tended to go on forever. In spite of myself, I actually managed to finish it. If your a serious reader, don't get this book. It is aimed at the young teenage crowd that doesn't pick up a book to often."},{"rating":"2","title":"man, was it FUNNY!","review":"Absolutely brilliant and very well executed. And it didn't cheese out, either. Truly, I think that it's an important read. I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it.

The writing is amateurish, and the entire novel is plagued by mistakes any decent editor would have easily caught. The characters are underdeveloped and the dialogue is wooden and unbelievable.

I can't describe how much of an effect this book has had on me. Nothing else I've ever read has so clearly interpreted the life of a punk, and told it so entertainingly. It's written in a way that makes you dread the thought of putting it down. I can't say enough good things, but, to sum things up, read this book. It will change your views on what it really means to succeed...and what it really means to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"All I can say about romalotti's books are they are amazing and grabs you right from the start.i have read this one 5 times already and it just keeps getting better.

Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. The main character, Frank Smith, was so well developed that I thought he was real and had to be reminded (more than once) that it was just fiction. Frank could easily be one of my best friends with his philosophies on punk and life in general. The book kept flowing, it didn't end-no boring parts at all. I can't wait to see what other writing the author has in stock in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I picked this book up totally on a whim. I've only read about a fourth of the book but man it's great. It hits so close to home with me. I'm mostly a \\"jazzhead\\" but the feeling that I got when I first heard jazz was the same feeling that Frank had towards punk music. I'm a musician and an artist so I understand the feeling that music has on a soul. Almost everything Frank went through growing up in a small town I have experienced all the way through college. This is a great book for anyone who loves music, not just punk music, any kind of music. I would have given it 5 stars but nothing in this world is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Bible","review":"This book was absolutely amazing.

I just bought another and look forward to another decade or more of use. A couple of great features to pass along would be the strong motor it has to cut through coarse facial hair and the built-in power prongs. Anyone that has had other trimmers knows how annoying it is to travel and lug around an extra adapter to charge a trimmer. This is so convenient. No matter where you are, you just slip out the power plug and plug into an outlet. Always readily available to charge up! There are many trimmers on the market, but none as convenient and straight forward as this model.

The main negative thing that I have against this trimmer is the height adjustment - the lowest setting is not quite as low as I prefer. On my old Norelco trimmer, I was using setting #3 - so the lowest setting on this trimmer is not quite as low as the 3rd lowest setting on my old trimmer.Other than that relatively minor gripe, the trimmer is very good - I particularly like the AC adaptor built into the trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beard Trimmer!","review":"I have had this Panasonic beard trimmer for about five years.

(Although IMO Fermin's voice and songwriting skills far eclipse Neko's.)I applaud Fermin for not being afraid to show a feminine vulnerability, especially on the lovely Baby Wont You Please Come Home, although I doubt the song lyrics will garner her an invitation to tour with Lilith Fair. Dragging On, My Town, Down The Road and Are You Gonna Miss Me To are highlights, but there isn't really a throw-away track on the entire CD.There are a lot of 'alt.whatever' female vocalists on the market right now.

The content is based on fact, as the author has spent time in prison, as a barker for strip-clubs, and as a junkie. Based on a simple story-line, with simple and cliched characters, Mr Morgan relies on the depth of detail and his story-telling skill to keep the pages turning.

The authors for the most part keep personal life and work of Gödel separated, instead of seeing them as a unity. A biography has to be the best of both worlds in my opinion. That's what makes the work of a biographical writer a difficult task. Maybe one of the two authors did the biographical part, the other one the mathematical ? And of course, everything about Gödel is great, brillant and alltogether grand. I am missing a critical view on his lifestyle and his view on music e.g.. Appearently the author of the biographical part was so in awe of Gödel, that he didn't dare to critisize anything about Gödel.

When I finished shaving part of my leg, even using the pop up trimmer for extra help, my leg still had stubble all over it.I use Wahl's Lady's Choice rechargeable shaver now. It's great, and is the best electric shaver I've ever used! It makes my legs as smooth as shaving with a disposable razor. It is great for those who need to shave daily, but can't use regular razors everyday due to irritation. It also comes with 3 different interchangeable shaving heads. The only downside is that it is not wet/dry. Quit wasting your money and take my advice...try the Wahl Lady's Choice regchargeable shaver.

The narrative is straightforward to follow, and does not involve much previous acquaintance with linux. It does help, however, to know some Java, going into this book, which does not attempt to teach it, per se.You can see that it is easy to install a web server container, and to hook this up to a backend database. All of which can be free, open source code! Given that this rests on a free linux operating system, the combination is ideal for startups or those of you on limited budgets.An alternative reason for using this book is pedagogic. You can learn about running web servers and databases, even if you have no current need, but want to understand and be able to say that you know this material. For example, if you want to upgrade your job skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Bible!!","review":"The book claims to be the Bible, which to me means that it is the authority on the subject...it isnt! To its credit, the book does cover a lot of material and gives you a basic understanding of the components of Access. However the major problem is that the book offers very few examples. There is a CD that comes with the book, but why do I need to reference a CD for every detai?! In fact the CD isn't referenced much in the book at all.This book would be a thousand times better if the author, instead of making the book like 1300 pgs long would get to the point and give clear examples.

For one example, the book includes the statement \\"Once your table is saved, however, if you change a field name that is also used in queries, forms, or reports, you have to change it in those objects as well.\\" Five pages later, a second sentence completely contradicts the first: \\"In previous versions of Access, changing a field name usually meant that any queries, forms, or reports that referenced that field name would no longer work and had to be manually changed. Access 2000 automatically seeks out most occurrences of the name and changes it for you.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Only","review":"Most people that this book would help probably shouldn't be using Access anyway.

I doubt they would hold the weight of the device if you were to move it by putting pressure on the seat or the seat backing.

It's a really nice stand, with memory card holders, and real neat lighting. However, if your looking for a cooling device you HAVE to look elsewhere. I don't have technical measuring tools but I can tell you that the fans would NOT hold a post'it note to my hand at two inches. The two small fans (appox two inches square each, 12 volt, 11 fan blades each) don't move much air and with very little speed.More technical: The included plugin mini power-pack is 9 volt, like a cell phone charger. I did try running the 12 volt rated fans at 12 volts, still not much air flow. Power supply or case fans are two thick to fit in as replacement fans, so don't think you can easily mod it that way. If you just want a stand or like the lights then it's OK.One star rating is my rating as a cooling device, given only because zero stars is not an available option."},{"rating":"2","title":"XBOX 360 Cooling Fan","review":"Okay, so I definitely would recommend this - only issue, is most of the time when I turn it on, it sounds like an electric pencil sharpener.

Now, besides that, it works great.I am going to try to drip some silicon lubricant on the fans friction areas and see if it helps. This is not a show stopper for me.The unit is powered by its own adapter, and does not draw power away from the xbox360.

The real story of these remarkable men deals with their enormous contribution to American modernist culture before World War II. Their sex lives are no more remarkable than any other bohemian group of their day and Leddick's voyeuristic obsession with bedrooms and penis size is ultimately boring to say nothing of discomforting. The endless number of sentences that include the words \\"must have,\\" \\"I assume that they,\\" \\"could have,\\" \\"might have,\\" \\"likely to have,\\" shows just how many cracks there are in the factual foundation of this tawdry and disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History as Cocktail Party","review":"David Leddick's look at the mostly homosexual art world of New york in the early part of the 20th century is an absolute pleasure to read. As a Gen-X gay man, I find myself very curious about the history of my culture. Obviously these stories aren't usually passed down from parent to child.

It's a cheap way to get into RF remotes that work through walls and cabinets without pointing the remote anywhere. However, I recommend stepping up to the RF20/RFS200 for not much more. It has an LCD screen with commands on the screen you can customize. So for example, the RF10 doesn't have A/B/C/D anywhere on the remote, and most cable remotes have commands like that. Or to control an xBox, with commands like A/B/X/Y, there's no 'good' way for the RF10 to do those commands. Sure you can program any button on the remote to do anything, but do you want to hit the number 1 to press A on your xBox? It's not intuitive. The RF20 allows you to put anything you want on the screen and I recommend stepping up to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric and Uninspired","review":"Jeff Goodell's book about his family and life suffers from having boring and mundane subject matter. His domestic problems are summed up in divorced parents and dysfunctional siblings that are wholly uninteresting and generally unsympathetic. His love for his brother is forced into the book to make the narrator more sympathetic and thus more central to the plot. Finally, the prose is as boring as the story as it is both unimaginative and all too simplistic.

The same thing happened to me when I heard Lisa Gerrard/Dead Can Dance song, The Host of Seraphim, which, btw, is on this album.:)That said, the music on this album is very moody yet soothing. I would go so far as to describe the music as haunting at times. Something you would listen to if you were intent on relaxing and just zoning out. There appear to be many influences in the sound of the music. It sounds as though the music was inspired from many countries all over the world, along with the Gothic period where the sound is what you imagine hearing back when in some Medieval Cathedral.Anyway, this a great album and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Buy Only One Tour Book For London...","review":"I've perused dozens of travel books on Great Britain and London in particular.

It does suck out black spots and oil and you can see it doing it. not all of it at once it takes patience for your face and skin to adjust. Warm water and scrubs help before you use it.

I have large pores on my nose which collect dirt and oil. The rest of my face is somewhat dry. I began by using an orange peel mask, then steamed by face with a hot washcloth. Then I used the nose attachment. It obviously sucked out the dirt from the pores in my nose -- you could SEE it collected inside the nose cup. The face cup did very little, but I don't have large pores on my face. Perhaps over time, I will see some \\"toning\\" of the skin on my face.

Honestly, it does work for me. The suction is strong (I even managed to get some purple spots on my face)and it did clean my face. On top of that, the suction had the effect of a good facial massage, which I would think will be beneficial on long run. I guess with a regular use there will be an improvement in the skin condition. However, if you expect that all blackheads will be gone with the first use, you will be disappointed.What I didn't like is the way the pore cleanser works in the shower.

Anyway, this pore cleanser really does work. I agree with those reviews who say it takes time to see the difference in your complexion. But, the very first time I used it, I could see LOTS of dirt, oil and maybe even a few blackhead collected on the nose suction tip. I use it mainly on my nose, and some on my forehead.

However, the next day, that area was completely bruised and dark red with blood under the skin. Another effort yielded two circular bruises - one on my nose and another on my chin. So while I believe this might work for some people, I'm not sure it won't damage your skin.

However, once I received it, I believe I only used it a few times. I was discouraged by the lack of any visual results, and I gave up on the product. I also read that products that use a suction action can actually HARM the skin due to the constant pulling of the skin. So, it may actually CAUSE wrinkles in the long run!

My wife would recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over heats","review":"I was very excited for this new trimmer but it over heats after about 30 seconds, so you constantly have to turn it off and on so it doesn't burn your skin. Plus its too big to curve to your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it - just what I wanted","review":"This trimmer is just what I wanted. I get horrible razor burn with a blade, even the special bikini razons and creams, etc. I have always used this type of trimmer to avoid bumps and burn. You can take the guard off so it trims close, and use the guard to trim hair to the appropriate length. It is easy to use and I don't get the irritation of a blade. Works great for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"I used this trimmer only a handful of times. I tried to use it the other day and it would not turn on.

It worked okay when it worked, but was nothing spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trimmer Ever","review":"I will start this off by saying that I am a guy who chose to buy this product. I was very skeptical about using an electric trimmer on my armpits and Southern region because I didn't want to get razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs, irritation, etc. I was more than pleasantly surprised to try this product and take advantage of how unbelievably easy and smooth this trimmer makes the entire process (as well as the end result). I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, just wish it went a little shorter","review":"This trimmer works beautifully. It minimizes hair and makes it much easier to shave or wax, saving you time, razorblades, and pain. I also use it on my arms, which reduces the appearance of the hair without giving that weird hairless shaven arm look. My only complaint is that the shortest setting is .125 inches, which is still a considerable amount of hair. Sometimes I remove the \\"safety\\" head and use just the metal part to get a closer trim, but you have to be sure to shave in the direction that the hair grows or it can pinch. I have had mine for about a year of regular use and it is still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bikini Trimmer I've Tried","review":"This product provides a close trim and shapes up the bikini area nicely.

This trimmer will not get you shaved smooth, but will trim your hair down relatively short. It allows you to chose what length you want your bikini area hair to be. It works great! I would recommend this product for any male or female who wants to trim their pubic areas. It is easy to use and painfree.If you are looking for a product that will remove all of the hair I highly suggest the Braun 2370 Silk-epil EverSoft Body System. It has two different interchangeable heads and works as a shaver and as a epil system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for women of color!","review":"I bought this product after comparing similar items and reading reviews and this is a great product.

It gets very close, but without any pain, irritation or bumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trimmer","review":"Overall a great trimmer if you not worrying about nicks is the most important thing you are looking for.Pros:Good for grooming male or female private areasCan close your eyes and trim without worrying about nicksNo need to worry about batteries running out or not retaining chargeEasy to handle and maneuver in hard to reach areasLow maintenance, no oiling of bladeCordlessCons:Not very powerful (need to go over same area multiple times)Need more run-time:Battery door build seems a bit flimsy (time will tell)Note: This is a trimmer only, does not provide a shave"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for my 'girly' parts","review":"I bought this because I dont like to be totally bare, plus razor burn kills me.I pulled this product out and used it the first day.

I don't find it as efficient as my old trimmer (which unfortunately doesn't seem to be in production anymore.) So, it's an effective trimmer, but you will have to make several passes over the same area. Perhaps the blades aren't as sharp as on my old trimmer. There is one HUGE CON - this trimmer drains rechargeable nimh batteries, even when it is not being used. As proof, I put a pair of fully charged batteries in the trimmer when it arrived. I used it once, and the battery power was fine. I tried to use it again a week or so later, and the batteries were completely drained.

It's too thick and awkward to get into all those hard to reach places, at least for me. It did work well for trimming prior to shaving, but if you don't let it get to that point, it's unnecessary anyway. I'm not sure who's going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn't trim the hairs short enough that I want to see you in a bikini after using it!! Plus, for this price, it should be rechargeable and wet/dry. Save your money.

It also didn't trim completely bare, however it was better than a manual razor as I didn't get those awful red bumps afterwards.

I bought the 4600 to replace a 3650 model which was stolen, unaware of this crucial difference -- the 3650 allowed you to view DVDs through the cable RF input. As a result this unit is completely useless to me, unless I want to spend the money for a new tv set.

HOWEVER, the firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem, and the last I heard, there was a class action suit filed here in Pennsylvania (which I received an invitiation to be a part of, but could not participate in, I think because I no longer had the receipt).

The disk simply needs to be cleaned with Windex and a paper towel. I have recorded many movies with the same three-hour tape for the last two years and the tape still records perfectly. Programming for recording movies at specified times is easy. My only regret is that I am able to only have seven events to be recorded.

From the stage to the recording studio, Hewitt provides the reader with what he/she longs for, a better understanding of what life in Oasis is really like. However, Hewitt seems to intent on playing up Oasis as rock gods instead of focusing on the personalities that drive Oasis. While it's interesting to read about many of the events that take place before Oasis became the worldwide superstars they are today, Hewitt in no way gives deeper insight into the minds of either of the Gallagher brothers.

Such as full transcripts of Noel-Liam arguments about nothing.

The book jumps from one minor story to the next - in some places it jumps forward and back in time - but somehow does not read as a whole work. Imagine a (badly written) 400 page magazine article about a rock band and you will grasp the overall feel of this book. Hewitt seemingly glorifies Oasis's worst behavior (Noel's and Liam's fights, tantrums, moodiness and hardcore drug use). The book talks glowingly of Noel Gallagher, as a songwriter and musician, lumping him in with the greats; Lennon/McCartney, Jagger/Richards, Paul Weller, Pete Townshend and Burt Bacharach. While he is, indeed, a talented individual, Noel would be the first to admit that he is not in the same league as those music giants. There are some great stories in this book and diehard Oasis fans will get some enjoyment out of it.

Standard notions of Rousseau are illuminated with unique jewels of obscure ironies and tragedies in Rousseau's work. Hence, Johnston's keen observation of hidden ideological meaning in Rousseau is an imperative addition to any political literary collection. This book is recommended as required reading for both scholars and avid followers of theory who wish to augment political discourse with the decorative nature of Johnston's perspective. A must-read for political science students, and a necessity for those academicians possessing a dire need for flair in their lecture discussions.

I also had a new problem occur recently. The printer decided to no longer recognize 11x17 media size and now every time I want to print at that size, I have to custom set it. Very annoying.

It also is a low carb diet, so initally you will see some weight drop off, but just remember it is water loss. I don't like following low carb diets because as soon as I add in carbs, of course the weight comes back. (Carbs hold water- but no matter what, I don't like seeing numbers go down and come back up)If someone has quite a bit of weight to lose, don't buy this books.

You are using 1 board, not multiple cards with numbers. And instead of the middle position of the card is free, you now have four corners as free. The game is for 2 players up to 4 players. It is very easy to understand even for pre-schoolers. After explaining the rules, most of them can play the game outright. The only thing that is a bit harder to understand is the strategic part; but that comes in later as they play the game more and more.

I'm not a fan of \\"gimmicky\\" games, those that are more on the toy side rather than game side - I cannot stand The Wheels on the Bus (I tell my son it's broken).

I think the age suggestion is a little off, I would put it as best for 5 or 6 and up. The strategy is a little tough for our 5-year-old but he loves being a team with Dad. Another plus is that it is quick to play so we can do a quick game before bed or play it again and again when we have the time. We love it as one of the few young-kids games that doesn't bore the adults to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for older children","review":"We love this game, but I think the 3-6 age range is a little young, 4-8 would be more appropriate.

This isn't his most well-known book, but it is probably his more enjoyable one.Why do I say that?. I find \\"Aguafuertes porteñas\\" peculiarly enthralling. This unusual book is about nothing and about all. It compilates some short articles that Arlt wrote for the newspaper \\"El Mundo\\" (from Buenos Aires, Argentina), between 1928 and 1933. The subject of those articles was the \\"porteño's idiosyncrasy\\", shown clearly by the author's cutting and acid observations. The stories are many, and the characters different, but all of them, taken as a whole, allow us to appreciate the diverse components of Buenos Aires' society, at that time.This book is very easy to read, provided you speak Spanish. Arlt's style is concise and straightforward, and I think you will enjoy it. All in all, highly recommended !!!Belen Alcat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Relate?","review":"Anyone who has ever been in a pipeband (especially a lower grade one) will appreciate this.

The base is large enough to support my 12 foot diameter umbrella in any position, using water vs sand. Very happy about that. Don't attempt to move the stand around when it is full. the construction is not as sturdy as a free standing basketball base and damage will most likely occur. Plenty sturdy to move when half full. Really only important for initial umbrella placement.

The white color was so bright and imposing that I bought some brown spray paint at the local hardware store that is specifically for painting plastic and I painted it. Now it looks and works great!

I would recommend this product to anyone buying an offset umbrella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This thing is huge but it does the trick. We get crazy winds here and even a tornado touched down in this neighborhood last year, but my umbrella went nowhere.

I can only fill it up to the seam. I don't know if that is going to make it heavy enough to hold up the umbrella in the wind. I'm very disappointed. It is very large and ugly and takes up a whole corner of my patio, but the umbrella won't stay up without it. I guess I can try filling it with sand, but that's going to make it almost impossible to move if I want to take it down to the back yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and broke after 2 days","review":"We filled the base with water as instructed and it held our umbrella really well. On the second day we noticed the plastic was warping, like it was melting in the heat, except we live in Denver and it doesn't get that hot. We took the valve off thinking it was building pressure inside...but that didn't work. Still warped and ugly looking, like someone stood on in and smashed it in. We decided to move it in the shade and see if would regain it's shape. But no, it popped a seam and water gushed everywhere. Product sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated","review":"I ordered this product simultaneously with my offset umbrella and, based upon the enthusiasm of reviews I read, felt more confident in this part of the purchase then in the umbrella itself.Yes, it works, but then so would a few bags of sand or several pavers, or just about anything else that is heavy that you could lay on top of the base...and none of these other solutions would be any less attractive or take up more space on your patio. All of them would be considerably cheaper too.One should understand upfront what you are buying with this: a large and very unsightly white molded plastic reservoir. A pretty cheap looking piece of plastic for about $75. This should cost less than $20 for what it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Effective","review":"The base is on wheels so easy to transport. Just fill with water and you're good to go.

The box indicates that this base is available in the tan, white or hunter green. 2) This base is HUGE! 3) It had ugly molded handles that are not shown in the picture.Back to the size, I was planning on placing my offset umbrella behind an Adirondack chair and have the chair sort of hide the base. But there is no way! This base is not only gigantic, it's thick and cannot be hidden except for under a table. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big but efficient","review":"Offset umbrellas are difficult to anchor. They have no center of balance, so that has to be supplied by something very heavy. Cast iron or concrete would be expensive to ship and near impossible to move about. This base is very lightweight until filled with water. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to drain the water and the lid on the top could not be closed once the unit was filled. Great concept, but poor in execution.

He invites the bear inside, and proceeds to help the bear remove the aching tooth. The antics include raiding the refrigerator, knocking over a lamp, and finally jumping off the window ledge with a rope tied around the tooth to make it come out. Seeing the illustrations of this bear in a quandry, and the sleepy father who comes to investigate all the noise in the little boy's room, and the bear trying to hide from the Dad, is what makes the book so hilarious.

The problem is that I spent too much time playing with the unit trying to get it to work properly.It has several Achilles heals, the biggest being the firmware upgrade cycle. You copy one of two files to it and cycle the power to the unit. It's supposed to update the firmware and allow the second file to be copied.It's always been a dicey process, frequently failing for the first few trys. The most recent try has apparently killed the unit completely. It's dead, and won't complete the upgrade, nor accept a charge to continue trying.The other problems were sticking keys, and the very difficult method used to delete tracks. I listen to podcasts and remove them after use. It's very difficult to do.

The brochure that comes with the sock actually states this, \\"Provides a non-constricting, mild compression (8-15) which is below capillary pressure. The product is not contraindicated for diabetes even if the patient has small vessel disease. The mild compression simply helps keep the sock in place to prevent sliding.\\" In other words, they fit a little tighter to prevent slipping down the leg. I ordered the women's large for size 10 1/2 to 13. I wear a women's size 10 wide in shoes, and the size I ordered fits perfectly. They feel like regular socks, and on me, fall about mid calf.

That said, this is an indispensable manual for understanding Ericksonian hypnosis from someone who started studying with Erickson at age 19.Therapeutic Trances is not an easy read, but what you learn in the pages will probably change not only your practice but the way you see the world.

However, if you have a large telescope (greater than 12 inches or so) or are a more seasoned amateur, you might want to invest in the more detailed Uranometria 2000. Sky Atlas 2000 comes with a clear plastic grid overlay for getting exact coordinates (I wish it were made out of a more durable plastic - mine has grown heavily scotch taped with use).

I don't recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok...","review":"This item is just ok. I prefer the fisher price jumperoo. For one, it doesn't seem that comfortable, plus it is a pain to hang in the doorway. Also, it is a pain to take down from your doorway, so you are constantly having to shove it out of the way when you don't take it down. I guess the only thing nice about it is that it is a space saver..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy, but might be better with a tray","review":"We've only had this toy for a few days, but my 3 month old son seems to like it. He hasn't quite figured out the whole jumping thing yet, but he likes to use it to help him stand.Assembly was very easy. Took maybe 5 minutes tops and no tools.The only thing I don't like about it is that sometimes my baby's head is the closest thing to the door frame, and if the doorway isn't wide enough and he's moving a lot, his head could bump the door frame. Other jumpers have a tray around them, and when choosing a jumper I picked this one because it didn't have one, but a tray may prevent this one slight problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so-so","review":"The thing is just not \\"springy\\", it's too stiff.

He drowns in this thing! he flops all over inside of it and its not very springy at all! going to find a replacement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not use much","review":"My son was about 7 months when we purchased this product and he used it 3 times at the most. I felt it was not safe for him and his arms just looked as if they were very uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but doesn't fit our doorframes","review":"Maybe it's because our house is over 100 years old. I don't know, but i read and did all the measurements, but when it arrived it wouldn't fit. It may be because from the edge of the door frame to where the top ledge part is quite long. I wish the description had been better because then I would have known this, but there wasn't even a picture of what the attachment looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This a fine jumper, but my baby {eight months} tries to jump in it, and is distracted by the rope. He can barely move his head around freely. He also has to keep his arms out because of the rope and he wants to play, and cannot really in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bouncing, just dangling","review":"We thought our 5-month-old daughter would be able to \\"bounce\\" using this product, but she can't. I'm assuming there is a spring encased somewhere in plastic? I can't really tell! If there is a spring, it's too flexible and doesn't provide any resistance. Also the protective plastic casing gets stuck. So even if the spring worked, the casing kills off any \\"bounce\\" the spring may have provided. Our daughter is content to dangle in this thing for a few minutes, but then she gets bored and cries. We're going to donate this product to Goodwill and try to find a bouncer that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIDE SEAT","review":"At 9 months old my 27\\" baby still hates the jumper I think because the seat is too wide for her legs to straddle comfortably. Plus when I tried adjusting to the right height, the thing was too high, then too low... and baby was a pain to keep putting in and taking out of the seat. She fussed and wiggled too much. Oh well... glad it works for some babies (and parents)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby swing","review":"Great toy. My seven month loves it. He can stand while being supported and loves watch his brother play beside him. He likes the upright position as an alternative to lying on his playmate or sitting in his chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I rate this 4 stars only because it is a bit difficult to get my son in and out of the jumper...it sways around while I attempt to slide his chunky legs in the leg holes. Takes practice, but eventually we get him in there. With that said, he absolutely loves being in the jump up. We purchased this to take some work off our arms because at 4 months all our son wanted to do was stand (supported by us) and so this product was a life saver. The spring is a bit tight, but it doesn't seem to bother him. Other than getting him in there we absolutely love this jumper! When he gets tired of bouncing he just hangs out and checks out his environment from a new perspective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumping safe and fun","review":"This was a wonderful chose for my 6 month old grandson, it's safe and fun. No booboo's from this jolly-jumper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the bounce?","review":"My other children loved jumping in their jumper but this one stinks! It doesn't go anywhere. My son can only jump as high as his little legs push him - he doesn't even get off the ground. It's as if they are trying to make it too safe for babies. They've taken all the bounce out of it. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby needs to work hard to jump","review":"The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"AKA the Johnny Sit 'n' Dangle","review":"Okay, so I chintzed out and bought the cheaper doorway jumper. I wish I hadn't: the spring on this thing is so stiff that there's no way that my baby could make it jump. She just sits there dangling and looking unhappy. If you want to avoid disappointment, definitely buy the more expensive brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but could not use it","review":"We bought it to hang on the door frame. Unless you have an extra extra wide door frame, this jumper would not work well. When my daughter sits on it and moves around, she will bump to the sides of the door frame. After a couple of tries, we decided to return it and bought her a walker instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible spring!","review":"We have two of door jumps - two different brands. One that works perfectly and this one. The inner spring is not smooth at all!! Baby has a harder time jumping. Spend $15 more and get a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth it!","review":"I got this because it so closely resembled the jumparoo that I played in for hours when I was a baby. It's a classic design that still works today! I love that I can take it down and store it in a very small space when it is not being used, and it is easily washable (important if you have a \\"happy spitter\\" like my son). Two caveats: first, if you have a petite or preemie baby you will need to use a thin blanket or towel to help fill in the seat and make it comfortable for him (our son was 11 pounds and 5.5 months old in thE pictureS I attached). Second, make sure that you have ledges over the top of whatever hall entrance or door you plan to use this on. I wasn't careful about checking this when I bought the item, and unfortunately there is only one arch that this will work in, all other doorways don't have enough room between the top of the door edging and the ceiling to place the hefty clamps that keep this jumper up and safe. HAPPY JUMPING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loves it","review":"my son loves it, he is almost 7 months old and 19 lbs and can really jump in it well. we got it for him when he was about 5 months old and he just went from side to side, but even then he liked it. we have large doorways in our living room so it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"This toy is great! My son started playing in it from 3 months. At first he only twirled, but now, at four months, he loves to jump in it. He teeths on front rim, too! Very safe and well made jumpy seat. We did pad the door frame with a couple of rolled up blankets, though, because our son likes to swing outward when he jumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"I liked some features of this, but Graco makes a better jumper that is more stable. This one wouldn't even come close to touching my floor either. We have high ceilings in our house and I had to return it b/c the poor baby was swaying in mid air and the jumper didn't even balance well for me to consider putting a stool or something under him to kick off of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful...until it stopped working.","review":"My daughter (7 months) loved her Jenny Jump Up; it kept her entertained for relatively long stretches up time, great for keeping up with housework on my end. However, after a month of use the spring device that enables the jumper to, well, jump became \\"sticky\\" (for lack of a better word) and jumping is no longer possible...too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheaply made","review":"The seat is set up where you slip two metal bars threw the material to make the top shape, but there is nothing to keep the bars from sliping around, so as the child is jumping the bar is moving making an akward shape which sometimes will move the straps in front of the child or in weird places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not how I remembered it...","review":"I remember having so much fun when I had one as a kid. Getting in and out is a huge hassle if they have squirmy legs, also, setup was easy but not the greatest thing i've ever put togethor, could have had better directions. The leg holes are too wide for my daughter so I recommend putting a towel or somthing to boost her up. Overall the design is safe and clamps very well onto the doorframe, I tug on it to make sure its safe. 2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get in and out of.","review":"I would not buy this product because it is difficult to get my four month old in and out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?!","review":"Can this really be classified as a jumper?! The spring might as well be stuck! It doesn't bounce at all. I can't believe Evenflo would even attempt to sell this terrible product. Such a waste of money. I'm disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't bounce, nearly worthless","review":"As many other reviewers noted, the spring has too much friction and does not bounce so the baby just spins around. The problem is with the spring rubbing against the inside of the plastic tube rather than the vinyl strap. I used a pure Teflon bicycle drivetrain lubricant between the tube and spring, which only slightly improved the bounce. $20 wasted, will go buy one of the other more expensive brands since reviewers report that those actually work.I am getting tired of these companies continuing to sell so many products that simply do not work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a hit with our daughter","review":"Stiff suspension, not bouncy at all. Might be scary for babies who are already mobile and like exploring independently. Our 9mo seemed excited at first but quickly became frightened as she realized she was tethered to a fixed spot. She's used to cruising and crawling. Wanted to encourage her to bounce by moving it for her, but it's not springy at all. She's terrified of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok.","review":"My son did not like this at all. I don't know if it's cause he's bigger for his age but he hated it and we tried it several times. He much prefers and activity center bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"awkward and dangerous","review":"I find it extremely difficult to get our baby in and out of this thing. It seems you need three hands -- two to hold the baby upright, and one more to guide her legs through the leg holes. I suppose if your baby is cooperative this is less of a problem but ours loves to push her feet against things rather than thread her legs through openings, so getting her in the jump-up without a second person is not at all easy.Once she is in it, she seems to prefer to just spin around in the same direction over and over, twisting the strap tightly and getting upset when she can't twist it any further. When she does attempt to jump up and down she is constantly swinging side to side, making it impossible to leave her unattended for even a split second, for fear she will hit her head on the doorway.Overall I am just too scared of my child getting hurt while in this product for it to be worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions and picture of product show two different things...","review":"This product has gone a little down hill since I was a baby as all things lately. Mother in-law and I had trouble putting this thing together for one thing not that it was hard but it was not SIMPLE. We tried looking at the picture to get an idea of if we were doing it right but it did not work out. It is a pain to get my son in and out of, but he enjoys it. The reason I give it a low rating is because putting it together was a pain and they used to put it together for you but now to cut cost they make you read confusing instructions for a toy so simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I am babysitting a very \\"fussy\\" 4 month old...I purchased this hoping she would like it...so loves it!!! It's well made also.

Atleast now I know I don't need to buy it! It was verrry boring and slow. There is no real plot and it is a complete waste of time watching. Not to mention the fact that they must have ran out of real actors so they through in Snoop Dogg. There is more background music than people talking or anything going on in the movie. Almost the entire first 5 minutes is just music...pointless. Recommend renting it before buying to make your own choice. Prepare to be bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT..don't let your little brother read it though.","review":"Rash kind of makes you wish Romalotti was an artist, so you could see what was going on in his head. The way he describes things are very unique, and at the same time realistic. When he talks about something a character does, even if it's something you would NEVER consider doing, after you read it you feel like you've experienced the same thing as that person. It was also extremely blunt and realistic. No candy coating. The end was interesting...especially since I finished it in math class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"Wow! I can't say enough about this book! Rash has a fast and clenching pace that makes it hard to put down. With so many detailed characters, it would be hard to not find bits of yourself in at least one of them. The characters and disturbing plot draw you in until you feel wrapped up in the twisted world Romalotti has created. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"super","review":"I read this book in about a day and a half, so it's not too long. I must say, it is pretty excellent. I had ordered Salad Days but when it came, the pages were out of order. So I sent it to Romalotti (the author) and he sent back a good copy along with this book (personally signed). I read half of Salad Days and I couldn't take it. The metaphors were unbearable. I thought I'd give Romalotti one last chance by reading Rash. What an improvement! For one, he stopped with the metaphor thing (thank you!) and started using details. The story line is great, and he comes back with an old character from Salad Days (Frank). I don't want to ruin the book or anything so I won't say much other than I loved it. He still continues to give some great music references.

Anyway the effort given by Richard Scott (in this book and especially through his excellent Money Chords webpage)is invaluable.

I also have played it as an ambient, atmospheric background. The results have been the same. It works. The music & sounds definitely seem to clear the air (so to speak) and impart a gentle serenity.

The only difference is that the new one has a couple of slots at the edges to accommodate a change in the labels.

Read the book instead. As Steve Coogan says in the film, Sterne's novel was a post-modern novel written before there was any modernism to be post about. Well, okay, but that doesn't provide license to put anything at all on the screen and call it a movie, as has been done here. I'd have been happier with this film if it had approached T.S.in the spirit of Menippean satire rather than in the spirit of postmodern sloppiness. Also, I don't necessarily see Tristram Shandy as conventionally unfilmable. If Lord of the Rings could be filmed, why not T.S.? Maybe the better approach would have been to film only Volume 1 of T.S., keeping in Parson Yorick, his horses, the midwife, the learned jokes and all the animal spirits rather than to have shortchanged the entire novel so shamelessly. Then there'd have been opportunity for eight sequels - an entire \\"franchise\\" of T.S. movies, just like James Bond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Well, that's part of my life I'll never get back!

Don't waste your time; there are a lot of other movies out there that are better than this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The antihero comes through in the end","review":"A long, seemingly pointless shaggy dog story of a movie, but beyond that a real tale with genuine moral dimensions. The \\"hero,\\" played by Coogan, is barely likeable, he's egocentric, petty and dissolute. Yet through the chaotic maze of the film, he ends up acting as a tender father to his infant son and a faithful lover to his mistress/wife. There really is a subject matter, and humane center, after all, despite the layers and layers of postmodernist posturing. Brilliantly done, even if not for all tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the most part, dull and boring","review":"The book was pure genius. This movie should not have been made. The parts of the movie that are actually taken from the book are good; but they only account for about 20% of the movie. The rest is a bunch of supposedly ad-libed, present day dialog about making the movie, new scripts from America to review, how to shoot scenes, etc. Dull and boring, and those are complements! This film was a total disappointment. Some may think by making the film in this way the movie adds on a layer of irrelevancy to a book that was about irrelevancy. Unfortunately, it fails miserably. Who ever wrote this script was no Lawrence Stern and should have stuck with making a movie based on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a horrible mixture","review":"We have more conversation between the actors than we haveof the fictionalization here.The acting may be good what there is of it:just hard to find with all the stuff that isn't really the movie?I gave up on it after about a third of the waysince it never seemed to get past the birthof Tristram Shandy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very memorable","review":"A great film, interesting and thought provoking without taking itself too seriously, whatever some other reviews may say. It isn't the usual but there's far too much of that anyway. I do accept it may not be every one's cup of tea, for me one of my favorite films of the last decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully, I borrowed the public library copy (details)","review":"This film evolves from the novel (by Sterne) \\"...which could never be made into a film.\\" It still has not.We have two elements here:1. A contemporary attempt (morbidly unsuccessful) to replicate the humor of Monty Python, and,2. A sort of an abysmal \\"anti-film.\\"More important is perhaps what this movie is not: a film conveyance of the novel \\"Tristram Shandy.\\" Most of the scenes concern the PRODUCTION of the film with clips of supposed British wit as the actors and the production crew interact in an impromptu fashion. The entire result is embarrassingly pathetic and, while I personally thought that Monty Python was roll-in-the-floor hilarious, this flick is devoid of practically any levity at all.So unless you can generate a laugh out of watching a window fall, mashing a post-toddler's fake penis, I'd definitely pass this one by.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great manga to read","review":"Personally i dont see the refernce to sex in the city and happy mania. I think Happy Mania holds its own. You follow the character shigeta through her search of a soul mate and end up laughing along with her.

If you have a sense of humor you will like Happy Mania."},{"rating":"2","title":"LMFAO!!!","review":"Words cannot convey how much this series rocks!

I have proof. I lent these to my friends who do not touch the stuff and they freaking loved it. In fact, one of them kept my books for a month and read them over and over again.

Unfortunately, I didn't care for the series at all. I found the main character boorish, whiney, loud, and stupid and I didn't care much for any of the other characters in the series(Fuku was the one I liked the best and she is in it the least) I don't care much for the artist's style and the repetitive, episodic nature of the series didn't keep my attention.I'm a big fan of romantic dramas, both shonen and shoujo alike, but I found the story to be shallow and far too slapstick(and not in the good Love Hina way)I'm glad TokyoPop is expanding into the more \\"adult\\" realm, but I wish they'd try another series....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This is a great resource for preparing to teach through the book of James each week for my youth group.

I live close enough to DC that I can see the Washington Monument from my grocery store and my two year old is constantly telling me about \\"the red balloon\\" every time he sees any of the landmarks in the book. He engages on the paintings and sculptures and is interested in visiting the places the balloon when we talk to him about them.

My girlfriend was really surprised and she said that she's been discussing this book with her friends, but nobody actually owned it.The book is amazing, both outside and inside. Outside, it has a shiny wrapping and a hard alumium cover. I have never seen a book with such a cover.It had a CD too, with the song \\"Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body\\".It describes Madonna's life, from her early sexual experiences, to where she is today. It has pictures of Madonna nude, and it explains some of her views on sex.She thinks that if you are a guy with lots of money, you can have a pretty girlfriend, even if you are not handsome.It is a remarkable book and it will impress all of your friends to whom you show it.So, don't hesitate, buy it. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring piece of history","review":"Add three stars if you are a Madonna fan and you liked the videos which caused so much friction with MTV.

Her book, Sex, with it's portfolio of nude images with the combination of design and production was beyond any book I've seen. However, I don't think of this book to be erotic but an example to Madonna's metaphorosis into the artist that she is now. It's like watching someone grow through pictures. Most 80's performers didn't last as long as Madonna's as she continued to reinvent her self through her career. The Madonna today would never produce the sex book (she's writing childrens story books now). \\"Sex\\" captures Madonna in her most dramatic reinvention.I recommend this to any collector!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-arty-farty Crap!","review":"The only value this pseudo-arty-farty book possesses lies in the name of its author, namely, Madonna [the queen of mass market endeavors]. Yes, this is a wonderful collector's item, if you're a fan, and you want to see Madonna in all her 'staged glory', however, this books adds nothing to the genre of erotica.

It's a very nice edition otherwise and I hope to re-acquire it someday after the error has been fixed. I like that it has Thomas Moore, which Shakespeare is believed to have partly written.

However, this hat's material has no rigitity to it whatsoever, once you have it on your head the brim droops down in the front and in the back making you look like a complete dork!Bailey claims the material is wool felt, yet if there was any wool in it at all it would be somewhat water resistant - which it isn't. Like with many other hats, the leather crown band is subject to constant stretching or tightening. The moment you take it of, the hat's shape collapses into something like a touque!The only better choice is the elastic brow band inside that makes for a comfortable wear in general. However, in this case it doesn't really matter - this hat is a complete joke and a waste of money.

In this story the female lead comes over as a spoilt aggressive journalist, and the male lead as a complete moron who'd found himself in a situation he'd never wanted and then craftily manipulated his way out of it. He deserted a person who could have been a good partner, and rewarded a woman who was complicit in thieving his affections and a child not her own. No heroes in this story.. the mother gets her child back, her \\"primordial\\" right, but then has it playing happily in a pen while she writes...this actually dosn't happen, a child wants your full time attention at all times, so either you put it in daycare, or wait till its asleep..... this leaves me wondering yet again why people are so careless about contraception...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"Moves along smartly with interesting characters, good dialogue and sense of place.

I read two of his books in less than a week (this novel and LEAVING THE WORLD). His novels appear to deal with very serious subject matter (suicide, guilt, post-partum depression...) while still managing to be very intelligent page-turners. The novels I've read thus far were written in a female voice; Kennedy is superb at this.This novel is about Sally Goodchild, an American foreign journalist, and Tony Hobbs, a British journalist, who meet while on assignment and fall in love. Sally becomes pregnant so they marry and settle down in London. Sally has a complicated traumatic childbirth and soon falls into terrible post-partum depression. Thereafter, Tony takes actions against Sally that lead her to realize that she never really knew him at all...I don't want to give any spoilers so I will stop here. I highly recommend this novel.

It wasn't until she went to the hospital to deliver baby Jack that the author belabored (no pun intended here) all the boring details and strung out Sally's hourly symptoms and emotions ad naseum. I began skipping sentences and speeding ahead, hoping to get on with their lives at home, but the depressing writing just wouldn't stop.

Dr. Neumayr read copious letters and notes about the 4 composers, and came to his own conclusions about their medical histories, giving us background as to what medical practices were at the time, and what would have been standard treatments and understandings of health. Even if you're horrified by what you read (Beethoven being punctured to relieve his abdominal swelling due to fluid retention) you'll come away with renewed compassion for not just the composers, but all people who lived and died in the 18-19th centuries.

This old game is so durable that it looks like new decades later! We love it so I bought this smaller labyrinth spin off game. My kids ages 11, 8, and 5 had a blast playing it. They love both now. However, the quality of this game isn't as good. The old stuff is very thick cardboard. I expected the same quality cards. When the cards were thickness of regular playing cards, I was disappointed. I know this game will be played a lot, so to make cards stay better on the table and not shift so easily, I glued them onto a cork liner that has an adhesive backing. It worked very well. The cards don't fit into the plastic case that goes into the box, but we just split the cards in 2, wrap with elastic and put back in the box. They fit just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful game","review":"We have been playing the board version of this game for 17 years, and bought this game to travel with.

What I received was a set of four deflators along with a little case. They are adjustable- supposedly over the range of 6-30 psi. Mine can go a bit higher, up to 32-33 psi. To adjust them you need a pump and a pressure gauge, but the adjustment process is straightforward. Once adjusted, they work beautifully, providing a very convenient way to \\"air down\\".

The typos were horrific! Half-words, mis-spellings, abbreviations that I didn't know what they meant, etc. Whole paragraphs were indented. Who formatted or proofed this?

In its present from it does nobody a service. Jumbled words, changing text. Kind of frustating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monkey perhaps?","review":"We've all heard the theory that given enough time with enough monkeys and enough typewriters, that one of them would actually produce a novel. Well, I think this is one of those monkey tests. The typos are so bad, I couldn't get past the third page. Even for a free download, it isn't worth the price of admission.It's a shame because I was genuinely interested in the story, but it's just not readable.

I even emailed Mr Maxim about it two years ago as I am disabled and cannot read dead tree books. Imagine my excitement when I saw all of Mr Maxim's titles availble for my Kindle...but it quickly turned to disappointment when I found, like another reviewer has mentioned, that the formatting was atrocious; there was no cover art or TOC; and the books (I've checked 2) are filled with missing words and spelling errors. They are essentially unreadable.I have emailed Mr Maxim to make him aware of this. One can only hope he, or his publisher, will correct the problems and issue a revised version soon. Until then do not purchase these ebooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"edit, edit, edit","review":"As others have said, this Kindle edition is a mess. Font size is either tiny or huge with no in between. Hyphenated words are everywhere - and they are not words that should be hyphenated. Paragraph formats are screwed up, etc. VERY distracting!The story line is good, not as good as his last novel, but interesting if you can get past the print problems. It does drag here and there. This book really needs a good editor to condense the story.Had I paid $10 for this, I'd be seeking a refund just for the horrible formating problems. I got it for free, so I guess I can't complain.My advice? Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"First of all the charge cord for mine needed to be put only halfway in or it would not make contact. Then the battery never charged. I took it apart and found the connection to the battery fell off. They didn't even solder it they just used some sort of weak glue for all the connections.I mean ALL of the connections were weak. When I soldered one another fell off until I soldered all of the connections. It was actually brand new in the box too."},{"rating":"2","title":"production error on CD pressing","review":"Since I saw at least one other reviewer mentioning the fact that the song \\"Let's stay together\\" from Bill Mason's \\"Gettin Off\\" ends abruptly at 03:48 on his CD as well, I feel I should mention that this must be a production error on the CD pressing, since the original title on the vinyl is 8 minutes long! And I went already through two CDs (the second one brand new, in factory shrink wrap), so it seems to be a general error!Not only are we cheated out of most of Bill Mason's solo, but we are also not in for Hubert Laws' fantastic flute part!I will not give this twofer a low rating because of the stated fact, since it is absolutely cool stuff (both albums), but I thought it be worth sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to Get This!","review":"If you like the Guitar, or Jazz, or Gypsy Jazz. Listen to the tracks, and you will be amazed. In spite of the aged foto on the cover, this recording sounds very modern, crisp and clean. There is excellent bass and drum accompaniment. The drummer sounds like John Convertino of Calexico, and that is High Praise. The songs are rendered very musically. Some of the Gypsy Jazz giants produce such an incredible barrage of notes per second, that the actual melody is submerged. There is nothing wrong with that, but this serves as a very pleasant counterpoint. The only song I didn't give a five star rating to on itunes was \\"Everybody Loves Somebody\\", because I can't listen to it without hearing Dino. And that's not pretty. So if your collection includes The Rosenberg Trio, Bireli Lagrene, The Dorado Schmitt Family, You need to add Tchan Tchou Vidal to your collection. (Available for MP3 download at reasonable price.)

The reality is that little is known about the artist's life. The author makes clear what scholorly research and scientific analysis tells us, and about several different theories surrounding the work. For example: the different styles of paintings could mean different artists working under Bosch in a workshop, or it could just mean he was inconsistent in style. - and nobody knows yet.This is an important look at the artist who has inspired so many - including the surrealists.Dixon, to places Bosch into historical context. While many look at Bosch's images and try to paint him as an alchemist, a heretic, or a madman, Dixon approaches Bosch with an open mind, but with an understanding of the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints","review":"There were no marks in my book and it looked as thought it were only read once. I like the seller but it DID take a bit longer than I expected for it to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many better titles on the market","review":"I was surprised to see that this title is still in print, almost twenty years after it was written. The first chapter of the book, on the role of pre-understanding, is valuable and worth reading. However, the rest of the book suffers from a number of flaws: overly scholarly language (as one with a Master's degree in religion, even I had trouble understanding parts of the book), a bias toward conservative interpretation, and an over-reliance on white male and especially German theologians. Liberation theology is given only a glancing mention, and feminist theology is nowhere to be found. There are newer and better texts to be found on the market, that take advantage of the diversity of voices that are being heard in theology today."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Blues buys I have ever made","review":"Sonny Boy is just a piece of the world that doesn't exist anymore.His talent is everlasting and if you can sit and listen to him for long without saying ..Wow!!

This book could not hold my interest. I became bored, lethargic and eventually sleepy. American Cinematic/American Culture is for the \`history buffs,' in other words it is for individuals who are passionate about history. They have studied history extensively and have an expertise in a particular era or subject. My professor seems to come alive by engaging the class with colorful tones, along with his animated presentations adds life to these characters and its era. This has assisted me in viewing history in a different perspective, positively. By no means am I a lover of history but, I am more knowledgeable regarding some of the major events and how it plays a vital role in our society. To keep me engaged, however, I would rather be enlightened by my professor who keeps me salivating for more, rather than learning it from a book-without colorful characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased American Cinema","review":"I was able to receive the book on time. Very useful textbook, full of information of course. This textbook is divided into three parts and within that are several chapters. Total of 17 chapters; about 500 pages.

I couldn't afford a color fishfinder and I wanted to put the transducer on the trollong motor but the quad that came with it was designed for a transom mount. Called the Humminbird 1-800 number and they exchanged it FREE OF CHARGE for the quad which mounts on the trolling motor. I am very satisfied with the resolution and being able to double my under-the-boat viewing area with the quad.

I reccomend this book highly, but don't fail to read the rest of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of wonder shared with human frailty","review":"Chales Wright is an amazingly fine poet. How he is able to look and see things we fastscan everyday and in a mere few phrases turn that blink into quiet monument remains a wonder to all who read him. Read? No, luxuirate. Wright's strange friendship with death introduces us to dark rooms, hand held in his lighted clasp, and gives meaning to all the mysteries nature giggles about in the corner. He is able to pluck the most mundane of ideas and place them in a land of myth and history and encourages us to think? Yes. But also he encourages just to read his poems again and again..........along with the poems of others, he adds, smilingly.

Although I have very little background in the investment or retirement planning arena, I have found it easy to follow, and very helpful in providing guidance and sage advice on financial planning.One of the things I have enjoyed the most is that although there is a \\"wealth\\" of information in here (pardon the pun), they have made it easy to find and digest the material that's appropriate for each individual. Rather than reading sequentially, chapter by chapter, I have enjoyed reading different sections as they relate to my area of interest and stage in life.Wonderfully written, nicely laid out, and with terrific content, this book is a \\"must buy\\" for anyone interested in taking control of their financial future."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK...and pass it along to your adult children!","review":"What a unique, well-crafted personal finance book. Instead of talking in platitudes about all the things an investor should do, Reiser and DiColo describe in understandable language the 7 pitfalls that can ambush you on your road to wealth. In each chapter, they describe a different pitfall and then illustrate in one or more case studies how the pitfall impacted a specific investor's portfolio. The case studies are actual stories of the authors' clients, and one or more will cut uncomfortably close to the quick for many readers. I am amazed to have found myself and how I've been sidetracked in at least 4 of the stories. The good news is that it's never too late to get started. I'm now armed with the tools I need to stay focused, and I'm encouraging my adult kids to read WealthBuilding so they can avoid the mistakes I made and can have a more solid footing at an earlier age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied at all!!","review":"I bought this book based on the great reviews it received. I made it through half of the book and had to stop. My biggest complaint is they fail to include results in their clients portfolio's after 1999.They are big fans of equity investing (of course they work for a big brokerage). In one of their stories, they berate a former advisor of one of their newer clients for having them in bonds. Not that the percentage overall was too high. But, that the advisor had them in bonds. Well, the authors didn't mentioned where the client sits today with the heavy equity position the authors put them into.Being financial advisors (brokers) for UBS Paine Webber is no different from being a broker at Morgan Stanley, ML, or Smith Barney.I found this to be a waste of my money. I thought Suze Ormans books were far better than this book. A lot more honest too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful attempt at self-promotion","review":"This book is nothing but a thick marketing brochure. It discusses the basics of financial planning, but it incorporates the authors' own subjective analysis and opinions, which, based on their reasoning, often times borderlines dangerous. It leaves unrealistic expectations on the readers with no real academic backing and no real insight or intelligent commentary. Rather a lot of ignorant comments, hypocritical recommendation, and poor order of discussion. I feel by reading this book, you may actually becomer dumber than had you read nothing at all. The authors clearly designed this book to be a celebration of self-promotion.Normally, I give books away when I'm done with them, but I would be insulting whoever received this by doing so - so into the garbage it goes! Please don't waste your money on this one - you're far better off with books by Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein, Larry Swedroe, Jonathan Clements, Thomas Stanley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and Beautiful","review":"Of all the colours in the Garnet family, if you prefer the lighter more red/orange stones, then this is the bracelet for you!

There is some useful material in it, but it is so poorly written that t's hard to tell. There are non-sentences, some sentences that are impossible to understand even after re-reading, non-sequitirs, and more typos than I have seen in any other book. The text repeatedly says things like, \\"At present (as of this writing)\\", without telling you when that is -- and the data given will be at odds with data just a few pages away, which begins with the same disclaimer. The text is also highly repetitive -- how many times do I have to be told that cHTML is just like HTML? The material on WAP is internally inconsistent, and, from what I can tell, outright wrong in places. Many of the pictures appear to be low-resolution images....

Of course, in Christian times, photos of male nudes were items purchased under-the-counter (until very recently).The photos apparently date from 40-50 years ago, when the \\"ragazzi\\" enjoyed and embraced life, and found no problem at all in doffing all of their clothing to appear as they were born!All in all, if you enjoy photos and images of the youthful male nude, by all means put this volume in your library!

This cartoon is very fun and light-hearted. However, my father thinks Blinky's voice cuts through walls. I guess it might be possible to find it irritating. My only problem with this set is that it plays the theme song only once at the beginning of the first episode, not even the beginning of each disc just disc one, and the closing song at the end of disc three. This can make it difficult to tell when an episode ends, but MOST episodes end with someone, usually Blinky Bill, saying 'extraordinary'.

It was not the ideal book for any one attending disneyland our california adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid introduction","review":"It's a great introduction. Lots of fun facts and ideas. It's nice to have a guide that doesn't assume you'll be there with your kids. I honestly recommend it for straight childless couples as well.The only downfall to it was just a slight annoyance. My partner and I had one question- where to stay? The thing this guide does that I don't love is it passes over the moderately priced resorts and tells you to move up a step. It's that blanket assumption again that all GLBT are better off financially- which isn't always true. But that's honestly the only real downfall I give this.Otherwise it has a fantastic run down of everything including where to find characters, what's in the area to eat, and neat little facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaying around Disney","review":"Much of what is in this book is not particularly original. Every book on the market in reference to Disney Parks offers a much better summary. I used this book on a recent trip to DisneyWorld and didn't find it useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid entry in the series","review":"This installment in the Advance Wars series might disappoint some because it's mainly more of the same, but when the original was fantastic that's not really a bad thing. The AI and campaign story have been much improved along with some other minor tweaks. Be sure to look at the clock when playing this game, because it still makes the hours flow away frighteningly fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Picked it up after seeing the great reviews it got and found myself agreeing. I never played any of the earlier advance wars games, and it came on real easy. I hear using the touch screen isn't popular with folks who played the old game, but for me it was the best method. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Turn Based Strategy Game","review":"I've been playing video games for over 25 years now and I must say that this is one of the best turn based strategy games to date. It features a nice combination of units and its easy to get the hang of the game play. There is a solid 30 hours of gameplay value here and the flexibility with units make it a fun game to replay numerous times. You can control the game either through the handheld controls of the DS or entirely through the touch screen. The graphics and layout of the game are superb.If you own a Nintendo DS, buy this game. If you do not, buy this game and a NDS. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rEaLlY fUn GaMe","review":"Advance Wars Duel Strike is a really fun game.

The unlockables are cool. The missions are rad. There's just something about hitting the presentation of a game 'juuussst right' that really gives it legs.

These are great for causal birders who don't want to lug around 3lbs giant binocs.They have wonderful clarity and zoom distance for such a small size and the quality for the affordable price is superb. The most wonderful thing about these is that when you change the focus, the knob at the top glides smoothly and firmly.I would avoid getting this for young children since they have a tendency to drop things and often have sticky and/or gooey hands. This is product is too high quality to give them. Get children under the age of 10 a cheap pair of $12 binocs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment","review":"What a mean little book! After AMERICAN STUDIES and AN ARROW'S FLIGHT, each in its own way very well written and rewarding, Mark Merlis has little to offer this time out except a central character who seems not so much real as he is a cliched vehicle for the author's contempt for the people he writes about, their world, and his own themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm very disappointed in this book.

Like Frank Peretti's books, this book is a very interesting drama of angels guarding us and demons enticing us to make bad decisions. Theodore gives us a view of how important our role is to the rulers of the Universe. It makes my life much more meaningful when I know that I am so important and that I have an important role to play in the next life. The best part was when God showed his power to his attackers. I did not understand much of the symbolic language in the beginning. However, I learned the secret of the power of the key given to Christopher before he got into trouble. There are probably a lot of interesting clues with lessons behind them that will take time to discover. That is, unless you ask the author. Beale has a great mind and his books will help many people see the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Abomination","review":"I've never seen a bigger load of crap than this before. This author has no spritual sense at all. He wrote about some low-life 16-year-old kid is supposed to be the \\"key\\" to storming the Gates of Heaven. First of all the Gates of Heaven would be guarded better than anything else and it is. Second of all JESUS CHRIST is the only key to Heaven. And also this man can't possibly claim to be a \\"Christian\\" if he writes about the Gates of Heaven being stormed and he also uses quotes from some evil Heavy-Metal rock bands. Parents I strongly suggest you don't allow your children read this if you want them to keep on the right path. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased at all","review":"It was not at all what i wanted and it didnt come with all things that it was supposed to.. i will probably never shop on here again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Feeling","review":"This CD reminds me of the the worst decade in music since the 1920s.

The 80s had, well, the \\"Thompson Twins\\". zzzzzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both conceptual and practical tools","review":"This is an outstanding book. While naturally oriented to strategic management of health care it is also a comprehensive framework to strategic management in general. The book's layout is that of a university textbook but it is also written in an enjoyable style. I read this book as a practitioner and not a formal student and found it extremely readable and helpful. The authors present both conceptual and practical tools for strategic management."},{"rating":"2","title":"Service Excellence","review":"The book came in excellent shape and I received it way earlier than expected.

I have purchased Rapid Fire and Rapid Fire 3. I recently purchased this one because I wanted a 90 minute workout that had a variety of segments. This workout is so much fun, that I couldn't believe how quickly the time went. Susan's moves are not too complex and the core segment is excellent. I burned 540 calories doing the full 94 minutes!

Our daughter hasn't played much with the beads but all her friends that come over have enjoyed them. She loves the chest with the little drawers and stuffs little objects in them often. I would recommend. The colors are girly and vivid. The chest is thick and sturdy. She was 4.5 when she received it and still enjoys it at five. This is a toy that we won't just toss out. A child will use it as the grow for various reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Publisher","review":"\\"Elaborately stylized yet profoundly faithful to their subjects, Katsushika Hokusai's prints are marvels of the block printer's fusion of art and hard-won technique. Compositionally more straightforward than Hiroshige's woodcuts, Hokusai's are no less complex in their evocation of place. They are crowded with humming life.

I would return the book if it wasn't worth the cost of return."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great overview of insects","review":"This book has a lot of useful information about insects. It describes basic characteristics, life cycle, and much more. It also includes info on other terrestrial arthropods, such as spiders and centipedes. As a field guide, it focuses on families of insects, not species, which makes more sense because there are so many species that are hard to identify. There are great photographs and descritions as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSECTS!","review":"I'm taking an insects class right now and this was a required book, but I'm glad it was because it contains a simple way of introducing insect orders and other arthropods to people who do know much about the topic. Also, great images and descriptions a few families of that order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking To Put Your Music Notes","review":"This book assumes you learn to play an instrument without learnning to read music notation. It tries to match the note with the sound, and test you to see if you know the notes. You take each test using the CD. In order to use the CD correctly The author recommends a CD player that \\"searches tracks\\", not a CD that shows \\"time remaining\\". You can use a \\"time remaining CD to synchronize but it's not easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner as it says","review":"I've never read music and want to start playing violin. This book said it was suitable for any instrument, but by the notes and exercises, it is CLEARLY geared towards piano. Even so, I decided to continue on. This book was so utterly confusing and only half explained things in the first few pages that I gave up and will be taking this useless book back to the library and be in search of something that REALLY IS for beginners and can give complete explanations. I would not recommend this book to anyone that is a beginner....it may be okay for those of you who know a little about how to read music to begin with, but I don't know.Also, the cd that comes with it is so old, that it's not even in mp3 or wma format and you can't select tracks like it wants you to do.

If you're not playing this game with a bunch of music teachers, then it wears out pretty quickly. It has the potential to be a lot of fun but it's a few minor tweaks from being a good game. It seemed a little disorganized, and we ended up just going back and forth between 2 teams trying to come up with songs (basically making up our own rules along the way). It's definitely better when you have a large group of people, as opposed to 4 or 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"so fun","review":"I love this game and I hate to sing, how ironic!!!

Even if they aren't music buffs they will enjoy it!My favorite thing is that you can repeat cards in different games unlike so many games that are over once you have done all the cards.

Three Ears could strip paint off walls; at the very least, you'll want to hop in your beat-up Chevy and drive, drive, drive.

If you find that interesting, the rest of the film might be worth watching. On the other hand, a short Youtube video has more plot, more dialogue, and more sensuality. Though the other reviewers had commented on the abrupt ending, I was not prepared for how abrupt and senseless it really was - it was as if the director had suddenly run out of money or time and just had to end the film.

Seeking to unite with Hassan (a vibrant and colorful character from his childhood in Iran), Terrence Ward penetrates into the soul of an ancient culture and captures the nuances of this fascinating civilization.

This is an arrogant, shallow, stupid, and presumptuous book, with absolutely no genuine insight revealed whatsoever beyond the banal. Instead of taking on important issues like racism and the Middle East, he settles scores with Black Panthers and allegedly anti-Semitism in the pro-Palestinian movement. Gitlin is no leftist-he's wedded to establishment, Democratic party politics. Events since he wrote this book have discredited that view, obviously. People like Gitlin have made their peace with the status quo, and are left to try to dress up banality as profundity. There is literally nothing to be gained from reading this book, other than an understanding of the difference between the genuine radical left and self-absorbed blowhards like Gitlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"This is politics with attitude, presented by a former sixties activist who has plenty of sincerity and passion, though he has a somewhat convoluted writing style. Todd Gitlin - the former president of Students for a Democratic Society, the SDS - has a great deal to say, much of it worthwhile, though couched in nostalgic reminiscence of his youthful activism. Given that, former sixties protestors may find more here than current rightist young idealists. His observations on the faults of the Left and the strength of the Right are, if not original, stimulating. He does draw potentially useful lessons from the sixties, as seen through his prism of leftist activism and leadership. We recommend this fast, historic and forward-looking read. In these turbulent times, Gitlin encourages participation, discourages violence and believes the individual can still make a difference. Who could quarrel with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick","review":"Gamestop is awesome, it was less than a week to get the bundle.

The 1993 Remix of \\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"Copacabana\\" give the songs a toe-tapping beat. \\"I Wanna Do It With You\\" and \\"Lonely Together\\" are very difficult to find on his original studio compilations, but can be found here. All the rest is pure Manilow, and is great for anyone who loves Barry or is looking for romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Manilow Collection","review":"This import collection is the best and most underatted. It includes excellent new versions of \\"Could it Be Magic\\" and the 1985 (also underatted) \\"I'm Your Man\\". The \\"Could it Be Magic\\" remake is especially interesting as it is uptempo and actually closer to the original unreleased version.It was also nice to see \\"I want to do it With You\\" and \\"Lonely Together\\" on a single album.

The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods!

A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like being caught in a wind storm","review":"There is one, though certainly not the only, thing that sets Muir apart from other naturalist writers in my mind... adjectives. You will not find minimalist prose in any of the condensed tales found in this beautifully bound book. However, you will find wonderfully descriptive passages that engage the senses and provoke imagination. The Wild Muir is a great introduction to Muir's exploits and beyond that to the creative non-fiction field in general. This book will provide a wonderful escape for adults and children alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of garbage!","review":"To be honest, this book doesn't deserve even one star.

This book came out when I was in High School so my review may be short. However: In light of recent events I feel this work needs to be made public again. As I recall, the story involves the major Superpowers(of the time) and their secret, covert and ongoing hidden battle being waged using some very complex weather manipulation devices. Today one does not have to stretch one's imagination to see the world view portrayed is both prescient and perhaps accurate.

Well, the game didn't come to fruition, and the book is now out of print. But I recommend a re-release and possibly a feature diasater movie on this same theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Maybe I shouldn't review this book because I only got about 60% through it. In doing so I not only failed to find any interesting weather processes (I am a weather hobbyist), but I could not find any characters to give a hoot about.

For one thing, the broadcasting is pretty lame. They are pretty repetetive, and the things they say aren't that cool. Furthermore, the court sound is focused on sneaker-squeaking rather than a good solid ball-bouncing, which makes it all even more tiresome.

I was also surprised that there was an on/off switch to activate the 'noise cancelling' circuitry. I put them on, turned them on without having music playing and it all sounded exactly the same, no noise cancellation at all. Later when I turned them on WHILE listening to music, I realized all it did was make the sound louder. I came to realize its not 'noise cancelling' circuitry that got me excited about this product, but it was just circuitry that makes it louder. Other than that, these headphones are Okay.

Usually, the theme of the section is expressed through a large scene, in which the individual items can be seen. They are also separately shown, with English and Spanish description. I was happy to see that there were bilingual glossaries and that the Spanish-English one gives Spanish pronunciations.This dictionary primarily concerns nouns, with use of the proper Spanish article; there are merely one section on verbs and one section on prepositions and adjectives.

Perhaps that's still a little too lenient. Widcomm slapped together the PC850 using poor design and poor testing. Its weak engineering shows its flaws every time I try to connect the Bluetooth device in its USB slot.Like other users, my experience with the H500 is fine. Motorola apparently did this one right, but when combined with the PC850 all hell breaks loose. Remove, re-install, and update to the latest drivers...but to no avail.

This rendered the product useless for me since I purchased it for making Skype calls (there is a big \\"Skype certified\\" logo on the box). I also think it's quite complicated to use. Although I got it to work by following the instructions step-by-step I think it's too easy to make a mistake in the sequence of \\"click here, then press the button on the headset for a specific amount of time, then press it again after the unit beeps, then click that button in the Bluetooth window, ...\\" etc. that one is supposed to go through before the device is ready to use.

But this one is by far one of the better compilations of those precious tunes once heard on FM stations in the 80's and elevators in office buildings. The remake of \\"After the Love is Gone,\\" the Earth, Wind, & Fire tune gets me crying everytime I hear it. The remake of \\"Never Knew Love Like This Before,\\" the Stephanie Mills song, made me pull off the road because the tears were filling my eyes while trying to drive. \\"She's Out of My Life\\" got me crying so loud, my wife asked me what was wrong. I pointed to the stereo. She began to listen, and burst into tears, too. \\"Woman,\\" is a very lush version of the song that brought back memories of me strolling the beach in the 80's with Avalon, NJ's former easy music station playing.

Jenkins and Tony R. Landis have produced the best volume I've ever seen on the history of the X-15. A fantastic collection of information on all aspects of the research program including hundreds of color and black-and-white photographs, many of which I'd never seen before.Dennis R. Jenkins has been doing a terrific job with his book on the development of The National Space Transportation System, SPACE SHUTTLE. HYPERSONIC is a must have for every space library. I can't wait to get a copy of X-15 PHOTO DIARY by the same authors, a collection of several hundred photos that didn't fit in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outta Sight!!","review":"I admit it- if it was built by North American, I'll usually like it.But Jenkins and Landis have scored big with this book.The X-15 was the most sucessful X-plane. but so much was unknown about what it did in it's 199 flights, and the fact is-it's successes were not yelled from the top of the N.A.A. plant at Los Angeles!Everyone who loved that aircraft felt that there was a void until recently. The Apogee book and this one especially, tell the story about how we pursued entry into space with wings. \\"Hypersonic\\" is the book that future Historians will be using to learn about the fantastic feats that the X-15 accomplished. This volume and the follow up scrapbook are long overdue homage to those first early days of manned spaceflight!This is THE must read book about the X-15!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Story","review":"Today when the space shuttle is about the only advanced thing going, it is hard to imagine what was really going on almost fifty years ago. Then a remarkable airplane was built in a very short time and flew 199 times to set records that still stand.Funded by the Navy, Air Force and NASA, three X-15's were built. They carried pilots high enough to earn them astronauts wings and to set one speed record after another.Here in almost 300 pages is the complete story of the X-15 that starts with the conceptual blueprints of the four bidders (Bell, of the X-1 fame; Douglas, of the SkyRocket, Stiletto); Republic; and of course North American, the winner of the competition. It goes from there through each flight until the last in 1968. There are over 500 photographs of everything from the people, every detail of the plane, and of course of the flights.This is the definitive story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is possibly the best book ever written about a research airplane. Perhaps best of all, it has forewords written by two X-15 pilots. The book covers the events leading up to the NACA deciding to build the airplane, the process that the military went through to fund it and the evolution of the configuration. The book takes the program all the way through finding the lakebeds that served as emergency landings sites and the development ifh the radar stations that tracked the X-15. The book contains hundreds of absolutely stunning photographs that I have never seen before and excellent color profiles of both the X-15 and the NB-52 carrier aircraft.

I've updated my kit with Torx bits, just for fun.The 99MP is discontinued. If you can buy one here, do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional Nostalgia","review":"As a kid in the 60's and 70's my Dad got me involved in electronics - especially taking things apart. He would let me work at his bench and use his tools. My favorite tools were the Series 99 Xcelite rollup. I used to find things to take apart just so I could use this kit. Well I'm ramping up my electronics hobby again and this is one of the first things I thought to buy for my small shop.The kit has a good array of nut drivers, allen wrenches and torx wrenches. I believe the kit is made in the USA. The feel of the tools are quality though the roll is plastic and I think my Dad had canvas. There are parts my Dad had that are currently an option. The short handle and stubby bits are an additional cost and they are NOT made in the USA. Looking at the reviews, I'll probably avoid that kit. I use the extra space to store my Leatherman and its accessories.Nice kit.

You can look at his illustrations and see your youth, a simpler time in America and what is both good and bad about life. Simple actions are depicted, such as going to the dentist or doctor, a day in school, playing with friends, politics at the grassroots, basic American liberties and how the formerly deprived were granted what many others refused to give.My favorite in this collection is on pages 74-75, where a young black girl dressed in a pretty white dress and carrying her school supplies is being escorted by a group of deputy U. S. Marshalls. It was a difficult time in the life of the country, but it was something that had to be done and has led to so many wonderful improvements in the lives of people of all ethnic backgrounds.

Unfortunately, following this thinking, Stoner may be a major culprit. He simply accepts standard uniformitarian thinking as fact. His treatment of dating methods appears to show a complete misunderstanding of them. He says, for instance, that the circular reasoning of using fossils is obviated by the fact that fossils are used for dating only when they first have been shown to agree with isotopic dates. First of all, index fossils, and the concepts behind using them, were used for over a century before isotopic dating even existed. Second, one of the major ways that dating results are evaluated for presumed reliability is their agreement with relative dating based on index fossils. Consequently, the circular reasoning still stands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality and size","review":"I bought this for my 4.5 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It's 1/2 size scale is just perfect for her. It's a real electric guitar with a single humbucker and volume knob. Comes with D'Addario installed strings and just needed to be tuned upon arrival. It also comes with a very cute custom Daisy Rock light purple/lavender guitar gig bag with a front zipper pocket for accessories. The only thing it didn't come with was a cable, so be prepared to order one. The color is gorgeous (shimmery purple) and the quality is outstanding for the price. I can't believe Amazon is able to sell it so cheaply, and seriously people, if you're considering buying one, you should get it while the price is low. I couldn't find one for under $120 anywhere else. It's not a $249 dollar guitar by any means and if I had paid the retail price for it, I would've been irritated, however, for this price, it's well worth the money.

It is amazing that the Links franchise could go from one of the greatest golf games of all times in Links 2001(PC) to what is the worst golf game since the days of the regular NES system. There is no control on this game whatsoever, chipping is a joke, and the putting is the worst system I have ever seen. You are in no control of what goes on. The player simply hits buttons and hopes for the best on this game. It's so depressing, the mighty Links franchise has fallen and fallen hard. Trust a real golfer folks, if you want realism, get Tiger Woods 2004 for any system. Even if you are given this game, return it immediately, your health will appreciate it.

I prefer the sim approach as opposed to Tigers more arcade style although I think both are great games. I really like the graphics in Links as well as the sound effects and music. Links also has online play which is fun but I have actually spent most of my time building up the stats of my created guy. You can also download several courses over Xbox live although I have yet to do that so I can't say if they are worth it or not.

It's really small ( see description) and it has a little clip so it can be attached to whatever you have on you.Having two earphone outputs will be helpful on a long flight or anywere if you want to share your music.

However I was compelled to purchase this because it is an accoustic performance. This is truly Foo Fighters at their best. It says a lot when a band can morph from their metal performance to a more mellow performance without skipping a beat. Dave Grohl as usual demonstrates his guitar skills as well as great vocal ranges. Taylor Hawkins is showcased in \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" and he gives a fantastic vocal performance. \\"Hero\\" is one of my favorites as it takes on a hauntingly smooth tone.If I could have changed anything it may have been the selection of songs on the CD. Before long I will have my collection completed. This will be a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, bad language","review":"I bought this as a gift for my 16 yr. old who enjoys the Foo Fighters, but regretted it when I saw even the 1st 10 minutes of the disk.

A good collection of the foo fighter songs spanning thier entire career reworked and placed on this cd for your listening pleasure. I was not real thrilled with in your honor, but this makes up a bit for that, due to the quality of the older work placed on here to make up for the newer material.

The controls are clunky. Instead of moving the character and using the targeting reticle secondarily, the character follows the targeting reticle at all times. Often you end up pointing straight up to the sky or straight down to the ground during the heat of battle.2. It's difficult to control your army. You cannot control portions of your army to attack different things. A positive example would be Pikmin. BW allows you to either control one character at a time or all characters of a particular type, but nothing in between.3. Making war seem cute and kid friendly, plus pitting grossly stereotypical countries (US, Russia, East Asia, and Eastern Europe) in diametric opposition to each other seems less than educational for my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game don\`t give in to the enemy","review":"This game is great the levels are some times hard but don\`t give up a good stratigy will get you far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful....","review":"Just tried to get through this, are the other reviewers reading the same book?

Fisk had an interesting life as a journalist in the Middle East; unfortunately, he is woefully inadequate at telling the story. First, regardless of the title, this is not a history but rather a rambling memoir that is hopelessly chaotic in structure. Fisk would have benefitted greatly from a heavy editing to cut the length down to 400 pages or there about. Second, Fisk clearly dislikes ALL government leaders from all countries and is unrelenting in his criticisms and second-guessing of policies and actions. For those who enjoy basing the USA you will find Fisk a kindred soul, as he reserves his strongest venom for the USA. These criticisms would be interesting if he presented viable alternative solutions. He does not. He castigates everyone except for his favorite hero, himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most engaging book on recent Middle East and North African histroy","review":"This book is one of the best accounts of the conflicts that have scarred North Africa and the Middle East over the past 30 years. As he travels around this small section of the world, Robert Fisk writes clearly and engagingly about the events that took place. Cleverly interwoven into the book are stories of his own family and historical events, such as the Armenian genocide and its influence upon international politics today.At times the detailed descriptions of the violence, destruction and carnage wrought on millions of peoples lives becomes almost too much, even for the most hardened of reader. While the reader can become desensitized to it by the end, it is worth remembering that this book is not science fiction, but reports of actual occurrences.If you want a very good background on the recent history of the Middle East, then this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Armageddon Preview","review":"Probably the most neutral analysis by a Westerner regarding the problems of Middle East and between the Mid East and the West and how history is repeating itself. Its not only history but also the philosophy of it.Fisk's eye witness accounts in the Afghan Jihad, the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf war (and the list goes on and on) adds value to the content as it does not only deal with Macro issues but also the micro ones i.e. ordinary men, women & children bieng affected by such regional developments. His ability to connect the recent past's or present events of the Middle East with those of US and EU in the 19th and early part of 20th century, and the insight into the possible outcomes in the region as a result of the West's hypocritical as well as an imperialist attitude towards it; may make this book a Must have for years to come. For no other book at present deals with so much detail about the great war or WW-4 (as per the neo-cons claim that the Cold War was WW-3)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must-read. Fisk's experiences are amazing...","review":"This is a must-read. Fisk's experiences are amazing and it's a roller-coaster through the messy hell that is the middle east. I'm familiar with much of the history, but his personal life seams it all together rather impressively. He's put his life on the line (on both sides of the line) for the truth. He's a great writer and an inspiring journalist. I'm glad he didn't follow a time line and that he's willing to occasionally lash out at leaders who are blindly revered. Our (US & UK) leaders' foreign policies are adopted from previous administrations with little thought or foresight. If you're interested in the Middle East, you need to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read!","review":"A very informative book! A must read for anyone interested in the history of this important region. Some reviewers would have us believe that historical facts are biased, they exist independent of politics. To anyone who is serious about reading factual and a trully objective analysis of the how and why the middle east is as it is should buy and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply excellent, and badly needed.","review":"Fisk is, I freely admit, someone I consider a bit of a hero, a rare modern journalist who is honest and attentive and cognizant of history. His well-written and well-researched tome provides incredibly important and relevant (and timely) context for what has been and will continue to occur in this troubled region. Fisk pulls no punches about the culpability of a lot of people and governments, including western and Israeli ones (refreshing.) This is, in my view, one of the most important books on the Middle East in a very long time. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Journalist","review":"Robert Fisk is a remarkable journalist.

He show how ignorant people of developed countries can be (to make a monument in Vincennes, indiana, USA, to USS Vincennes, which blowed up a civil plane, killing 290 people, is terrible!), and how dishonest governments like Reagan's and Thatcher's were. Please, divulge this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another British anti-Semite (but he writes well!)","review":"An interesting book with as much BS as timely observations and personal anecdotes. But spend a little time comparing actual history with his descriptions of events and you realize he's another in a long line of inglorious ideologues who are willing to twist the facts to justify their visceral hatred of Jews and Israel. (Well, probably not INDIVIDUAL Jews; as long as they're willing to be history's traditional victims, Bob will write mournful paragraphs descrying their fate.) A book that proves that really good propaganda and anti-Semitism needs to be well-crafted to be effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reporting distorted by hatred of U.S. and Israel","review":"Robert Fisk has thrown himself with passion into the task of reporting from the Middle East, often exposing himself to great danger, and he has done this for decades. He is an articulate speaker and writes well. He presents the POTENTIAL for great reporting given his commitment and skill, but ultimately Fisks work is undermined by his strong anti- American anti- Israel opinions. Even a cursory examination of this book bears that out. Once again he appears much, much more as a propagandist rather than a reporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling stuff","review":"This is a book that I suspect few will enjoy but even fewer will forget. Fisk has that amazing ability to have the reader there with him experiencing what he is experiencing within a paragraph or two. Speaking fluent Arabic, being a long time resident of the Middle East and having many personal friends within the indigenous populations, Mr Fisk tells it as it is - stripped of sanitising euphemisms. Being a foreign correspondent this book reflects his firsthand experience of events and his personal research on the ground - no dry and dispassionate academic tome this one. The end result is riveting, disgusting, compelling, confronting, embarrassing, profoundly saddening, and essential reading for anyone hoping to understand recent world events and likely future developments. Approach it with an open mind and I guarantee you'll view the utterances of our politicians and opinion makers in a very different light.E D Pritchard"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Production Job","review":"This is no doubt an important book by a respected expert in the subject matter. The problem is that the book is poorly manufactured and, therefore, extremely difficult to read. It runs to 1136 pages in only one volume. It weighs 3.4 pounds. To get it all in one volume, the publisher chose an extremely small type face, 10 or 11 point at most. The copy I received had two damaged pages which is not surprising since the binding is too flimsy to withstand the stresses of handling such a lengthy tome.

The author has so many typos and blatant grammatical errors that he can't even hope to be taken seriously. This is the most poorly written and thrown together publication that I have ever seen. I hope he is better at being a veteran firefighter than he is a writer. His department should have set an 8th grade education level as a minimum requirement for employment.

I like that it has a few different steps, picking the cards (number of moves), turning the carrot and moving your bunnies up the hill. The kids liked when the bunnies fell in the holes, which occurs when you turn the carrot and it opens a hole in the \\"mountain\\"...it never got old! You can easily change the rules a bit, and make the game go faster or slower by changing the number of bunnies each player has. I think by time a child is 6 or 7, they might tire of this quickly, but for the three and four year olds that we had playing, they didn't get bored for a long time, and have asked to play on several occasions. This is also reasonably priced, a good choice for the preschool set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting to a 6/7 year olds","review":"This game has all the bells and whistles that are perfect for 6 & 7-year-olds: bunnies, carrots and hot pursuit to the top of the bunny hill!Unfortunately, the \\"holes\\" are pretty predictable, and anyone can easily figure out how to avoid them. We played and played the game and not a single person's bunny was lost.

Usually they prefer to play electronic games but my wife and I make them play board games regularly as well. Funny Bunny was easy for them to figure out, they can play together without an adult to ref. (unlike Monopoly) and they actually seem to have fun doing it.

My 5-year old and 3-year old love to play this together and laugh hysterically when a bunny falls through the hole. The game is extremely well-made, which seems to be the case for all Ravensburger toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but needs more cards","review":"My 3.5yo son really likes this game and understood the directions pretty quickly. As an adult familiar with board games, it's actually a bit confusing at first to not count EVERY space when you move your piece (if a bunny is on a circle, you don't count that space when you move). It makes sense in the course of the game as there's no way two bunnies can share a circle, but I can see it possibly confusing kids if they're playing other games where you don't skip spaces. That said, the game is fun, though it can get VERY long if all your bunnies keep falling through the holes. Also, you need more cards. In a short game you need to shuffle at least 2-3 times. No, it's not a big deal, but how hard would it have been to include more cards? I like another reviewer's suggestion of using your own die with nail polish markings for the CLICK card."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mama...bunny game again please?\\"","review":"My daughter is under the recommended age level for this game at 2 years old, but she loves it. I've really grown fond of the Ravnsburger game line. They are fun, but a lot more educational than a lot of games on the market. This game you can use to teach counting and colors while having fun together as a family. It is simple, but very fun to play. My two older daughters are 9 and 11, and while this game doesn't hold the same educational and entertainment value for them, they still have fun playing with the younger one and in general as a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Action","review":"Funny Bunny is a durable fun game for children ages 5-10. I played this game with my 3,5,6 year old grandchildren. The object of the game is to be the first to reach the carrot at the top of the hill. Each player picks a card to move the playing piece a designated number of spaces. The bunny pieces land on \\"holes\\" which may collapse if the carrot is turned (indicated by a card). The bunny that reaches the top of the carrot first....wins! There really isn't any skill or memory involved,just luck. But there is plenty of action to delight the younger children. The directions indicate that a ten year old would enjoy the game. I don't know about that; it certainly was action-packed for the younger age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but limited","review":"There really is no strategy to this game, and once you figure out where the hole is going to appear in the next spin (which my 5 year old can do) it is purely a question of luch who gets to the top first.... Nonetheless, my 5 year old adores it and hasn't bored of it yet... Great box and materials.. it's designed to last, unlike many games.ECL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This game did not hold my child's attention at all. In short, the game has a trail-like path winding around a mound of earth. Along the trail are several trap door-like spaces. When a card is drawn, it directs the child to activate the mound, which in turn causes one of the trap doors to fall open. If your figure is on the door and it opens, you lose.Unfortunately, the game is way too simplistic, even for a young child. After about 5 minutes of play, my child was over it. Cute concept, but it needs a lot more functionality/features to be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"O","review":"I love this knife, it's much better than my Henckels, which it replaces.

I'm a huge fan of the Damascus steel look and the fact that I can get that in a bread knife is awesome.The only thing that surprised me was that this thing is SHARP! Maybe it's just me, but I've always had really cheap bread knifes and they were never that sharp; you know what I mean... the kind that you can (kids...don't try this at home or anywhere else...) hold the blade in your hand and not get cut. With this one, I'm positive the out come will be poor if I tried the same foolish thing.Bottom line, I'm extremely happy to add this one to the rest of my Calphalon Katana set.

However, if you are a person who likes to understand what you hearing, this isn't the CD for you.

This is mostly due to the numerous editing errors, omissions of Figure and Listing numbers, inaccuracy of a few of the Chapter test answers, and the occasional errant typed value and/or expression name in sample code listings. The most annoying of these problems was that the implementation of proper sentence structure (plain English) was incorrect, making the logic of the text hard to follow. Combine this with the annoying little habit of not separating sentences with spaces, and you've got a big headache trying to digest this information. Altogether, this made the reading and understanding of many of the topics slow going. I managed to finish the text with moderate comprehension in about a week (8 days). I would recommend this book, but I caution potential users to pay close attention, in order to ascertain the author's true meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, horrible CD","review":"The book was a invaluable source for helping me pass the exam.

I'm a regular observer of the Filemaker forums online and can understand why they are so popular.I agree with the first reviewer that the book should not simply target beginners, as Filemaker is simple enough already to waste time on intuitive tasks.This for the true bibliophile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive","review":"I have usually found the \\"Bible\\" books to be fairly complete to allow for progression from Novice to Advanced user.

This book is not for the serious developer...it does not cover any real-world situations and rarely goes \\"beyond the user manual.\\" It sticks right close the user manual, in fact. It doesn't cover important areas like integrating/using FileMaker plugins, barely nrushes on ODBC connectivity and has no useful info on GUI development.

It never goes beyond filemaker pro, the basics. The basics are also in the Filemaker Pro manual, which comes with the software at NO additional cost. Actual intermediate and advanced techniques with scripts and calculations are never covered.As someone who has spent way too much money on Filemaker Pro books at this point, the money on this book, and most of the others has been a big waste.Apparently Scriptology, Filemaker Pro Demysitfied by Matt Petrowsky and John Osborne, is the ONLY Filemaker Pro book available that covers actual Filemaker Pro techniques, calculations, and scripts. The Filemaker Pro Bible just doesn't do that.Filemaker can be very powerful, but from the bible, you would never know.Read the manual, buy Scriptology, and check out the filemaker newsgroup.

Roseph the King Broseph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poorly executed","review":"The thing that jumps out at me, as a fan of chamber music as well as rock, is that the solo performances are terrible. The musicians playing the vocal lines almost always play them as if they were just sleeping through the recording sessions. There is none of the emotion and dynamic constrast that make Maynard's singing so powerful. Combine that with the fact that they're often completely out of time with the rest of the ensemble, and it just takes away so much from the recording that I can't get past it. There is potential in the arrangements, and if they were played by real musicians with a decent ensemble and some orchestral percussion added, they could be very worthwhile. The arranger is obviously a big Tool fan, but it sounds like the performers never took the time to listen to the real thing. As it is, this is not worth the money, unless you absolutely must have anything and everything that has to do with Tool, whether it is good or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool on strings poorly arranged","review":"I am a huge fan of Tool, a huge fan of Classical music, and a huge fan of string based classical music. This CD was a HUGE dissappointment. The arrangement was very poorly thought out. If you are trying to get your partents interested in Tool, it may be OK at best. Aenima was an incredible piece. The rest lacked the classical arrangement that I would have expected from the band. This CD had so much more potential. It really lacked the depth and complexity that the band delivers. Even the limitations within a string arrangement could have portrayed Tools power, depth and layering better than this CD did."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this really tool?","review":"2.5 STARSim an avid tool fan, and a fan of maynards various projects like apc and puscifer, so i know that his music is hard to live up to. this just didnt cut the mustard. the songs ar alright on their own but you can barely tell that its tool, i was expecting more along the lines of apocalyptica's tributes to metallica. they remain heavy but still keep the string sound. i recommend that over this any day.all in all if you're a classical fan, this might help you get into tool, but not vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"i gave this one star simply because the songs are tool songs.I am a huge tool fan and also a fan string arrangements.neither the the strings or the songs written by toolare done justice by this album.you want mellow tool? get some of the remixes or go buy a perfect circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do Tool justice","review":"Maynard and the boys put a whole lot more work into layering their compositions than this dinky string quartet did.

They're TOOL songs, yes, but they lack the soul, the passion of a TOOL performance. It seems over-calculated, paying attention to the notes, rather than the feel of the song. In many parts, they try to replicate the vocal line, but miss or change a few notes, making an awkward sound for those who know the songs by heart. Also, there is little/no precussion, which gives you a boneless, hollow sound. If anyone else decides to try to adapt TOOL's music for string they should have at least one precussion insturument, and I suggest they listen to the music a few times before they pick up their bows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical Copag quality","review":"Nice looking but too thin and flimsy.

I hope your heart can take it.Heavily annotated by Poppy Cannon (of which Alice B. Toklas did not approve) with even funnier references as to how to behave around men, at cocktail parties and how to treat the hired help it becomes more politically incorrect as the years pass but this is all part of its charm.

My wife and I played it for nearly two hours last night. The game is full of great graphics and super sight gags. It would be a game that you wouldn't be affaird to let your kids play alone. It has a very comic book feel to the graphics and story line. The action is non-stop and the game moves really quickly. The very best part is that you don't have to be a mast video game player to get the maxium amount of enjoyment out of it. I'm not one who is extremely awesome at games, but I do really well at this one. The only draw back to it is having to use the right thumb stick to attack with.

Besides the fact that Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a copy, the game itself sucks! The controls, the story, EVERYTHING!

However, this book fails to help newbies whether they be interested in the sport or just the discipline of fencing to enter the exciting world of mind, body, and spirit conjured by it.

Nick gives a fencer the tools to evaluate the effectiveness of an action. Want to know why an action you used was effective? If your answer is \\"because I got a touch\\", you will have great difficulty bouting with fencers more skilled than yourself.Great information on composing attacks and developing timing, distance, speed and more.

It would seem around 3 years ago, plus or minus some time, they had built up their reputation enough and it was time to sacrifice quality for PROFITS! All good companies go through this cycle.I emailed customer service last year and told them I had holes in the toes of about 6 pairs of socks. They sent me 12 new pairs. Pretty nice. I sent the old pairs in for analysis by their company. Almost all the pairs I was give failed and produced holes by the big toe in less than 6 months. I threw some away already.

It however did not cover some of the most important areas, plotting and printing for example.

No clues as to how to set margins, no driver file info, not even mention of fences or views, I've found out a lot only by experimentation with no help from this book.

However, \\"Switched on Bach\\" is one of my least favorite. If this is all you've heard, you're missing out -- this is a dull, mechanical and rote performance in my opinion. Please look for Hans Wurman's \\"The Moog Strikes Bach\\" or his \\"Chopin A La Moog\\" for something a lot better. This sounds to me like a cheap soundblaster card and a computer-generated MIDI file... despite the long hours it took to get it right and the historical value of the recording, the MUSICAL value is just not really there -- sounds like it was played by a robot. 4 stars for being what it is, though -- the LP that kicked it all off.

Most computers sold today do not come with a standard gameport anymore, but you can get an adapter, or some video cards come with them, and you can buy a PCI card that has just the gameport. It stood up well, overall. I used it for about three years, and in the last year the base of the joystick became very loose, but it still held up with most games as long as I kept it callebrated. All of the buttons worked well, and the throttle. If you have a gameport, and need a stand-by joystick, this will work.

The orchestration is over-wrought--too much doubling, too much percussion.The second selection is a sophomoric pastiche of various incongruous famous themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design, doomed by poor electronics assembly","review":"Pros: Classy, understated appearance. Low profile. Very accurate when it works right.It worked great for perhaps 2 weeks, then occasionally would get stuck in a mode where it added about 30 pounds. New battery made no difference. After a few months, it failed completely.I did not keep the packaging or receipts (will next time), so I had to toss it out. But first, being an electrical engineer, I took it apart. The soldering on the circuit board was horrendous, a typical result of cost-cutting outsourcing. This little circuit board would normally be assembled by machine, but was instead was manually soldered by someone with obviously little training and/or care (who was likely being paid next to nothing).To see the classy product of talented designers doomed by clueless cost-cutting is all too common."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design... but that's it.","review":"I purchased this scale and it worked great and was very accurate. It also looked fabulous! Then about 6 weeks after purchase it started weighing about 30 lbs extra. We replaced the battery but that didn't help. It had been over 30 days so Amazon wouldn't let me return it. I found the Soehnle website and they let me return it and sent a replacement since it was under warranty. Of course, I had to pay to ship it to them. Well the new one worked for about 6 months then it started doing the same thing as before, weighing about 30 lbs too much. If I keep returning the scale to the Soehnle people I can get a replacement as long as the warranty is in place but when you have to pay $10-$12 each time you ship it, it gets to be a very expensive scale. We decided to just cut our losses and find another one. Don't waste your money on this scale. I gave it one star because it is a very nice looking scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight. We returned it to Amazon, probably the first time we've ever had to do that. For the price it should at least work. Also, in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner. It earns two stars for looking great. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All looks, no functionality","review":"Owned scale for a total of about 6 months.

It goes will in my bathroom and is relatively unobtrusive and easy on the eyes. As far as decorations go, not terrible.The scale itself is not very accurate. I weigh myself 10 minutes apart with no changes and my weight changes by 2-3 pounds. This is not a big deal in and of itself, but I wish there was a bit more precision in a DIGITAL scale.Additionally, I have found that when two people of similar but different (10-15 pound difference) weigh themselves one after the other, the scale registers the same value for both. I feel like there is some sort of artificial \\"memory\\" built in which is troubling.Overall, I am somewhat unhappy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fine looking scale, but not so good for weighing things","review":"My experience echoes several others here.This is a beautiful piece of design that looks terrific in our bathroom. Unfortunately, I also wanted to use it to find out how much I weigh. It worked for about two months, and then started reading low battery and randomly flipping between lbs, kg, and st. Then it stopped working altogether. I changed the battery (which the manual says should last for many years) but that didn't fix it.I sent it back (it does have a nice 5 year warranty). The new one worked for six months, then started reading low battery and working intermittently. Should I throw good money after bad buying a new battery or sending it back again? I don't think so.I'll go back to my ugly old mechanical scale, which I'll hide in the bathroom closet.I rather doubt I'll ever buy another Soehnle scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I have had this scale for a few years, but like other people here, I have discovered that it doesn't last. Replacing the battery made no difference. It's past the warranty period, so that's not an option. The Soehnle people say that they don't repair. I hate the throw away society we've become, but it's a useless item now. I can't do anything else but toss it. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great. Thats it.","review":"Great looking scale, very low profile, gets compliments. owned for less then a year and then it just went haywire one day. Soehnle will replace it but it will cost you shipping. No its wasn't the batteries. From what I could figure out, one of the four pressure sensors went bad and that caused the whole thing to malfunction. what a let down.

The Lady Onogaro, in order to endure her lover's visits, hires the services of a storyteller to whisper erotic stories in her ear while she makes love to the general. The larger story is also interesting, and told in a beautifully translated language. Lady Onogaro's discovery of what is important transcends time and culture.Much of the poetry of the Lady Onogaro is also included (more presents), contributing to the pleasure of reading.

One point that the reader from New England misses when she states, \\"this book survives as a piece of literature resurrected from the past\\" is that the author has cleverly invented a story under the guise of translating an actual artifact. Successfully, apparently.

The author knows her Japanese mythology. Subtle allusions to ancient tales enhance the narrative. While some of the erotic tales are full of frustration and cruelty, most of them are funny and tender. The fantasies are woman-centered, celebrating women's sexuality in loving detail. A few imagine women's revenge for ill-treatment. And, if you follow the thread of Onogoro's own life between the fantasies, you find the story of so many 20th-century women, trying to let their hearts and talents shine in a world not made for them. Onogoro succeeds. This is a fable of feminine strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"love them","review":"I love skechers, and these are wonderful for winter and look great.

But I agree with the previous reviewer that the straps are just a few inches too short. At 22 inches, I find I can't pick the bag up with one hand and slide it onto that same shoulder, as I can do with other tote bags I own... which is annoying when my other hand is already holding something else (most typically, a violin case). Basically, the length of my arm from my elbow to the groove between my thumb and index number (where the handle sits when I pick up the bag) is longer than the 22 inches provided, so my elbow bangs into the side of the bag instead of sliding through it. I don't want to return the bag, but I confess I've been trying to think of some way to alter these handles to make them just a few inches longer without destroying the look or integrity of the bag.

He realized too late that the holster grips the closed clamshell phone so tightly that it is difficult to get the phone out. The design is very poor, and doesn't allow you to open the phone clamshell while in the holster, therefore rendering this useless if you wish to answer any phone calls (and opening the clamshell is necessary to use the phone). But you cannot open the phone without freeing it of the holster, and this is done with some difficulty and frustration. A truly stupid product, with absolutely no forethought into its applied practical use. Don't waste your money, unless you are sky-diving and want something that definitely won't let go of your phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but clasp isn't as described","review":"The bracelet is lovely.

Ninety percent of the book is what is being thought in Connor's head about Winona, and in Winona's head about Connor.

The cleaing system was its downfall for me though. The cleaing solution ate away at the finish on the top of the shaver. This was only about two months after I had the shaver. I sent it back to Remington, and they sent me a new one, that one only lasted about two months too, before the finish got all bad again. This time they didn't have any more of the R-1000, so they sent m a lesser one, but with two sets of replacement blades to make up the diffrence. The real downfall with this is they just relied on the shaver to air dry, unlike the Braun I had before which had a fan to get it dry. The solution just sat on the razor and ate away at the finish. The one thing I can say is that the customer service at Remington is excellent, but the shaver is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend to a friend","review":"Owned the Remington system for 6 months and although the shave was fairly good (hence the two stars), the razor itself fell apart. The paint on the plastic does chip away, which doesn't sound like a big deal but you end up with small flecks of paint on your skin that are hard to get off. The cleaning system was quick and easy to keep up, but I don't think it is the best on the market. I ended up opening my wallet to purchase the Braun Pulsonic system and I am not looking back.

Think back to bands like PESTILENCE, OBITUARY, GRAVE, ENTOMBED, and others. They were extreme, catchy, and fun to listen to and had actual songs! Bands like DEEDS OF FLESH are just boring, end of story. What's the point of \\"brutal\\" death metal? This style is cold, dull, and just plain boring. There's like 500000 billion CD's like this and they are all the same. Just buy SUFFOCATION's \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\"(still the only \\"brutal\\" death metal album that matters) and forget about 99% of this garbage being released today.

I agree with previous reviewers who mention that the color is closer to olive drab than the dark khaki I see on my monitor, but the high quality and relatively low price of these pants still earn them 5 stars.

The right front pocket has a leather protector for those that carry a knife. They look good on a 6'3\\" 195 frame, other cargos haven't been so friendly.

They ride high on the waist too, so keep that in mind if you only like the awful hipster hip hugging style that Levi's has unfortunately adopted because these fit like real pants should. 2) They seem to run a little long in the leg so plan on wearing thick soled boots to keep the cuffs off of the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"veeeery noice!","review":"Yet another great Amazon pick up from a US shipper.Have become quite discouraged with Aussie online shopping as of late, nothing but disappointment. :(However, these are an absolute gem!

In Persian, the majority of words rhyme, either intheir dominant vowels or their endings, because of the way the language isconstructed.

Using a number of parables and metaphors, the author uses the voyage as a process of self discovery. In the voyage, many birds fall by the wayside, while their leader questions them why they are giving up; these questions are the same questions, in theory, everyone should be asking themselves.The translation is very good, though sometimes I questioned the fidelity of it, since it was rhymed in Persian and the author made it rhyme in English as well.As a comparison, Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist has some similar lessons (such as seeking oneself), but Farid's work is much more subtle and interesting from the point of view of allegories and symbolism. Of course, in the end there is a surprise in both, but I will leave it to the reader to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played one DVD before dying","review":"Our Mintek MDP-1810 portable DVD player played one DVD before it died.

I found the same problem on an Audiovox model but the Apex model I looked at was Ok 110-240v.If it is important to you to be able to use the product abroad I would recommend checking each product before you buy (although Amazon does not currently seem to give this info in their technical specs).P.S. the rating is arbitrary, I didn't get further than a quick look at the player - seemed ok although the motor was a bit noisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"portable dvd mintek 1810","review":"this product is good - beautiful sound, sharp pictures. but it will be better if last memory feature can be retained even after unit is turned off.

This Mintek unit has two major problems: first, it does not play most DVDs as a black bar appears across the screen or the picture is misaligned and second, the battery attaches to the back, not the bottom, and it is very easy to break off and ruin the unit.

Not some fake crap that they are using to lure Dave back. He is gone I'm sure for good.The songs are fast paced and resemble their old stuff quite well.I'm not a big fan of political music, but there isn't enough to ruin the album.(Noted towards those comparing Sums to Green Day)I'd give this album an 8 due to that reason, but that shouldn't take away from what you would miss by reading negative imputs."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this cd was pretty disappointing to me. after 3 amazing albums in a row, the departure of guitarist dave clearly left the band in a pretty bad spot because these songs all sound the same. they arent unique and frankly it could possibly be their worst album all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm here to warn you...","review":"I will always love Sum 41.

The title track is definitely misleading, making you think that this Sum 41 going back to the beginning. I also agree with the other reviewers in saying that this CD makes the band sound too similar to Green Day. However, that doesn't stop me from enjoying this album, although forever lost are the hints of metallica and megadeth.

The CD was no fun! It was alot of boring slow songs. Sometimes those are nice if there is something to them... sadly there wasn't. The faster songs they had weren't even that original.

Please don't let me down again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same Old","review":"Ok I don't understand the praise for this album. The songs are actually boring except for The Jester, March Of The Dogs and King of The Contradiction. I consider their last album Chuck to be their finest moment as the songs were more serious and alot heavier in message as well.On this album they seem to have slipped back into the sound from their previous days which I thought was ok. They sound like Green Day and Blink 182 which isnt a good thing as those arent really GREAT Punk Rock bands. The songs are long as well, longer than usual for Sum 41 and the ideas arent really there.I know this seems like a plug to diss this album but really folks its not that great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete retread","review":"This is a pale, insipid version of Green Day's American Idiot (and other Green Day songs).

I ordered 2 pair, because i tend to lose earrings, which is why I don't buy \\"the real thing\\". The settings are really flimsy. The CZ was not well attached in the setting. Of the four earrings received, one CZ had already fallen out before delivery, and one was at an angle. I reset them using tweezers and a magnifying glass.Basically, with this product you get what you pay for. I would recommend going up a notch in price and getting a more solid setting rather than the 4-prong setting in very thin gold that these earrings come with. It gets two stars, because even for a somewhat low price, you are not quite getting what you pay for.

White fully fleshes out his characters and the community in which they live.While the book begins with a murder, and while its investigation runs throughout the book, one would never call this a mystery. It is a well-done character study and an exploration of the feelings and motivations of these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Dr. Stuart Jordan is a great character whom you have sympathy and hope for. The novel is spun off his life as obgyn doctor during the day and moonlighting as a medical examiner. He is completely wrapped up in his work and for good reason. His soon died fourteen years earlier and his wife, a manic depressive, floats in and out of his life. His work provides some stability for Dr. Jordan. In comes Rosa Littlefoot, a woman accused of murder and with an infant daughter... she somehow manages to get Dr. Jordan to look after her daughter while she is incarcerated. Dr. Jordan's surface level stable life (one must remember he is always dealing with the pain and memory of his son's death and the havoc his wife wreaks) is turned upside down... Annabel (the wife) returns, he has an infant to care for and quite a few other obstacles. The book is great because you have so many hopes for Doc, and you wish he would get some backbone!

I decided to purchase another Perquackey game (thank goodness they've re-released it!) and am more than pleased.The instructions are not as aesthetically pleasing (no longer a booklet, but a printed sheet of paper), but everything else is the same. My only small complaint would be that the metal tin the game is in is much larger than it needs to be. I plan on covering the inside with felt so that it doesn't make as much noise when I'm transporting it.This game is great for anyone who wants to improve their vocabulary, or already has a good one--if you can see patterns in words, you'll do amazing. It's kind of like Boggle, but with loose dice and each person takes a separate turn. I'd suggest having a dictionary close by for the hardcore players (such as myself) in order to dispel word disputes on the spot.Buy it and you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Game, Bad Implementation","review":"I played Perquackey as a kid with my parents and loved the game. I purchased this game online for my wife and I and, initially, we had a lot of fun with the game. However, we played the game perhaps a dozen times and the letters were worn the the point of being almost illegible.I do not recommend purchasing Perquackey from this manufacturer.I highly recommend the game and suggest that anyone interested in the game pay the extra for one of the used original games offered on Amazon. Either that, or hit a few antique stores and look for the game used.My wife and I found a used game in outstanding condition, circa 1956, for a little more than we paid for the brand new one from Amazon. The quality of the used game is far superior the new iteration.Seriously, unless you plan on playing the game only 3 or 4 times, save your money. If you are going to play Perquackey regularly, buy a used version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dice scratched!","review":"This game is sooo fun! My husband and I enjoy playing it a lot. But one small problem - after playing about 6 or 7 games some of the dice were so scratched you could hardly read the letters anymore. The image is only on the surface of the dice and scratches off.

The craftsmanship is terrible, and I wrote the company about the faded die two years ago. I stated that I would be willing to pay more for quality. I received no response. Perhaps the vintage games of the '50s and or '70s, both of which I played, are better constructed and made to endure the addiction of the game. I note that Perquackey is often sold out.

It's fast and simple, but you do have to know how to spell! Keep a dictionary handy in case words get challenged! You have a cup filed with dice that have letters on them instead of numbers. Another player turns over the timer and someone writes down the words as you use the dice to spell them. Yu have to arrange the dice and spell the words out loud. You keep re-arranging the dice until you run out of time. Longer words are worth more points. If luck gives you good letters you'll have an easy time of it.

It is low profile enough that the bathroom door would pass right over it in the small bath where we kept the scale; great for tight spaces.However, after about 3 years, one day it just began showing dashes accross the display, or numbers counting down from 170 to 150 or so... not the normal weight indications.The units setting button on the back did not do anything either. A new battery produced no difference....So for a short lived scale, its great. However, as something you can leave in the bath and rely on... this product fails.There must be something in the design that is flawed... a plastic component or similar that will break after some age. There is no other way to explain why an electronic scale would fail from nothing more than age and very occasional use."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks great BUT...","review":"I never usually write reviews but I thought I needed to with this product.Mine broke after only 6-7 months of very light use.

Let me start by saying, the only reason I gave this game 2 stars in the overall rating is because the graphics are great. The game looks really nice, but the controls are absolutely horrible. Miserable in fact. When I sit down to play a racing game, or any other game for that matter, it should not take so much effort to get your car to steer and handle turns, slides, etc. The controls are miserable, and I found the game making me angry. I am selling this game asap and getting something else worth my time. I highly recommend NOT buying this game. A huge waste of time and money. I love XBOX, but give me Super Mario Kart anyday. At least you can control that game without losing your mind, and you can have fun with it. Unlike PGR2. Don't buy it.

All us Gran Turismo 3 drivers used to be mighty confused about being rewarded for sliding through a turn when a well-executed line is faster and more elegant! So now you can slide, or nail the apex, and still get points. (You still get more for sliding though.)It's a great racing game. The physics are good, and the vehicles respond as you'd expect them to. The AI is much better than the GT3 AI.It's easier to unlock new cars, and you pay for them with Kudos tokens, rather than virtual money. You cannot upgrade the cars as you could in GT3, and I will miss that.Playing against others is fun, just mute some of the trash talkers - or beat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"This was a Christmas gift to an Autistic child who really wanted this game for Christmas, but when I order it and had it send to him ( he lives in a different city then I) I found out later that the game did not work.

Hogan is the man, but not right in this Nitro collection. The tape covers Hogan from 94 to early 99. If you like the Hulk then get this, but again, not even close to being a best of Nitro video.

The violinist was not exactly matched up with the audio.

So in I walked out of Borders Bookstore, excited about my new purchase of this seemingly obscure CD, all about reinterpreting Tori Amos' music through some string quartet. I looked at the tracklist, and was pleased at the songs chosen, songs that the quartet eventually butchered and left to die a slow, uninspired, gut-wrenching death. Without Tori Amos' passion and verocity of piano playing and vocals, the re-interpreted songs are ignorable at best, and just plain painful to listen to at worst. 'Caught a Lite Sneeze', in particular, was horribly done. It was monotonous and unnecessarily loud. The rest of the CD, in general, was just as monotonous and it was so repetitive I might as well have been listening to the tick tick of my clock next to my bed. And at least then, I could make up my own melody.It seems as if the only redeeming quality of this CD lay in its gorgeous cover design.Well, that does Not save the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the Ducks Chickens & Other Fowl Things author","review":"If you're looking for something of the same calibur of the force and emotion found in the voice of Tori Amos, this is not it. However, it is worthy in its own right as a wordless interpretation and expression of Tori's lyrics. I also think it speaks volumes about the devotion Tori's words and music evokes in others, that these people would choose her music to adapt.The strings are fabulous, and demonstrate the range and personality that is not found in all musical instruments (as in Precious Things). If you're looking for Tori, this isn't exactly the CD for you. But if you're looking for something inspired, give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool","review":"I really love this album. It shows how amaing Tori's compositions are.

Mediocre string performances which sound dead and uninspiring.The marketeer who named this a \\"tribute\\" knew nothing about what draws people to Tori's music, and was thinking of the definition meaning \\"collecting money\\".I doubt Tori herself would have allowed the release of this if she had any control over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try...","review":"Usually I like what string quartets can do with pop & rock music ie Rachel Barton's rock album and Apocalyptica. This tribute wanted to be good but lacks feeling in all the tracks except for \\"Pretty Good Year\\", which was beautifully done. There are some sonic redeeming qualities, especially the intro to \\"Precious Things\\" but most tracks seem rushed. These artists could have taken more chances with the music. If you're looking for Tori, she's not here. If you don't know Tori's stuff, this is an interesting strings excercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a precious thing...","review":"Being an admirer of Tori Amos, I was anxious what this cd would sound like. Only after a few seconds of some songs I crucified this cd and cried... well, not exactly cried, but I'm very, very disappointed. I can't imagine that Tori was fully aware how her songs were raped blown to pieces. None of the songs are close to the originals, not even bad live tracks. Where Tori keeps impressing me with her beautiful songs, fragile lyrics and where one kan hear the love for music and wonderful poems, this album is a waist of time, money and effort. Now even my cd player refuses to play this album anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad for the money","review":"Bought this for my son's Gamo Youth rifle.

At first it sounds like the man is more in love with love than with Bernadette, his lover. He is also married, not necessarily unhappily either, though his wife is ill and soon (conveniently for the plot) dies. But before that happens, Bernadette becomes pregnant,and the story deepens from that point on. He and Bernadette decide to see each other while his wife is ill, though he continues to care for his wife with much love and tenderness. Bernadette tells him she will wait for him, and she does. Some of this comes across as just a tad too pat and unmessy - too idealistic - but Bragg is an excellent writer, and it's impossible not to find this book interesting: he pulls you right into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Gear: Complete Season 13","review":"My son was thrilled with receiving this series since he watches the show on TV whenever he get a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Gear Series 13","review":"Awesome show about awesome cars mixed in with three funny host.

I believe this was his first film.

Checking (along with all else) rarely results in a turnover making on ice play resemble something closer to PONG rather than hockey. My best advice, go after NHL 2k6 and hook up to the internet or get a AR to download the new roster changes.

The many miss-spellings and rambling verbiage coupled with a seemingly infinite number of hyphenated words (5 to 10 per page) makes reading this work as much fun and pointless as digging random holes in your back yard.My level of expectation for a $0.99 purchase is low.

If you want the whole story, you will need to buy a hardcopy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Beginning, Ultimately Unsatisfying","review":"Right up until the shooting starts, it's a great book. Beyond that point, too many players are using cards they would no longer have. The authors seem to have forgotten that most US cities came to terms with imminent attack long ago, and that at the end of the threatened scenario one side would still be in a position to offer deals that the other would no longer be in a position to refuse. Militarily spot-on, financially iffy. Beyond a certain point, economics does not play a role in policy decisions at a leadership level. A President that ignored that would not remain President very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"e-books editing","review":"This book has all the essentials of a great political thriller. It is totally spoilt however by the appalling editing. In some places the novel is practically un-readable. Amazon should take note of this and demand more professional input from the publishers. The author will rapidly loose sales through this kind of presentation. e-book Format is not a licence for such sloppy material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pictures are pretty good","review":"Been longing for another text that finds an unusual subject, then stretches canonical works of theory to say something about them that seems meaningful till you think about it for 15 seconds? Ever wondered what it would be like to read a book that intersperses the Paris arcades, regurgitated Walter Benjamin, the Crystal Palace, regurgitated Lacan, paperweights, regurgitated Colette's daughter? Here you go. The sheer number of typos suggests the author didn't see fit to do a second draft, or retain the services of a proofreader. The color plates are very pretty, but the book is plain bad, and not in any good (kitschy) way. Stick to Gillo Dorfles for a good book on kitsch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I don't find this book derivative of Benjamin so much as openly drawing on him. Olalquiaga doesn't ape his work on kitsch - she applies it intelligently to her own research. Artificial Kingdom struck a deep chord with me. I concede that it is not the most rigorous examination of the kitsch experience possible, and some chapters are separated by intermissions of glazed ruminations that haunt the analysis and reverberate beneath it with personal conviction. But this is what I appreciate most about the book. You could do worse than recall in your reader Bachelard's reveries on the poetics of space. Olalquiaga's passage describing Rodney's marine home crystallizing around him into a glassy temporal suspension is as beautiful as anything by the sources from which she appears to draw her models."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Milwaukee fan","review":"I can't recall how many times I've exclaimed the virtues of Milwaukee products, suffice to say I definately qualify as a HUGE fan!

Very well built, worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed well built, but...","review":"Had to send this back. The bearing that holds the drill bits in place would not depress and did allow the bits to slide all the way in. As a result only the first quarter of the bit actually fitted into the tool (and so would fall out in actual use)You pay quite a premium for Milwaukee. Too bad they don't test their tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this instead of the cheap ones!","review":"For an extra $20 you can get this right angle adapter instead of the cheap half plastic ones sold for $20 to $30. I'm a DIY'er. I used this to bore holes in studs for electrical wiring with a Bosch 1\\" Daredevil spade bit. This adapter is well made and should last for a long time for a DIYer or a Pro whole uses it occasionally. Unless you are a plumber or an electrician doing \\"new construction\\" and boring holds in studs all day long, this item should last a long time (a Pro would use a real right angle drill). It has a sturdy aluminum housing, real metals gears, real bearings I think.

Definately worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a Right Angle drill for a Fraction of the cost","review":"I had several confined places to drill and didn't want to spend $200.00 plus dollars to buy a right angle drill.

I would recommend this attachment for anyone that needs a right angle drill for occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changes the Way You Work","review":"I do not know how I got this far without this attachment. I do a lot of boat work with cramped spaces and odd angles that make it difficult to place a drill in anywhere near the correct position.

I needed a tool to drive the special screws for the HardiBacker into the sub-floor underneath the \\"toe kick\\" of the kitchen cabinets. I started out using the Milwaukee light duty right angle unit, (since that was the only tool I could find at the local store), but that gave out right in the middle of the job.Thanks to AMAZON, I found the real deal and this unit is completely different! It is well made with ball bearings in the head unit, and has the heft and finish of a real tool. It is also rated at a much higher torque. The funny looking red bar in the photo is a multi-position handle that locks into position and gives you the much needed leverage in tight spaces.You may not use this tool every day, but when you need a right angle driver/drill man, you need this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The handle fell off after a few weeks of light usage.

Plenty of others said how good it was, and it really is, but I'll just say I wish there was some more concept art in here. Especially the characters. I was thinking it was going to show several drafts of each character before the final one was chosen.

I have been a die hard fan since part one was released in 1990. There are several books out that show the visual effects from the Final Fantasy series, but this one is by far the best. It is strait forward, art, from the original designer of FF characters, Yoshitaka Amano. Page for page you will see the steps that he followed making this characters shine.The main reason that I took one star away was because most of the art in this book is finished up designs from Amano. I am a very big fan of his work, ex. Vampire Hunter D, FF1-6,and 9 adn several other Japaneese work. I enjoy his early sketches better, they are much more fantasy like.

The pilot movie of the DvD was full of glitches so numerous to mention. The Dvd pilot episode in short was a transferred film captured on Dvd that includes all the specks, flashes, and lines that one would expect to see on an old 8mm film and not a movie production. Heed the warning of others when they mention about the quality of the DvD pilot episode. On a plus note the tv series episodes were captured with better quality, but not of the quality one would expect on a Dvd. The episode series appear soft looking and lacked a detail crisp image. Fortunately, I have the pilot episode taped on VHS from tv way back in the day and it is of better quality than the one I just purchased. The pilot episode deserved better restoration than what was provided (apparently none was performed at all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles Lover","review":"This is an excellent album.

One that unforetunally is not on here is My Boyfriends Got a Beatle Haircut but you can find that one on other cds so its ok. Also if they look up the Coasters boxset Theres a Riot Going On The Coasters On Atco they can can find Wild One which is about The Beatles and also Allan Shermans boxset My Son The Box theyll find Pop Hates the Beates to the tune of Pop Goes the Weasle which is obviously also about The Beatles. So this album is not everything but its a start and its good. If youre a Beatles fan and you also like novelty songs about them you should get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing document of a reactionary time in the music biz.","review":"This very funny, very strange collection of songs is, of course, best recommended to Beatles obsessives and completists. (Not to mention fans of the Dr. Demento show.) An example of the surreal quality of this compilation: Track 13, entitled \\"John, You Went Too Far This Time,\\" credited to Rainbo, is actually a very young Sissy Spacek!!!

But Moffat also draws from a wide range of influences: the spirit of Ennio Morricone emerges for a showdown at sunset on \\"Rotspots from the Crap Map,\\" while \\"Jim Dodge Dines at the Penguin Café\\" ventures even further into country-western territory. \\"Fan-Dance\\" leaves the continent entirely and becomes a beguiling backdrop for one of Scherazade's stories. \\"Total Horizontal\\" ends the album on a mellow note, reminiscent of the Lemon Jelly track \\"His Majesty King Raam,\\" but with a bucolic flavor all of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"bottle opener","review":"Easy to mount, works great.
