I was also expecting him to be a little taller than the Robin Hood character, but he wasn't. Since Maid Marion is about the same size as the outlaws, I figure the size must be fairly standard for all Papo figures--even though he King seems somewhat taller because of his crown.

Even so, only 3 of the waterers worked, I think because some of the tubes are crimped when they are affixed to the cap -- a defect in design.

Rear derailleur triggers are different than Shimano. I still catch myself up shifting when I want to down shift and vice versa.

Also,his claims of having been the chief instructor for the U.S. Army and for the 2d Infantry Division and 8th Army in the ROK and other areas is not what I remember nor do any of my service compatriots.

If you buy the car kit and one day your unit malfunctions (which is likely), Xact will ask you to return EVERY component of the kit or they will charge you for each replacement item.

We were recently given a Playhut ball pit with some balls and wanted to order extra balls for our son. I knowingly payed 10 dollars extra over another brand on Amazon simply because I figured the Playhut balls we have now are very sturdy so it's better to stick with the same brand. Well, I was wrong. These new balls don't even have the \\"Playhut\\" name stamped on them like the original balls do, they are made of a much thinner plastic and collapse easily. I am so disappointed in the quality, I am debating sending them back and ordering the cheaper balls I saw. I mean....if they are gonna be crappy and thin anyway, might as well pay less right? The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because my son loves the ball pit itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playhut Magic Balls 100 Pack","review":"These are great balls. Seem durable enough.

It indeed can match the performance of Shimano Stradic series, at 1/3 of the price.However, even if it says you can spool 8lb line (20lb braided spiderwire) with 280yards, if you are reeling 10-20lb bass and salman all the time, this reel will break in a few trips, mostly right at the thinner gear. If your forte is crappie and white bass fishing, this is a good reel that can last a couple of seasons.Hope Okuma will double the width of the gear (even just stack current gear twice) to give it more strength. Yes, you may be out for a crappie fishing, but you can't control what ends up at your hook. If you end up fighting a 20lb striper on the run, you can see how a gear bent half-way.

I don't think this is the full version, as I seem to remember the movie to be much longer than 115 minutes, but maybe that is because it was cut up into episodes. If it is not the full version, then that's very dissapointing, because a dvd can hold more than enough information. Anybody know the truth on the length of this movie?

Dalton, one of my all-time favorites despite some appalling role choices, here plays a mysterious criminal who engages in a chilling head game with the young police officer assigned to \\"babysit\\" him while the police interrogate him.

So, I figured I get a Reel Echo, and leave the old \`plex at home. When I first saw the unit, I was impressed that they designed it to resemble the sliding tape head instead of a knob for the length of the delay. Needless to say, it's just not the same. Doesn't have the right feel at all. And you can't get that great feedback loop either. Now I will admit, for the sound on sound function, it's perfect.

The book has large print, lots of whitespace and many repetitions used as filler. Of what little actual content there is, most of it is \\"chatty\\" and lacking substance. The disorganization of this book makes the Perl language structure and syntax seem elegant by comparison.

If, however, you want to actually make the overwhelming majority of the food listed in the menus in each section of the book, this publication quickly disappoints.

There is absolutely no resemblance here to early Swans, for the tunes here are more mellow and acoustic.

Rather, imagine like Johnny Cash with excellent musicians having a psychotic episode.

The camera eats up batteries like no tomorrow, the pictures are grainy, red-eye is a BIG problem, the camera itself is ugly and mildly bulky which makes it a pain to carry around, it has a very slow shutter speed[don't even bother trying to take pictures of anything that moves] and is all-around a terrible camera.This camera is cheaply-priced for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time and money on this product.","review":"This camera was a gift.

Sometimes the pictures just show up as static or with a green or blueish tone. The flash barely works and it really does eat up the batteries. I never ever used the LCD screen because the batteries would die in about 2 minutes. Also, you can't access the main menu without the LCD and the LCD doesn't work when the batteries are low. I would still use this camera because I really would rather not spend money on a 3rd one in 2 years however, the USB cable broke and I haven't been able to find one I can buy seperately.Tip: For young kids, it's an alright buy because they probably won't know the difference.

You can do better with another $50 elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"This camera should be taken off the market. I understand at this price-level you can't expect the quality of a $500 camera but even at $20 this camera would be overpriced. The image quality is very pixalated. I have seen 1 Megapixel cameras that take better pictures than this one. The battery life indicator is always showing batteries that are half drained; even with new batteries. The viewer looks really bad and cannot keep up with any movement. I brought this camera back the next day. I purchased a Kodak 6330 for a few dollars more and am very impressed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Life Worst for this Camera","review":"I bought this Camera thinking HP Quality will be good, but I am totally dissappointed. The pictures taken are not what you see as it takes them after some delay. The Worst part is the Battery will die within 2 minutes. I kept changingg batteries rather and kept missing taking the good shots during my visit to Sea World.My configuration is that I have added 256 Meg SANDISK SD Memory Card to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P Brian Pillman","review":"I saw Pillman wrestle a few months before his dead, too bad I cant remember how the match went. The bio on Pillman was sad. He was a great star turn into a shell of himself after his accident. Also, his matches are short on this set but Pillman puts on a hell of a show in a few short minutes. The matches were great considering they featured early WCW cage matches that ive always wanted to see. A few funny things about the set is the back of the dvd says more then 15 matches, there is 16 in all. Anther is Dustin Runnels is interviewed and the capation says former WWE star Golddust. Well its nice to know that he retired by watching this. Great dvd and a excellent buy. Next up, Roddy Pipper dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look Back At Brian Pillman","review":"Not knowing a lot about the wrestler Brian Pillman, this two-disc set covering his career was not only informative but entertaining.

It dose take a while to figer how to hold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel companion","review":"Don't expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you won't be disappointed. That said, I find it useful for composing on the road. Heck, it even sounds better than my big guitars, in an odd way, for certain songs. Nice sturdy and portable case. Not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags, but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask. Action is adequate for practice--with a little tweaking it's actually good. Quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Ruins a Good Idea","review":"I was excited to receive this little guitar, as I am traveling for one month. Based on its dimensions and price, this seemed like an ideal travel mate to keep in practice. Sadly, after it arrived its defects were immediately clear. The build quality is poor. I may not be Joe Satriani, but I have been around guitars for more than 25 years. This is the poorest quality guitar I have encountered. Frets that buzzed, dead spots, and constant retuning. Given the limitations with the bridge I wouldn't even attempt to perform an intonation on it. For the money you can easily find a small scale acoustic by Yamaha and others, or for a little more spring for a low end Steinberger. Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells awful","review":"It's basically a decent travel guitar. Plays easily, is portable, has decent sound in the treble. No bottom end, but what do you expect. The glue on the neck joint looked a little skimpy - you can see into the joint a bit where there's no glue. Not a big deal though.The guitar had an awful, toxic smell, like some evil solvent from a Chinese factory. Turns out, as others have noticed, the smell was coming from a greasy black goo holding two leather flaps of the straps together. The goo issues fumes that are a cross between shoe polish and gasoline. And it's strong, any time you open the case up, the smell hits you hard. I threw away the strap, hoping the smell would go, but it had permeated into the case. After two years the case still reeks! Unbelievable. I am going to try just leaving in open in my yard for a year to see if that helps.Otherwise, not a bad travel guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered twice 1x Good 2X Not so good","review":"I ordered this guitar and it came wrapped up nicely, but without the strap. I called and they immediately sent a replacement which came in an old box that had been damaged and taped up and still did not have the strap. I know they had a problem in the past with the straps smelling funny. Maybe someone removed them and never put new one's back in. Also, the 2nd guitars woodwork was not nearly as nice as the 1st, and the case was coming apart in the \\"hinge\\" area. It was probably a previous return. Returning everything and going to brick-and-mortar store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar","review":"This guitar have a beautiful sound and size is great for travel. It's a bit heavy though.

It's light, responds well to picken and the full sized neck works well for chords too.For the price here on Amazon, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar for the price and size","review":"This guitar followed me to Canada and then onto a cruise in Alaska. I tried three types of strings on it and actually found that the extra light strings worked very well. The guitar itself is built very well and the case provides much more protection than a gig bag. It fit in every plane I've been on without any problem. It doesn't have the projection as my Takamine or Ovation, but that is not what it is built for. It's built for travel and satisfying a chord-banger's need when you're away from home. The neck is great and its' fullsize allows you to play it without having to reaquaint your fingers to a smaller scale neck. All in all, it's a fun guitar that I don't mind banging around in an airport, a ship, or on the road. Construction is SOLID - well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it if you actually play guitar,","review":"Needed a travel guitar to practice while sitting in hotel rooms on business. I wasn't all that concerned about sound quality. Mainly wanted something that was playable and had a decent neck and string action.Very disapointed. String action was so high I consider this thing completely unplayable. Tried adjusting truss rod and it helped, but still very unplayable.Sound was about what I expected, not going to play a concert with it, but good enough for practice use.Nice case and accessories, and a great idea. But too bad the guitar itself is unusable and unplayable. I'm amazed at the good reviews, so I can only assume that most of these folks are not actual guitar players or have no experiance with anything other than a walmart guitar..Returned and decided to look at other options instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a stinker!!","review":"I play a Godin guitar, and needed a light travel number to use when I'm away. The Washburn Rover seemed the best option, great case, extra stuff and a good build quality. When it arrived i got a shock, the stench from this nightmare hung in my flat days after I took it back. The smell is obnoxious and clings to your hands and clothes, giving them an acrid honk that ruined my enjoyment of this product. The laquers used are obviously not fully cured before it gets packed and this just isn't acceptable in this day and age. The stench is embewed into the case so anything you put in there also gets contaminated. My advice is side step this smelly sub-standard joke, and buy the Ozark 3330, which is a great travel guitar and worth the extra cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Rover, Little Tone","review":"This was an affordable package deal but I wasn't happy with the poor guitar tone.I sent it back and purchased a Samick \\"Greg Bennett\\" ST62 for $139.00.The Samick isn't as small but has much nicer tone and workmanship."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little guitar","review":"For the price, I don't think you can beat this little guy. The action is good, despite a bit of an intonation issue, but the neck is adjustable. The sound quality is about what you'd expect, but the level is perfect for not disturbing your neighbors, in a hotel, etc. Considering the size, portablity, & playability, it's well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good value","review":"Some have commented on the smell of the case, we did find it to be there in ours. The guitar itself is very nice well made and sounds great. The guitar is worth the price so if you don't like the case smell then get something else. The case design is very nice and we hope that in time the smell will go away.

Slight smell but nothing, couldn't care less if it stank to heaven and back.Thanks Washburn, And thanks for your reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sound From a Little Guitar","review":"I normally play an Ovation acoustic and was accustomed to that projected sound afforded by the rounded back. As you can Imagine I was somewhat skeptical when I looked at the ROVER. This guitar has EXCELLENT sound that I absolutely did not expect. I compared this guitar to the martin backpacker(btw, I love Martin Guitars) and not only is the sound better but the action is unbelievable. All for under $200.00. This is a great buy especially at this price. I can't put this guitar down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little awkward... but amazing!!","review":"I got this fantastic little guitar for christmas this past year and have been happily playing it since. The sound is really amazing for such a small guitar. As an out-of-state college student, this guitar is perfect for when I want to have a guitar both at home and at school. It's perfect for airports and overhead storage.The only downside to the guitar is the (here's the kicker) small size. It sounds just like a full sized guitar, but actually playing it can be awkward, but totally doable.Overall, I love this guitar! It holds its tune, sounds amazing (better than some full sized guitars) and is a great buy! Just be prepared for the comments when you bust it out!I'd recommend this guitar for anyone on the go! Enjoy and happy playing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap is Hazardous to your Health","review":"The strap has an industrial glue that has not and will not cure. The result are noxious and dangerous fumes that get in your eyes and lungs. No amount of airing out will change this issue and I was forced to return not one but two guitars to Amazon, as the chemicals permiate the case, guitar and anything else that it comes in contact with.After my complaint Amazon was responsive and even took the product off of their inventory.

The comics are far better than the TV series ever was. The interesting thing about the first ten issues of GI Joe is that, except for the 2-part Oktober Guard intro, they are all single-issue stories, most of which impact very little on the rest of the series.I liked having them in a single volume, but I do not like the fact that the back-up story in issue 1, nor the pin-up extras that were in the original somics, are included in this volume. Would it have hurt them to have put those add-ons in the back? That's why I can only give this volume a 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Shipped fast and just as described.

Being married to a British citizen and living in England doesn't give her carte blanche to make gross generalizations, especially when she's a guest in their country.This, coupled with the generic, haphazard feeling of the recipes makes me suspect she's just cashing in on her minor fame in England as a singer.I'll stick with the great Edna Lewis, a true culinary genious who recognized that food should used to bring people together, and who didn't indulge in making fun of other cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul Food: Classic Cuisine From the Deep South","review":"I don't like this book at all because the recipes are not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"This book was full of food that if you eat on a regular will probable cause heart problems, high blood pressure and high colestoral.

Preparing food in the tradition of those we love and remember is one of the most profound ways to keep their memory alive. Miss Ferguson knows this, and brings us right up close with her Aunt Peacie and other wonderful characters who taught her to love this food and to make it.

Painting them to fade into the wall itself is a great idea and reduces the distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norse Giants","review":"A well-selected, -arranged, -performed, and -recorded CD. I agree with the assessment that Nielsen's Fourth is one of the greatest symphonies of the 20th century (along with several of Mahler's, and Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms). However, the timpani battle in the last movement is far from the only excitement. All four movements shine with the sort of vital energy associated with Beethoven. Also, in its own dissonant way, the small masterpiece Pan and Syrinx partakes of this vitality. I would call this tone poem, along with Roussel's Bacchus and Ariane ballet, the truest and most exciting musical realization of Greek myth. Sibelius's The Dryad also has some of this spirit.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When a bargain is not a bargain","review":"I purchased this set thinking they were the Clover brand bamboo knitting needles which I use all the time. The set seemed like a great value, however when they arrived and I saw it was not the brand I was expecting I took a close look at them because as long as they were quality that wouldn't necessarily matter. Upon inspection I could clearly see that these were inferior needles with very rough joins and cables entirely too thick. The construction is very poor and these are not usable for any kind of serious knitting. I returned them and got a credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap in price and quality","review":"These are way cheaper than buying name brand needles (Addi, KnitPicks, etc.). They're rather dull-pointed, which some people might prefer, but I found hindering. The cables are rather thick, and the joining between the cable and needle is sometimes rough enough to catch my stitches. The packages are not labeled with sizes, so you have to open them all, or turn the needles in the packages to see the label and make sure you grabbed the right ones.If you need several of these needle sizes right now and money is tight, these will work. But if you can, buy just one quality cable needle now and save up for the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken cords","review":"I bought this set and was quite happy to have complete sets in all sizes in this length. However, a few projects have been ruined because the cord broke away from the needle. I guess I'm not experienced enough to figure out how to save a project in the round when this happens, but ultimately, I am not pleased with this product. I cannot recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"It's really nice to have a whole set but these are just not usable, in my opinion. The points are very blunt, the needles made out of very cheap, light wood, and the cables are very flimsy and feel like they will break. I will use them to hold projects on that I'm not currently working on and for that purpose and the cheap price maybe they are worth buying. I thought maybe I could use them to find gauge with in order to save some trips to the yarn store but they are so rough anything I knit with them won't match better quality needles. If you open the package to test them you can't return them. The DPN's are ok but not these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice But Break Often","review":"I don't recommend buying these at all.I bought the 36\\" and 17\\" set of these needles because I was in desperate need for circular needles. These were a great bargain for the amount of needles you get. Turns out the plastic that is attached to the end of the needles cracks and then breaks. I found myself having to cut and use super glue to reattach them after only a few uses. The breaking is highly obnoxious when you have a ton of stitches on the cable and you don't realize it's broken until all the stitches begin to unravel.I'm using a new type the circular needles where the cable is attached with metal. A bit more in price, but guaranteed to last and in the end be worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Win some, lose some","review":"Pros: like the bamboo and the assorted sizes, haven't had a problem with the bamboo breaking or splintering.Cons: Many of my needles have broken at the connection point and they cannot be glued together successfully because they just break again. The first time this happened, I wrote to the company asking for a replacement, which they sent me free of charge. The second time, I asked for another replacement and they sent me a whole other complete set, which I didn't need, but I figured if the needles keep breaking I might as well have extras. Now I'm slowly getting metal indestructible ones to replace the ones that keep breaking. I would suggest going for the ones that don't break because you'll save yourself the frustration.(I don't use very small needles in my knitting so I'm not sure how the little ones hold up.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Fantastic price, great quality!

In my opinion, this recording gives an indication of the reason for that. Here we have a technically impeccable performance but absolutely boring in terms of real musical interpretation. If you just want to have a faithful reading of these works that's an adequate recording, but if you want to get a taste of the real emotional power that make them qualify for the title of masterpiece I'd recommend any of N. Jarvi's and K. Kondrashin's interpretations. Specifically for No. 5, Maxim Shostakovich's RCA recording is my absolute favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous tempos","review":"This review is confined to Bernstein's performance of the 5th, because I couldn't stand to listen to his performance of the 9th after suffering through the 5th. The recording is muddy, and the tempos are bizarre. His \\"moderato\\" is \\"allegro\\" and his \\"allegro non troppo\\" is \\"allegro very troppo.\\" The last movement is breathlessly fast -- 8:55 where Haitink takes 10:35. Get Haitink instead, although I agree with other reviewers that the first Rostropovich (on DG) is very worthy as well, particularly in capturing the screams underlying the false note of triumph in the last mvoement.By the way, the Hurwitz review seems to indicate that the performance on this disk was recorded in Russia. I think what he means to say is that Bernstein presented this interpretation as part of a TOUR that took place the same year as the recording, but this performance took place in Boston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy!","review":"I have no idea whether Bernstein's performance of Symphony No.5 was or was not to Shostakovich's liking. I do NOT endorse Communism or for that matter Bernstein's lifestyle or beliefs. What I can endorse though is this disc. The performance is startling. Many people criticize Bernstein's interpretation as being too romantic and that it does not do this serious expression of the people's Soviet Union justice. Sorry! Not interested! This music is exiting, emotional and just what is needed after a long day at the office. Prepare yourself a glass of Laphroaig single malt, take the phone off the hook, put your mobile on charge, turn down the lights and turn the volume up. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an incorrect interpretation","review":"The Shostakovich 5th is interpreted incorrectly. The tempos are always way too fast.

Well, not only is this no comedy, but it's actually pointlessly depressing. The film focuses on the life of a son who is affected and overpowered by his father's personality and extramarital affairs. He never had the opportunity to confront his father about their relationship, creating an unresolved tension in his life. This is a common issue in real life relationships today, yet there are actually not a whole lot of movies about father-son relationships. However, the characters in \\"When Did You Last See Your Father?\\" are pretty shallow and rote.On top of all of that, the British accents were very difficult to understand, and there is no option for English-language subtitles. As Churchill noted, the Americans and Brits are two people divided by a common language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Broadbent - Amazing","review":"I watched this film simply because Jim Broadbent is in it. He is one of those actors who could not give a bad performance in his sleep. Colin Firth is a bit too \\"Hugh Grant\\" for me, but I was willing to endure him simply for Mr. Broadbent. However, I don't 'get' the film. Supposedly, it is an exploration of a father/son relationship. In the film, Mr. Broadbent's character (the father) has a lifelong affair with another woman, occasionally calls his son 'fat-head' and exposes other human flaws, but other than that appears to be an involved and caring father. It leaves you thinking that Mr. Firth's character (the son) is just a selfish whiner who spent his life alienating himself from his father for no reason. Perhaps the book explored the potholes of their relationship more fully; the film sure doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Personal","review":"I see that a reviewer believed that Colin Firth was trying to be Hugh Grant. I can almost detect why they would feel that way. This is a complex film with multiple time frames, and sometimes it seems that Firth is grasping to get just the right emotion, whereas Jim Broadbent, who plays his not so faithful dad, pulls it off effortlessly. The best supporting actor, however, goes to Matthew Beard who plays Firth's character as a teen. Look for him in the future.As for the film, it is one of those movies that will touch you if you had a father that you always wanted to talk to but never had the opportunity, for whatever reason. Tear jerker for some, blank stares from others, depending on who you are. It's just one of those movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"British drama about fatehr son relationship","review":"Very touching film about complex father son relationship. When father is diagnosed with cancer, his son goes through a flashback of the events from his early adolescence that explains the strained relationship between father and son. Father had a greater than life personality, while son was more introverted and emotional. Long time ago indiscretions commited by the father seem irreconcilable to the son. His attempt to get answers is impeded by the terrible sickness that seems to take over the situation.It is a touching story about parent child relationship. It is also a story about grief and the fact that sometimes we would rather have our parents around so we can hate them then loose them to death and life long sorrow for not being able to have them around ourselves except in our memories.Wonderful cast of very fine British actors.

Instead of installing the drivers automatically, use the \\"I Will Select\\" the hardware option then through the hardware wizard browse to the XP Drivers folder on the disc and let windows install ONLY the driver, not the utility.

This camera does work decently when the batteries are working. It takes video with sound in addition to the pics. If you have a HP computer and printer like me, the software loading pics/video is even easier.Here's what I have found is a way around the battery problem:Keep 3 sets of rechargable batteries. (I use rayovac IC3 6 total)The moment you put the batteries in the camera, it starts sucking power whether it is on or not! IF I limit my viewing of pics already taken and take pics without the screen on, the batteries will last about a day (40 pics).Leave the batteries in the camera overnight. By the next morning, the batteries will be dead or close to it. Take the old batteries out, and put new charged ones in while the others charge. The reason why I keep 3 sets is in case I use one up too fast.Hope that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading and subjective","review":"Poorly written \\"shot\\" at large projects based on weak analysis and \\"leaps in logic\\".

I felt the publishers misrepresented this book and sold it under false pretenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the read, but with caution.","review":"This book depicts the judicial system as corrupt. If you start out with that in mind you will tend to feel victimized. The system is a collection of laws, attitudes, accepted norms and people doing a job. To expect everything to come to halt to take care of you and your children is unrealistic. Judges, lawyers, mediators and the rest of the system didn't get up this morning bent on doing you harm. They are doing a job, just as you do your job. With guidelines, bosses and parameters they have to meet.To see everyone as \\"despicable people have zero regard for children or other people, but only for the money that they can extract at the expense of other people's pain and conflict\\" is debilitating.This book is only a tool. A marginally good tool. You can see the low price for which it is being resold. It is worth the $7.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing to read.","review":"I am a woman and read this book for the benefit of my fiance and his daughter. While there were some excellent tips for figuring out a good strategy for winning custody battles, the examples of men's situations and numerous defeats was depressing! I was especially surprised by the number of men implying that their former spouses just suddenly went nuts and started acting crazy. If men can't get a CLUE, then they shouldn't get custody. If you're a man and you like the idea that women for the most part are stupid, bi-polar, and downright vindictive then you'll love this book. I do have to say that the advice given on looking for a good lawyer, and how to \\"act\\" in the courtroom were fairly good.

It just makes sense, who is the jerk who created the old style jiggers, you need at least two jiggers to cover all the common measurements and one always gets lost so the bartenders just guess or free pour and unless you have more than a tip at stake you are probably less concerned with liquour cost than your tip so and extra 1/4 ounce seems like no big deal but that adds up to huge losses at the end of the year and that is the end of many a great restaurant. The only downside is the shippip is soooooo slooooowwwww and way too high for this day and age. Give me a break the cost of the shipping was as much as the jiggers I bought and it still takes over a week to get it to me. Come on, I could get it to Japan in a week.

I think these are much better then the largest size which is too big but for some reason I like the middle size better than this one since they are a bit wider.

Your food turns and stays turned easily. The tips can be sharpened ~ I don't sharpen them because I am concerned about how sharp they can actually become. Instead, I slit the meat or veggie with a small sharp knife and thread them onto the skewer. You can't use small pieces of meat or veggies ~ the width of the skewer is almost a half an inch. They are about 18 inches in length, but you lose almost 2 inches because of the \\"handle\\" ~ You can easily get 16 inches worth of food on this skewer.They wash easily and so far, I've not had any rust issues.

They are huge and would only work well on the largest of grills.I also found them to be difficult to skewer anything with. They are very wide (I know there are narrower ones) but any vegetable I tried to put on them (onions, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers) split almost every time no matter how careful I was.So I guess if you have a large grill and want to skewer large firm items such as beef or swordfish, they would be great although still difficult to manuever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product but the edge is too sharp that it cut your fingers","review":"Solid skewer. Good quality for the money. However, the pointy edge is razor sharp. I actually cut my index finger trying to skewered the meat.

As my finger still hurts badly after 3 days, overall not such a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to load unless using HUGE pieces","review":"I bought these, double pronged skewers, and FireWire at the same time. I feel these were the worst of the group. They split mybell peppers and it takes soo much force to load potatoes,etc. I know using bigger chunks would remedy the splitting problem but I don't want to be waiting on veggies to grill forever. I wanted to stop tomatoes from spinning when turning kabobs. If I hadn't bought FireWire also I may have found these to be better, but after comparing the two I can't stand these. I almost would rather use cheap metal skewers over these and turn the veggies with a fork that wouldn't turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best kabob skewers around!!","review":"I bought several different sized sets of these skewers so I could try them all, including the widest so I could cook ground beef.These stainless steel jems are simply the best........ The quality and workmanship is excellent. Unlike water soaked bamboo skewers that will burn up, you can cook your kabobs on very hot fires and get that crusty exterior that makes em taste great. These skewers are flat and can be turned with tongs or even pliers. The meat and veggies will not spin. They are dish washer safe.I shortened several of the skewers by 2\\" making them the perfect length to fit in a Large Big Green Egg. Left at full length they are fine for a 22\\" Webber.I also used a file to sharpen the points to make the food literally glide on the skewers.

The question-answer format provides information based on the questions the author believes you should ask, and makes referencing for specific information frustrating and time-consuming, if not impossible. The examples are elementary and lack significant value. A far better resource is \\"Software Inspection,\\" by Gilb and Graham; Addison-Wesley publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"On one hand, I appreciated that this was not a cookie cutter period romance. And yet it left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It's not the adultery, but the fact that the hero is the man through whom all the murders for hire, gambling, and prostitution in London must go. As he tells Isabella at one point, if her kidnappers had gone through the \\"right channel,\\" he wouldn't have batted an eye at her murder. Yes, he has a vague sort of moral compass (not hitting women, etc.), but I don't find that it makes up for his greater flaws. As a previous reviewer said, his unsavory career is never really addressed, which I find unsettling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Don","review":"\\"My Heart to You\\" is vintage Don Williams -- soft ballads sung with Don's unique style.

In a desperate, year-long search to locate my own copy I eventually decided to try out some of Jel's other offerings and came upon 10 Seconds. The format is similar, but the tracks on 10 Seconds struggle to capture the essence of what made Greenball so successful, and fail to recreate the intensely mellow beats that make Greenball such a good driving disc. If you're a huge fan of Jel or spin your own music this CD will likely yield some good things for you. Casual fans stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Intro to Jesus for Your Child","review":"My 4-year-old daughter has recently developed a love for this book and with it, a love for Jesus. She wants me to read it to her every night and even in the morning! We tell the stories to her using the pictures, and she can tell them back to us as well. The most amazing thing is that she has such a wonderful grasp now of how much Jesus loves us and the things that he has done and does for people. Whenever we read the Bible together, she will say, \\"Jesus loves us a lot.\\" When she hurt her finger today, she said, \\"Jesus will heal it.\\" It has been precious to watch her love for Jesus grow. This book presents Jesus as a lover of children, and that has been a powerful connecting point for her. I am so thankful for Dennis Jones and his work and how God has used this book to answer my prayers that He would draw my daughter to Himself. May He continue to use this book to draw many children to Himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First Bible","review":"Dennis Jones uses bright and comic illustrations for this See With Me Bible for very young children (and their parents or grandparents.) They are a visual delight, one page after another. This is an accessible way to present first Bible stories to children. However, it also forces the presenters to bone up on the stories before starting the book so they can explain what is happening as they go along. A later edition has a few more words of explanation in it, and if I buy another volume, I will opt for that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Truth for little ones","review":"This book has been a consistent favorite of my 3.5 year old girl since she received it about two years ago. Each story is presented in a few pages and the parent's job is to help explain what's going on. Included stories range from creation and the fall to the ascention of Jesus. Having worked in a Christian bookstore, I know that the opinions of the artist's work are all across the board ( I personally love it.)

LOLI respect Jesse a great deal, and have found in him a great role model and inspiration, since I want to become a bike builder myself. This book was cool because it cut through James' public bad-ass persona and showed the side of him that I admire: a perfectionist craftsman, a genius marketer, and a tireless worker.

Most expensive air filter I've ever bought--three years ago.Stupidly, when having my oil changed recently at a Firestone dealer, they told me the air filter needed to be replaced--\\"go ahead\\"--and another Fram air filter placed (I forgot...)Two months later the check engine light is again on, same code and another expensive air filter replacementAt least for a 2000 Avalon, be careful with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Mac compatible","review":"nowhere in the description does this product state that it is only compatible w/PC's. i was excited to load up some pictures on it for my daughter. when i hooked it up and attempted to open the program, i realized that it would not work on my MacBook. now i am going to have to transfer all the pictures i want on it to my husband's computer. so much for quick & easy. i have no idea if it even works at this point. and a minor detail, the description states it takes 2 AAA batteries. it does not. it takes 2 AA batteries. can't give this toy a higher rating because i have no idea if it works, and my frustration level with getting a product i cannot currently use is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"I love romantic suspense, and this book certainly delivers in that regard. Kendra is a serene woman with an unwavering faith, Garth is a former hostage negotiator who has been blaming himself for a tragic end to his career, Vincent is the ultimate bad guy with a good heart, and Tony is an evil man spiraling into madness. All come together in a suspense-filled climax that left me breathless.The book moves at a rapid pace with a Southern locale and dialogue. Some quirky characters are thrown into the mix (as in Moutain Man), which makes the read that much more fun. Tony's descent into madness is chilling to read.An exciting book I didn't want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected it to be better","review":"With all the 5 star reviews and the price of these books used I expected this book to be out of this world. It was a good book. Fast paced, great story line but I expected alot more considering French's books cost as much used as brand new. I was waiting for some sort of extremely exciting twist to come into the story, but it was your typical predictable story with your typical predictable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I started reading this book after having read all of the Bodyguard series, and was terribly disappointed. The characters lack all of the spunk and spirit of the ones I'd grown fond of in her other books, and the plot is certainly not up to par with the others. I didn't originally realize that this book was published earlier than the others, but after reading just the first chapter, I thought it surely must be since it lacks so much that I've enjoyed in her later works. I'll give 5 stars to the Bodyguard series for fun and originality, but this one certainly lacks those qualities. While I raced through the others in a day or two, I've been dragging through this one for over a week, and still haven't finished it, but the outcome is already clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Story!","review":"Chasing Demons by Christy French really was a fantastic story. I loved it. This is just one of those kinds of books you will want to read many many times. And that is exactly what I inteed to do!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I like it?","review":"I don't know if all those who gave this book 5 stars read something I didn't. This book was simply terrible. The story and the characters had real potential but the wording just ruined it for me. Why would an author go around trying to find obscure words to describe everyday things in a way the reader won't readily understand? Lady, its a romance novel, its supposed to be simple and have a certain \\"flow\\", if I wanted to read a book I had to crack out the dictionary for I would look in another section of the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"It was a struggle to get even half way through this book. It is so amateurishly written, poorly edited and incoherent that I didn't see the point of even finishing it. Just like the author's other book, Chasing Horses, this one is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read!","review":"\\"Chasing Demons\\" is a must-read for any lover of romance, romantic suspense, or books with plenty of thrilling action. The characters are wonderfully portrayed. Kendra Salvatori is a woman who has lived with an abusive husband for 12 years, yet has continued to keep herself strong and mentally free of his control. Her husband, Tony, a vicious man who expects to be obeyed and pleased, becomes insanely out of control when Kendra escapes from him. Garth Fisher is a sensitive, caring man who is passionate in his quest to ensure Kendra never returns to her domineering husband. Tony's bodyguard Vincent is a man toughened by life who sees himself as a protector of the innocents of the world.This is a fast, entertaining read. I guarantee, once you pick this book up and start to read, you will not want to put it down until you're finished. And you'll still be thinking about it after you finish!What a fantastic movie this would make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn the witch!","review":"When are you Luddite Neanderthals going to scamper back into the jungles?

So, this book is rather disappointing; I would have paid more for a normal format book, but the only alternative to this wretched \\"Chunky\\" size edition is to buy a old and used hardbound copy of the original edition(which typically sell for almost $100)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I gave this book to my Dad for Father's Day, years ago.

(If I hear one more bit about her being against eating meat and against violence one more time I'll scream!) No, in fact I refuse to buy any more DW books until Sam gets kicked out!! If you like Sam, then get this book. If you find her an insufferable moronic idiot, do yourself a favor and pass this one up. You'll save your blood pressure! Otherwise this story is rather standard fare, nothing really spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work","review":"I honestly believe this title recompiles his best work when in La Fania.

Looking at this book sometimes brings me back to my childhood (a comfortable time) which is nice. The author shows a great appreciation for The Planet of the Apes. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it did not show all memorabilia of the Apes which in all fairness would be an almost impossible task.

Originally, I had previewed this through netflix and thought it was good. It took awhile before I actually bought the series. When I watched it, again, I got caught by the catchy enthusiastic opening and ending songs. If you are ever feeling down, this music will perk you right up.The story line is good and zany. Even though this is all fiction, I can see correlations with current ideas seen in \\"The Secret\\", teachings of Abraham-Hicks, etc. Create your own reality by consciously using your mind/imagination/emotions. Like Haruhi, most humans are not aware of their personal power, but are still creating, but on an unconscious level.Okay, enough esoteric thoughts. Overall, this is a very funny and entertaining series. I hope they come out with a second season and that they get out an original soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awewome anime","review":"the dvd set was what i expected all haruhi all the time. the artwork on the set was nothing but what is expected when dealing with this anime. if haruhi is what you like than this is what is needed to buy. all in all it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 10","review":"Haruhi Suzumiya is one of my favorite anime series out there. Its success is b/c of the great characters and original story. Everything about this anime is awesome. The animation, voice actors and story are all of the highest quality. I'll keep it short by saying this one is definitely not one you wanna miss. I really hope you love this anime as much as the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and well worth the short ride","review":"Just do yourself a favor and skip the 1st episode for last. It'll make a whole more sense and not leave with the idea \\"what in the world am i watching?\\". Beyond that Kyon's narration of what he's actually thinking is what makes this series so great. But Haruhi is also crazy if not a borderline exhibitionist but it only adds more to the series. Also the world actually does revolve around Haruhi and yeah its pretty funny that way. Definetly worth checking out"},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot dies early","review":"I know there is a lot of hype on the series, but its beyond me why it deserves it. Episodes 2-5 do show some potential, but after that the series fizzles out in a string of sub-plots that have nothing to do with what was supposed to be the premise of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time I will not get back...","review":"The BLAH-factor:This is one of those anime flicks I believe everyone \\"loves\\" because someone else 'loved' it before them. The notion of a goddess creating a universe of girls crazed for one average guy just doesn't interest me. The notion of the series appears 'complex' on the surface but is really the same ol' same ol': cute girls want one average guy. Save your money and RENT this before buying it. You'll either love it or you'll hate it. For me, I shouldn't have to waste my time watching MORE than one disk of the series to become *remotely* interested.Good points:To be fair? The character design (visually...not substance) is neat, the animation is fantastic, it does have its moments of humor, and it's a decent source for some pop culture. I was sucked into buying this when I watched the promo-- who doesn't love an opening para-para with some cute characters?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"The final episode is oddly slow, and the \\"00\\" episode makes literally no sense unless you watch it last. But overall, the show is worth every cent I spent, and I'd suggest it to anyone who likes anime.It's funny, thought provoking, and a little over the top sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"As I See","review":"This was a real find because this is a book that has been out of print for a long time. My father gave this to me a long time ago and I wanted to give it to a special someone as a gift. So I was very happy to finally find it again. It is a fantastic book about the various pyschological conditions of the human mind in pictures. Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Harvesting the Heart was the worst book ever! It was such dribble, I didn't believe anything about it...I thought how many times can eyes flash with rage, how many times this and that - I loved My Sister's Keeper and Nineteen Minutes, so I thought this would be great and it was just awful - I kept thinking maybe it would get better, but it didn't. Then I saw that it was written in 1993 and I'm thinking it must have been her first - it was terrible, really, don't bother - I can't believe others liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read in a while....","review":"This is such an amazing book. I have not been able to put in down. It stays with you long after you are done and the story is one not to be forgotten. I highly recommend this book to any woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better","review":"The story line was great, but was kind of lost in the end. Jumped around a little more than most of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvesting the Heart","review":"Was not sure I liked the ending, guess I just wanted more. Maybe a sequel would be good about the mom and dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvesting the Heart speaks to my heart!","review":"Harvesting the Heart is the third book I have read by Jodi Piquolt. Each time, I am amazed by her sense of reality. She often addreses the simple truths which so many people are afraid to speak. Harvesting the Heart is no exception. The main character, Paige, has a little peice of all of us in her. With amazing clarity, we watch and relate as Paige faces the difficulties and triumphs in her life. This book is not to be missed! I am so sad I finished it....When is the next book due out by Jodi Piqoult??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something different!","review":"I loved the format of the book - knowing Paige's thoughts, then Nicholas's. Different and wonderful. I fell in love with the characters and was glad to see them progress and sad to see them go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to Preachy","review":"This is the first and last book I will read by this author. It was way too preachy. All the references to G-d and the author's opinions on abortion, human relations and religion were more than one fiction novel need to contain. This is the last Picoult novel for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommended!","review":"Another well-written, emotionally-engaging book by Jodi Picoult. Although slow moving in the beginning, the tempo picked up considerably as the story moved forward. Paige was a likeable protagonist, and I related closely to how overwhelmed she felt after the birth of her son, especially with a husband who was so clueless and unsympathetic. Without giving the ending away, I truly appreciated the way the situation played out and resolved itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Obnoxious Self-pitying Character from Picoult","review":"Ok, I'm done. I enjoyed a couple of Picoult's books, but between \\"House Rules\\" and now this, I've lost patience. The main character is so self-absorbed it's painful to observe. She seems to lack the most basic common sense. She behaves with a nasty disregard for anyone else's feelings and, it seems, with disregard for logic. Picoult includes a number of slice-of-life details that simply aren't accurate or reasonable, leaving me wondering if the author is not that smart. Very annoying book. I'm at the end, and it won't phase me if I finish it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"I absolutely hated this book. I took it with me on a cruise because it was a selection of our Book Club. My poor husband had to hear me say \\"I hate this book! I hate these characters!\\" over and over. I hated Emily for walking out on her husband and baby and just driving, driving, driving away one night. I was more sympathetic to Nicholas because he, at least, showed great promise in his field and was pursuing a career that would benefit the whole family. Emily's walking out on her father and leaving a note \\"I won't be coming back\\" ----- what the heck is that all about? How do you do that to your father? I hated that the book started out with a dramatic scene at the house but flashes back for most of the book and you are trying to figure out why the opening drama has taken place. I read this book as fast as I could, just to get it over with. I cannot recall ever detesting a character as much as I did Emily. This was my first Picoult book and will definitely be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartache","review":"I thought that this book was very good. It described the loneliness and confusion of not knowing and understanding oneself and one's origin. It is about love and forgivness; patience and acceptance; and loving oneself fully. I liked how the book focused on many diverse issues, such as socioeconomic class, gender roles, separation and divorce, and the life cycle of a marriage and a family. I did not like the ending as much. I thought that the ending could have been more descriptive of the chracters' lives, but instead, it seemed to have stopped abruptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Jodi?","review":"I have read many of Jodi Picoult's books, and in the past she has been one of my favorite authors. However, this book though an interesting story, had so many errors it was distracting to read. I was curious if this was just a problem with the Kindle addition, or the paperback also. It seemed crazy that Penguin would distribute a book with so many errors in grammar, and punctuation.There were words left out, words doubled,and misspelled. Sorry, Ms. Picoult, but I'll be a little more cautious when I look at your next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of a Let Down","review":"Having read many of Picoult's novels and becoming quite the fan, I was pretty disappointed with this novel. The characters were difficult to relate to and I found the main character to be to flaky and awkward. And while many of Picoult's past novels have been page turners (The Pact, 19 minutes, House Rules), this one felt like more of an assignment than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan","review":"I am a mother of three and I was hoping to read a book that explored the many complex, and very real feelings, you have being a mother. This book sounded very interesting and I have enjoyed a lot of other Jodi Picoult books, but it was a huge disappointment. I could barely finish it the characters were so unlikeable. The big revelations in the end of the book were far-fetched and did not \\"ring true\\" with how the characters had been developed. I have been through many issues conceiving my children, dealing with a special needs child, feelings of guilt, feelings of inadequacy, etc. etc. and there was absolutely nothing I could empathize with in the main character of this book. The main character has been through a lot, so you think there will be a lot to empathize with, but she is so self-absorbed and the last third of the book seems to just focus on her whining and neglectful parenting. Do not bother reading this book - there are so many good ones that this is truly not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"After reading the Pact, I didn't think Picoult's work could possibly get any better. I was wrong. Harvesting the Heart is by far the best book I have ever read. It contains much symbolism, but at the same time its not overdone. The novel left me thinking about my relationship with my boyfriend and also my mother. If you read any of Jodi's novels, chose this one. I didn't want the book to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"Jodi Picoult can capture the essence of motherhood and relationships with mastered skill.

This was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to relate","review":"I found it hard to relate to the character.

This book was just disappointing. The ending wasn't satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated on Amazon!","review":"I rarely write reviews, but because I was duped by the reviews on Amazon into buying this book, I thought I would save other unsuspecting buyers the trouble and boredom of slogging through this poorly written mess. I buy many books on Amazon based on customer recommendations and am always pleased, but this book is the exception. It's simply awful; the story is cliched, the writing is juvenile, and I kept waiting for that moment when the book \\"gets good\\" (it never arrived). Go read T. Greenwood, Mary Carr or Dani Shapiro if you are interested in stories about women finding themselves; all three write in a simple, poetic manner that Picoult simply doesn't have the natural instinct for."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have read half of Jodi Picoult's novels and this one was such a disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters and just wanted to scream during the last 50 pages. I only finished it so I could find out what happened. After reading My Sister's Keeper, Vanishing Acts, and Picture Perfect (3 of the best novels I have ever read) this one was a huge let down. It felt very impersonal and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a shallow book","review":"I have ready many of Jodi P. books but this was the most disappointing. It was a shallow plot with both Paige and her husband very self absorbed and Paige wanting to blame everything for many of her bad choices. Her father was an unreal character - she never visited him for 8 years, he knew where she lived but didn't visit her nor did she visit him until she was desparate. Yet he was portrayed as an outstanding father?Her listing the things she was good at on her mirror were pathetic. Nicolas was a wimp who was born with a golden spoon and was like a robot.I kept waiting for something redeeming until the very end but nothing even came close to reality. Staying w/her long lost mom for 3 months when the mom had made no effort to find her and was herself the same self absorbed person wasn't realistic either.I can only excuse this as it was one of Jodi's earlier books but it isn't even close to her other books which I have enjoyed. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Amazingly Awful","review":"I too made the mistake of purchasing this book based on Amazon reviews. What a disappointment!! The premise of the story was incredibly trite - I felt like I was reading a short story in Good Housekeeping rather than a Jodi Picoult novel. Not only was the plot tired, but the writing was exceedingly poor and the editing was atrocious. The characters were largely one-dimensional - I found I wasn't able to care what happened with any of them. I also couldn't get over the number of times that I found myself rereading paragraphs just to make sure it wasn't me - the time sequences were totally screwed up. It was a chore, but I slogged through to the end because I have read, and really enjoyed, several of Jodi Picoult's other novels (Plain Truth, The Pact, My Sister's Keeper) in the past. There was no redeeming twist, no nothing, just the sense that I'd wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"harvesting hits close to home","review":"Once again Jodi Picoult hit her mark. Her books are always testing the waters of the soul and making me wonder about myself. This one hit close to home with the questions it brings about...how would I react? Jodi only gets better with time and I am always thankful for her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Jodi Picoult book!","review":"This was the first Jodi Picoult book that I bought, the second the at I read and probably is my favorite. I loved the added magic to it - the second-sight of Paige's drawings. I love the setting of Chicago for part of it. I like that it's open enough at the end for there to be some doubt as to how it all turns out. I like the romance, the storyline... and of the three of her books that I have read so far in 2008, this is definitely my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All About Coping-Not A Bad Book!","review":"This is my first of Jodi Picoult's stories that I have read. And I have really enjoyed this book a lot. It's all about trying to cope with lifes struggles for Paige,as she is afraid of mother hood.In summary, Paige runs away from home at 18, after guilt over an abortion that she kept a secret. She meets Nicholas Prescott, her future cardiac surgeon husband, who has no time for her. When Paige becomes pregnant, and tries to cope with the newborn at home by herself most of the time, she eventually cracks up and leaves. This puts her marriage into a great big disaster.To really get into details, please read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvesting the Heart","review":"Jodi Picoult is a wonderful writer. She uses rich language and her stories touch your heart. She deals with some heavy issues! I would recommend her to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"when will it end??","review":"This book was depressing....not because I felt sympathy and heartache for the main character, but because I felt tremendous sadness for anyone who felt sympathy and heartache for her!! Grow up and accept responsibility and quit being a victim!! Forget about your loser mother and get on with making your family's life a happy and stable one. Really, give me a break. Nothing about this book presented itself as \\"real\\" to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my fave","review":"I am a big J Picoult fan and decided to read some of her early books. this was okay but definately not on my list of favorites. Don't use this book to judge the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it, though I tried","review":"The first J.Picoult book I ever read was \\"19 minutes\\" (a Columbine-like story) and I found it awesome, gripping.I've read several others by her since then, but I found them all appalling, over-dramatic and not the least bit endearing.The \\"catchy\\" summaries you can find on the back covers which read \\"what would you do if...\\" make me think the author has found a formula for writing best-sellers and is doing it over and over again ad nauseam.I really wanted to give this one a chance because I liked the reviews, but I didn't enjoy it: once again a sob story with a twist (usually legal or medical). I'm giving up on Picoult."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge letdown","review":"I have read a number of books by this author and they have all been very good - this one, however, was horrible. I cannot believe that this book was written by a woman! So the main character, Paige, had an abortion in her teens. This has NOTHING to do with her husband later. He has no right to be upset about it and the fact that he wants to divorce her because of this is simply stupid. The fact that Paige will do anything to get him back is even worse. This book is sexist and Paige is a weak and pathetic character. I was so surprised by this ending and very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I loved \\"The Pact\\" and \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" and after reading the reviews I thought I'd like this one too. Boy was I wrong. I thought it was the most slow moving book in the world. I gave it 100 pages then quit and flipped to the end to see what happened. It was way too wordy and I was thinking, \\"Please hurry up and get to the point!!!\\"I also felt this way about \\"Plain Truth.\\" I liked it but it got to the point where I thought it was being drawn out and then the ending just abruptly happened and it wasn't even a good ending. You could kinda see it coming. Not too much of a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess this author is not for me","review":"This is my 4th book by this author. I must have liked the first one well enough to read another. The next two - can't remember the names - I couldn't finish because they were written in such a boring style.I downloaded this one to my MP3 player and continue to slog away at it. If if was a book, I would have put it down long ago. But I only have one or two more parts, so I will finish. I'm having trouble concentrating, though, because I really don't care what happens with these people.I guess I just do not care for this author. She comes up with interesting, contemporary plots that could result in very good books in the hands of a skillful author.I doubt I'll ever read another of her books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment compared to Picoult's other books","review":"I've been a big fan of many of Jodi Picoult's books, especially \\"Change of Heart\\" and \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" but this book was a huge disappointment. The storyline, like the main character, can't seem to figure out where it wants to go. My biggest problem with the book, however, is the main male character. Nicholas is such a complete jerk, arrogant, angry, selfish and self-absorbed . . . I was honestly hoping that he'd be hit by a truck so that Paige and her son could put their lives together and move on. I would not have been surprised if he had turned out to be a physically abusive husband--he has all of the psychological characteristics of an abuser. I could not believe that he could change, and so I did not want the lovers to reunite. I wanted Paige to take her son and run away and never be found.

It is comical at times to see our main lady juggle with her many lovers, but we are also subjected to some more serious and dramatic issues that our character has to deal with, and these issues help us to see more into the inner workings of Kathryn.

Now she's met Craig, will she have to get a new phone? Purple maybe? Some of her tactics (never let 'em know where you live and have a job where you're out and about - she's a London cabbie) start to wear thin and she starts worrying about one of her lovers running into another one, which turns out to be well founded.

The audio constantly changes volume levels. The disc kicks off promisingly with Frampton's sole guitar scorching through the amps, but when the rest of the band's instruments join him, the volume of the DVD shifts. This happens throughout the two-hour concert, making it unlistenable. The camera work is a bit too frantic at times, but I could forgive that, had the DVD's audio been mastered at the same sound level throughout the video. But it's not, and it's a shame. It pains me to write this, because Frampton is such a wonderful, underrated musician. I think he sounds better on this DVD than he did in the mid-1970s, and he sounds even better today.

It has an intimate, classy feel, but the hall holds enough people and has good enough accoustics to give the concert that \\"big\\" feel that is lacking in certain smaller venues. Frampton feeds off of the crowd and the crowd responds. This same dynamic made the original \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" album rock and roll history.The only slight downgrade I give it is for the video.

My only regret is that the auditorium in which the DVD was filmed wasn't cooler: Frampton quickly strips down to a tank top and is sweating profusely, and every time his arms come up, massively hairy armpits are revealed.

This film carries some of the finest performances I have ever seen in a movie. I have become a fan of Japanese cinema for the heart, soul, and passion that goes into making these movies. Once again, Tak Sakaguchi steals the show, even in his limited screen appearances. Joe Odagiri is great as well. The plot moves at a decent pace while development of each character falls into place with each new scene.Action packed with a great music soundtrack and well placed cinematography that gives the viewer an oppurtunity to feel exactly what the characters are feeling. Watch this movie before yuou judge it...give it a chance to bring you intothat world, and understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must be getting old!","review":"Wow, I loved it! I must be getting old. lol If I had come across this type of movie a few years back I probably would have either dismissed it completely or gave it at best a fair review.It has a mix of great anime-type action and a great love story.It kind of reminds me of a great comic book.Fantastic visuals and a plotline to follow(if you wish).It was definetly worth checking out.If you like this type of movie it's absolutely worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty wack","review":"Pretty because its on Blu but wack cause of the movie itself. Some action scenes are good, but I suggest you rent or borrow from someone before purchasing this one.

This flick has nothing to do with real ninjitsu. It's an attempt to cross an Asian Epic/Love Story in the spirit of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\".. with \\"video game\\" ninjas who possess ridiculous magical powers and colorful costumes. I suppose it might have been a better movie if it had just been one or the other. Pity, because the lead actors (Odagiri Jo and Nakama Yukie) are pretty good and deserved a better movie. History buffs might note that some of the politics hinted-at in Sunpu Castle are pretty accurate. The CGI version of Sunpu-Jo was pretty interesting in itself, but hardly worth the price of a DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need something to put you to sleep...","review":"This movie is terribly boring. I fell asleep twice during it. The fight scenes are too short. The CG used in the film is very cheap looking. The \\"drama\\" will cause you to roll your eyes.

No need to belabor the point - they just do exactly what they advertise every time. The rubber seal keeps the server securely in place; we've never found a bottle that didn't accommodate one. Don't be misled by the product name - the servers are made of plastic, but that just means that they're easy to wash/care for and they've held up through a lot of use with no discoloration or other problems. As with many of the Vacu Vin offerings, these are a superb solution at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pouring","review":"These are plastic pouring spouts that prevent dripping from a wine bottle.

Used them in nothing but standard-sized wine bottles of various common varietals. Did not place any undue pressure on them to insert, but they still developed hairline cracks with a few uses, which eventually lead to complete fractures running the length of the product. Does not seem like I got a few lemons ... seems like a flat-out design flaw. Too bad, because when it comes to their stated purpose, you really couldn't lose a stray drop of wine with these if you tried. Unfortunately, staying in one piece is kind of an important feature for me. Will be trying the flexible foil-style pourers instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Wine Servers","review":"We use these all the time to pour wine.

Walsingham's methods would have been suitable for any intelligence organization in the Cold War. In fact, he might have performed better than some of the actual intelligence people of our own time. The book is told in an easy to read style, with contex explained for the times in which Walsingham lived and worked. The book is highly recommended for anyone interested in the Elizabethian era and/or the history of espionoge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After buying this book following a positive newspaper review, I was very disappointed. I was expecting a discussion of Francis Walsingham, with some historical background and supporting commentary on Elizabeth I and her times. Instead, the book is a commentary on the times of Elizabeth I and associated historical events that just happens to mention Francis Walsingham. If you're looking for a broad view of the times and events leading up to Walsingham's more well-known exploits, this book may interest you. Even then, the writing is not very compelling, and I struggled to get to the end, finding the author's writing style very dry and uninvolving - I may even go so far as to say this is a boring book. In sum, your money could be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Budiansky does not accomplish his goal","review":"The author tries to bring both the biography of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time, but, after reading the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of Walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers. Instead, it is a general overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth I. If you want details and a better understanding of Walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Flop","review":"After such a promising title, I was disappointed to make it more than half-way through this book and still have little mention of the title character and no information that seems pertinent to the supposed theme of the book. It is possible that toward the end Budiansky decided to actually make a point with his narrative, but between his abysmal sentence structure and his *sesquipedalian* use of gratuitously long words that broke up the even flow of reading, I personally was unmotivated to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man was much more interesting","review":"In \\"Her Majesty's Spymaster,\\" Stephen Budiansky attempts to show the truth behind the Walsingham myth, by pulling together countless quotes from letters, diaries, and marginalia. Unfortunately, the attempt is lost in the telling. Even though the picture he shapes for us is a much closer representation than Hollywood gives us, the method of his delivery has much to be desired.In fact, the book is so loaded down with quotes and excerpts that it lacks any real tone or voice of its own. The end result is nothing more than a mish-mash of historical references and quips that are merely slung together in chronological order with no sense of purpose, and lacking any new insight or greater understanding of Walsingham's life or career.If you're looking for an interesting, in-depth narration of Walsingham's expansive service, this isn't it. If you want to remember why you hated history class in middle school, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid popular history","review":"Ms Jardine's assertions about the modern limits of intelligence agencies bespeak a charming naivete; the \\"contrast between now and then\\" is not, I fear, as great as some might wish. (Gentlemen do, in fact, read each other's mail - readers interested in the cryptographical angle of Walsingham's work might enjoy Simon Singh's \\"The Code Book.\\")From the perspective of an historian-in-training, true endnotes are always a desirable feature (one can't always count on recognising the primary documents from one's own research), though Mr Budiansky helpfully provides a number of lengthy quotations from the raw sources. Otherwise, this struck me as a perfectly respectable work of \\"popular history.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin and forgetable","review":"If you are looking for an interesting, illuminating book about the Elizabethan \\"police state,\\" keep looking. This shortish book is light on details and lacks good sourcing. I was hoping, with a biography about someone whose fingers were in every Elizabethan pie, who knew, figuratively and literally, where all the Elizabethan bodies are buried, we'd have a sort of unified field theory of the Age in the offing. Alas, no. Just a little book with little ambition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let us look elsewhere for guidance.","review":"Mr. Budiansky proposes that Elizabeth's spymaster Francis Walsingham offers us an example for conducting modern espionage. Yet the fact is, Elizabethan England was for all practical purposes a police state. Catholicism was deemed treasonous, and Walsingham's spies combed the countryside for practitioners of the \\"old religion,\\" i.e., the faith that had been the taproot of English civilization for a thousand years. Catholics were barred from serving in Parliament, attending university, worshipping at Mass, and generally living the life their immediate forebears took for granted. And yet Budiansky holds up this tragedy as a model. Let us look elsewhere for guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok -- as long as it worked","review":"I wasn't thrilled with the industrial appearance of this system, but it worked great for about 4 months; then the CD player quit. When we tried to play a CD, it showed \\"Reading Disc\\" and wouldn't do more than that. Since we'd had it longer than 90 days, we couldn't return it to the local Target store where we had purchased it. It was still under warranty, so I called the company and was told to ship it to them (at my expense, of course) and they'd replace it. I no longer had the original packing material.

The system actually picked up FM stations on incorrect frequencies, then quit picking up anything, then got stuck \\"reading\\" the CD, then completely went defunt -- all in the space of 15 minutes after setting it up.

It's a trooper, never a skip in a cd, radio comes in great, and the best thing is that it is attached to the TV with a cable. Instead of needed a fancy surround sound system, we have a theater effect created from our one TV stand. It's surprisingly loud and clear for it's size. Having these speakers work with the flat screen really beats the expense or time of running little speakers everywhere, and there is less \\"stuff\\" in the living room to collect dust.

Its almost wholly Shakespearean programme (which features excerpts from the composer's relatively little-known works) is a delight from start to finish. Beginning with the light-hearted (though highly romantic) overture to 'Beatrice et Benedict', the concert ends grandly with one of the most moving funeral marches (a choral march for the final scene of 'Hamlet'). Like those two pieces, the extracts from 'Romeo et Juliette', 'Les troyens' and 'L'enfance du Christ' are superbly conducted by Robert Pikler (where is he now?). Excellently recorded, and not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonstop whining and complaining","review":"I bought this book after my own journey through Spain. At first I enjoyed it, thinking that she had some bad luck running into a few grumpy people, but it became an increasingly annoying theme that according to her everyone in Spain is rude, stupid, and/or fat and every place is dull and boring. I quote from the end of the book: \\"another drab dive in another dull town.\\" Other tourists are also stupid and fat, and sometimes pimply. Sites that have left others breathless bore her to tears, and she thinks people meet in the plazas because they have nothing to do. I started to question her language skills as well as her eyesight.I find it astounding that she could travel 1600 miles on bicycle and eat every meal in a public place and not strike up a single friendship or even a single interesting conversation, but her snarky attitude and condescending assumptions are revealing. Unless you're looking for an excuse to get out of a trip to Spain, I'd skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"Polly Evans' attempt at travel writing in this book is flippant, shallow and trivial.

Fortunately our experience was 180 degrees different from my Polly Evans account of her bike ride through rural and urban areas of Spain.

Fortunately, I enjoyed my visit to Spain much more than I enjoyed reading Its Not About the Tapas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fascinating subject that deserves better","review":"As a historian & a goth I so looked forward to this book. While it started out interesting, the closer it got to the 20th c. (my area of expertise) the more flaws I found in his research. I joked that he must have typed in \\"gothic\\" on yahoo & printed out everything that came up... then I looked in the footnotes. They are filled with website citations of peoples' homepages! No wonder the research was so bad! Because of space limitations I can only give one example: he lists \\"Carcass\\" & \\"Suburban Relapse\\" as Bauhaus songs, when they are, in fact, Siouxsie & the Banshees songs. I wonder what he got wrong in his research of previous centuries, about which I have less knowledge. It is so disjointed towards the end that, frankly, it reads like a 15-year-old's \\"Things I Like\\" list. What a disappointment! Someone else, please pick up the gauntlet & write an accurate history of goth influence on the centuries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hines investigates why we love to be afraid of the dark!","review":"Using all his powers of perception Richard Davenport-Hines draws the black curtains back and reveals why humans have this odd fascination with anything gothic. Though insightful and often thorough to a painful degree, Hines seems to hit all the highlights in what is a most difficult topic to cover completely. Far from objective Hines gives his opinon on the greater and lesser talents of the Macabre, from Lord Byron to Poppy Z. Brite, Hines speaks about his subjects with passion or with ambivalence, depending on his preferance. Though the start is slow, tracing the history of English Gardens the book gradually builds up steam until the end, in which with great love he speaks of English modern artists. Throughout Hines is insightful and his style of writing mixed with the sordidness of the subject matter leads to a good informative book with plenty of appeal for those interested in the Gothic tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"more about tim burton?","review":"The book was great until it started getting to the last part of the 20th century. There he forgot a lot of current gothic works in the areas of comic books and film. I think Tim Burton was only mentioned ONCE in the whole book for his work on the first Batman movie. He should have further explored Tim Burton's work on Batman, as well as talked about Batman Returns, Edward Scissorhands, The Crow, etc. He also could have explored horror films with dark themes like Rosemary's Baby.

This is one of my favorite series! My favorite in the series is Sunwing, because it ties everything up. It seems like Firewing was just written so the question \\"what happens next\\" is answered. It is still good.

My bad. $7.79 for this product is highway robbery. Indeed I could have bought it in my local and very expensive supermarket in NYC for $3.99 or less.

I have had no issues so far and each bag has held up pretty well. If I had to place a grip it would be in the price, but at the same time it does have the free shipping so it offsets the over-price some, but not completely. Only true reasons I have purchased this product more than once is because it is a proven quality product and the free shipping on small items like these make it worth ordering for the office. (With a busy schedule I rather log back into my regularly shopped office items on Amazon once a month and re-order in 10 minutes versus spending more time, energy and gas money going to Sam's Club, Wal-mart or Office Depot looking around for these same items)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"Third- or fourth-rate derivative Raymond Carver.

That said this particular album is of very poor quality especially the mix! Being a professional tubist I certainly enjoy hearing a strong low brass section the problem here is that it sounds like a tuba solo with band accompliment. Alford certainly knew how to write for the lower brass section and the tuba parts were not your a typical omp-pa-pa lines but melodical with wonderful counter melodies for tuba and all the lower brass.

As others have said, it won't stop a bolt cutter, and it could probably be picked given enough time. But in an environment like an office or restaurant, it should be fine.The cable is flexible, and nicely coated so that it doesn't scuff surfaces. The lock mechanism itself works smoothly and seems quite sturdy, and it hasn't scuffed or scratched the laptop even after numerous uses. The only real concern I see: the lock mechanism is significantly bigger in diameter than older locks I've used; so if there's some other connector very close to the security slot on your laptop, you may not be able to use the lock and the connector at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice and safe - but broke in two weeks!","review":"I can not say it is not safe - as long as it does work. But a moment ago when I picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it, I sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced (God knows what had happened to it) and I could not fit my key in. OK they said they would have a life-time warranty but I hate such kind of trouble. I guess they could provide better product with such a price.

A determined thief will not let a 1/4 of an inch metal cable stop him from getting what ever pleases him. All it takes is small tool called a CABLE CUTTER! For one with a strong hand, it will only take seconds before the cable is cut in two. So before you go on and buy a cable, BEWARE!

It's a little difficult to lock because of the way it was constructed. Other then the difficulty locking it, the cable is awesome.

Not only did it warp the plastic for him, too, but to his apparent surprise, it also took him several frustrating minutes just to get the lock on and off.

Keeps the computer secure when you are not near it to stop 99.9% of thieves. Also its pretty non-intrusive and lightweight to carry around. But for all the mac users blaming this product for warping the laptop, its not Kensington's fault, its Apple's. Think about it, they sacrificed build quality near the lock for slim-ness.

I still use it because on the off chance it could disappear, it's worth the minute it takes me to get this cable out and put it on. The first time I put it on it felt and sounded like it was scraping the inside of the laptop, but I didn't worry too much about it and it hasn't been a problem. Now that it's been on a couple times it goes on easily every time. Just have to get the T-bar twisted until it lines up with the dots by pressing the key in and turning, then stick it in, turn the key 90 degrees, pull it out, and done. Long enough I haven't ever had a problem finding something to loop the cable around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to use","review":"I know how this lock is supposed to work and have gotten it to lock before, but it is so frustrating to use. I just spent 20 minutes wrestling with it, trying to get it to lock, with no success. Part of the lock is too loose to ensure that the lock securely locks the laptop.

Tie your laptop up wherever you go, especially the library! I live on the ground floor, and my desk is right next to the window. So I keep my laptop locked up even when it's at home, so that any would-be burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook.

A neighbourhood has to exist, in order for any other meaningful discussion and analysis about it to be valid.Keller then looks at how a neighbourhood can be demarcated.

The cons were that it was totally goofy looking, the color (pink) was pretty different than the picture (I was hoping for rose), and it was huge on my 10 month old. The sizing said something like \\"Fits 0-18 months.\\" I should have stopped right there. That's like saying your 1 year old's Pampers will fit you when you're old enough to need them again yourself.

This knowledge and related inventions for transporting plants made it possible for the British to grow rubber in SE Asia, tea in Ceylon, coffee in Latin America, sugar in Brazil, etc. This movement of plants around the world were further aided by the valuable discovery of quinine for curing fevers and malaria which meant that the cinchona tree from Peru and Bolivia facilitated the penetration of colonial empire further into the African and Asian continents.

I've purchased and used Superpads before, which made a decent replacement for the official Nintendo version. This, however, is an inferior product (Tomee brand) to what was already an inferior 3rd party product. The directional pad is overly stiff, which could greatly limit its use for any games requiring you to roll the d-pad. The button feel is not consistent at all, with one feeling soft and slightly sticky, and others feeling more firm and crisp. The plastic case itself seems poorly machined with a rough surface.

And for those others who said it had poor graphics,adjust the video graphics to high and your screen to 8000 by 6000.Lower the brightness and boost up the contrast on your moniter to get the \\"true\\" 3d effects!(Please disregard if you don't have a ATI PRO video card)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter disappointment","review":"Take it from one of the original frogger fanatics -- the retro level is not even close.

All this for more detailed bumps on logs. Ridiculous. It's also hard for me to understand how the play can be so disastrously jerky when computers must be at least what? 1000 times faster than 20 years ago? Even the typeface is completely unreadable.

I know this is not an introductory book for R, but a lot of time, when we want to use R or Splus the first time, it's not b'cos we want to do simple statistics, so a bit more explanation of the commands will be helpful, rather than following the commands blindly.

But other than that, it's a great product. I strongly recommend it!

I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, it didn't happen! The story of 4 Australian women has it's share of very erotic prose. The combination of food and sex results in a feast for the senses. However, those parts in between are long and often dull.

The opening chapter is well-written and sexy, but the book falls apart soon after.The main characters are four women who eat food, have sex, and do little else worth mentioning. They're interchangable, forgettable variations on one another, and Jaivin's attempt to emphasize each one as she goes about her business inevitably chops what could be a good novel into a collection of erotic vignettes and dialogues, with a whole lot of filler in between.Is there a plot? After reading it once, I'm not sure, and in all honesty I'm not inclined to go back and find out.It's sexy at times, and it's funny at times, and Jaivin clearly has potential. But the book, neither memorable nor believable, misses its mark.

Simply MARK your car location before you begin and hike anywhere trail or no trail forest or mountain and find your way back every time. The uses of this are as varied as your tasks.

My friend's computer also had the same problems when he tried this game.The game itself is loads of fun. The party option has a \\"first to buzz in\\" feature, and there are questions with visual and audio clues as well. In some cases, there's a brief explanation of the answers to entertain and educate you. I'm certain I heard Wink Martindale's voice on some of the questions. He did host the TV version of TP in the 90s. Overall a fun game, but be prepared for glitches and drop out, especially the longer the game goes.

By the way, 'il weekend' is indeed part of contemporary Italian and, as I noticed during a recent stay in Italy, is used by many people, including those who have little or no knowledge of English. It has become so common that in teaching publications such as 'Acquerello Italiano' it is rarely glossed, and it appears even in the smaller editions of the Harper Collins dictionaries.

Each chapter tells a different, but beguiling tale about one of the inhabitants of the inside-out house; major dramas of which the Dixons remain blithely unaware.

Too bad, because an undamaged unit bought locally will cost me $100 to $200 more at local plumbing supply houses.(And yes, the one-star rating may seem unfair but after all, it's the manufacturer's packaging, not Amazon's.

We now have a 3-flush rule for bowel movements: (1) mid-poop flush; (2) end of poop flush and (3) post toilet paper wiping flush. This totally cancels out the low-gallon-per-flush feature. Instead of 1/6 gpf, it becomes 3 x 1/6 gallons per flush.In addition, in the past 11 years since they were installed, we have had to replace all the flappers between 1 and 2 times each, the handle mechanism in two of them, and the filling parts in all three.I cannot recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pure Classic!!!!","review":"This was the first album, that introduced me to CHICAGOTRANSIT AUTHORITY,later just changed to Chicago.

Listen to the bass line in this album and you can tell you are listening to true musicians. When you listen to \\"Goodbye\\" you realize that Peter Cetera's talent goes beyond the high voiced pop singer. Peter is also the bass player and the bass lines here are very intricate.

I stopped at the store today and got another, L'Abbe C. I read Story of the Eye last week (that one was my favorite). As I read (devoured?) Blue of Noon it was like a dawning, an uncovering of a type of writing that I've been trying to find an example of, since it is the style of most of the things I write. Bataille combines his emotions and feelings and anguish and disgust and frustration with the story of this guy and his relationships with various women. It's hard for me to describe what this book did for me because I understand the comparisons and allusions, but taken exactly as it is without trying to find any hidden meaning will still provide for excellent reading. I'd say dismiss any and all negative reviews and get this book, then get Story of the Eye, then The Accursed Share, then everything else this brilliant man has written.."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"I'm pretty fondly disposed to Bataille, but Blue of Noon was a disappointment. The title and the cover are wonderful, and having read Story of the Eye and L'abbe C just before it, I expected great things. But what I received instead was a drawling, shabby, painfully tedious and remarkably unmemorable narrative ramble. It isn't as disturbing as Story of the Eye, and it isn't as interesting as L'abbe C, and it feels much shorter in the surreal atmospheric magic that made those two books worthwhile. If you've already read and enjoyed Bataille, you may want to check Blue of Noon out, but it is not one of his better works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regimental Marches of the British Army Vol 1","review":"The CD fills my music collections on British Military music to the max.

If this book hadn't been marketed as \\"literary,\\" I wouldn't have minded -- namely, because I wouldn't have bought it -- but it's a disservice to other Latina writers, such as Cisneros, to place this book in the same category.

Cisneros is to Castillo as Bellow is to Robert James Waller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible","review":"While there are many books that provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about our culture, this novel is not one of them. A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central character, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make this the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read.

PEEL MY LOVE LIKE AN ONION is almost a parody of multicultural writing, in that the author seems, by pushing all the right buttons, to be striving for marketability among those who see multicultural lit as \\"hot\\" or \\"trendy,\\" rather than those of us who are interested in good stories, strong writing, and real characters. My suggestion: read Sandra Cisneros or Denise Chavez, writers who create fascinating worlds, unlike Ms. Castillo, who appears more interested in capitalizing on a niche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural Trash","review":"A book for the NY effete cocktail party circuit of liberal arts beer bingers & PC police.

Her witty interweaves her romantic language to portray the struggle of Carmen La Coja. Castillo wants finally to prove that Carmen, despite her disability is the most powerful character in the novel.

The green and gold colors are very nice. The figure stands well by itself, and it gives the appearance of being in motion. The quality figure is detailed and well-painted--ready for imagination and adventure when paired with Robin Hood. With some careful placement, the \\"Crouching Robin Hood\\" figure by Papo can also seat on this horse, but the resulting pose is quiet interesting--maybe not all that natural looking for a mounted archer!

Job always comes before her kids....she falls head over heels for a guy she meets in an auto accident and goes out with ONE time!

Then I realized finishing a book that does not deserve to be read is a major waste of time. I found this book to be in the category of a major waste of time and I could not get past the halfway point. The characters are drawn too breathlessly with way too many adjectives. The lead character, Sullivan, who is billed as a savvy investigator with two children for whom she put her law school plans on hold, does some extremely stupid and unbelievable things. I guess this was meant to show how gutsy she was, but to my mind, the author has kind of run out of steam.The author tries to gain our interest by including dark passages that intimate the murderer could possibly be her new love interest but the book couldn't hold my interest long enough for me to find out. I also couldn't figure out if there was more than one serial killer and I really was too bored to stick it out.All in all, the book was lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, stupid book.","review":"This book sucked.

I'm finishing a degree in creative writing and if I turned in any part of this novel as an assignment (theoretically speaking), my professors would tear it apart. However, I am in no way an established author, so I'm really in no position to judge Ms. Rosenberg as a writer. This novel was a huge disappointment, though.

The storyline (self-loathing schmuck finds a twisted kind of redemption via hypocrisy) might as well have been written by the Heritage Foundation. If someone straight (as am I) finds this book so blatantly offensive and political, imagine how gays in search of information re sexual identity would feel after plunking down hard-earned money for propaganda that is aimed at pepetuating hatred toward them.

The section in this book on the question of evil is especially good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best out there","review":"These pads follow the natural shape of the breast, and are undetectable even with a thin shirt.

None of the ideas offered any new insights into productivity.In certain chapters of the book, the author(s) lack of real-world experience is clearly visible. From my years of experience in human-resource management, I find many of the ideas and suggestions offered in the book are already well known management methods that do not work in today's world. At best, the book is suitable for the consumption of naive business students.Does not deserve the 4 star rankings. Who wrote the earlier reviews? The authors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic???","review":"I found the book sadly filled with useless pages filled with photos of people (8 pages) and even more of nothing most people would ever think of carving(12 pages) that's 20 out of 63 pages wasted.

Does offer little help in the layout of a head and facial features.If your good enough to attempt carving a face you are way beyond this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carving Faces","review":"The used copy was received in almost new condition. Written in 1993, it is a bit dated equipment wise. There is a lot of information concerning facial proportions which will keep you on track to carving a recognizable human face rather than a gargoyle. There are books for carving gargoyles. Overall, it is a good book if you're interest is in carving the human face.Carving Realistic Faces With Power (Schiffer Book for Carvers)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is NOT what you get.","review":"This is definitely a case of what you see is NOT what you get. Yes, you get two cast iron pans, yes, you get a bag of cookie dough, and yes, you get covers, but they are nothing like what is pictured. First, the skillets are much smaller than what I was expecting. The descriptions says 7 inches by 10 and a half inches by one inch. In reality, the internal dimensions are 6 and a half inches by about three quarter inches deep. The \\"Form Fitting Hot Pad\\" is nothing more than a tiny wrap that goes around the handle (picture a finger cut off of a glove oven mitt). It does NOT cover the bottom of the skillet. The cookie dough is NOT Lehi Roller Mills in a nice bag, it is a generic mix in a small plastic bag with instructions stuck on the outside. It actually has printed on the label \\"Prepared especially for Skookie by the nice ladies at Blue Cattle Truck Trading Co.\\"Very disappointed in what I would consider false advertising.

Sun says to start migrating from Admintool in their Solaris 9 release notes. Nothing on soft partioning, and worse yet, no covereage of how to use Solaris Volume Manager. Nothing on Projects when setting up user accounts. Nothing on the SMC process tool. Nothing on how to use SMC to manage disks and file systems. Nothing on Print Manager.

Unfortunately I was not able to plug it into any of my computers because none of them have this kind of plug (ps2) so I am unable to try it until I get an adapter that I have been looking for (for another mouse I have with this type of plug). Should have been the description. Kind of a big unit, as wide as my palm with my fingers spread apart. Not as slender as the picture looks.Update: Sept. 2, 2012So I bought an adapter for the outdated PS2 cord that converts it to a USB port and it does not work on Vista. Downloaded several different drivers and all that happened was that it disabled my keyboard and the BSOD a couple times. May try another adapter. I so want this mouse to work , I really like the features, but Kensington does not even provide the correct driver. Hopefully a different adapter might do it.

After reading this one, I would recommend reading other business books that cover business principles for ANY type of business.

It covers correct latch and different positions for breastfeeding. It is really helpful for first time moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly outstanding breastfeeding guide","review":"I purchased this book while researching the breastfeeding chapter in one of my forthcoming books. I immediately fell in love with this book -- specifically, with its innovative approach to the material (the seven natural laws) and its warm, supportive, and mother-friendly tone. The authors do a terrific job of explaining the root causes of many common breastfeeding problems in ways that make so much sense. Their section on how taking a \\"left-brained\\" approach to the very \\"right-brained\\" act of breastfeeding is totally brilliant. I can't praise this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I'd had this BEFORE MY SON WAS BORN!","review":"I thought I'd done everything I could to prepare for breastfeeding, but if a friend hadn't brought me this book at 3 weeks I really might have thrown in the towel. I was starting to think I'd never make it through the first month and wondering if I had milk supply problems. In five minutes of looking at this book I realized that:1. it would get SO much easier in a few weeks (if only someone had told me!);2. all my \\"worries\\" were actually normal behavior for a 3 week old baby. (If only someone had told me!)3. I too could feed lying down at night and actually get some sleep. (If only someone had told me!)If you're about to have a child - or if you're exhausted after only a few weeks and wondering if you can make breastfeeding work - then do yourself a favor and READ this book before you decide to quit, supplement, introduce a bottle, or switch to formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and informative!","review":"This is THE BEST breastfeeding book that I have read thus far. I initially purchased the American Academy of Pediatrics' \\"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding\\", which was an adequate book for those women who may be exploring their options in terms of breast vs. bottle, but as an RN, I learned absolutely nothing. I kept feeling like there was something missing, but being pregnant with my first child and having never breastfed before, I couldn't say exactly what. Then I bought this book on a whim and WOW! I LOVE IT!!! This book not only addresses the \\"how's\\" of breastfeeding with pictures and numerous detailed explanations, but it also explains the \\"why\\". I have so much more insight into how breatfeeding works and have a new appreciation for the team that my baby and I will become."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breastfeeding Made Simple is an excellent choice!","review":"I highly recommend that new mothers read Breastfeeding Made Simple. It would also be helpful for breastfeeding educators, lactation consultants, childbirth educators, labor and delivery nurses, doctors, etc. because the authors explain how babies are \\"hardwired\\" in behavior and needs, as well as how to get breastfeeding off to a good start (or what to do when there are problems). Mothers with such knowledge will feel more confident and have less difficulties than if they ignore these behaviors. As an IBCLC who has observed thousands of babies, I learned alot from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book allowed me to continue breastfeeding was I was close to quitting","review":"I highly recommend this book. As a new mom, with no experience with nursing, I was given lots of very conflicting advice (from the OB office, the pediatrician, the lactation consultants etc). I was so confused and overwhelmed! I bought this book when my son was 4 weeks old. I read it while nursing over the course of 24 hours and it helped tremendously! The book gives you straightforward, simple advice that encourages you to trust yourself and your baby. It made sense of all of the different things I was hearing. My son is now 9 1/2 months old and I am proud that I am still nursing, a fact that I attribute largely to this book. I wish I read this during my last month of pregnancy and I encourage all expecting moms that I know (who want to breastfeed) to get a copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone planning to breastfeed!","review":"I read this while I was pregnant and it helped me so much to get in the right mindset for breastfeeding.

I buy it for anyone who is planning to breastfeed because of how much it helped me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Breastfeeding book EVER!","review":"This book has all of the information needed for succesful breastfeeding. I read this after my third child and learned so much. An absolute MUST read for every expecting or seasoned mom. Explanations are so easy to understand. Photos and drawings to show techniques. Gives you all of the who, what, when, and how. Great support and encouragement offered by author. I will be giving this to every new mother I know. I'm a pediatric nurse and teach mothers how to nurse but I learned so much from reading this. Mothers, trust your instincts!

Fortunately, I had this book when we got home from the hospital. I referred to it MANY times in those first critical days home when I was second guessing myself and when I was ready to give up. It was so reassuring and gave me the information I needed to KEEP going. I'm happy to report that my baby is now a month old, gaining like a champ and so far is exclusively breast fed. Excellent resource! Does not have the preachy tone found in other breastfeeding books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, good stats","review":"This book was helpful for a first time Mom.

However I personally used an old standby written by the LaLeche League, but the reviews for this one were so outstanding that I made the choice. My daughter-in-law hasn't talked about the book, but I have noticed it sitting on her end table marked for reference on several pages so I do assume she is using it regularly. I've also noticed that she has repositioned my grand son to make it more comfortable for the both of them while nursing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book!","review":"In my opinion this book does not share the realities of breastfeeding. I hated the way it painted. A Rosy picture and said if things aren't amazing with breastfeeding something is wrong. Everyone's experience is different and breastfeeding and hurt at first in the first few weeks! This book just made me feel bad about myself and want to rush to a lactation consultant.

Breastfeeding was very difficult for me and still is (6 months in). The book helped me understand the basics of BFing. I liked that it gave more scientific explanatations and quoted studies etc instead of anecdotal evidence in the LLL- Womanly Art of Breastfeeding (which is also good to have on hand, but made me feel terribly guilty that things weren't working out perfectly).

Getting the ball out to clean the rollers is easy, but actually cleaning those tiny little rollers is a nightmare, much harder than a normal mouse.Plus, the rubber is so small it is deteriorating really quickly.I discovered the roller itself gets stuck inside the casing and doesn't spring back as it should, so the roller is not touching the ball.In conclusion: you get what you pay for: cheap and nasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing [stinks]","review":"When I first got it, it worked great.

Initially, the ball moved the curser quite quickly and freely around the screen. However, after about 10 minutes, I noticed myself frequently hitting the left button when I clearly didn't intend to.Also, my wrist became tense and would cramp up from using it. I think it was due to the wide frontal design. I put my old Intellimouse in its place and found I didn't have the pain nor discomfort.

With Kensington's MouseWorks driver, you can reprogram the buttons (it's useful to set buttons 1+2 as autoscroll). The ball is a pretty, translucent blue.That being said, I cannot understand why this trackball is still being sold. This trackball was made in 1999 and is mechanical, which means it uses the same technology as the old ball mice that no one uses or even sells anymore. Logitech's Marble optical trackball is less expensive, uses better (optical) technology, and has four buttons. Or, if you need a Kensington trackball, there's an optical version of the Orbit, too.

It's simple but a bit intricate - the first time I put it on backwards, since there's no easy way to tell, and it's harder to open up than close. Then I started putting it in my window, and it would invariably pop off within a few minutes even when the car is stopped. Sometimes when it falls, it springs apart again, too.

But, after wasting a lot of our homeschool day with the children coloring (by day 3, coloring had turned into scribbles) I decided to use these as supplemental activities. We read and do art projects. We talk about the subjects. We did the puppets and had my daughter write postcards. The kids chose which ones looked \\"fun\\", and skipped the rest.While it is nice to have a book to look at afterwards, I feel they do not serve a great purpose. They are nice if you need a \\"work sample\\" for school, but I feel they are just \\"busy work\\".

This is an unforgettable story based on true events experienced by actual people, Koestler among them. \\"Right and wrong\\", \\"moral and immoral\\", \\"selfish and selfless\\" -- all these dichotomies are turned on their heads, and the reader is the richer for it.

The protagonist, Rubashov, takes us through memories that lead us to realize that we could all be delinquents of a socialist state. His feelings begin with understanding for the revolution and support of the positive changes the revolution brought along. The feelings become more of a Randian nature as Rubashov realizes the great error of the people.The thematic quality of the book is near that of any of Ayn Rand's novels while the prose surpasses even Rand's greatest.

Being a native of Massachusetts I appreciated the correlation between Windale and Salem as well as the authentic feel of the Wicca practice. The characters and dialogue pull you through the book keeping you scared, fascinated and drawn to find out what will happen in the end!?! I would definitely recommend this book... and after you are done reading you too will wonder about those noises in the night!<grin>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Great!","review":"While this book may seem like the old rip off of Salem's witches from a normal review, it's a whole different story. With a plot of possessiveness, rituals, and chases, this book is very hard to put down. I began reading and finished the 304 page book in 3 days. It's a great read for Stephen King lovers and hopefully J.G. Passarella will come out with a new book within the next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween will never be the same!","review":"This is an outstanding first novel that takes you into the world of the Salem Witches. The story line is so strong that you ignor the small discrepancies.Set on the campus of a small New England college, the author takes you on a roller coaster ride into the world of the occult.A must read for all you \\"Stephen King\\" \\"Anne Rice\\" fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Have To Work Too Hard","review":"Wither is the type of horror novel that really does not horrify. Its too much fun. This engaging novel by John Passarella and Joseph Gangemi, under the psuedonym J.G. Passarella, is a supernatural tale that is much like a ghost story told around a campfire. Kind of scary but ultimately not really dangerous. Interesting historical references to the Salem witch trials and a well researched presentation of Wiccans (who are really just tree-huggers in religious trappings) are written in a non-threatening way but they propel the story forward. Believable characters and a cartoon-like 300 year old monster presented in straight forward prose that is easy to follow makes Wither a great leisure read. Not too serious in tone, this book is an amiable companion for the beach or on an airplane. One complaint: An editor would have been usefull because at 438 pages Wither is a bit overweight and could have easily been editted down about 50 pages with no damage done to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"deleriously awful; badly written; silly plot","review":"Am I the only one who thought this book's best use is in my fireplace? What's the average age group of the above-reviewing readers, I wonder? This clunker of a book is the equivalent of a Saturday night made-for-tv movie you watch because you're too sick to be bothered to try and find something better to watch. An UTTER waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wither","review":"thrilling read edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next but dreading the outcome. have read all books in the trilogy, love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I am frankly appalled that so many people recommend this book so highly. It's not that it's bad; it's just not very good. The writing is mediocre and lacks anything to distinguish it. The story has a lot of potential and is, frankly, pretty cool, but it's executed in a completely boring fashion. Passarella draws the story out so long that you just don't care what happens in the end. This is genre fiction at its most ubiquitous: formulaic, boring, and over-rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and slow","review":"When I ordered this book, I was hoping to read a scarey, chilling book. I was wrong. Certain parts of this book were entertaining, but most of what I read was a disappointment. It had a weak plot, a weak ending, and weak characters. It lacked some sort of stability to keep my mind focused. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't deserve the hype","review":"I was shocked to hear that this book won the Bram Stoker award for best first novel for one important reason: it's not very good. With sketchy characters and a sophomoric writing style, Wither is an utterly forgettable book. There is plenty of good horror fiction being published these days (I recommend Waiting by Frank M. Robinson or Superstition by David Ambrose as two great examples) that deserve distinction. Wither is not one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading the reviews I was really looking foward to this book but I found it so dull that no one could force me to read the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a slight disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with this one. It isn't the worst book I've read, but the author needed a better editor. The writing is excellent in some places, but unclear and redundant in others. The premise is interesting, but I could never shake the overwhelming sense that this book wanted to be a TV movie -- a bad TV movie. Most of the characters seemed a tad stupid, and more than a tad shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW WOW WOW WOW","review":"i hardly ever read for fun but now im glad that i read cause now i can read without having wet dreams which i have but no one believes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing.","review":"Despite an interesting premise and setting -- the revival of 17th century witches in a 20th century New England college town during the Halloween season, this novel relies on the typical elements of modern horror, i.e., profanity, sex and graphic violence. For a truly scary read, try one of the old masters of the supernatural, such as Henry James or Edith Wharton, who knew that by engaging the reader's mind and tweaking his or her imagination, extremely frightening results could be achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Read","review":"This book was fascinating. I loved the way all of the characters were connected and interwoven. I would also like to say that I am a Wiccan and this book does my religion justice. The plot was spellbinding and the characters were rich and well developed. I could not put it down. I would love for this book to be made into a movie because it would be amazing to see on the big screen. Pick up Wither! You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"Nice start, a little choppy. You can wait for the paperback. It's a good first book, nothing more. I do agree with another reader who says it reads like a made for tv show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud","review":"Fraud! This charger does not work. I opened up the charger, it consists of a resistor and an LED. Nothing else. Don't get fooled by the low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back up","review":"The original battery charge that came with the DSC-T1 has a cord that is about 12 feet long. With my travel and the allowed weight I needed a smaller package. This charger works great. The new battery is an addition to the still good original battery. The batteries are both alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost started a fire","review":"The charger charged my battery once. The second time I attempted to charge the battery it made a high pitched noise as if it was about to short out. I tried it several times over the course of the day. I threw it away because it was either going to ruin my battery (might be ruined - I have not attempted to charge it again) or start a fire (likely). Not that it has anything to do with evaluating a poorly made product, but I'm an engineer.Also, it was not compact in any sense of the word. It is much larger and more awkward than the original charger from Sony. I would highly recommend buying the Sony charger and not wasting the time and money on this product or any other product by this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than original","review":"I bought this charger because my mother in law lost the original. This charger is smaller and easier to use than the original. I would have bought one years ago if I would have know it was so nice. Plus it came with a car charger plug - bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"More organization, editing & focus needed, but great photos.","review":"I enthusiastically ordered this book after hearing a good interview with the author. I was rather disappointed with the book. The photos of album covers and insides, with the narrative comments, were a lot of fun. But the author seems to include reasonably clear clues, speculation, idle speculation and bizarre speculation all on the same level. Its hard to know what to take seriously as the book wanders throughout all of those. Would have been a more enjoyable read if better organized, edited and focused."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FASCINATING TOPIC, BUT NOT THROUGHLY RESEARCHED","review":"Patterson does a thorough job of reprinting/rewriting a lot of old Rolling Stone articles, but doesn't go the extra distance in tracking down the behind-the-scenes story of this great rock 'n' roll rumor.

I was pretty bummed when I got this that I couldn't play with my friend in a LAN game but I believe our issues were based on playing XP to windows 7, not the game itself. So fun...I still enjoy playing the old ones, they still stand up as great games, perhaps not graphically but strategy wise these games are hard to beat.

One from my wife, the other from my mother-in-law.One had 5 CRC errors in various files stating \\"The medium from which you are running the setup may be corrupted.....\\" After the fifth I got the great \\"Catastrophic failure\\" and off it went.The second managed to go through the install with 13 CRC errors but never a Catastrophic failure, but it would not play properly (of course).So I took my wife's back to CompUSA and exchanged it with no problem for a third one..........got the first CRC error in the same file and decided I wasn't going through with the rest this time and aborted the whole thing.I'll be calling EA in the next couple days to figure out what is wrong.

None of the multiplayer mods work for the generals and zero hour games. The map editors are not included for the earlier games. There is missing music in the first 2 games.The best thing and the reason its a good value is because all the games are on 1 DVD instead of having to swap multiple CDs out or clog up hard drive space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I got 2 of these so me and wife could fight each other and the PC opponents.

By the time you get to Red Alert 2, I feel like the graphics are more than presentable, even in today's standards.Some slight complaints:1) (MINOR) Entering 7 CD-keys is a real pain.2) Some of the games can have problems on a 64-bit system.

If I had bought it from a store I would have returned it. One section of 2 games would not work at all. The first 2 had a mission that could not be beaten and on a time limit and no cheats and no way to go past it so about 4-5 of the games were only half doable. Got to the next to last game and it is set to going so fast as to be undoable and no way to slow it down. Tanks move at 100 miles per hour.

The DVD of extras (interviews) is being met with luke warm to negative reception.Some people that have the original games are copying the code from their old game CDs in an attempt to patch the versions in C&C; X. Electronic Arts has been mostly silent about issuing any patchs after days of complaints on their bulletin board.The games don't really appear to be \\"updated for XP\\" at all as features have been removed and there are some bad bugs.

The biggie: The titles have been tweaked/updated to run well on modern Windows XP PCs (hopefully, this will also work fine with the upcoming version of Windows, called Vista).Not much has really changed from the original titles. The reasonable $39.99 buys you a package of 12 awesome RTS titles on a single disc that runs on modern PCs. Videos/audio have not been remastered/remade. The idea was to keep the games as close to the originals as possible. The games that support multiplayer still do. So there you have it:Every C&C; game in the past 10 years optimized to run on WinXP.

This was probably the best choice I have made in awhile.The book starts strong with the prom plot set up with the fake dates, drunk high school girls and closted hotties but goes off the rails (In a good way) with deaf dancers, drug dealers, skinny dipping, smoking pot, car chases, cute cops and more plot twists than seems possible.The book reads like a smart, funny, slapstick, heartfelt comedy and managed to make me laugh, smile, cry, and not put it down. It's just a great summer read that has one the best cast of characters ever--you might not like all of them but they all need to be there and they all work to form one of the most daring books I have read in a long time.Just read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out Loud Funny-A must read!!","review":"A really nice prom mess was one of the funniest books I have ever read.Cameron's misadventures on prom night are hilarious. He seriously has the worst prom ever. This is a highly unrealistic story but it is such a fun read. From Dmitri the drug dealer bi-sexual Russian to Virginia McKinley the wild party girl to Buck-the gay deaf stripper the characeters are all so likable and funny.This book is like all those teenage prom movies (She's All That, Drive Me Crazy etc.) with a little twist.I could not put this book down and definitely recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"helps busy psychiatry residents and psychiatrists ace the boards.","review":"i am a psych resident and finding time to study is always a challenge, given my busy clinical schedule. i found this book to be a concise and powerful tool for psych boards preparation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation of Book and Poor Customer Service","review":"This seller misrepresented his book.

Already had one pair. Needed 4 more. Very convenient especially with the handles that are touchable well into a prolonged meal. Butter melts in a matter of two minutes and stays soft for literally hours on a single candle. My niece ground up some fresh garlic and included in half of the warmers for optional additional flavor. Very easy to clean afterwards. Safe, attractive, classy. Don't have to worry about tarnishing that may occur with metal sets.

Relieved, I moved on, hoping for what the description sounded like would be a good gay thriller. Unfortunately, the storyline, which was pretty simple, didn't build the needed suspense very well for a film in this genre. The movie seemed more of an excuse for some admittedly hot scenes; however these scenes did little to advance the thin plot. The acting itself was mostly amateurish and this deficiency was distracting enough to remove me from the world the filmmakers tried to create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, i really liked it","review":"It was entertaining.....I seriously never expect Oscar worthy performances for a gay movie....not yet at least.

Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called \`FiberComp', tool is very lightweight. The handle is rock solid, and while much thinner, the tines are surprisingly hard as well. While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft, it is capable of more rugged performance. The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if used properly and not abused, it should last for some time. The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howey Wine drinkers","review":"My daughter gave us this product for Christmas. As we drink mostly red wine, this product gives us the freedom to store our whites and bring them out when the mood arises. We love the Breville wine chiller.

I chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm. I had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink. Gel packs don't allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chills okay, but \\"chill cells\\" are oozing.","review":"The product works ok, but then we don't like our Chardonnay super cold either. I'm not so sure that an ice bucket filled with ice and water wouldn't do the same thing in just slightly more time. (You might want to try that before buying this chiller.) My primary reason for writing this review is to say that after about 3-4 months of intermittent use, the chill cells are oozing out freezer gel. They say it's \\"food safe\\", but nonetheless, that shouldn't happen. I'll contact Brevelle & hopefully, they'll make it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does nothing in 7 minutes","review":"I tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I bought this on a whim, as a gift.

This gizmo loses a point for being $50 instead of $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just an ice bucket with circulating water","review":"The major difference between this and an ice bucket is that it uses solid chill cells instead of ice. It circulates water, but I don't see what difference this makes. Bottom line: It didn't chill my wine any faster than an ice bucket full of ice and water. I ended up throwing mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to do much","review":"This product didn't do anything more than sticking the bottle in the fridge would have done.

It's an adjustment at first, because the way you brush your teeth with this brush is so different from the way you do it with a regular toothbrush. But once you get into the new pattern, it's great! My teeth feel really clean, and my gums are much healthier, too.

Most of the time we think of the 7 cast members of Gilligan's Island but once you read this book you'll forever know that Sherwood Schwartz was the reason for the show's success. Did you know that they turned the pilot down 3 times? Did you know the Executives wanted Gilligan to have a pet dinosaur. Did you know the only reason it was canceled was some big CBS Mucky Muck wanted Gunsmoke to continue and chose the Gilligan Island time slot to put it in.

This book takes a wonderful look at what Mr. Schwartz went through to get his vision (like it or not, the concept was created by Mr. Schwartz, and Mr. Schwartz alone) on the air. From network executives who tried to change everything about his show, to casting, to scoring and more. Whether you like \\"Gilligan\\" or not, you have to admire Mr. Schwartz's guts and tenacity in seeing his idea through to fruition. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherwood Schwartz is an idiot","review":"My father was the late Charles Tannen, who, with Bill Davenport, wrote many of the Gilligan episodes.I'm stunned of the strange and cruel things Schwartz and penned about the both of them.

There aren't wall-to-wall beauties like the first one, but at least three strongs stand among Edwards' finest: Hearts Overflowing (an ideal wedding song), White Line and the title song. The production is a little too lush, and lacks the acoustic immediacy of the debut. So I keep comparing this album to \\"Jonathan Edwards\\" and coming up short. Still, if you've got that one and are looking for more, this may be the next place to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin The Boat","review":"I'm very taken with the other reviews here.

And why wouldn't you get forgiven; after all, you took these actions because you were upset, and really wanted something, and you cried a bit - doesn't that entitle you to absolution for whatever you do?A pointless tangent regarding a dead brother and a cliche mystery ending also offend.

Assign one negative star for each of the five and one-half trillion dollars of our deficit and you have the perfect rating for this movie!I like Emily Blunt and Rosemarie Dewitt, but I am deeply embarrassed for them and their professional lives...no one should need a paycheck badly enough to recite this script in front of a camera. And Mark Duplass...was he acting, or is he actually that shallow and disgusting in real life? I am embarrassed for Jose Cuervo Tequila who allowed their brand to be seen in this moivie. And poor Seattle; who in their right mind would ever want their city to be the locale for such a film?Take out all the \\"F---\\" words in all of its forms and the movie would run no more than 18 minutes.Final thought...my little miniature schnauzer is sick with diahhrea tonight, but her bowel movements are pleasant when compared to the aroma of this movie beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

Do not rent this movie. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. I gave it a try twice and couldn't take it. The dialogue was horrible. It just dragged and dragged. They tried to throw in some outlandish things just to wake up the viewers but I found myself running for the remote because I just couldn't take anymore. Emily Blount seems uncomfortable in her role because she probably realizes how horrible it is. Save yourself a couple of hours to watch paint dry.

I give Lynn Shelton some credit for trying to put a new spin on the genre, but her efforts to create a non-traditional love triangle resulted in the characters doing things that didn't feel natural to their personalities.

Scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diet Detox book is a ripoff","review":"I bought the book and kept on thinking ok, ok, but where's the beef --sorry - i mean the juice. The book is nothing more than a promo piece to step you up to the next level to buy the kit for $199. Roni talks of juices and soups but its only when you go to the website you realize you have to buy it all from her.Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean yourself out and lose weight","review":"OK, the most important thing about this detox to know is that it is not easy and it is not for everyone. But... If you can do the work and follow the concepts, there is no way it cannot work. I am on day 12 and have lost 17 lbs. The organic produce is expensive, as are the colonic treatments, but I was spending a lot more each day on junk food.

Cannot wait to get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets get serious","review":"Diets come and go. We had the adkins diet in the early 2000's which entailed cutting out carbs. Eventually this turned into low carb diets and then America shifted to low fat. This just sounds rediculous. Anybody can lose weight by just eating correctly and eating at the right times. Typically, people eat their heaviest meal in the evening which is when we are winding down. If one wants to increase their metabolism which will burn through your food and keep you fit. Your best option is to eat 5 small meals/snacks a day. Say you are normally eating 1500 calories per day. Many will argue well if I eat 5 meals a day I am eating more and getting fat or gaining weight. Not so! In fact if you eat 5 300 calorie meals you are eating the same amount of food just several different times. The 21 day diet is inefficient and you will gain the weight back immediately when you get off of it or switch to whole foods. Be smart and save yourself some money and time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't need this book to do it !","review":"I saw the documentary \\"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead\\" and decided to get healthy. I bought this book because Amazon recommended it when I bought my juicer. There is about 1% of information for a juice diet, and NO juicer recipes. As far as the detox diet that she tries to push, you need to spend HUNDREDS of $$ in supplies. Chi machine, water distilling machine, Enema equipment, colonics, special massages, and the list goes on. The book goes into the science of detox, and then again into the science of detox, and again into the science....... OK, we got it, poison in our cells, detox by fresh vegetables...This could be summed up in one chapter, but is stretched out for over 100 pages. Also, it's filled with testimonials. How many stories do I need to hear about other peoples diets? Boring! Save your time and money. Buy a juicer, some fruits and vegetables, and start juicing. See \\"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead\\". You don't need this book to get healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you work do not even try!!","review":"Unless you have the freedom of not working or having children don't even try this diet. Also if you do not have the money to buy a juicer or if you do not have a Health Food Grocer near by good luck trying to get all the correct juices required.

I have never desired a colonic and still don't but 8 days into the diet I was very \\"backed up\\" for about a week--it made me really nervous so I stopped. The general concepts are great but very basic--cut out sugar, bread--eat veggies, supplements and lots of water but not eating--just drinking veg and fruit juices is potentially dangerous to your system. In the end I gained all the weight back and then some! Back to the gym! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this book after seeing a recipe for the vegetable soup in a local newspaper. I am not trying to lose this much weight this quick, but figured that if I used some recipes from the book a few times a week, I would be healthier. After recieving the book, I was very disapointed in the recipes. There were only a few that I would consider using (one of which I had for free from the newspaper.) Most were drinks. I recently purchased a juicer that accomplishes the same thing, but is easier and better. Unless you're willing to not eat solid food for the 21 days, I would not consider this book.

I followed it to a \\"T.\\" Since going off, not only have gained all the weight back where there used to be muscle, but I have developed cardiac arrhythmia due to an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolytes such as Potassium and Sodium were completely depleted during the detox through the use of distilled water, enemas, colonics and total lack of nutrition. Such amino acids regulate many things, including heartbeat. I urge anyone who is contemplating this detox to reconsider.

And they never really tell you what to do. There are clues throughout the book - but you really have to look for them. A friend did this diet and she looks unbelievable and feels unbelievable. After 2 days my gag reflex wouldn't stop. The upside is that any other way of eating to benefit your health after this one is pure bliss! I haven't cheated on my new diet in 3.5 weeks.

There are some good pointers on juicing your fruits and vegetables, but that is only a small part of this plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a waste","review":"Don't waste your time. It is just a big sales and marketing pull to the website which then wants you to buy product. There is no concrete \\"fasting\\" plan at all and there is a very heavy emphasis on religion so you should know that if that makes you uncomfortable. Again this book should lay exactly a plan to do the fast but it does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic.","review":"This book could have been written in a more organized manner. Also, the diet is better as a weekend detox, than a three-week diet as most of the people who do it for three weeks feel weak and dizzy. The author claims they feel weak and dizzy because of past issues; I doubt that. Most people feel week and dizzy from NOT EATING. I don't think people that have to work will be feeling well and there might be some sick days used up from this nutty diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible, Unsustainable, and Dangerous","review":"Of course you'll lose weight if you follow this plan. You're eating about 500 calories a day, and that's if you gorge on soup.\\"Dr.\\" Roni advises people to eat no protein and no fat for 21 days, plus consume dangerously high levels of Vitamins A and K. This is DANGEROUS.The weight you lose will go right back once you start eating 2000 calories a day, like most humans are supposed to.Is this why you're supposed to do this once a year--to take off the weight again? Gaining and losing 20 lbs a year is terrible for your body, especially your skin. It will cause wrinkles and loosen the elasticity of your skin.I gave it two stars instead of one because some of the tea recipes are useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This is a good primer guide for juicing but there are better ones out there.

I didn't buy it to have to buy another book or $200 of DeLuz's products so I could follow the plan! Honestly, what a rip-off! Great on medical generalizations, but short on facts. I am so unimpressed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the heads up!","review":"I was going to look further into this program. I read an article in the November 2008 issue of Essence magazine.

I'd like to thank those of you that gave an honest opinion and kept me from wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting and Dangerous Cash in","review":"Okay folks, I cant understand how these quick cash ins for dollars keep selling. Just a little hint but if you come across any \\"diet\\" program that mentions losing more then 2.5lb a week it does not have your health or body in mind in the least. I have seen so many folks destroy their gallbladders, health and skin by rapid weightloss that does not give you time to learn problem eating and excerise habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"21 Pounds in 21 days","review":"The information was incomplete and not consistent with the program as described on Oprah (I think, some talk show). It took my digestive system 6 months to get back to normal functioning even following their instructions.

I'm not happy at all with the program but I've learned to LOVE juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I found nothing of value in this book. It is simply a rambling series of claims about nutrition and new age treatments not backed up by a single shred of scientific or medical evidence that I can see. The plan is totally impractical unless you have no problem scheduling weekly colonics and coffee enemas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Waste of Money","review":"I didn't have to read too far into the book to realize I just threw money out the window to buy it.

Hyman's approach is very doable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I have no doubt that if one followed all the author's suggestions and bought all her supplements this plan would work. However unless you have a lot of time , (to get colonics and give yourself enemas) as well as money (to buy all the additional products you need to follow the daily menu plan) then I do not think this plan is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooook","review":"Giving this book one star because you mistakenly thought it was a recipe book is ridiculous. Why would the author put a bunch of recipes in the book when the whole point of the detox diet is NOT EATING (or at least, not chewing)?? this book is exactly what it claims to be, instructions on how to do the Martha's Vineyard 21-day detox plan. I was excited the minute I started reading it, because it really sounds like you don't have to be starving and tortured throughout the whole diet! frequent drinking and variety means you won't constantly be thinking about what you're missing. Today is the first day of my detox and I am so excited to start seeing results! I highly recommend this book to people who know what they're getting into - this isn't your typical diet book, don't expect it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"No response to E-mail","review":"I would not recommend purchase the products. The cleansing system arrived with no instructions or guide to follow. The cleansing system was over $200.00. I purchased the book and still had questions. I e-mailed Dr. Ronnie requesting specific instruction and to get my questions answered, she nor her staff responded. Steve Harvey promotes the cleanse, I'll bet she responded to him. I wound not recommend this cleans system for that reason. I expect a return response when spending that much money."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only there were an American version","review":"That's the only drawback. We have trouble relating to some of these statistics because they're British or generally Eurocentric. On the other hand, all the adjectives on the cover are true. There are many eyebrow-raising facts, of both the pleasant and not-so-pleasant sort, like the humbling kind. Try the percent of people worldwide who have never made a telephone call, or the percent of people in India who have never heard of the USA.This is a great book for anyone. As a math teacher, I leave the numbers blank and ask my students what they think. The only one for which they were generally dead on was the number of Americans who are injured by shopping carts per hour. Makes for some interesting discussion, and definitely some perspective. Could there possibly be an American version in the works? If so, the 5th star for the rating is on its way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much for the money, and other sources","review":"I bought this book while trying to buy another book called Numbers. When I saw my error, I thought it might be fine as I like these types of numbers. But, at 96 pages, thin, not much per page, I returned it even though I lost money doing it. Pretty weak. The Harper's Index from Harper's Bazaar magazine gives you about as much per issue. And has a book. And is more compelling generally. Not my vote for a great use of money, though a few nice number twists are in here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie does not offer Amazon appeal.","review":"I bought this movie because I find muscular women attractive and exotic. This movie featured a very fit character, named Ravinhawk, but it did not meet my needs.There is only one scene where the beautiful Ravenhawk flexes her muscles, and it's breif. Moreover, her back is turned and it's during the night, so you don't get a very good look at her sexy back.There is no nudity, and the movie is poorly made. The story seems unbelievable, and does not really come full circle. Scenes where she beats up much smaller and weaker men with her bare hands would have made this movie much better.Don't buy this movie if you want to see a lot of female muscles. Sorry guys, it's a let down that way. I recommend Skin Deep for those needs, though that's only a breif scene too, but it's revealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"RavenHawk - Silence is Golden","review":"Rachel Mclish is totally AWESOME!!! Rachel reminds me of a Greek Goddess. She packs a punch in this movie. Although, her lines are few theirs lots of action. She doesn't really need to say much. The movie is not only avenging her murdered parents, but about government corruption, special interest, collusion, and a toxic waste site on Indian Land.Rachel, sophisticated,cool,calm,& collect, gets the job done as she eliminates the competition, or should I say SCUM. Payback, is much deserved. Way to go, Rachel!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravenhawk, excellent","review":"I normally do not enjoy movies that are full of conflict and at first I chose not to see Ravenhawk. But I kept coming back to the movie and reading the back of the box for the plot and decided to take a chance that this might have a moral message. I was extremely impressed with the plot and the way that the individual characters were portrayed. You could relate to the feelings of the lead character and understand her pain and depth of her feelings. It was very well acted and the actions scenes where realistic and all neccessary to the over all plot. There was no wasted action or emotion and all the elements of the movie came together, I thought, to give it a well rounded look at all sides of the issues. Even if you do not enjoy action movies with fighting you might still enjoy this movie. Especially if you enjoy native american drama that has a strong spiritual and family base message."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least She Looked Great At 40","review":"Well, I think just about everyone agrees Rachel McLish had a much better bodybuilding career than an acting one. In this Class B action film, she's the female equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first action movie, \\"Conan The Barbarian.\\"Of course, Arnold made an incredible career out of his acting and has gone on to bigger and better things. This was it for Rachel, acting-wise. Oh, well, at least she was a two-time Ms. Olympia winner.To McLish's credit, she looked good in the film which was made when she was about 40 years of age. How many 40-year-olds do you know are in the shape this woman was here? And, in her defense, the person who wrote the dialog for this film didn't help her out much. The screenplay is really lame. Not many actresses would look good with dialog this dumb.Basically, what we have here is another simple revenge tale, and not one that is well-done. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love muscular women: this movie was a let-down.","review":"&#65279;I am an admirer of buff and muscular women, which is why I bought this movie. Ravenhawk did not deliver the goods for me. Besides being a bad movie, there is nothing that capitalizes on Ravenhawk's beautiful muscles and wonderful build.There is only one scene where you get to see the very beautiful and muscular hero flex her ripped back, and it's brief. In addition, it's from the back and during the night, as she stands near a fire.This movie would be better if it featured her beating up much smaller and weaker men with her bare hands. It could also be improved if there was nudity, and scenes that concentrated on her flexing and working out.This movie isn't revealing at all. I recommend Skin Deep (staring John Ridder) for a scene involving a very ripped female bodybuilder.Sorry fellow lovers of ripped and buff babes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think.....","review":"Just a reminder to those who are planning to buy this book... this book is somewhat like a notebook.

Nice way to treat customers. I can't return it because he needs it for school on Monday. To think I paid extra shipping for something that looks like it was taken out of the trash.

I must say this one was probably the most disapointing one I have played though. I have a brand new maxed out system and still experienced problems, even after the patch. I would hope Hasbro takes a little more time to work out the problems before they release another one. As far as they mystery itself, it was just okay. I went through it pretty quickly, and found the ending to be all of a sudden and somewhat disapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"Although it's been almost a year since I've played this game, I still remember that I loved every minute of it! It's hard to find a good, suspenseful game nowadays with such great graphics and storyline. This is a wonderful game for any mystery lover, and especially if you're willing to solve lots of puzzles. Never had a problem loading the game, but it did crash once or twice during game play. I've been waiting for Episode 2 to come out, where is it?! This game is recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Sweet","review":"Great uncomplicated game with decent graphics and just the right amount of \\"spookiness\\". I loved the puzzles which weren't overly difficult to solve and the HINT system was very very good in helping me get over one or two puzzles which did not seem to make sense. The marble-in-the-hole game was a little irritating but all other puzzles were solvable even on a trial and error basis. This game is probably not for people who like complex plots and puzzles but as a game novice I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed when the game ended (a little abruptly!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"I received this game last February for a birthday present.

However, don't buy the House of Shakira because it has nothing to do with the real genuine Shakira. All I received for the cheating price that Amazon charged was a bunch of speed freaks screaming their stupid music. I really take the blame for this rip-off DVD. I and you should be aware of all the different ways that Amazon and Caiman.com cheats, probably thousands of customers. Oh, Yes, Of course there's no way that you can contact Amazon or Caiman by phone and get a refund or exchange and of course, they'll never answer your e-mail.

They do not load in the clips, will not feed through the gun, and when you finally get one to shoot, will not bust!!! They feel like they are made out of spongy rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"Ok im a big airsoft player and these sound like a awsome idea and they are a great idea but they are a horrible product. When I bought these i was exited i got home and loaded my gun which by the way shoots 450 fps. Getting them in the clips was a pain. They arnt even round there like a ovel shape. so i finaly get them in the gun after about a half hour. I shot one bb at the side of my house wich is brick and i was about 20 feet away and the bb hit the wall. Did it explode like real paintballs of course not. I have also heard about people having them break in the gun and jam the gun. That didnt happen to me but im shure it could of. Also when you shoot them they only go about 50 fps. so if u like to waste money this is the product for you. Otherwise i would strongly suggest to NOT buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've seen this one before","review":"Thank goodness I didn't pay much for this book.

Wanted to compare mechanical tracking (this has rollers inside under the ball) to optical tracking- found very little difference. Have read complaints that trackballs hurt your wrists and this is probably true if you don't rest your forearm on the copious extra desk space you'll have because you don't have to move it around. Wish it had a scroll ring (innovation to substitute for scroll wheel) but it's an older model. Kensington makes the best trackballs and the newer versions have scroll rings and optical tracking. The little glass beads inside collect dust, but the ball pops out for easy cleaning. The rubber rollers on this one will decompose over time from age and skin oils so it's more of a collector's item- my newer Kensington optical does the grunt work. Cordless is a more expensive option- maybe someday.Thx..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay more for something better!","review":"I liked the idea of not rolling a mouse around my desk; particularly since i have a laptop and i don't like the track pad at all.The Kensington Orbit was fantastic at first; up and running in seconds, easy to use and feels great in my hand.However, after approx. 3 months use, I find that the left-right action gets stuck very easily and is very hard to start again. Getting the ball out to clean the rollers is easy, but actually cleaning those tiny little rollers is a nightmare, much harder than a normal mouse.Plus, the rubber is so small it is deteriorating really quickly.I discovered the roller itself gets stuck inside the casing and doesn't spring back as it should, so the roller is not touching the ball.In conclusion: you get what you pay for: cheap and nasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy orbit review","review":"I purchased the Kensington Orbit because I have Arthritis in my hands.

You will find a great secret on page 50 when making potato salad.You will also enjoy the descriptive writing these tiny treasures are so famous for.

THis book presents in a very clear light just who the traditional CHinese Boxing MAsters really were and just exactly what their views were and are on the study of CHinese Boxing. Smith is impressed by the subjects of his book, and rightly so, however he dosen't become so engrossed with them that he falls prey to the depths of mysticisim. His observations are informative, educational and at times down right funny.

I think this is by far Smith's best book. I have encountered some criticisms of Smith here and there over the years. I think these are often opinions out of context.

I was really hoping for some inspirational tales of martial arts that would encourage me when I became unhappy with my own progress, but this book completely failed to deliver. The meat of the book is Mr. Smith's stories of his own training in China. In fact, it's not really about his training so much as it is a set of press realeases about the people he met during his training and outlandish stories involving them. \\"Mr. Chan was the greatest <boxer, puncher, kicker, tai-chi master> in <northern, eastern, southern> China.

I just bought another one. Material feels strong (but we will see). It is low profile which I like. Only other draw back is when you close the silver clamp it can be difficult to open it again due to the lack of space between the silver levers (as pictured).

For those who were swept away by the power and depth of Roses and by the Celtic instrumentals that album presented, Right out of Nowhere may be a bit disappointing. Also lacking are the songs of eternal love that made her famous. But for all of what this album lacks, it brings forward a sense of hope where others may find despair. The blues riffs are not sad, but steady. Many of the new songs are reminiscent of tracks from Walk the Way the Wind Blows, only greatly matured.

Every argument he makes stands or falls with one lab analysis that very few scholars believe was correctly carried out. Ransom couldn't care less, because that would spoil his story. What happens if this ossuary turns out not to be a modern forgery, but something much more interesting, like a forgery from Roman times, as has been asserted by, ahem, Harvard scholars?

Not only is the GPS reception spotty at best in the woods, it's not much better on the roads with an unobstructed connection to the satellite(s)! Additionally, it often takes at least 10 minutes to link with the satellite. I bought this unit primarily for the GPS functionality. As an experiment I've carried my Garmin Nuvi GPS unit with me on a couple of runs and had no issues with maintaining a link in the woods or on the roads.

This instrument also tells time, but that's it. When skiing in the mountains, it just plain doesn't work. If you bet your life on the gps coordinates getting you back to the parking lot in fog, they would find tour new watch frozen to your inert body. I have a Garmin product that actually picks up satellite signals, this watch does not. Even on a mellow cross country outing, the gps fails 50% of the time, at best. I can't even imagine it working properly amongst high buildings."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS Unit","review":"I really like the fuctions of the watch, easy to use and plenty of options. The one complaint I have is the GPS unit. It doesn't work half the time. I could be out on a country road and it goes out on me. Why, I have no idea. Also, when I place the arm strap through it, the backing of the unit came apart, so I had to go to the belt holder. I wear a fuel belt so it wasn't that big of deal, when it worked of course. I have bought Timex watches in the past and never had a problem with their products, but this one is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a beginner","review":"I really like this watch, as a person who use to run and then stopped and now am going to pick it up again, I've read that this is the tool to use to monitor one's training. The watch is straight forward, as Timex watches tend to be. The only caveat, to me, is the synchronization of the GPS to the watch, I seem only to be able to sync the GPS first, then the heart monitor, not the other way around, but that is no major issue, once all is in sync, it works like a charm. Battery life is as expected for an electronic gadget that one uses, real-world scenario: the more you use it, the faster the batteries will drain, even with that, I would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car adapter for gameboy color","review":"I cancelled my order for this video game.

The only one I could find any emotion for was Jeremy, and that emotion was sorrow.I'm very disappointed. I usually prefer books where the female lead character is a strong warrior woman. But this woman was too hard to like.The story is very slow. After 100 pages, there is no progression towards a future at all. It just stands still.Generally, I can get through a good book in a day or two.

One problem. She discovers her new boss is Vin Makram, a man she crossed swords with when she badmouthed the merchandise in a store he owned. But they put their differences aside very quickly, and very soon attraction flows smoothly. One other problem, Vin is apparently deeply entrenched in a relationship with another young woman, a young woman who's father is instrumental in Vin's business, making Vin look like a gigolo. Its obvious Vin likes Tansy, but he keeps telling her to wait for him, without apparent reason. The truth comes out later, and you really feel for poor Vin, being caught in an impossible situation while the women he loved, Tansy, is right in front of him, but he can't touch her. They have a satisfying reunion, and their romance was very gratifying. I give this a high recommendation.Cyndi"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Harlequin writers","review":"Rarely will you find an author who is as genuine, exciting and as thorough as Leigh. Her characters are always very down-to-earth and likable, making her a good-read, always.This story, set in Thailand, is no exception. She is thorough with her detail, including sights sounds customs and a bit of the basic language when talking about another country that is not English or American. Her character Tansy and Vin are normal, goodlooking people, and there are usually 3rd parties interested in the protagonists, which naturally add to the riot. Her plots are exciting because in the end, she'll throw in another huge plot to offset all the small problems during the whole book.I esp like Leigh's mistaken identity plots, constant verbal sparring and/or her rags-to-riches stories. It always reminds me that you should never judge a book by its cover.

As long as I could tell the difference between characters in a movie or show, it's pretty much fine with me. I am trying to find an apapter to hook it up to the laptop in which in the future i can use internet and especially power point. This would probably be a great cheap thing for a teacher to buy becuase just for power point alone i think it would be great. Now of course you would need it in a very very dark room to get a pretty good image, but even closing the drapes would help somewhat at least to see the image being displayed.

Like I said in the title the DVD player is quite good no skiping or anything like that the first problem is that the door for the DVD is easily opened and sometimes while I am adjusting the image to the screen the DVD door pops open stopping the movie. The body is flimsy and weak made out of thin plastic. The resolution is one quater the amount of any projector just a few hundred dollars more. The room has to be pitch black and even then I have to strain my eyes to see the image in other words the lamp in the projector is very weak. Also as you project on a screen if you sit within five feet of the screen you can no longer see the image but rather the dots that make up the image. for seven hundred dollars or so you can get a cheap projector, dosen't have DVD player but the projector will be twice as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"Wow!

It's annoying to have to keep flipping back and forth. The grid and the clues should be on facing pages.The lessons that go with the puzzles are very brief.

Among the four fittings, every flare face is damaged and scarred. Brass is a soft metal and easy to nick. It is beyond me to understand how otherwise well-make brass fittings could be mishandled (like thrown in a bin during fabrication) when scarring the flare face renders the part useless. Why the flare face matters is because high and low pressure access valves are often used in long term leak down tests. Leaking through nicked up flare faces renders the fitting useless. Are these 'factory rejects' being sold by Amazon? Are these fittings Chinese rejects dumped into US Market? I am not sure what I will do about returning these worthless fittings to Amazon.

This manual is simply amazing. With this manual you can virtually marry any denominational or non-denominational, or revise a ceremony to fit just about any type of marriage.

The \\"On the go\\" CDs are particulary well executed, with bilingual instructions such that the student doesn't have to be looking at the manual when listening to the CDs. They are excellent for those who want to take advantage of their commute time to learn the language. My main complaint is that it doesn't offer quite enough drills.

I am fluent in German, to the extent that I am occassionally taken for a native speaker, have very good french and good latin, but I just couldn't hack it with this book.I can only imagine that it is due to the approach. Where other language courses start by giving you a few nouns and a few verbs & make them into stilted & unnatural sentences, this one throws you striaght into natural conversations - but they seemed just too complex for a beginner.The course does look very good though, with a large, well laid out book & all of those CDs.

I highly recommend it!","review":"I've looked at a few Japanese books that are confusing, doesn't explain things thoroughly, and hard to understand, but this book is really helpful.

The book editor needed to reel in the author's desire for boring, non-essential details of the characters' lives that neither moves the story forward nor gives insight into the character arcs. This is not the era of Dickens. You need not worry about getting paid by the word. If I were the editor, I would cut the middle, because the beginning and the ending were quite good.

The cd rom that is included with the text is also very good, especially when reviewing. It catagorizes your weak areas and also gives you the correct answer, with rationalization. I took the cd rom test before reading the book, and then again, when I had finished the book. I found my score improved using the Kaplan strategies about 33%.

I don't remember what the weight was, but I believe it was about half of what the product listing claimed. Shipping charges for this item were based on weight if I recall; so by claiming double the actual weight, I was charged double for the shipping.

Truly, it's beautiful, and combined with the science-fiction/occult plot, makes an excellent manga. If there's any fault in this book, it's the way that the story itself takes a back seat to the artwork. Once you finish, you'll realize that the plot itself would have been merely two or three chapters in a written novel.However, this is typical of CLAMP, and while the plot is slower to develop because of this, this doesn't mean it's not worth it.

How corny is it to begin with a paragraph of bad puns or to assume that whatever Joyce wrote in his fiction can be applied to his biography? If Dedalus said his mother smelled better than his father, is it fair to say that of Joyce without even a source attribution? You might as well stick with the man himself, though if you really want a biography, invest the time in Ellmann's masterpiece or search for Scholes's brief In Search of James Joyce. I can't see that O'Brien brings much to the party."},{"rating":"1","title":"increasingly disappointing","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, that while this series Penguin Lives series looks so promising on paper that it is becoming increasingly disappointing, particularly this book. It tries too hard to be a novel and employs too many literary tricks and devises to pull it off as even a short biography. As a real biography nut I have been following both the Penguin Lives series and the Lives & Legacies series by the Crossroad Publishing Company. While the Lives & Legacies series does not tout the big authors this series does, the writing is exellent and in just 192 pages they manage to include the backmatter, that as a reader of even short form biography want and expect. Really, this series is worth checking out. Admirably as well, this series supports both new and established authors. First, that's rather rare these days in the publishing world; and second, it's great to hear some new voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Purchased Lollia handcreme for a Valentine's day gift.

Each of the four represents a different outlook. Anna supports the Roosevelt administration whereas Jonathan sees FDR dragging America into an unnecessary war. Berthe is horrified by Nazi excesses while married to a loyal German submarine commander who becomes more and more hardened as the war drags on. Their lives become entwined against a background of world events set in Washington DC, Spain and Germany. Fleming uses this drama to explore the allies insistence on unconditional surrender and the effect on the course of the war. It is a very readable sprawling drama of politics, love, and war that delves into the daunting question of the effects of President Roosevelt's diplomatic policy with Germany and Russia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they had more coming...","review":"MP3 is a great album...if you like Marcy Playground. Fortunately, they are one of my all-time favorites. Way cool sound, nice mix of electric and acoustic and subjects that everyone relates to at one point or another in their lives. John Wozniak is a musical genius! \\"Jesse Went To War\\" is probably my favorite track on this album... not just for the lyrical content, but for the music behind John as well. So far, John Wozniak is working to release a solo effort of sorts, so I think that's the metamorphasis of MP for us fans still playing these albums over and over again.

They are trying to go for a new sound here, more harder, and in many cases end up coming off like Nirvana wannabes. Hotter Than the Sun is the only great track, with Deadly Handsome Man certainly good but not exceptional. Many of the lyrical \\"stories\\" Woz puts in here sound forced and highschoolish to me. I would MP3 a few songs and wait for their next album, hopefully a return to the style of their first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's missing...","review":"I love Marcy Playground, but even after multiple plays this album is not as good as their previous two. I don't know the make-up of the band enough to know if it is the departure of one of the original three members, or if they are just stuck in a rut (some of the songs almost seem like the same concept, like \\"Rock and Roll Hero\\", \\"Punk Rock Superstar\\", and other lyrics that make you think of High School).

The self-titled debut, as well as Shapeshifter, had some of the best music of this genre. This album picks up right where they left off. While the influence Nirvana had on MP is huge, they were never content to solely rely on it. They do have a tendency, on some songs, to lean heavy on the drama (\\"Jesse Went To War\\", \\"Flag and Finger\\", \\"Death of a Cheerleader\\") but the music is so good, one tends to overlook the cheese. Highlights include \\"Blood in Alphabet Soup\\", \\"Punk Rock Superstar\\", and the single \\"Deadly Handsome Man\\". Also check out \\"Paper Dolls\\", which in my opinion is one of the best, most fun, songs they've ever recorded. Love this album immensely. MP, don't ever leave! Everyone else, buy it.

Brown himself was a horsethief, a murderer, and a meglamaniac. Among the evidence found on his person was the constitution of the \\"new republic\\" he would usher in after Southern whites had been slaughtered by his army of freed slaves, naming himself as the new provisional president.

It reveals a part of OSS history that is not often explored in detail. The contributions of women to the wartime efforts of the OSS are impressive.I did not find the book easy going, though. There is no narrative. It's a string of anecdotes, often told backwards or sideways. The author skips around from telling us where the woman was from to telling us where she lived after she retired, then throws in a bit about what she did in the war, then skips to her husband's story, then back to the war, then maybe back to her early schooling. The reader is left dangling when important bits of the wartime history are simply omitted. Some stories are told in a way that only a WWII OSS enthusiast could make any sense out of them.I wish it had been better.

The patriotic tone may turn off a few people. And, before an Amazon troll steps in and tells me I can't rate something if I haven't read it the whole way through, well, you're just flat out wrong.

Frankly, I totally enjoyed this book. I would rank \\"The Raft\\" as my all time favourite mainly because it appealed to me at that time, being a teenager then. The thing that caught me most with this book is the way that the plot developed from an apparent simple situation and escalated to one of extreme terror. The monster or whatever it was somewhat strange but likeable also. \\"Survivor Type\\" really, really had me.There was something darkly humorous about it, the fact that the character had to resort to feeding off his own body to stay alive.I especially admired this and at the end of the story I found myself laughing, horrible as it may sound.

If you know and like the song this createsa sense of identification with the character.I'm not really sure how you define horror fiction. PerhapsKing has defined his own brand of it. It's sort ofworking-class folk in a world of hidden supernaturaldread.I read this a long time ago. I think the story \\"The Mist\\"was recently made into a film.

It's a shame this one wasn't made into a full length novel as it's sensational.Like in Nightshift there are great stories but also average ones. Other people however think the ones I think are average are great so maybe you will too. I liked The Raft, Uncle Otto's Truck, Cain Rose Up and The Monkey. Telling what each story is about will give away too much of the plot and the surprises you want to encounter. If you liked Night Shift then you'll like this collection.

It's pretty good, especially the one about the Word Processor of the Gods--type in your wish and it does just that. Very creative. The Wedding Gig--written in gangsterese--about a band that plays for some gangster's fat sister's wedding, was worth quite a few robust laughs. The Raft, about a man-eating blob in the lake, could easily be a metaphor for cancer. And that murderous, musical monkey--makes a perfect xmas gift!!! Stephen King shows his talent to write in different styles. Just when you think you've pigeon-holed King, classified his writing, he changes gears on you and shows a totally different modality.

Also, another amazing element of this book is the way it does not rely on gore, violence, or serial murderers, but rather on the strange and supernatural hidden behind our most treasured things.

The site also says free super saver shipping but charges $50 and there is no way around this. Additionally, you cannot place anything on the toilet tank because it is not flat.

Its a relationship movie or a long public announcement on what womenshould not do with a relationship (and the type of guy to avoid).Also, Amazon needs a rating that is NO STARS.

Other reviewers have covered all the defects of this film in better and more detail than I will here. Suffice it to say it's boring, tedious, and silly.

If this movie had a plot, a script written by a competent writer, a director who wasn't asleep at the wheel, and actors who had studied somewhere besides the local community group, it might have stood a chance.

If it is not going to be a special relationship or a special story then I fail to see the point of making this type of movie. If the rest of the movie had been fun or easy to watch it wouldn't have been so bad. This could have been an inspiring love story even with the tragic ending, but instead it was depressing, uninspirational and boring and after spending all that time sitting through it, I was at the very least expecting a happy ending and I didn't get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic love story....","review":"This is one of the best and my top favorite love story around. It is just amazing in so many ways. The journey Emma and Dex go through is very complicated, but original. Some comments talk about not feeling the chemistry, or that you don't know what has happened each year following the day they met, I think that is one of the best advantages of the movie is it really pushes you to use your imagination. Even if you have no imagination it hits on the highlights or their lives, marriage, death, jobs, relationships, good times, and hard times. If Emma and Dex started dating after they met, the relationship would have failed fast. It is epic that they become an item much later in life when it was right for both of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Day","review":"Blossoming superstar Anne Hathaway put on her sometimes iffy British accent once again for this romantic drama based on one of my favorite recent novels of the same name. The film follows friends Emma and Dexter over the course of 20 years, beginning with the day they meet and checking in on the same date every year. As the years pass, the pair naturally come to realize they may have been perfect for each other all along. Despite a solid cast, good source material to draw from, some interesting narrative elements, and the fact that director Lone Scherfig's last effort was the multiple Oscar-nominated An Education, One Day failed to resonate with me. I simply felt the film lacked the emotion, depth, and insight that made the book such a hit. This is a risky venture, possibly suitable only for the most diehard of romantics."},{"rating":"1","title":"one day","review":"90 minutes of stupid decisions and self destruction.

I was so disappointed I had to force myself to get through the entire movie. The accents are so horrible, so fake. The only thing I liked was the scenery of the countryside.

There is some romance, but you have to go through an awful lot of crap before you actually get to the good part, which is roughly in the last 20 minutes of the movie. And then, the good part is extremely abrupt! Suddenly, I was shocked to learn that there is a twist that turns this film into a tearjerker! I don't really want to sit there on a plane, crying over some sad movie. It had some good points, but I think they should put a warning on it that it's not all sunshine and roses. I might have still watched it at another time, but it would have been nice to know what I was in for because I'm not one to purposefully watch a sad movie. So my advice: watch at your own emotional risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler alert...Started out good, plodding along, then","review":"Good happens again, then Spoiler....are you serious, the protagonist dies like that!!!

Sorry I thought this was a downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"First of all, I didn't read the book on which the movie is based, so my judgment of the film is based simply on the film itself.I get the whole premise that we are seeing only a \\"slice of life\\" in the lives of this couple--one day each year. And yet, I felt like I missed something important that must have happened during the intervening 364 days. Throughout, we hear them say what good friends they are, but I'm left scratching my head as to how they became friends. Much less how they fell in love.On a more positive note, the lead actors are beautiful people and it was nice watching them. Umm...that's about it.Seriously, don't waste your time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Funny dialogue, if you can hear it.

Fell far short of a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Day....One Star....","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I enjoy watching Anne Hathaway and love a good romance. From the start it looked pretty good and the premise of their first (remembered) encounter in July 15 1988 and peeking in on the same date through the years was a an interesting idea. Somehow, the movie seemed likable but disjointed, as you only had a bit of insight into what had happened the entire year before. I found it especially hard at the end to feel anything but disappointed. My husband and I both looked at each other, shook our heads and said nearly in unison \\"Worst movie, EVER\\".Overall, I am not quite sure who may like this movie, like I said I enjoy a good romance, but this just isn't one I could recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Could this translation be any worse?

This thoroughly Victorian volume was one of 50 books in the Sacred Books of the East Series which Legge (and Max Mueller) translated into quaint missionary English. Legge's work lies entirely in the public domain, can also be found at Project Gutenberg, and in modern history is one of those antique but praiseworthy free texts that find themselves constantly dragooned into electronic book readers. There are several excellent modern translations of the Tao Te Ching, written by scholars for whom Classical Chinese is, as it were, an open book. Not recommended. Legge's missionary style is occasionally prudish or even deliberately obscurantist, although for the time and place it stands as a monumental beginning in Western sinology."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"After downloading this and beginning to read it, I thought \\"Wait, did I open the right book?\\" Really, it is that bad.

If you are new to running or have never considered the idea that there is a spiritual side to running or if you are new to the idea of meditation than this hackneyed over wrought phoney-boloney (he claims that the journal passages are actaully from his journal) book is for you. I found it to be fairly contrived. I found it impossible to buy into his journey. It read like an exercise manual for the soul with all the grace and diginity of a photo set explanation of the squat, cold and without life.

The true story is far more compelling in Sonora's own words. Horse lovers will enjoy the book even more than the film, as it concentrates on training the diving horses and the unique personality of each animal. Sonora herself is remarkable, insisting there is nothing difficult or scary about riding a diving horse, even as she describes other girls who were hired but couldn't master the stunt. Even after losing her sight in a diving accident, Sonora never considers quitting. Her obvious love for her horses is the perfect answer to anyone who may suspect the horses were abused, or forced to dive. Sonora says the horses enjoyed performing, and the reader believes every word of her honest memoir.

The reason I say this is that in a few places Stanley's formalism, which is entirely appropriate for professional exposition, actually obscures the underlying simplicity of the mathematical ideas.

To me they represent everything cool about rock n' roll. Good style, smart lyrics, a bit mystical, and above all else, rockin' songs. Something good to crank when you're cruisin' down western highways in your convertible. This is about as good as one disc could be, and I'm really happy it contains \\"The Witch\\" from the \\"Cool World\\" soundtrack. Don't know any Cult songs? Imagine The Doors mixed with Danzig and a dash of Cinderella. Well...something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compilation from an overlooked band","review":"This CD brings back a lot of memories, the Cult is one of those bands who blends material from other bands exceptionally well, while sounding completely original in the process. Most of the time they're combining AC/DC and Led Zepplin, sometimes shamelessly, fortunately none of that is apparent on this CD.She Sells Sanctuary still sounds as fresh as it did when it debuted in 1985 (heard the Nissan Sentra commercial?), Edie (Ciao Baby) was the first heavy metal tune to use an orchestra, and Fire Woman put them on the map.

But anytime someone mentions The Cult, they describe them as an awesome, often overlooked band from the 80's. Therefore, I'm going to refer to them as \\"overrated\\". This album, even though it contains the band's supposed best work, doesn't do much for me. The one song on the album that is definitely a classic is \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\". That song is the only reason I gave this album a second star. All of the other material is standard hard-rock fare. I've heard many other bands that sound just like, or better, than The Cult. Many people would argue that's because The Cult were \\"trend-setting visionaries\\". I disagree; there were many bands slamming out hard rocking music with a country-esque flair long before \\"Fire Woman\\" hit the airwaves. If you want a flavorless taste of hard rock, go with The Cult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Cult The Singles 1984-1995 - Good...","review":"Pure Cult The Singles 1984-1995 is a good addition for anyone that is forming a \\"Music that I will be listening to 20 years from now\\" library.

Once again, rather than just another dungeon crawl, there is an unforeseen plot afoot that the players will become embroiled in and will need their wits about them in order to dig their way out. And most likely the players will at some point question whether they can succeed against immense odds. It was the most fun I had as a player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy customer","review":"Scale should never be sold as a hand held scale. Buttons on it are dented, light goes off so fast.

I am also a fan of the comic books that have been written as novels (I've read the death of superman, a couple of spiderman books, and golden's first book in his x-man trilogy) and I've found most of them to be excellent. Especially the X-titles. But this book just didn't have it. The characters were never developed (they spent most of the time moping around), the plot was weak. The drawings were good though. There just didn't seem to be a purpose to this story. I know the authors can do better work, and I hope to see them do better in the future. This book makes me want to only read a comic-book-turned-novel if it has Chistopher Golden's name afterwards. But, if they write another X-book, I'll give them another try.

This album is the best collection of great romantic opera arias of the french repertoire that I have ever had in my vast collection of 3500 recordings.

It is not too expensive, but offers hours of fun. The concept is to build an amusement park in all types of landscapes and obtain a certain goal.(1,200 guest with a 600 or higher park rating in 4 years for example.It is fun building your own design and watching it run. You choose from 12 different styles, as well as other rides such as Swinging Ships, Ferris wheels etc.The game is very easy to beat but it takes a while to beat all the levels. But once you do you reac the MEGA PARK scenario.I have long beaten the game, yet there are some differences. In real life you have to pay alot more interest for the bank, rollar coasters cost millions not thousands, rides do not \\"break down\\" as often, and rides hardly ever have crashed, and you are going to pay your staff more than $35.00 a month.Yet it s still one of my favorite games.

The only violence is if you accidentally drown a guest or staff member by removing the footpath out from under him, so he falls into the water. Or if you crash a rollercoaster with people on it.

Unbelieveable - and quite challenging too.But really, the best part is making the rides blow up...try it with \\"Whoa Belly\\", and set the launch speed as high as possible, and then watch the metal fly.

I have incountered a few minor problems, therefore a patch is still not in a \\"must need\\" basis. If you think this is really boring then let me sum it up to this. If you like ok graphics and a complex, hard to understand game, then go with Sim Theme Park. If you like a game with ok graphics, non-stop action and an overall fun and addictive game, definatly go with Roller Coaster Tycoon.

I have written computer games and programs (as a serious hobby) for about 15 years. The design of this game is unbelievable - nicely detailed graphics, incredible sound effects of coasters and carnival music and people laughing and screaming on the coasters, and very addictive gameplay - it is so much fun, and so many hours fly by while you are totally immersed in it. I disagree with the guy who says the interface isn't so great - it's just fine and once you get the hang of building your own roller coasters (which you don't have to do until you're up to it), it is really amazing what you can do.

I love this game so much, that I have all 3 games of RCT.Also guests that can't handle the big rides can choose from many other amusing rides, such as a carousel and sometimes guests can vomit all over your pathway if the nausea on the roller coaster is 2 high.

It requires the right amount of skill and gives 50+ hours of fun. A wide variety of pieces to use makes your theme park the best. The idea is to gain money. You need good rides to do that. But it isn't all about crazy rollarcoasters that make dudes hurl. It is an attraction for the whole familly which makes sissy rides for infants nesscasary. Plus you will need stores, snack boothes, restrooms, and more to stay in business. This game is fun for the whole familly. The only major con is that the game is a bit slow. But it is still a great game. I recommend this game to all gamers who like to look at picture perfect graphics and are willing to put a lot of time into a game. 4 out of 5.

Designing an extravagant theme park or creating the ultimate rollercoaster is great, but it's no easy task. Since this game is a real time strategy game, it's about using the resources available to achieve certain objectives, wich isn't a big problem because it gives some meaning to the game, but, as many people complain about, RCT has no free editor that would alow you to creat an extravagant theme park or the ultimate roller coaster without having to worry about getting kids into your park to take their money. That, along with the fact that it's somewhat time consuming and tedious to complete some of the scenarios, keeps this game from being truly great, because it is extreamly playable and quite fun.

I don't know if my laptop is the problem or the disk. I'm still trying to figure it out. Other than that, the game is simply amazing. You control everything. You handle ride speeds, research and development, and garbage can placement. You have to deal with bank debts, lost guests, vandelism, crashed rides, and business quotas.

Take my advise: BUY THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addiction!","review":"If you have a job, kids, spouse, or anything else that requires your time, I do not recommend you purchase this game. IT IS ADDICTING! Your free time is gone! You will be dreaming of new Roller Coaster designs in your sleep and bending paper clips at work to look like your latest creation! Chris Sawyer is a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the addiction","review":"This game is incredible! I am in competition with my 11 and 9 year old sons for the best theme park. So far, they are in the lead. I stay up after they go to bed to try to beat them. This is a great game for youngsters and adults. It beats the blood and guts of many other games. The thrill really is becoming the tycoon. I highly reccommend this game for anyone. If you have the time and desire to find and explain to the youngsters about some minor grammatical errors, the game is even more worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I've been playing this game for a long time and it stopped working on my old computer so i ordered the game.

Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"From A Tycoon Fanatic!","review":"This game has it's ups and it has it's downs.UPS: It is so much fun. Me and my brother play it all the time. I just bought the Loopy Landscape 1 and it has a whole new twist 2 it. It has a park where you have unlimited cash. If you haven't bought this game, you r crazy!DOWNS: It takes 2 long for the people to create the rides. In the unlimited cash 1, my guest will get all mad because i have boring rides and i'm like \\"Just hold on while people make better rides you little ...!Besides all of that, this game is good. You should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Game Person","review":"This is the best computer game I have ever played. I'm really not into computer games but this thing is really addicting. I had to take some time off work to play more...lol. I recommend it to everyone. I bought the 2nd CD adder for it 2 days after owning this. If your the type of person that likes model trains, this is the game for YOU. This game is like a computer version of model trains except with every theme park ride and appurtenance you can imagine, tunnels, bridges, landscaping, everything and you get to build every track ride they have, track by track, trestle by trestle, or you can use some off the shelf rides. I played immediately without opening the book. Its even easier if you sit back and watch the visual tutorial before you jump in and start punching icons. Truely awsumb program, no wonder its a best seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do not play games very much but I love this one","review":"My brother introduced me to this game over Christmas and I can't put it down. I love it! The sounds of the people screaming on the coasters to the sounds of the toliets flushing only add to the lifelike realism of this game.Your creative talents are also put to use as well. From building your first coaster to designing the layout down to the last light post.After I complete my park and have accomplished my objective, I like to observe everyone having a good time at the park I just created.A really good time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sim games made!","review":"This is a great game! If you've never played it here is a brief description: You own a theme park. You build the rides, bathrooms, etc. to satisfy your guests. As more people come to your park the more money rolls in. Once you get good at it you can stop using pre-built roller coasters and make custom ones. But don't make them too scary or people won't ride them. When you run out of space for your theme park, buy some more rides and stuff.I also have some pro's and con's about this game:Pro's:1. Unlimited possibilities let your mind wander. 2. \\"Real-life gameplay\\" tests you to your fullest extent. 3. Make your park better and better so you become richer and richer.Con's:1. To get people to ride the rides you have to make these confusing, hectic walkways. 2. If you make a ride to scary, no one will ride it. 3. Gameplay goes on forever so you can get bored easily after a long while.But if you are the type that get's interested in this kind of stuff, this games for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PC Cocaine!","review":"This game is not only awesome, but probably one of the most addictive games ever made (along with Tony Hawke Pro Skater, Sim City, Diablo II, Rogue Squadrain, and The Sims). I really enjoy this game, because it is amazingly fun. The only problem is that you don't actually get to ride the rides, personally. That would be ULTIMATE. If you love emusment parks or ever wanted to design roller coasters, this is amazing. Trying to make the worlds greatest amuzment park is the best high. I deffinately recommend this to others. Just make sure you don't play it too much, or you'll need to go to some kind of Rehab program...Just kidding. But it is very, very, very fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Roller Coaster Tycoon Good......

It is very creative not only from the coputer programers point. It is the same for the person that wants to creat a theme park. I also have the expantion pack call corkscrew follies this make the game that much more fun. There are one or two small problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly addictive, a great game.","review":"This is quite a fascinating game. A great amount of thought and detail went into this game, from the fact that you can build your own rides (or choose from many premade coasters, thrill rides and gentle ones) to the fact that you've got to maintain a fleet of handymen to keep sweeping up the vomit! You proceed through scenarios with a goal set for you to complete, the terrain is interesting and you'd be amazed at how quickly time flies when you're playing! Excellent work! You can also download new rides all the time from their website and visit the Ride Exchange if you don't like to build your own, there are limitless realistic rides to be built and there's a huge following that this game has picked up... and for good reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This game is one of the best out there. You dont need a supercomputer. In fact this is one game where the requierments will let it run just fine. Pros: very addictive, fun, realistic, low requierments. Cons: very easy, time consuming(there are time limits, but you need to wait until the time expiers-very annoying). Overall this game is well worth the money, expesaly if you buy loopy landscapes (the expainsion)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a game!","review":"This game is so much fun I play it too long.I would give it ten stars if possiable.I request anyone with a computer to buy this game and its add-on pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun...for a few weeks","review":"This game is so addcitive, or should i say WAS ADDICTIVE.

The game is well designed and set out. It has an excellant pedigree (Transport tycoon) and has the same attention to detail. I love the scenery, there is little to compare with creating your own ancient city, complete with super intense rollercoaster! The levels are well set out, and take the right amount of time- one or two evenings of solid play, not weeks. The only problem I have is the interface: in my version it does not let you keep certain construction windows open at the same time, but all this is compensated for by a thoroughly entertaining game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"With a huge amount of scenarios and even more if you get the expansion pack, this will keep you entertained for hours. Just be careful desigining the coasters. I built one that had an intensity of 17+ and had you pulling 5 lat. g's. There's definitely a learning curve, but it's fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem among Gems","review":"Being rather new to computers, I was skeptical at first when purchasing this game, however I was pleasantly suprised.Once you sit down at your computer you never want to get up. Whether you are new to computers or a computer pro you are guided through the various aspects as you advance along each level.Also you have simply got to purchase The Corkscrew Follies Game to interface with the original.With both games in tow, you can count on plenty a sleepless night ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the best!","review":"I bought this game a long time ago and it's really great. The onlydraw back is you get so addicted and spend a lot of time on it. It's really fun, has amazing graphics, and you'll enjoy making your own roller coasters....it's a blast to design your own and see how people react to it. Anyway, everyone should invest in this program because it's great and every time i'm on it i have to ask myself how the technitions came up with it. It's brilliant...you'll have lots of fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"This is a very good game. I used to play this game for hours on end. It's a lot of fun. The best part about it is that you don't need to have a supercomputer to play it. For those of you who's computers can't handle RCT 3, buy this game.

You have a goal on each park to beat it. It has great roller coasters.

As annoying as that was, i thought it was isolated.NOT. Now we leak everywhere. My daughter can go from a totally dry diaper to suddenly leaking from everywhere in just one single, tiny pee. Yesterday she went from being dry to having wet pants and a wet stroller in just one go.I'm taking the unopened boxes back to Target. We're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked them before but they started to leak","review":"We've been using huggies for the past year and really liked them, until the last 2 shipments. For some reason the diapers leak on the sides, as if the elastic was loose, but the diapers are on securely. We haven't changed the way we put on the diapers, and I noticed that the diapers we have now seem thinner and also the elastic is not as tight as ones from previous boxes we got. Will definitely be trying another brand after we finish this box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Pampers to us...","review":"We have tried all of the major diaper brands and keep coming back to Pampers. I found that the Huggies brands don't fit as well, don't hold as much and leak more than Pampers. My son is very tall for his age and Huggies don't have as much stretch or as the side tabs that let me really get the diaper wrapped as well around his waist as Pampers do. They make them sound good, but we did try them again recently (I had a coupon and we were broke!) and I was disappointed. The front has one large panel which makes it difficult to wrap around my son's waist well. And they definitely don't hold as much as Pampers do, which is a problem at night. During the day I can change him frequently, but that means we're using more diapers so it costs more in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS ALL THE TIME.","review":"I was so bummed about this product.

I've been using Pampers for 2 years - and I can count the number of leak-through's on one hand. But, at 21 mths & 27 pounds, the Pampers size 4 is too small and size 5 is too big. The Huggies size 4 fits perfect!!! Like a glove..however, we have had a leak-through at least once every 3rd day and EVERY NIGHT!! Bad..might as well not even had a diaper on. Also, we haven't had any diaper rashes since 4mths..she's had one since we started using these Huggies two weeks ago. Want to like them for the fit..but the leaking is making me lose sleep at night all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Rash","review":"My son gets a severe diaper rash anytime we use pampers. We have been using Huggies Supreme natural fit since he was 4 months old. I feel that the Supreme is that much better than the regular Huggies or Kirkland (which is the same as regular Huggies). We have also switched to cloth diapers to save money and use Huggies at night or on the go. I have never had leaks or a blowout with Huggies as I have with many other brands. I would never purchase any other brand of disposable diaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooh Designs Stained Babies Clothes!","review":"I tried these a two years ago with my daughter and hated them because they stained our onsies.

We ran out of onsies a few weeks ago and put him to bed with just the sleeper over his diaper and it is RUINED!

I can have him in my lap with a fresh clean diaper and have a wet lap! These diapers leak at the legs. And don't get me started with outings and constant issues of having to change his jeans shortly after leaving the house! This isn't an issue with keeping a diaper on too long (I'm a prompt changer) but a simple issue of a leaky diaper. Even though it doesn't take rocket science to apply a diaper, I have tried different ways (lower on back, puller up higher in front, snugger around waist) still he leaks.

It contains virtually everything in the right amount in one place--from disease definitions, sensible epidemiological data, pathophysiological processes, health maintenance, etc, etc--to my favorite, the step-by-step management of those familiar conditions.This book does not stretch (read: confuse) your mind with useless minutiae the way Harrison's sometimes does.

The disappointing part is it was all totally in spanish I has to change the settings to watch it in English. And there was a lot of hand motions that didn't belong. And it was like watching an old japanese movie that had been dubbed. Their mouths were moving but the words never matched. I sugest if you care about these things.

How come the Germans and the French have the talented people to make a dub, but all English speaking countries in the world don't?Don't buy this film until an english dub is made.

But that realism is robbed by the choice to dub this movie in English rather than use subtitles. The voice over acting is truly horrible with the voice over actress for the female lead being an exceptionally bad actor. If they'd left the original sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue it would likely be different but as it is with this cheap horrible voice over, it renders the movie unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great. English overdub kills the movie","review":"When I saw the movie in Spanish I was terrified. Granted I was alone, it was a really fun movie to watch in the dark at night. But the English overdub makes the whole thing feel like a joke. It sounds ridiculous and the voice acting makes the movie seem like a comedy rather than the scary movie it was meant to be in Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the dubbed version, watch the spanish version!","review":"[Rec] is a thrilling horror film about a small camera crew documenting the lives of firemen. They end up quarantined in an apartment building when an unknown disease is traced back to that location. The reason you should watch the original Spanish version is because the cast did a great job and you can often hear the fear and panic in their voices; something I don't believe can be easily and effectively captured by a voiceover. Manuela Velasco as Ángela was standout in this film and so was the police officer. The movie has a great introduction, and the thrills start after about 15 minutes with a few breaks throughout the rest of the runtime. I also liked the ending.This is an amazing horror film, packed with thrills and frights up to the creepy ending. I highly recommend a purchase.[Rec] has strong violence and blood. No sex/nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not care for the dub","review":"The dub is simply awful. I tried to watch for about three minutes but the voices were so out of sync and badly matched with the characters I couldn't do it. I just purchased it and feel like I wasted 3 dollars.

I saw this one 2 years ago and just loved it. Very Creepy and very dark Zombie flick. Some will say it's not zombies, it's rabid infected people more like28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition). I don't agree. Regardless, it's a film any Zombie fan should see.Quarantinewas an American Hollywood remake of this film. It looks identical almost frame by frame but for one major issue I had with it. The Zombie, Monster, whatever at the end is not as impressive as the one in REC. I'm not kidding. The Creature at the end of this one is 100% Creepier than what Hollywood could come up with. If you haven't seen either, watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"REC","review":"So Quarantine is not an original film huh? It's a redo or REC. I guess i shouldn't have been shocked, oh well. I watched this and felt like I was watching Quaratine but in Spanish. Yeesh, if your going to redo a film from another country, at least make it a little different no? Rec was good and the final creature at the end was way cooler looking. I really don't know what else to say. I should just copy what i said about Quarantine and paste on it here. Seems like a lot of movies now are either remakes of films from other places or from the 1970 or 80's.I don't know when REC 2 came out, but i found copies of it at Toys n Joys. I watched it a few hours ago with my friend. It takes off right from the end of REC.

The crew believes they have been called out because an elderly woman has fallen, but when they arrive, they discover something terrible; the residents of the apartment complex are becoming infected with a disease that makes them terrifyingly aggressive, with a taste for human flesh. Shot entirely from the point of view of the cameraman, [REC] is a risky experimental zombie flick that pays off with riveting terror. It supplies an all too plausible beginning to a viral apocalypse.The US remake, Quarantine, is good, too, but is almost a shot-by-shot redo of [REC]. My advice is to see the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible phone","review":"I have 2 of these phone and they are like 6 months or so old.

Still the old Sprint internet, not the fast EVDO, no music player, inputting letters/words for texting has a delay, slightly.

All my friends have different providers, and they can understand me clearly, but I cant hear them well, the quality is horrible. There is an echo also, I DONT WANT TO HEAR MYSELF! It looks good.

The orioles love 2 things- live mealworms and grape jelly. When feeding live mealworms the orioles would eat as many as 12-19 worms per visit. Most likely feeding the new hatchlings. The large, fresh mealworms can cost as much as 10 cents a piece at our local Wildbirds Unlimited. Or I would purchase the smaller size live mealworms at $2.75 per 100.In any case the local feed store recommended trying dried mealworms. Whether I feed them dried or rehydrated, the orioles won't have anything to do with them. They will spit them out of the feeder as they search for \\"real, live\\" mealworms.And nobody likes change so I tried repeatedly serving the dried mealworms (rehydrated according to package directions)hoping the orioles would come around to liking them and no luck.

If you read true crime for the thrill of the blood, lust and suspense of a novel you'll be disappointed. What is fascinating about this book is how the system works when there is little hard evidence or motive. But the people involved are interesting as well: the suspect is an overbearing, lecherous creep; the victim a sweet, quiet and submissive wife, with a family history that would make up a different type of crime book. Carlton Smith does a great job of telling the story of Jana Carpenter Koklich, whose disappearance would have made national headlines if it hadn't taken place just three weeks before the horrible events of September 11, 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

I picked this book up around 1997 I think, at Twice Sold Tales in Seattle. I got it mostly to be iconoclastic, I think, and because I was curious about what sort of stories the Russians told themselves about the future. I mean, you get to learn about a culture though its fantacies, right? Isn't that what Thrawn said? I'm afraid it's mostly a dissapointment, I found a lot of the stories to be overly short and simplistic, and I had a sense that I was loosing something in the translation. I'm going to hang on to it though and leaf through it on rainy nights. When you're a kid during the waning years of the Cold War you can't help but have a morbid curiosity about what was going on behind the Iron Curtain and this is an interesting peak at what got past the censors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Practical guide for today's RTL design","review":"This book gives many examples to help immediate application for practical design.

This book is the first book that intensively focuses the synthesis in the user's view; how to desribe design to generate intended circuit. No complicated talk on CAD technology. The discussion on blocking vs non-blocking assignments is also valuable for an advancved understanding on the semantic consistency between synthesis and simulation.This book is a really excellent and practical guide for today's RTL design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic, Long-Lasting, and Strategic","review":"This game is very good and best for Risk players.

Toby gradually loses his macho sex drive when he is appointed investigative detective. Interviews with the victims of these crimes causes Toby to reconsider sex games with his devoted wife Sara. The action in this book is pedantic and frustrating expecially the symbolism of Toby and Sara loading and unloading his cop guns every night.

We all know sometimes we just need something new to watch cause we've already seen all the goods every where else.The fact that this movie can even be compared to or categorized with Hostel or the Saw films is just insulting.

If you want the advantage of \\"1-application\\", the instructions say to insert the tip and squeeze the entire contents into your rectum, thus using the entire tube in \\"1-application\\".The main ingredient is charcoal, so even if you use it like it an ordinary product, you get BLACK EVERYWHERE. UNBELIEVABLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I had high hopes for this product when I read about it... One application - cool! Maybe this will help take care of those painful little buggers. Well, I was disappointed by two things.1) The One-application claim does NOT mean that you'll be cured after one use of the product. What it does mean is that you're supposed to use this ENTIRE tube in one use. Okay, so you'll need to buy multiple tubes to follow their recommended dosage. Very expensive (not to mention messy).2) While it did provide some relief from the symptoms at first, it later became uncomfortable and was a terrible mess to clean up afterward.Save your money. Go to a doctor instead and get the problem solved. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking to the usual over the counter ointments and such.

It then starts blowing dust out the intake, spewing it all over the area just cleaned. The plastic case builds up a static electric charge, causing the dust to stick to the case all over the inside and outside. Cleaning the dust collector is a filthy job and requires the use of another vacuum and a source of compressed air to blow the dust out. By the time it's cleaned out, I end up covered in gritty grime. This piece of equipment is completely useless for its intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I needed to replace my old Dirt Devil hand vac and read all the reviews about hand vacs and finally chose the 100 Classic. Amazon sent it promptly and I was happy...until I tried to attach the hose. The attachment clips onto the bottom of the vac and as soon as I moved the hose it fell off. I asked my 18 year old son to try to attach it and the same thing happened. I called the 800 number enclosed with the machine and after 2 days I finally got to speak to a human. He had no idea what I was talking about. I dont think he even had a picture of the model available.

The new one, however, has lousy suction. That's because the air filter becomes clogged after about five minutes of use. The owner's manual says that you need to \\"periodically\\" tap the air filter to remove excess dirt. It also says you need to replace the air filters every 3-6 months. In my experience, I found I needed to replace the air filters after 30-60 minutes of use. I can't afford that. I'm back to lugging around my full-size vacuum with its attachments."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Junk ! !","review":"This is the third Dirt Devil handheld I have owned. Over the last 10-12 years they have increasingly lowered the quality of their product. This current model is very LOUD, the attachment for the hose is made out of plastic and already broke. What a piece of junk ! ! I made my own strap attachment so I could use it on high shelves in my home; the strap works great, but the exhaust comes out the sides and gets hot while the vacuum rests against my side.The paper filters are expensive and get clogged quickly. This reduces suction. I am sure that is their goal - just keep buying those filters. You can blow the dirt off them and reuse for awhile. My recommendation is to look at other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and inconvenient","review":"For just about any application where I want a handheld vacuum cleaner instead of a canister or upright, I feel I'm better off with an 18V cordless model with a brushroll. It's going to be just as useful for cleaning up cat litter or food spills or vacuuming the stairs or upholstery, plus I can take it to the car (or with the car), and it's so much more convenient not dealing with a power cord. While this product might be more powerful than a cordless, applications where you need the extra power also tend to require more reach (no stooping or getting down on your hands and knees) and bigger capacity.And the noise, OMG. Turn this vacuum on and dogs will howl, cats will hide, flocks of birds will take to the skies, neighbors will bang on the walls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly cheap construction","review":"This model might look like the old Dirt Devil handhelds, but it's nowhere close to the same quality. I've used this vacuum three times. It has the potential to be a great product. But each time I used it, something broke.The whole unit is made almost entirely of plastic, and there are quality issues with the manufacturing and assembly. The tubing for the accessories doesn't fit snugly. The ends of the hoses should all be round, but they simply aren't molded properly. Instead, the wand attachment is oblong and doesn't make a tight seal.The attachment hose snaps onto the underside of the vacuum. It's a bit odd, but the real problem is that the only thing to sealing the two pieces together is a piece of glued-on foam. It started to peel off on day one, and now I've lost about half of the suction.Just today, the dustbin latch snapped off. Three strikes. This thing is headed back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy, but handy.","review":"It's a beast, but it does work well. I got one for my mom this past Christmas. She wanted something to get the dog hair off the furniture, without having to haul out the big vacuum. We have four dogs, so we use it often. And it's worked excellently. The hose attachment isn't great, but will do in a pinch. Overall, we're pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hand Vac but for cleaning out the filter","review":"This Dirt Devil is light weight, the cord is conveniently long, and it does a great job at vacuuming my stairs, which is the sole purpose that I got it for. Yes, it is loud, but I solved this problem by using safety earmuffs. My main gripe is having to spend a good five minutes cleaning out the HEPA filter, which I do each time, after use, to ensure its efficiency. I use a soft toothbrush to clean between the pleats and this works well at getting even more dirt after the initial knocking on a surface, as the manufacturer suggests. Customers wishing to avoid this problem are likely better off getting a hand vac that is not bagless, as this one is. The disadvantage then, is the cost of frequent bag replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in every way","review":"i was excited about this because i had read reviews that harped on it's power with the inclusion of a belt, and because it meant that i didn't have to store a giant vacuum cleaner in my studio apartment. however, i am now very disappointed and this is only the second time i've taken this thing out.the first time i used it, it worked perfectly, but then when it came time to throw out the grime, i was totally disgusted by how intimate i had to become with all that dirt. i had to claw all the dirt out of the rear compartment and the filter. it was like cleaning twice. yuck. but i wanted to give it another shot because it's fast, powerful and compact.today i took it out again, only to find the belt completely slack (possibly broken?) and no movement and no suction. worthless. i'm sending it back. any other suggestions for hand held vacs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working at 2 month mark","review":"I clean out the filter after every use because it works so well.

Unfortunately, I needed a machine that could handle fine wood ash that often ends up on the hearth of my in-wall hybrid wood stove/fireplace. This fine ash clogs the filter almost immediately and the filter is almost impossible to clean. The filter is not washable. So the suction went from very good to very poor. I ended up reselling this machine and buying a much lighter and much more utilitarian Dust Buster with a washable filter that doesn't clog nearly as easily. I'm sure the Dirt Devil would be much more satisfactory for larger particulate dirt but for very fine ash, it failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they change it?","review":"I own an original dirt devil hand vac, but it's on its last leg. I thought I'd prepare myself for the departure and get a replacement. What better way than by getting the improved \\"classic\\" model. Well, It's not what I was expecting. The R&D department missed the mark on this one. The only thing I like about it is the slick look; that's about all it has going for it. Why they got rid of the old bag system, I'll never know. Now, every time I turn this puppy on, I'm emptying it out every 3-5 minutes; and that takes about 3-5 minutes of my time. The hepa filter system should be the way to go, but in this case, it's just a lot of extra work for the consumer. The original hand vac is by far the real \\"classic.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it for pet hair!","review":"This little vac works great on pet hair and I love that you don't have to buy bags... just empty the container at the base after each use.

The last one I owned had the cloth bag, which wold puff a cloud of dust when you first turned it on. With the new bagless design, that doesn't happen. Plenty of power for cleaning the steps or the car, which are the two purposes that I bought it for. The bristles are a little had, so I'm a little afraid of what it might do to thinner materialed furniture. Maybe over time the bristles will loosen up and be usable on the aforementioned.

The French admire and understand these long-lost Scriptures and Leloup uniquely combines mystical insight with scholarly wisdom.

The Forward and Preface are scholarly done and, as usually is the case, the prose requires focused attention to follow and absorb. This was my first exposure to a Gnostic text and I found it very interesting. It also cleared up, in my mind, why gnosticism was not embraced by the majority of the Nicean Convention. I would recommend this book to the student wishing a fuller understanding of the politics at work in the early church. However I pose a caveat to those less secure in their faith. The early church did not simply spring forth in the form we have to day and those convinced that it did will find the book troubling at best. Others will be intrigued by the jostling of opposing viewpoints and opinions, and find that seeing them will deepen their belief that the early church fathers were capable scholars intent on finding the correct course to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless without properly calibrated scanner","review":"In order to calibrate your printer, you have to print and then scan the calibration target. Because of this, your printer calibration will only be as good as your scanner's calibration. Since they don't include a hard-copy target, you have to go to another source to calibrate your scanner. Their tweaking controls are only good if you already paid $$$ to calibrate your monitor.In my case, I bought the Spyder2 for the monitor, downloaded shareware to calibrate the scanner, and purchased a Kodak target to calibrate my scanner. After all that, my printer color is still not close.

The six mini-games are great at capturing that Muppet feel, but they don't do anything with it.

How about pushing the A or B button for 3-4 minutes in time to music? The Payoff? A Heckle from Statler and Waldorf. Hardly something I want to work towards. If these mini-games were part of a larger adventure they'd be enjoyable, but as the main dish, they're just unappetizing. A lot more substance and variety is needed.Younger gamers (ages 4-7) will probaly enjoy this game quite a bit since it has easy controls, is repettitive and the characters are appealing.

The writing was competent enough, but I found it a bit pretentious when it tried to be important. Then, I changed my mind. It is a very uplifting story of two elderly people who are able, as septuagenarians, to grow through self discovery. One of them meets the kind of end most of us would like to meet, with acceptance and dignity, amidst loved ones. I found this book especially heartening as a senior citizen (and as a recent reader of Wallace Stegner's \\"Spectator Bird\\" in which the elderly character views himself as being in a line, getting ever closer to the end as friends in front die). \\"School for the Blind\\" is warm and humorous. While things work out well for several of the characters, McFarland wraps up the plot without being implausible or sentimental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and moving","review":"I have read and re-read this book.

The reader can really enjoy Muriel and Brimm as they confront how they have dealt with their dark childhood and try to grow beyond it, even as they face Brimm's death. I really like the way they struggle to acknowledge painful events and learn from them -- but still not let themselves be completely defined by them. The murder mystery -- I really haven't been able to grasp how that ties in with the rest of the story; it seems tacked on and out of tempo with a self-exploratory novel, but it does fit in with the emotional timbre of the book. Also, involvement in the mystery does give Muriel a chance to be active in the present and to impact her community in a positive way, as she contributes to finding the serial killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this novel","review":"This is wonderful, knowing book.

Mr. Bounce, disturbed by constant uncontrolled bouncing, goes to a doctor (representing the bourgeois rationalist mindset) who gives him a heavy pair of boots to stop him bouncing. But the boots lead to his downfall as an artist - they are so heavy that he crashes through the floorboards.Conclusion: artists should never listen to the advice of the rationalist types who seek to restrain their spirit. It's better to bounce unpredictably than crash through the floor like a ball of lead. But better still is the artist who has learned to CONTROL his bouncing, like Goethe, and that is what Mr. Bounce should have tried to do. Sadly, he chose to listen to a two-bit doctor instead.You may also enjoyTime Struggle 1: The Wolves of Odin (Volume 1)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, fun and easy to read.

It quotes extensively from European esoteric scholars, theosophical thinkers, Buddhist scholars, as well as from Javanese sources. It attempts to undercover the underlying Buddhist culture of the country now called Indonesia, showing that the Islam overlay is a recent phenomena which has not eradicated the taproot of classical tantric Buddhism imported from India. It is also a personal spiritual voyage by the author, with great sincerity and humility. The central focus of the book is the great monument of Borobudur, which was visited and blessed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in the 1980's.

Nor do I want to have baby peeing in a potty all over the house....or on my feet. We set up a little potty next to the changing table in the bathroom.

The pace of the movie is extremely slow and the atmosphere of most of the scenes tend to induce sleep rather than the excitement of that era. Further, there are good people in the cast--as can be seen in E.G. Marshall and Judi Dent--yet this is one of the slowest, least interesting movies I've ever viewed.

Confused, I sent the seller an email asking what had happened and they stated that this book was actually not available. About a week later, I saw the same book from the same seller listed for sale but again, it was not available. At least I received a credit for the purchase price but it was disappointing that the book was not actually available..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my glass slipper","review":"It seems that with Little, Big, one either loves the story (the majority) or is bored to tears by it. I confess I was of the latter class. Little, Big dragged so much in spots with its apparent aimlessness that I found myself thinking that I preferred even Dickens' writing. This rather massive novel is fairly episodic, centering on certain memories of the eccentric people, or their stories; I found the lack of a central theme until the end very irritating. Yes, lovely allusions and interesting eccentric characters and house, but-- surely a stronger central plot isn't too much to ask? What I thought would be a whimsical and delightful fantasy turned out to just be monotonous. I think I'll go back to reading Stardust or The Princess Bride, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.","review":"I heard great things about this, especially from writers that I trust, such as Ted Sturgeon and Ursula LeGuin. My IQ must not be as high as the others on this site, witness the poor star rating. To my mind, this book was very well written but serving no point, like a great big beautiful car with no engine. The story moves rather inventively back and forth through time, for some purpose other than literary showmanship, I imagine. Sorry to be so vague on the inhabitants of Edgewood and Smoky Barnable and Daily Alice and Grandfather Trout and all the other characters that should be memorable but aren't, but this novel is one vague miasma itself. Not that I am impartial to fantasy; another fantasy novel I read earlier this year, Mikhail Bulgakov's Master & Margarita, was far superior to Little, Big in terms of style, plot and theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"new age rubbish","review":"Not really literature, since there is no plot or character development to speak of. Just a lot of cutesy waffling around with a couple characters looking and acting shy and mysterious.Tons and tons of laughably pretentious pseudo-metaphysics are also piled one endlessly here.Vacillates between being cloying and sacharine and heavy and morbid. Like being forced to listen to James Taylor's \\"Sweet Baby James\\" album over and over again for three years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting , magical ....like music for the soul....","review":"It's hard to put into words how gorgeous the writing is in this masterpiece. It was like discovering a captivating portrait in an old attic. The prose is breathtaking, and I re-read many lines, just for the beauty of them.Please don't miss a book this beautiful and poetic, it would be a shame to not have the experience of reading it for the first time! I envy those who are just picking it up for the 1st time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A midsummer night's dream","review":"John Crowley's Little Big is a marvelously well written fairytale set in a bygone America that never was. Generations of the Drinkwater/Barnable clan live in a wonderfully mysterious house in the country whose grounds get larger the deeper you go into them and whose rooms and hallways don't always open into the same rooms and hallways you've entered from. The girls in the family commune with the fairy kingdom that the house is a gateway to, and the boys in the family spend their lives trying to figure out if the fairies are real. These details, and many, many delightful others are somewhat secondary, however, to the wonderful mood of the narrative, a melancholy dream state of the sense of wonder only children can seem to have in a world that in its smallness is the biggest they will ever inhabit. Crowley never hits a wrong note in the best of times and the worst, and the ending is supremely satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most beautiful books I've ever read.","review":"This is, hands down, one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read, and perhaps the only pure fantasy novel I've ever enjoyed on all levels: intellectual, esthetic, etc. Why it's currently out of print is beyond me. This is a book to read, enjoy and keep to read to your children some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch Bewitched reruns","review":"We picked this book for our book group based largely on Harold Bloom raving about it. Harold and I obviously have different taste in books. I slogged through the book and managed to finish it, but I did not enjoy it.I notice that the small number of folks who gave the book lower ratings feel like they have to apologize and admit to some lack of intellect. This might have been a good short story, but it was a hellish 500 page book. And I'm not kidding that I'm much rather watch Bewitched reruns - Samantha, Darren, Tabitha and Endora are way more interesting than any of the characters in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother. Waste of time.","review":"I am an avid reader that has never not finished any book that I started, no matter how poorly executed. Till now. I just didn't quite get the full meaning of this book. I started to read it because of the rave reviews. I read perhaps three-quarters of Big Little and then put it down in disgust. It is morbid and had no meaning for me. I've read many fantasy books, as well as total fantasy series but this was pure stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little annoying","review":"I just started to read the Book. So far I eke out to page 86. The Story itself is interesting and that is the only reason I decided to continue.After 60 Pages I started first time to count the iteration of the word \\"though\\". It seems to be the Author\`s favorite and at some pages I could find it up to four times.I am very sorry but this uninspired writing is nothing else but annoying and for a foreigner who\`s mother-tongue is not english and who wants to read books not last for practice, to my opinion it is not the best choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"I picked this book up based upon all the raves. Crowley was linked with Mieville and Neil Gaiman, whom I both love. So I was set to really get into Little, Big.But I just don't get this book at all. Found it trite, cute, and painfully whimsical. Even the writing was wooden. There seems to be a Rorschach quality to all these raves - as if the reader is seeing what they want to be in the book, rather than what is actually there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whewww! Not For Me . . .","review":"A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book. I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside. The book just made me disoriented and tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad","review":"I really hated this book. It was so dreary, confusing and boring. I'm willing to put up with a lot of book with little action (and often enjoy such books), but this one just didnt make any sense! The plot, if you can call it that, was so disjointed and rambling and unclear. I was very dissapointed because I read many reviews before purchasing this book, and it was so well reviewed I thought I'd like it. I guess I didn't realize how much I appreciate clearness and plot in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"I started this, but absolutely not my thing. The writing would seem to be ok, but at several hundred pages of what was going on here, no thanks. This particular Fantasy Masterworks edition had the incredibly annoying and twee indentations of different scenes time after time. That destroys any reading flow, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Really Sorry,","review":"I tried to read and love this book several times , and I have a degree from Columbia in Literature and I read a lot of Fantasy but I just can't get into this book!Nothing HAPPENS!

The story is thouroughly magical and enchanting. But a warning. Don't forget any detail no mattter how small, they are very important later. Think Dickens in a way. But trust me, its worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book.","review":"I'm echoing the praise of the other reviewers, and also their amazement that the book is no longer in print. I, too, have lost several copies by trying to share them with everybody. It is a wonderful, magical book, with little pieces of wisdom hinted at: 'the further in you go, the bigger it gets'...what does that mean? I'm not real sure, but I think it's profound. And the words from sampler on the wall, \\"Those things that make us happy make us wise,\\" still sing in my mind, and as I grow older, I more and more believe that it is so."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a book a dream","review":"I teach high school and I bought four copies of the book this holiday season to give to some of my favorite students. My experience reading it was like reading A Hundred Years of Solitude. I felt like I lived or dreamt it rather than read it. It is an amazing book like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books Ever","review":"This book is not for the casual reader who simply wants a page-turner. The book is demanding, requiring that the reader bring something to the reading, but is enormously rewarding. It's a powerful work of intellect and emotion. The incredible complexity of the story is one of its pleasures, as one sees a story thread disappear here only to show up again \\"way over there.\\" I'm not alone in regarding this book as a masterpiece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently, I Just Don't Understand","review":"There's no question that Crowley has a good grip on language. But honestly, I can't understand all the rave reviews for this book. The main characters are, to me, completely uninvolving and uninteresting cyphers. There is no plot that I was able to detect. And worst of all, the overall feeling of constant whimsey I found to be oppressive and cloying. If one wants whimsey in reasonable doses, I would recommend \\"Neverwhere\\" by Neil Gaiman, a book that, in my opinion, has some of the same elements that many reviewers seem to enjoy, without the overwhelming cloyingness that made this book a chore for me.Obviously, the mileage of others varies considerably, but I found this to be a long, uninvolving book whose atmosphere is opressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"This may well be my favorite book of all time","review":"I've read four or five of John Crowley's books and only this one speaks to me. There's something about the juxtaposition of the mythic and the mundane, the historic with the fantastic, and most importantly the fairy story with everyday life that just floored me the first time I read the book and continues to amaze me every time I return to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only bring one book to a deserted isle. . . .","review":"I've only read this book straight-through once, but I've picked it up to get immediately lost in Edgewood countless times. It's immediate and completely immersive and I feel a little lost and sad when I re-enter the real world.Do not read this book if you are into action and fast plot development. One of the other reviewers described this book as \\"droning\\". It certainly fits the description as tedious and dull if you don't enjoy long blocks of description. There's not a lot of dialogue and no part of it is a quick read. \\"Little, Big\\" might feel like something you had to slog through in high school where every paragraph felt cumbersome to get through. If it's not your cup of tea right now, set it aside and try again in a few years.Beautiful, lyrical, evocative. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Farie Tale","review":"It's been many years since I have read this book. But I remember thouroughly enjoying the story. The main charaters are named after the farie king & queen of Shakesphere's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The twists and turns are just delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flawed","review":"I will not attempt to write a professional review; too many have already done this. The book is mostly a fairy tale. The last third or so of the book is set in some sort of post meltdown England which manages to be less believeable than the fairytale. The book was written some decades ago when it may have gone down better. The first half of the book I found enjoyable and was thinking of all of the people that I'd like to share it with. Suddenly, the book switches gears to something resembling magical realism, and my enjoyment meter reversed direction. This book has held up far less well than \\"The Forgotten Beasts of Eld\\", \\"Mythago Wood, and the New Sun books, of Gene Wolfe or Jack Vances' Lyonesse series. To end,I finally gave up on \\"Little, Big\\", and tossed it away. Read the first half and then lose it maybe, a plan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginitive masterpiece","review":"If you are a skim-reader, go no further...this book is not for you.The depth and intricacies of this book are unparalelled by any fantasy novel I've read thus far. The book requires patience (it's somewhat slow to develop) and it requires close attention to detail. I also would imagine that non-analytical readers may find the book a bit dull; the real value in this novel is from the allusions, the vivid imagery, the expert story-telling, and the delicately constructed prose. As I read through each chapter, I found myself referencing back (continually) to prior chapters to find subtle references and hidden gems that you will miss unless you pay close attention.If you like finding treasures and enjoy a good challenge, this is definitely the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, but don't buy the Kindle version","review":"The Kindle version of this book has what I've come to expect as the typical amount of format and grammar errors for an older book made available for the Kindle (way too many unless you've gotten to the point of expecting them). However, near the end of the book (in the chapter titled \\"52 pick up\\") enough content is missing that the story continuity is lost. This has been the case in a few of the Kindle books I've purchased. I'm not sure what options exist except to stop buying older books in this format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe dryness, lotion doesn't help it, it's THAT bad.","review":"Perhaps it's just me, but whenever I use toners or anything with alcohol in it, my face just tightens up and sunburns and everything gets inflamed and it's just horrible.

It went on smoothly and no scent was detectable. and to think I almost wasted $25 on a bottle of Anthony all-purpuse moisteurizer for my face. This only cost me $7.00 at CVS.

If you are looking for a list of quick organizing tips then this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last!","review":"I have been frustrated for decades by my messy desk. I tried numerous recommended tactics to manage it, but none worked---until this book! I have finally conquered the monster by following the wise and supportive guidance given by the author. I have purchased copies of this book for many friends and they love it too. I cannot recommend it highly enough for those who feel disorganized around time, space or \\"stuff\\". It's great to finally be able to use my desk as I have always wanted to. My desk is at last a source of pleasure instead of a pain--which is handy since I work at it so many hours every day! This approach really works!!! I am extremely grateful to this author and recommend the book most highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holistic approach to organization","review":"Drawing on the four areas of development (physical, emotional, mental and spiritual), the author focuses on WHY people are unorganized. The book is not as focused on practical steps to become organized, but does give an excellent overview on the path towards understanding. If you want a more specific, skills-based approach, this isn't the book for you. On the other hand, if you want to learn why you're not organized (in ANY area of your life, not just housework!), then this is a good tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"The campaign for mathematical clarity starts here...","review":"These truths I hold to be self evident:1) It is unacceptable to provide equations without explaining all the symbols in them.2) If you explain something to an intelligent person and they still don't understand then it is your fault not theirs.3) Laziness is the right of the reader, not the author.In practice you assume your audience knows some things, ellide from previous equations for space and fluency, and provide a glossary. But I have a degree in maths (not stats) and still I can't make head or tail of the first two pages of chapter 2 in the excerpt given. So I will look for a book, article or course that assumes less knowledge on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn about EM? Read the relevant papers but not this book","review":"I tried to read the whole introductive chapter a couple of times but I couldn't understand what is EM about, the used terminology and the basic definitions. The authors say that the book is for theoriticians and practicioners, but I do think it is not appropriate for both categories, unless the reader has been involved in writing papers on this topic. I have enough background knowledge in probability theory and in mathematics but it seems that I have to read all the relevant literature before going a step ahead. In my opinion this book is wide useless for people who do not know EM algorithm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for awhile","review":"This item has worked fine for me with a few exceptions.

Bios of Audie Murphy are either too worshipful or try to highlight his all too obvious flaws. Mr. Graham to his credit does neither. No doubt he clearly admires Murphy's accomplishments as a soldier but he is less than enamored with his postwar record. Murphy fans will either love or hate this book. I enjoyed it, though I had to deduct a star when Mr. Graham wrote that the Battle of the Bulge began on December 18 (it opened on the 16th). If you make a basic mistake on that level, your book might have other such errors. Still, it's a good book and if you want an honest portrait of this tragically flawed hero, you won't do any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audi Murphy was my hero growing up","review":"When I grew up everyone knew Audi Murphy. Now it is quite different. This is a truley excellant book on the real guy it pulls no punches. Audi had lots of problems both before durning and after the war but was one tuff SOB and one damn nice guy who would give a stranger the last dollar in his pockett. This book realy tells his life from his childhood to his final day. His womenizing, his standing up for the under dog, a non drinker who would fight at the drop of a hat. A person who was humble, brave, fearless, liked the girls, a super outdoorsman, a man who earned everything he got and asked for nothing extra. But boy did he have issues an thats what makes him so interisting. The only thing I differ from the book on is that myself and most of the people my age thought Audi was a terrable actor.

So he crosses the desert, fights armies, sees his family in danger, etc, so justice can be made (I will not tell you the end - it's a twister!).Now the review: the book (Tuareg by Alberto Vazquez-Figueroa) is superb and it's with sadness that I see such great adventure turned into a 2nd grade Rambo Comando Spagheti.At least the book's author has the same idea about the movie, as one can read in the sequel of the book Los Ojos Del Tuareg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"What Andy Griffith episode isn't child appropriate?

In a book that involves getting shrunken and encountering giant ants in an attempt to stop the Evil Power Master from destroying the universe, reason seems to falter. You can defeat the old arch-nemesis of the Zondo Quest team, but most likely you will at first get stuck in some colorful death scene or even start an aphid rebellion against ruthless ant taskmasters.If you want a Choose Your Own Adventure with sheer random fun, this is it.

Or not.In the Cheese Chronicles, Tommy Womack presents a great look into the usually-unglamorous lifestyle of beer-swilling, chain-smoking, working musicians just trying to make ends meet. He demonstrates that the road to musical nirvana isn't paved with gold for every band that hasn't made it yet. It's paved with concrete just like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, complete with an ungodly amount of potholes.

And I found out information that I did not know all of these years of buying Hoodia.No one is selling Hoodia Gordonii extract , as it would be violating the patent held by CSIR (which has been leased to Phytopharm, who in turn have leased it to Unilever).

I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade.

Some people are saying that it might be good for beginners, but I really disagree. It's almost completely lacking basic, basic information anybody, especially beginners, would need to get good results.

Or if you are a purely artistic photographer, with no computer facility, then this book can help.However, if you have done some scanning and understand the basics, then there is likely to be little here of value. The book has a lot of pages and is well organized, but each chapter falls well short of providing the in-depth knowledge required for mastery, despite the cutesie congratulatory message at the end of each chapter.

But if the powers that be are waiting for us to give in, maybe we should just so we can get the other seasons on the shelves....NOT!GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! AND WHAT WE WANT IS THE REST OF NIGHT COURT!!I search the shelves of the video stores weekly hoping to see them there. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"The time has come!!

This was the FUNNIEST show on in the 80's and still one of the funniest!!! I've been dying to see the middle seasons forever!!! I'm sick of getting my hopes up and looking for them in vain!! I agree with other people how Season One was the least desirable and it didn't hit comedy genius level until later,but still I bought it and eagerly waited for the others. Holy crap,some of the other shows I've seen available on store shelfs are laughable(not in a good way!!) yet still no wonderful,hilarious,brilliant Night Court! Warner Bros. should be ashamed!

She also wrote that without the rest of the series, she might as well send them her copy of the first as it is no good to her without them.I agree that Warner Brothers is being a complete idiot in this case.

Ripped open the packaging and popped it into the dvd player and was immediately let down.This is most likely a counterfeit item because the picture quality is poor. The picture is grainy and fuzzy and the audio is mediocre at best. It was either made by copying with a camera from the screen or from an internet rip.No way this was made from a master of the movie.

There is absolutely no way a 5 yr old can maneuver this gun and shoot - plus, it sure does not shoot very far.

An evil alien force named Armus kills Yar and torments the crew while they attempt to rescue Troi and the other crewman. I found the plot really average, and the special effects left a lot to be desired.The only reason I bought this episode because my favorite character was Tasha Yar, and I collect ST:TNG episodes myself. If you are looking for a memorable, exciting episode, and you don't particularly care about Tasha Yar, then don't buy it. I don't think you'd like it.However, the ending on this episode is its saving grace; it is really touching and great, and even I had to shed a few tears. At least they gave Tasha the proper send off! It's too bad that Yar dies senselessly in this episode and is soon forgotten by the crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst episodes","review":"Most of season 1 is pretty painful to watch but this episode takes the cake.Tasha Yar gets killed by an oil slick. A very bizarre way to end a character. An oil slick flings Yar in the air and she dies.The dialog between the oil slick monster and the crew is hilarious though. The oil guy's dialog is very childish and stupid.Beverly wants to see Troi and the oil slick guy says \\"okay you can see her\\" Beverly walks towards the ship to see her and the the oil slick guy says \\"wait, I change my mind\\".Another scene he is talking to Captain Picard and he mentions a few times how he (oil guy) wants him and his crew to entertain him and when Picard finally gives in and says I will entertain you if you let me see Troi. He (oil guy) says \\"you can't entertain me\\". LOLThis episode was ridiculous and stupid even for 1988 standards.Only good thing is Tasha died. I never liked her and was glad she was gone after one season."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I am a LONG-TIME fan of the Flash. I watched Wally West grow up from child to adult.

He still had the lightning, the gold accents to his costume, and the helmet of Mercury (the winged helmet thing that Jay Garrick, the first Flash, wears and which Wally wears in Kingdom Come and the Kingdom as an homage) has freakishly huge wings.Only for someone who's an action figure fiend.

Once you get it past a certain point it pulls back easily, but getting it started is a little tough for a younger.I knew going in based on reviews that the arrows weren't stellar, and I've found that to be the case as well. The first day outside with them, one of my daugher's arrow feathers tore off. We have since gotten the kids some more arrows at the store and that's not a big deal. I also wish there was more of a \\"ridge\\" on the ledge where the arrow sits, as my son (especially, still being younger) has trouble keeping it on as he pulls back the bow.

My youngest daughter (11) has been shooting with it for three days now, she can consistently hit a 3' by 6' target from about 35'. The small air rifle targets I purchased (elsewhere) are pretty much worthless for shooting this bow. The arrow rest is very difficult to keep an arrow on, practice does help, but I will probably end up buying an arrow rest that cost nearly as much as the bow to help my daughters. My daughter (couch potato) had some trouble with the draw weight (18lbs.) at first but she pulls it back with no trouble now. By spring I believe we'll be ready for a better bow, but this is just fine for getting them interested in archery.

However, in my opinion, somewhere between the author's final manuscript, and what actually got published, someone at the publisher thought they understood things better.For example, in many cases, what the author says in the text doesn't match the final drawings. Or, when discussing calculations for voltage and current where the term 'miliampere' is used, it's defined as one millionth of an ampere- that's flatly incorrect, a miliamp is one thousandth of an ampere.So, if you buy it, get your calculator, pencil and pad out and be prepared to test the math and make the corrections in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice if you like inaccuracies","review":"Don't know if Uncle Abdul make the mistakes or the typesetter or printer but there are mistakes in the book and someone could get hurt. Of course we can get hurt driving a car too. The biggest thing to remember, electric play is a high risk activity. From Electric Play Toys, Techniques, and Safety written in 1982:There are three kinds of electricity: static electricity, high-frequency electricity, and electrical current. Current is what comes out of an electrical socket or a battery. There are two ways to measure electricity, voltage and amperage. \\"Voltage\\" is the oomph that gets electricity where it's going; \\"amperage\\" is the amount of electricity being moved. Amperage is what kills people.If you want to play around with this see one of the few experts in the field for hands on training and not learn from a book or the Internet.

These bows are made in a strange way, the way the band is attached will leave the bow sideways....impossible to straighten them out. And the elastic is very stiff and will not stretch...which makes an already hard job even harder. When I did managed to get them in (crooked) they lasted about ten minutes...and then fell apart.....This being a dog that wears a sweater constantly and never pulls at it....the tiny beads are glued on and my pup promptly ate one of them, and while you should receive two of each color you will receive about four or five that do not match whatsoever....I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"the elastic band is too thick for my yorkies fine hair, and it just lasts a few hours and wears off its not properly glued, wish it was with better quality also i didnt quite exactly receive what was on the photo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gold trimmed tiny grooming bows","review":"from the picture these bows look really cute. but i opened the package and you can the rubber band all the way around the front of the bow too. should just be on the back of the bow only. i will not purchase these bows again. is ok for home. but not to take my dogs out in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, Obnoxious Music","review":"This CD sounds like rather bad 80's synth.

The piece is supposed to be intact, and should have arrived that way.

One would automatically think to put it in bubble wrap, and styrofoam, but seeing as how it's a fairy statue, I guess it's supposed to magically be OK.... I was REALLY hoping to get this and display it along with my fishpond, but oh well, money ill spent. If you DO order it, tell the seller to PACKAGE IT CORRECTLY.

Dont worry about it being to hard to install, anyone can do it. I watched an istallation video online and that made me think I could do it myself.

After purchasing this product and installing it myself I do not know what problems or difficulties they were talking about. This was the easiest installation and set up ever! I would definitely recommend this type of opener to anyone. The operation is extremely quiet, and the automatic lock, and automatic light are a bonus. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey but works great.","review":"I bought this because of a clearance issue in my garage. It was fairly simple to install, even easier than a regular door opener. Programing the unit was not difficult but did not work for me for the first 3 tries, maybe my fault I don't know. But after a few tries everything worked fine and I have been using the unit for about a week with no other problems. The opener seems to be fairly high qualityand has all the safety stuff you would expect. Overall, so far I am not dissapointed with this purchase at all, and would recommend this opener to anyone with some mechanical skill. (really not that bad though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disastisfied","review":"I have this unit and have had other liftmaster garage door openers. They malfunction about twice a year. I paid over the cost of the opener on service. Seems like clockwork when it comes to breaking down. There's a number place on these openers to call when you need service. How convenient! Some mornings I'm about to go to work and my garage door is wide open!! This is putting my family at a risk. I will never buy another liftmaster. If I can give no stars I would! Save the heartache and trouble, and get something better! These cheap clunkers are manufactured in Mexico, and man do they suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Product - louzy service","review":"I ordered the Liftmaster, but upon arrival I discovered I did not have the necessary vertical clearance to install. I contacted Garage Intel for a return authorization. They granted the RMA request - I of course had to pay the $30.00 for return shipping. I just received confirmation that the refund has been processed after a 20% restocking ($60.00) fee has been deducted! What a ripoff...I regret having dine business with Garage Intel and feel misled by the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product, Warranty and Customer Service","review":"Installed two of these in a new home in 2008. One broke down after a year and the second broke down after two years. The warranty is next to useless since it covers only parts and not labor. It took ten days to receive replacement motor from Tucson and then the labor to remove unit, replace motor and reinstall unit was $200 and took another several days. This is after having installed Chamberlain/Liftmaster garage door products in two other homes and having zero failures in 20 years. Customer service was argumentative, blamed their own installer, who actually does good work and took no responsibility. Avoid the Liftmaster 3800 unless you want to manually open your garage door a few weeks a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, bad support","review":"This product works in some applications but not in others. If it were designed a little differently, it would work much better in nearly all situations. It would be much better, as described in my comment on another review, if the motor operated in constant tension when closing the door so that if the door movement is slow at any point, the cable doesn't get ahead of the door and fall off the pulley or worse (one side of the door goes faster than the other, the door gets misaligned and falls off the track).All this has actually happened to me.Since most people (even my professional installers) won't know what the problem is, I consider this product unacceptably dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liftmaster 3800 is a great product","review":"I purchased the LiftMaster 3800 for my new garage. I have 10' wide by 9' tall doors with a 13' ceiling and a door track that is about 12' high. I didn't want to add the extra door panels on the inside of the garage, so this LiftMaster was the best option. I'm very satisfied with the openers so far. They are smooth and quiet (although when the motor first starts turning there is a bit of a grunt and hum). I was planning on installing these myself, but then I found out that would void the warranty on my new doors - so I had the openers installed by the same company that installed my doors. The only feature missing that would be a nice to have is the compatibility with the internet gateway to be able to control the doors remotely and see open/close status on a phone app."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative","review":"This is a solid product. Great alternative to overhead openers and tracks. Easy to install. This is one of a very few residential jackshaft openers and it lives up to the brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a beginner it is not that difficult","review":"Instructions are pretty straight forward. Keep this in mind, the cable monitor must be in the exact position indicated or it can make the programming later a living nightmare. It does not have to be off by much. I purchased this in June and hesitated to write a review until I was sure this was everything as advertised. I have been pleased with its operation so I bought another this past Labor day for my other door. This is the answer for older homes with low finished ceilings and you don't want that old conventional unsightly box and track hanging over your head. I am not mechanically inclined, but you must have some basic knowledge of tools and using them. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would never go back","review":"I was a little worried about the installation after reading all the reviews, but this thing went in very easy - just follow the directions. No problem adjusting it, and I did it all with no assistance until the adjustment when I had my wife push the button on the controller. Installation took probably 3+ hours but this included running wire in my attic and cleaning up the wiring everywhere. The actual opener goes on in less than a half hour, it's just all the wiring for the controller and sensors that takes time. I would reccomend this to anyone looking to put in an opener in any application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Opener","review":"Installed two of these in my new garage and they work fine. Instructions are good and troubleshooting guide also. Just a note to anyone that might install one of these these themself, If the door keeps stopping when you are trying to set your upper and lower limit you have to set the force first then the limit. I had a issue on the second install where the door was on its way down for the lower limit setting and it kept stopping and going back up. The troubleshooting section did say to set the force first for this symptom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great press","review":"The grill press works very well and is the correct weight.

They include the liners, which most companies sell seperately. If you want solid white baskets, however, don't buy these. That is why they are called white-washed!!! But the white-washed look is very pretty in a baby's room and they hold diapers, wipes, and baby supplies very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this book","review":"I actually had the professor who wrote this book for a class. I did not like the book at all. For a beginner as I was with no programming experience some of the examples led to more confusion than they solved. Some of the examples will build on code that you read several pages to several chapters back in the book and flipping back and forth to figure out what was done is annoying. The book is not all bad though I still use it some for reference since I paid 100 dollars or so for it when it was brand new... but if you are looking for a beginners introduction to C++ code go with a Schaums(sp?) outline or something that is more of a reference than this book which can be wordy at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware. Shoulder strap is junk. Do not use it!","review":"On my way out the door for the first time with this bag, my $800 Gateway went crashing to the ground, doing some minor damage to it (one of the battery locks popped out and I cannot get it back in). How did this happen? Did I somehow clip the shoulder strap incorrectly? After picking up my case and laptop off the ground I quickly discovered that the lousy Made-in-China, pot metal clip failed right at the pivot point. I did nothing out of the ordinary that would constitute extreme or otherwise abusive behavior. I simply slung it over my shoulder and down it went. Whatever weight rating this was designed for is obviously not suitable for the weight of a 15\\" laptop and its charging pack.

Put once those first 15 seconds go by, it's all garbage. It's entertaining in a completely irritating way. You can't even identify some of the songs (e.g. You're Crazy and My Michelle), which would be a good thing if they spun them correctly, but they're nothing worth noticing. Most of the rest of the songs are near-carbon-copies, but sound way worse, are done with much less skill and only rarely are any harder. The classic Estranged is done without guitar solos and a nasaly singer. The intro riff to Sweet Child, possibly the most recognizable guitar riff of all time, is plinked out on a cheap piano. And the real chance for a beautiful HC re-interpretation, a cover of 'Used to Love Her' keeps the all-acousticness, which just shows you how misled this album is.

Your lives would be absolutely perfect if God could give you all the answers when you asked him right? So why aren't they? Most Mormons join the Mormon church/cult because they want to belong to something and feel welcome and thats exactly what they get. Mormons are very nice people and I have nothing against the Mormon people. I'm against the Mormon concept. Research the HISTORY, what Joseph and Brigham SAID at the beginning. The whole church rests on ONE man's tale. The man was a liar, deceiver, and ... fiend.

When they finally reached land, they spread out and multiplied and created great societies and built great cities. They had many wars and famines.

The chapters lack hard returns, and the table of content only links to the beginning of the various books, so that to get to 2 Nephi 15, you would have to manually scroll through several hundred pages.

If you are looking into Mormonism, I recommend that you check out mormonthink.com before you commit to anything - they'll explain a lot of the problems with the Book of Mormon and church history, but they explore both sides of the conversation.

For example, there are references to iron, steel, brass, metal pieces of money, wheat, horses, chariots, and elephants in an ancient American setting (approximately 2,400 BC to 400 AD) which are consistent with 19th Century rumors and theories, but simply do not fit within the catalog of scientific knowledge available today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay for a free book?","review":"If you want a copy, get it free from the mormons instead of paying for it.

I was shocked and appalled by the first chapter and it only got worse from there. So much of it is just unrealistic, historically incorrect and just plain nuts. I can't believe so many people believe this is true! Of course every chapter seems to tell you that if you don't believe it you're going to hell...so that might be why. I just don't see how logical intelligent people can believe things like a God telling someone to murder someone else or people's skin changing color because of sin, or, this is the worst, people digging up steel along with gold, silver and other metals.

He said that Joseph Smith was beckened from his sheep by an angel, I would like to correct that comment by saying that Jospeh Smith was searching for the true church when he was prayfully reading the scriptures (bible) when he came acrossed james 1:5, where it says that god gives to men who search liberally. Well he took this passage to heart and he went to a remote grove and prayed to the Lord and to God about which was the true church, as he was praying a bright light came upon him and he saw two personages who were the God and Jesus Christ or in other words the Father and the Son.
