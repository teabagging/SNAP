To make up for it, as well as take more money out of our pockets, they are finally doing it right. They are currently doing a new BLADE RUNNER DVD. It's set for release in 2001. It will have Ridley Scott's commentary as well as others. It will also have production design sketches, extra footage, etc...

The director's cut did not include this and much of the story is missed. Also, there was a scene with a unicorn...quite bizarre.

Actually, ordered it from Amazon at Christmas not realizing it was a different cut from the original shown in theaters (so many years ago!) Some script was changed and there was very little voice-over or ad-libbing by Harrison which for us made the original movie more interesting. Anyway, I had always said that this was one of my top-ten movies, but certainly not the Director's Cut. How can I get the original???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lack of 5.1 sound hurts","review":"Blade Runner is a fantastic, thought provoking movie.

That said...I like both the original and the directors cut. The directors cut demands more of the non-sci-fi initiated and puts many off. Rent the movie first if you are unsure and decide then. Now the real reason I write: this \\"special edition\\" DVD release is a terrible dissapointment. The \\"special extras\\" are not worth the money and when you compare the availabe features to any Criterion release...it is just sad and pathetic. This movie deserved more attention to detail - at the very least to help some viewers with the vague complexity of the story.

It has the original version released in theatres, with Harrison Ford's \\"Mickey Spillane\\"-type voiceover to help the less than attentive viewers keep track. It also has the director's cut without the voiceovers that has been prevalent in recent years; it has additional footage with Decker (and the audience) questioning his own origins. And an additional cut I will leave for you to discover.And all the way through there is the beautiful, bleak but plausible future and Vangelis' haunting score.

The Final Cut is breathtaking in both audio and video quality. All of the well known 20th century video \\"glitches\\" have been cleaned up with 21st centuty technology. But, if you still like the previous Director's Cut, or the original theatrical version, you have all that too. And the price can't be beat.Sure, the story line of the movie could have been a little cleaner and tighter - even some of the people closely involved in the making of the movie admit that, but, while the movie is running, it's hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Just think, not even the people who saw the original theatrical screening of this movie were treated to such clarity - such visual and audio depth.My recommendation - make some popcorn, fire up the big scren, dim the lights, and curl up with someone you love. Movie watching doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best way to watch blade runner","review":"This is by far the best special edition of any movie ever. There are all the different cuts of the film each with commentary tracks. After you are done watching the bonus features you will know more about blade runner than you ever thought possible. The only downside to the collection is that disks 2 and 4 (the making of and bonus features) are standard dvd and not blu-ray. The advantage of this is that if you have an upscaling player you can at least upscale to 1080 unlike the special features on Pirates 2 which were on a blu-ray disk and therefore unable to be upscaled. So not perfect but at least you arent forced to watch special features in 480."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"There is no other vertion of theis movie to get. if you are a true fan of Blade runner then you have to own this addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Dolby True-HD sound track","review":"I am in the process of replacing all my HD-DVD's to Blu-Ray in order to reduce my equipment rack to a single Blu-Ray player. I received my copy of the Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) in Blu-Ray. The packaging indicates Dolby TrueHD is the primary sound track for the \\"Final Cut\\" disc of the movie. However, there are only 2 sound tracks on the disc--Dolby Digital 5.1 and a stereo sound track for director commentary...no others; not even foreign language tracks.The HD-DVD version of the \\"Final Cut\\" disc DOES include the Dolby TrueHD. This appears to be an engineering oversight on the Blu-Ray version. This is not acceptable. The manufacturer MUST be aware of this. As a result I cannot recommend that anyone waste [...] bucks on this collection. I give the video 5 stars but the audio doesn't even warrant half a star so I'm giving it the average--2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars For TDC","review":"I give only two stars for the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, but five stars for the original version--one of two of my all-time favorates (Wizard of Oz is the other). Harrison Ford's voice over add greatly to the atmosphere of the movie. Supposedly, Ford was not at all happy about doing the voice over and shows in his tone, or lack of, which actually ends up as the perfect narration of a down and out retired Blade Runner. Kudos for the theatrical version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The actual movie gets 5 stars, but not the DVD...","review":"The movie gets a perfect score of 5 stars, and I can't really choose between the directors cut version and the theatrical version. The DC version allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions regarding Dekard and whether he is a replicant or not, and allows you to develop your own insights into the characters. The Theatrical version on the other hand pretty much holds your hand through the whole movie, which I personally don't mind, yet isn't really necessary, I like a movie which forces you to think about what is going on...and the DC version does just that.This DVD version falls short of 5 stars simply because they didn't digitally remaster the sound and picture quality. Blade Runner is the perfect movie for 5.1 surround sound, hopefully they will release another version..."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened here?!","review":"I saw the original theatrical release, and when I heard there was a \\"director's cut,\\" I imagined that there would be lots of more scenes from the \\"deleted\\" ones, etc., but definitely no what they did. The voice over adds a great deal of understanding that it is needed for a better grasp of the motives of the characters. The so called \\"phony ending\\" is a definite absolute requirement for psychological resolution and hope. This release at least should had offered both versions. I own the original on tape, and so hard to get, but VHS is dying.

It is the workprint.So... as much as the price is enticing, I'd consider long and hard before attempting a purchase before these issues are resolved.BTW... the movie is 5 stars, easy. My 1 star is for the actual PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could anyone please explain me this film?","review":"Oh god, I almost fell asleep when I watched this film, perhaps my mistake was that I watched the director's cut first. I choose rent this DVD 'cause the critics say this one is an excelent sci-fi story and the director's cut is the best way to see it (?), I read that the scene of the unicorn fell over the audience's head like a dump of freezing water, well, maybe for them that meant something special but for me it meant absolutely nothing, can anybody please explain it to me? I know it has something to do with the question: Do the androids sleep with electric sheep? or something like that, and the critics here say that maybe Deckard was a cyborg, but why? I don't get it. The film for me was awful slow. Well, who knows? maybe I need to watch the original edition first in order to understand this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This movie was awesome.

It is timed at 1 hour 58, a full 20 minutes short of the Final Cut version, so is no substitute.Baffled and really kinda ticked off.

The DVD isn't all there.","review":"The directors cut is a nice \\"flavor\\" of the Blade Runner movie, but it's the narration that gives the character Deckard human qualities. And what's wrong with that?We can stand on a pedestal and preach how smart we are in watching a movie with no narration, but I personally like the human Deckard. I was disappointed that the \\"end all to Blade Runner movie\\" flavors left out the narration. If you were told that the narrated version was really the \\"Director's Cut\\", would it add less value to the present \\"Director's Cut\\"?The added goodies in the DVD are nice. The sound is great, though getting really digital does make it a little stale. One nice plus about the DVD, is you can pause it to get a look at Los Angeles 18 years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensley boring","review":"This film is one of the biggest sleep inducers I've seen so far. I rented it, hearing it was a sci-fi classic of some sort, and found myself constantly wondering why. I first must admit that I really loved the visuals. The special effects and excellent photography are a delight. This film demostrates Scott's trademark gloomy photography and snail pace. The film is shot almost entirely at night, and everything looks as gothic as you can get in a 21st century setting. This is all arresting at first, but as the movie settles down for it's overlong, confusing, feckless, and totally BORING story, not even the visuals are able to save it. I had read once that Ridley Scott had originally planned to direct TOTAL RECALL, another short story by Philip K. Dick, when the screenplay was still in the works. I felt relieved that he hadden't. It also made me wonder what Paul Verhoven would have done with this movie. That thought leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is just atrocious.","review":"I've read so many good reviews and bad reviews of this Ridley Scott Film Noir/Science Fiction thriller that I became confused as to how good it really is. Well I finally bought it and watched it. Want the truth? It is a slow, unnecessarily complex movie about androids and humans. It is cold, violent, and none-to-bright either. However, the movie's architectural designs and the fact that it was based on a Philip K. Dick novel certainly make it interesting...but it just isn't that good. Cast (especially Ford) excells. Director's Cut does nothing to improve it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD reprodution","review":"I give this DVD 1 star not because of the movie quality but because the DVD version, as opposed to the Video, does nothave Harrison Fords Narrative thoughts and comments.As a result there are lots of long camera shots pointed at his face. Without the narration of what he's thinking, these long camera shots and musical breaks seem a bit silly.Until they remaster this DVD I would not recommend the purchase of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Runner Review","review":"I love the movie. I bought the 5 disc set because I couldn't find the theatrical release by itself in Blu-Ray. I am not a fan of the Director's cut, mostly because all of the voice over narration is taken out. Buying a 5 disc set is probably overkill if you are not already a fan of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weird Movie. I Didn't Understand What The Hell Was Going On.","review":"This so-called classic movie is nowhere near a classic. Honestly, I didn't understand what the hell was going on in the movie half the time...and I didn't even finish watching it. I got through an hour and seven minutes of it before I finally gave up. I will say one thing in its favour, though: the director's vision of a futuristic L.A. was really good. Avoid this trash.

Buy the book instead!","review":"This movie is good if you have nothing better to do than sit at home and watch TV. I read the book (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) and loved it. I thought the video was 'dumbed-down' far to much and lost all origional meaning. Just sex and violence with no moral. Don't get me wrong, sex and violence is great entertainment, but it shouldn't be used to butcher a excellent novel. READ THE BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, bad DVD","review":"Having heard the buzz for many years and being a science fiction fan, I got Blade Runner. Big mistake.Some of you raving about the missing voiceover ought to take a moment and think about what the movie - to a first-time viewer - is without it: A boring dectective story with little or no detail. The only explainer we get is at the beginning of the movie - one whole paragraph. Otherwise, we're left to judge for ourselves what's happening in 2019 LA. I don't mind complicated stories. Love them. But this one was incomprehensible.A unicorn? Sorry, if you're not a fan and no one tells you that replicants dream that way, then you've got no idea what it means. AND NO ONE TELLS YOU WHAT IT MEANS. NOT EVEN A HINT!I do have to give the nod for the ending. The redeption of the replicant in the final conflict is touching. But I didn't know enough about him or Deckard to care all that much.Plus, there are no special features on the disc. Really a bad buy in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie-Terrible DVD","review":"I love this movie. It's still a mystery to me how Leonard Maltin could give it one and a half stars (yet Gremlins 2 rates 3 stars?).Unfortunately this is by far the worst video transfer I've ever seen. When I play it on my laptop, I can see the sound track! I'm no expert, but I know a shoddy production when I see it. It looks like they just slapped it together without even watching what they were doing. I haven't watched the full screen side (why would I?), but the wide screen has black not just at the top and bottom, but on the sides as well. Couldn't they have made it fit?This piece of cinema history deserves mounds of extra features, and yet there's barely even a MENU. And that looks like it was designed by a four year old. What a waste. This could have been such a treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The great Blade Runner Swindle","review":"This is not a Director's Cut, but a half-finished edition, recovered in storage somewhere in LA and let loose on the public.

Please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Cut","review":"Just to add my opinion to the (thankfully) many others out there who apparently agree, the original version with the voice over is much better than the director's cut. Ford's narration adds so much to the movie. The so-called \\"phony happy ending\\", though silly, makes sense to the movie. If the alternate ending for \\"Stigmata\\" was shown on the DVD, then both endings for Blade Runner should be shown on the DVD. I think it's a travesty of justice in this unfair world that one cannot find a copy of this version, the non-director's cut, anywhere. Not on VHS, not on DVD, not even on Amazon.com. Please, if anyone out there in VHS land is listening, WE WANT OUR ORIGINAL BLADE RUNNER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just to put my 2 cents worth in...","review":"I saw this version in a theater and I have to say I felt ripped off. The missing naration doesn't add or detract from the movie, in fact, I kinda missed it. The \\"unicorn dream\\" sequence is footage Ridley Scott stole from his 1983 disaster \\"Legend\\", the movie he dumped \\"Dune\\" to make. The only other major difference is the lack of a happy ending. The real story here is that this is not the definitve version of the film. There is another... a friend of mine saw a sneak preview back in the day in which Deckard was a replicant (remember all those old family photos on the piano?). Maybe one day that version will see the light of day and we will have a real \\"Director's Cut\\". Until then I say stick to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"LOS ANGELES, 2019 . . . .\\"","review":"After seeing \\"Blade Runner,\\" i'm fearing the future. Ridley Scott (director) paints a rather vivid and disturbing picutre of what L.A. will look like in the furute. Harrison Ford's portrayal of a worn-out detective is rather bland, and it is the impressive special effects and art direction that saves this film. The futuristic setting is dark, rainy, neon-lit, smoky, slimy, and polluted. Is this what L.A. will look like in seventeen years? I certainly hope not.The plot could have been interesting. Several \\"replicants\\" (robots) have been unleashed in L.A., and detective Ford is assigned to track down and kill them. The film moves at a slow pace, but it saved by the fight scene at the end.This movie could be much better. The whole idea of Ford's character being a robot is laughable. His voice-over narration sounds like he's drunk and sunken..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Blade Runner","review":"The transfers are spectacular, and there's more versions of the movie included than you may ever decide to watch.

Such imagination that started the wave of other science fiction knock-offs. This is the type of film that you could watch over and over again and always notice something new. The future world that was created here is almost scary in how realistic it may be. The grittyness, the commercialism and of course the super humans. I did not enjoy this only because of it's visual feats but the story and acting were superb. I've always been a fan of Harrison Ford and this is propably a more physical role than for him than Indiana Jones was.

It's no What's Up, Doc?, but it's pleasant enough, coasting on the stars' likeability and offering just enough funny moments for you to feel you're not entirely wasting your time. However, the vintage making of documentary on the DVD (which includes a lengthy deleted scene) really gives away how much times have changed, as O'Neal and the screenwriters make genial lighthearted jokes about wife-beating..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's good about this movie?","review":"That's a hard one to answer. I did smile once or twice, but even Barbra's most ardent fans will struggle to like this lame effort. The trouble is that there's nothing clever about it. So anybody who likes 'What's Up, Doc?' and thinks, Great, another Streisand/O'Neal movie I will enjoy, well, think again. Ryan O'Neal tries to be cute, but it looks like it's hard for him. Barbra's character is confusing: she starts as a high-powered business woman, but later in the film slips into 'vulnerable silly woman' character half the time. What's going on?And do we need another movie with endless scenes of boxing? No doubt they needed something to fill up the empty spaces in the plot, between the embarrassing 'that would NEVER happen' bits that spoil so much comedy.So what's good about this movie? Well, if you like Barbra Streisand, you get to see her, albeit with probably her worst ever hairdo. If it was anybody else, I'd give this one star, and grudgingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but a PG rating?????","review":"I liked the movie, it's fun and funny but what really surprised and shocked me was: PG RATING?

For the real Jean, read Eve Golden's book. Collen Moore and Myrna Loy had good chapters on Jean in their biographies.

A great book to enter into an understanding of what the Catholic Church really is, from someone on the inside of this life. If you are not a believer I would venture to say it would make you curious about this phenomenon that was started 2000 years ago by a carpenter's son from Nazareth.

Jadakiss used to be a great rapper, especially on his albums with The LOX and his work with the Ruff Ryders, but his work on this album is disappointing.

And also is his song \\"why\\" he says, and i quote \\"Why the whole world love my voice\\"... the whole world loves your voice? man i hate your voice, its probably one of the most anoyying voices ive ever heard.

It's obvious that Jada was trying to make some dough by going mainstream. There is so much filler in the first 3/4 of the album, that you are already bored by the time anything interesting happens. Although it's killng me to write this review, I have to be honest. Even though I'm a fan, I can't just give 5 stars because of that, like some reviewers have done.

Sheek really surprised me. \\"What You So Mad At\\" is hot. \\"Time's Up\\" and \\"Why\\" are great choices for singles. He should have released \\"By Your Side\\" (my favorite song on the album) as a single instead of \\"U Make Me Wanna\\". \\"Gettin It In\\" and \\"Hot Sauce To Go\\" aren't as bad as some of you make them out to be.

Jadakiss enlists the best producers in the game again but ends up with the same lame result. If it wasn't for the havoc produced why, Kiss would be dropped by interscope.

I contacted tech support about some problems I had with this. The rattling noise that really annoys me is caused by the drive heads moving to a resting position where it \\"rattles\\" harmlessly. They told me its due to the fact its their low end no frills drive. I wouldn't have bought this had I known about the noise. Its very annoying.Also have a problem where the drive doesn't come up on startup. They say sometimes data gets trapped in a buffer, and the drive won't work until it clears the buffer. But since its \\"data\\" the drive is refusing to purge it. Usually unplugging the power and removing the USB cable for a minute does the trick. But not this time.....

My favorite albums by far are Baby Beluga and Quiet Time (great sleep CD). Raffi Radio is our my third favorite and my daughter and I both love the tunes 'Raffi Radio' and 'Coconut'. 'Every Child' is also a great song that sends a positive message. A lot of Raffi's music has warm and encouraging lyrics which make kids feel welcome in this world. If your kids like to listen to CD recordings of books, they'll probably like this one. There are skits with a funny dog co-host named Sleido Jazz Dog and others, so this one is a little like a music CD/mini show.On this album:1 Opening2 Raffi Radio3 Kitchen Sing Sing4 Berry Nice News- Seasons5 Sunflower6 Roving Reporter7 Sleido's Song8 Silly Panel - Audio9 Coconut10 Weather Report11 Skip to My Lou12 Berry Nice News - Bananas13 Julia14 Ripple of love15 Silly Panel - Time16 Six Little Ducks17 Sax Interview18 Wishing Well19 Whatever You Choose20 Every Child"},{"rating":"1","title":"a dog book; not a \\"Border Collie book\\"","review":"This book is OK if you are a new dog owner.

It is poorly made, the screen is small. The light on the red one illuminates the sides of the toy as well as the screen thus the colors are not as vibrant. It does not do that on the purple one. The worst part is the case that the pegs sit in - I thought this was a good idea, except that whenever they try to open it, the case sticks and the pegs go flying. I am still stepping on errant pegs. They used up the pages in one day, and I cannot find more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend this product.","review":"This product is a huge disappointment. It will not stand up, the pegs fall out of the board, the light is on an auto timer and there is no way to manually turn it off.

We now have to return three of the items we purchased due to poor quality and broken pieces and due to the draconian return policies at Amazon we don't even know if they will take back the products.

They were three chords plus some interesting tasty fills from all players. The lyrics were always funny. This album has their simplest stuff ever with hardly anything to spice up the mix. I know punk is supposed to be low budget, but this is totally off the cuff. Way too repetitive. No spark. The guys sounded much better 25 years ago. I don't know what happened to Jon Watson, but he needs to TAKEOVER the bass duties again. I hate that tinny, metallic sound. Guy, please play louder than the bass player!

Indicative of that is, &#65533;Shamans search for lost pieces of soul and return them to members of their community. Psychologists investigate the workings of the mind and strive to validate their methodological approaches. Shamanism has soul to give to psychology.

Shamanism is a method for obtaining spiritual insights that are non-linear in nature. It is creative. It is challenging. For me this book attempts to structure shamanism psychologically, and that is not what the shamanic pathway is about, it limits the potential of the Work. To the seasoned journeyier this is not the book to read.If you are a psychologist who wants to expand your practice by \\"doing\\" shamanism without doing your own personal work so you can make more money- please take another path. If you want to explore this pathway of direct experience with the G-d of your understanding and are willing to leave your clinical training at the door, take off your psychological mask then come journey . . . and buy Michael Harner or Sandra Ingerman's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeker Review","review":"I love Shakespeare and for the value of this product, I would have pai full price.

It's also given me a new fear: that one book might be lost or damaged.

It's quite a shame too because Shakespeare is amazing and should be a part of everyone's home library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price went up","review":"I think that $300 for this wonderful set is a bit much. The price just skyrocketecd up from $119 to an absurdly $300 Its really sad to see this happen. Each of these books should be around $5-$6 $190-$228 I will agree on even. The price needs to be reduced right now its a rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than buying the individual paperbacks","review":"The individual paperbacks are priced at $5.00 and $6.00 each. The full set (in hardbound) averages $3.94 a book. The text appears to be identical to the revised paperback edition. Having the plays in single volumes makes it easier to read them (see Al Pacino discussing this issue in Looking for Richard). This is a great deal for a great set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Bought These Volumes","review":"The reviews encouraged me to buy this series, and I'm very glad I did. I've read a number of different Shakespeare editions; my favorite had been the Folger. But these books are luxurious, and comparing one to a Folger proves the quality of the paper and the clear, easy-to-read text. At the $89 price - and even higher - these volumes are a rare bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT Deal!","review":"This is an amazing bargain --- quality bindings, excellent background articles, interesting introductions, helpful notes, all in a convnerient, quality binding.

As I said the set is not flashy but for shakespeare's work all that matters is what is written not the presentation. If you are a fan of shakespeare and there is a massive discount on this set dont hesitate to buy it. It is worth the money. The individual volumes are easier to handle than a giant anthology of works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"South Park is by far one of the best and controversial shows on Television.

The first few episodes are crude, often thin affairs with sparse laughs, but the ball quickly gets rolling with \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\" and \\"Death\\", the series' first classic. \\"Mr. Hanky, The Christmas Poo\\" is a dead-on indictment of society's obsession with political correctness, and its message hasn't dulled a bit (nor has its belly laughs). The extras are few, but Cartman's \\"Oh Holy Night\\" music video is a riot, as is \\"Thanksgiving With Jay Leno\\". This DVD collection is perfect for the hardcore \\"South Park\\" fanatics, as well as anyone who wants to catch up with one of the most outrageous (and outrageously funny) shows in television history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE SOUTH PARK...","review":"This is my pointer on the 1st season and its episodes:101- Cartman Gets An Anal Probe 10/10 Wonderful way to start a series102- Weight Gain 4000 10/10 Debut of Cartman's fatness so funny...103- Volcano 9/10 SKUZZLEBUTT 4EVER!104- Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride 7/10 Not one of my personal faves105- An Elephant Makes Love To A Pig 7/10 Same here106- Death 10/10 Great comeback here107- Pinkeye 10/10 Classic Halloween108- Starvin' Marvin 9/10 Crude and sweet at the same time109- Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo 11/10 Excellent Christmas episode110- Damien 12/10 My favourite from this season...111- Tom's Rhinoplasty ...11/10 though this was also an excellent show112- Mecha-Striseand 9/10 Great ripping on Striesand!!!113- Cartman's Mon Is A Dirty Sl-t 10/10 This had me hanging...This might be the weakest season of South Park, but it's still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"No commentary? What a waste...","review":"If someone were to re-author the DVDs with the commentary tracks from the Comedy Central CD, I would buy them. Perhaps offer them on Rbay or something... a legal risk probably, but Warner Home Video should know better.I'd sooner pay the same amount for a re-authored set, no matter how illegal, than give one cent to Warner Home Video. I feel totally cheated, and I didn't even buy the thing. One star. Why did they even bother releasing this? Take a look at the Simpsons releases... they're in the Top Ten. They're quality products. Too bad Matt and Trey didn't stand up for their creations and hard work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was unrated...?","review":"I watched a couple of episodes and it was still censored.Have no idea why. I'm really starting to hate Warner Brothers DVDs, because they aren't giving what the consumers demanding (Walk to Remember has lots of cut scenes, see IMDB.com; and why are they holding back on Harry Potter Footage? Why can't they release a special DVD cut? Like the Lord of the Rings?)I'll just stick with FOX TV DVD box sets, thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not it's best season.","review":"Don't immediantly judge me based on my star rating. I've been a fan of South Park since 1997. When it came out, it was actually my favorite show. However, now that I look back on some of the older episodes, I can see the huge flaws in them.The first thing I noticed was that the humor was very differant back then. The current South Park episodes revolve around meaningful plots and have some actual good and funny jokes in them. The older episodes just use lots of bad language to try to be funny. Back in 1997, this was considered shocking and South Park immediantly became popular because of this. Then around the time period of 1999, t.v. started crossing new borders and South Park was no longer new or shocking. It was at this time when the creators changed the show to rely less on language and more on pure humor.Anyway, if you want to get a South Park DVD set, then get Season 3, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Christ what a dissapointment","review":"Ok look, South Park is one of the best animated series ever.

The audio & video are great, with some stereo effects I don't remember being on the tv versions...but there are a plethora of audio \\"pops\\" that are loud and very distracting. I felt I couldn't enjoy the show because I was anticipating the next POP! Also annoying are the intros before the episodes by Trey & Matt...why aren't these bypassable or at the end of the disc as extras? I could stand the intros if there were no pops, but both together are too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, incisive, crude and hilarious.","review":"While perhaps a third of the episodes of South Park do miss their mark, another third are pretty funny and the remaining third are brilliant. Wickedly funny and at times incisive, South Park when at its best delivers big laughs and makes you think a bit too.I watched South Park the day it premiered and have seen many episodes since then. The creators still turn out a fairly consistently clever and funny product even after 10 years. This set gathers together all of the episodes that started the phenomenon back in the very first season and viewers who came to the show after season one will enjoy being able to see these shows without having to wait to catch them in reruns. Collectors and fans of the show will definitely want to own these early gems in what has become a staple of our pop culture. It's worth it just for the first episode; the alien abduction story still makes me laugh as much as the first time I saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs WAY Down for Warner Bros.","review":"My review of one star in no way reflects the quality of these great south park episodes.

In fact, WB is starting to get a nice reputation for being one of the worst distributors of DVDs. As for South Park, the biggest gripe I had was the deletion of the audio commentaries, but I wanted to reserve judgement until I could actually hear them. Now that I have I can only guess that the \\"stardards issues\\" involved one or all of the following: a) fear of a slander lawsuit by Barbara Streisand or Bob Saget, b) Matt and Trey ripping of the movie \\"Contact,\\" which WB owns, or c)several references to Fox, another network Matt and Trey shopped the show to.Whatever the reason, it's nothing a disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD wouldn't have fixed. But even though it pains me that I can't give the DVD 5 stars becasue of Warner's foolishness, I love the show too much to give it 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Bros removed the audio commentary that was promised","review":"I love South Park. I own all of the DVD's already produced for the first season.

However, that commentary has been removed by Warner Brothers, who are the distributers of the DVD Box set. They wanted to censor it, but Parker and Stone would not allow that. The audio commentary is available on a separate CD that you can get IF you pay extra (the box DVD set w/CD is 40 dollars at the CC site plus shipping and handling) or buy it here and pay extra for shipping and handling for the CD when you send proof of purchase to Comedy Central. Just remember that it's Warner Bros. fault...and let them know how you feel about, mmmkay folks?

How about the original Christmas short? Not to look a gift horse in the mouth but I think sales could be driven up and a lot of fans could be made very happy with things like this on what should be the ultimate South Park season one collection.

Got it home, popped in the disk to see my favorite episode, and the box was mislabeled! And the only good extra \\"features\\" are the music videos. I guess I expected a little better than this....

Otherwise this is a funny show with lots of creative episodes and lots of vulgar humor which never gets old.

For the right amount of money, you can be paired up with the perfect mate for you. No need for blind dates and changing your phone number after going out with a psycho. It's simply to good to be true, and you know what old wise ones tell you about that scenario. There is a group of super couples who match up 100% perfectly, but for reasons unknown, they are comitting suicide. Forensic psychologist Chris Lash is called in by Eden Inc. to determine what is going wrong. What Lash discovers will astound you. Will he be able to save the supercouples that are left?The characters in this book are real people. There are no super heroes. There are characters you will cheer for and some you will despise. The plot is well thought out and executed nicely. This book was a breath of fresh air. The ending was predictable and a little bit silly, which is why I didn't give it a 5 star rating. Overall, it is well worth your time and attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heavenly Highlight for Favorite Author Lincoln Child","review":"E-Harmony is an amateur compared to Eden Inc.

A very good read and a very different plot from the regular Preston and Child books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"This rates lower than it would if it were written by another author, because I've come to expect great things from Lincoln Child - either writing alone, or with Preston. And while this book really drew me in to begin with, it got a little stagnant towards the middle. And the end was entirely predictable. It was an interesting plot, but there wasn't enough of a twist to keep it interesting, and I'd say that if you read a lot, it's probably worth it. But if you're only going to read a handful of books this year, I wouldn't recommend it. It was just okay.I'd strongly recommend you check out his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool premise, \\"blah\\" book","review":"Now that I've read both Preston and Child as singular authors and coauthors, I now know Preston seems to be the backbone to Preston/Child's collaborative works. With \\"Death Match\\", Child developed an intriguing premise but failed to execute the story. Despite the promising premise, the story was actually BORING. It was slow-moving, the characters were \\"eh\\", and the end was predictable. It's unfortunate Child didn't have the insight to insert more conspiracy and intrigue, for the \\"long-awaited\\" answer to the deaths ended up being disappointingly simple and obvious. Hopefully Child's \\"Utopia\\" proves to be a more interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be meant for computer types.","review":"This story started out fine.

He sounded eerily computer-generated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise, Flat Ending","review":"The premise was great. The writing in the early part was absorbing. I was hoping against hope the ending would be different. But it became the boring, flat ending I was afraid of.As to Eden, while the premise of an all-knowing computer was intriguing, the extent to which it was pushed, & for a purpose like match-making, made it rather implausible, if not laughable. It is conceivable a computer can hack into that much data. It is rather dubious it can do that a million times without anybody detecting anything.Would have preferred if the novel had taken another direction, like, how all the information in the world still can't predict a perfect match...a little misinterpretation can ruin all the hard data..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Match","review":"These are the kind of books that MOVIES should be made from!

Lash, a psychologist with an FBI background, is hired by the founder and CEO of Eden to investigate.

The storyline became so un-believable that I could not take it anymore.**SPOILER**I stopped reading the book during the chapter where they lost control of the computer and they couldn't turn it off (because it controlled the power), they couldn't slow it down (because it had redundant systems), they couldn't bash it with a sledgehammer (because all of the computer housings were rebuilt w/ hardened steel cases), etc... All of this for a computer system used for match-making?The monster in Relic was actually more believable than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Match Drag","review":"I loved Lincoln Child's other e-books from Amazon but \\"Death Match\\" was a bit tedious. The hero Dr.Christopher Lash was an animated mannequin.

His stories, like the Raven, Tell-Tale Heart, and The Black Cat will keep you engaged and will promote your brain to think if ever human nature is like that, if ever you could be like that.

I read him when I was in high school and fell under his spell. I read him again as an adult, and feel that I am still just touching the tip of his depth. I enjoyed him immensely at bothe levels. He throws in French and Latin quotes that still largely mystify me. But even with those aside the tales are wonderfully mysterious.

It showcases the tales of terror that have enthralled readers of horror for generations. It's a pity that Poe doesn't get the credit he deserves. After all, he was the creater of the detective/mystery. Just read the Murders Of The Rue Morgue,etc.But what I love best about Poe's stories are the psychological tales of horror that he penned. He gave us insights into the dark places of the human psyche. One only has to contemplate the inner meanings of his tales to get at their hidden symbolism,e.g. The Black Cat or William Wilson.

Most of the album has uninspired beats, and they're so obsessed with attacking the more commercial rap artists. The worst offense is the lame Pop Goes The Weasel, where they attack Vanilla Ice and his To The Extreme's multiplatinum success. What's even contradicting is that the group's rapping over a pop song in Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer. The music sounds like some broken food mixer when the parts can't spin and the screws are fallin apart in the mixing bowl. The rest of the album is nowhere as exciting as that solid 1989 debut.

I found it pretty well stated which is not always the case with books that have been translated from the original language. You may or may not agree with Liberation Theology but you will be informed enough by this book so as to be able to talk about it with understanding. This makes the book a worthy read.

The story line was slow. The best part was Patricia Arquette's performance as \\"Alabama\\" the call girl. She is a tough girl whose beautiful face and figure are not hardly damaged after a violent assault scene by one of the bad guys.I guess she wouldn't have been so sexy and cute if they made her realistically look beaten up.

But be patient, you may think people getting married after 3 days or so of knowing each other is stupid, but hang on. Then the action kicks in, the couple find $500,000 worth of coke belonging to the mob. Buth they want to sell it and start their lives again somewhere nice. Superb acting from not only the stars (Slater and Arquette) but the supports and extras (Pitt, Kilmer, Walken, Oldman, Sizemore) too. Great original story and very gripping, nice chunk of action and an ending that'll blow you away and leave you wanting more and more and more. One to buy for sure and to watch over and over.

Good movie all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoid the \\"R\\" Version - Director's Cut is Mandatory","review":"At all costs avoid the \\"R\\" rated version of this film. The distributor had significant cuts made in order to sell it at Walmarts and other middle-American cultural outlets. These aren't just minor changes - indeed, the ending of the \\"R\\" version is different than the \\"NR\\" Director's cut, and the violence is much reduced in several scenes.Make no mistake, the \\"R\\" version is a waste of money. Accept only the Director's cut and you won't be disappointed.All in all, a superb film, with everyone involved at the top of their respective games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew!!!!!!!","review":"Hopper and Walken......What can I say?

It incorporates great action with an intense love story. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette have amazing chemistry. Brad Pitt delivers one of his finest roles in a cameo as a drugged out, but friendly guy (check out the honey container he offers Christopher Walken, in one of the most awkward but funniest scenes I've seen). Worth seeing over and over again as well for Val Kilmer's cameo as Elvis, who guides Christian Slater and gives him courage throughout the movie. Dennis Hopper also delivers a poignant and sweet performance as Christian Slater's somewhat estranged but loving father. Don't miss this one!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever (Guys - don't let the title fool you!)","review":"This is my all-time favorite movie! If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't seen this movie, all I can say is WHY NOT?!? I won't go through the whole story, but suffice it to say that it's an all-star cast, a great story, and a romance movie that guys can totally enjoy too! Not sure what this says about me, but I do think Clarence and Alabama's relationship is the ultimate romance - one I aspire too! ; ) And Gary Oldman should have won an Academy Award for his performance as Alabama's pimp! Definitely one worth having in the DVD library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, especially if you like violence and the mob","review":"I have always enjoyed this movie.

And everyone and their mothers are in this movie. The casting must have cost half the budget. (One wonders why Steve Buscemi wasn't in on this one.) However, the casting and the script are pretty much the only reasons to watch this movie, which is about forty-five minutes too long for its plot. Christian Slater and his unknowing wife (Patricia Arquette) steal half a million dollars' worth of cocaine from a very nasty pimp/dealer (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman, playing as great a bad guy as he did in The Professional) and head for Cali to sell it. Could've been a high-powered action flick (the theft), could have been a good road movie (getting to Cali), could have been another good high-powered action flick (trying to sell the drugs to a hysterically funny Bronson Pinchot), but when the director attempted to glue the pieces together, everything came out flat. For Tarantino completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the fine print.","review":"I purchased this DVD and was satisfied w/the delivery but the seller was in Scotland and the format was for European standards.

I wore two VHS tapes out of this movie....and this was after taping them onto blank tapes, so as not to ruin the originals. This movie, along with Natural Born Killers, are my favorite bedtime movies. I would love to buy the directors cut of this DVD, but will not by one until I see it. I must admit, I am intrigued at the thought of seeing it letterboxed. Please get a letterboxed directors cut in so I can buy it from you. \\"You see, he bought this ring for his sweetheart.

It's got it all; love, sex, drugs, rock n roll, revenge, and plenty of violence with the mother of all endings. This movie is funny as hell too. The Director's Cut is the only way to go with this one to note. Nothing dramatic, just high voltage entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS DVD IS NOT ENHANCED FOR 16X9.","review":"This latest edition which was released in 2007 is a single disc set and the box says enhanced for widescreen.It is not enhanced though.

The DVD is great... if you read the fine print. I purchased, by accident and my fault, a Region 2 DVD. What does that mean? I means only Region 2 players can display it. Where's Region 2, you ask? Ah, well... that would be Europe. I live in the USA which is Region 1. So it was my bad, but still wish a more active effort was displayed by the vendor to illustrate it was not a compatible DVD.

He gets it wrong again and again. It's arrogance at work disguised as an adventure. He's obviously prejudiced(your Sicilian slept around, The Compton schmeel in Res. Dogs), ect. The close-ups of the actors, again and again. Yes, I know they are pretty/cute/important, but just because the director says someone is outta sight, doesn't make it so. Oh, and how can I forget the rambling. On and on about whatever just as long as it doesn't make sense. Like discussing a drug deal on a roller coaster. This is supposed to make Christian Slater hiper than hip, but let's face it. Anyone buying 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine should be able to handle a roller coaster, right?

I didn't care a bit about what happened to these characters, or why they were doing anything. and why the stupid \\"happily ever after\\" ending? if you're trying to make a edgy movie that doesn't follow Hollywood conventions, why do you tack on that ending?

Otherwise, I say pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, overblown, and just plain stupid","review":"I can't imagine being drunk enough to find this movie interesting. It's offensively mindless and incoherent, and some of its scenes really define \\"gratuitous violence.\\" Slater is nice to watch and Pitt is marginally funny; Walken always adds a touch of class and Hopper does a good turn; Kilmer is a voice-over out of focus in the background: but the sum of the parts is not enough to balance the ugliness and mean-spiritedness of the whole. Boy was this movie bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"TARRENTINO IS NOT THE TALENT TEENAGERS IN THEIR 20's THINK","review":"Could have been a good movie, if tarentino's ego were kept under wraps. He inserts himself into everything and HIS actual life is terribly boring. Tarentino's films are universally and fundamentally boring for anyone who has ever lived a real life and not just fantasized about having one. His dipictions of violence eminate from his own personal lack of sexual energy. Sadly, teenage males without girlfriends seem to like these slammed together video games that are being called brilliant, and continue to support the trash factory that generates this type of hyper garbage. It's especially sad when a true film afficienado understands the brilliance of all of the original pictures which he doggedly ripped off and claimed the scenes for his own. If one more person calls this sad, pathetic, lack of a man a genious, I will become even more sick of him. Please get a life and buy a real movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"the other actors in this great movie...","review":"I couldn't read all 100 reviews, but wanted to make sure someone mentioned the other great actors in this picture. Anybody spot chameleon actor James Gandolfini (the Sopranos, the Mexican, the Last Castle, Get Shorty) as Virgil, the mob guy who beats up (I mean beats up) Alabama? If you blink, you'll miss Samuel L. Jackson's appearance. And that's Chris Penn (not Sean as someone mentioned) as Nicky Dimes, and Tom Sizemore (Big Trouble, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down), as Cody. I also didn't see anyone mention Bronson Pinchot, who's quirky character Elliot sort of bookends Serge, the character he played in Beverly Hills Cop. Finally, let's not forget Saul Rubinek (The Family Man, Rush Hour 2, 1000 other movies) as Lee. My point is this picture doesn't just work because of Q.T.s script or Tony Scott's direction, but because they assembled ALL the right people to play the parts, big and small."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is da bomb!!!","review":"true romance is the best christian slater movie i have ever seen & patricia arquette as \\"bama worley\\"is magnificent! i loved brad pitts part as the \\"stoner\\".if you have not seen true romance then you have been missing one of the good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Romance Unrated Directors Cut 2 Disc Special Edition","review":"I have ordered many things from Amazon, This is my first Problem that I have incurred.This movie was advertised as brand new.

They arrive to find the person who sent them, a scientist named Connie Brighten, murdered, and the planet's head of security, Samara, orders them to leave. Instead, they follow thier leads to Nolanda, Ukbar's only forest, where they are told a shuttle might have gone and Mizumi could have been in it....I can't really say what happens after that, but rest assured it has enough action and humor to keep any Dirty Pair fan happy.

I'm a professional engineer and a musician with a lot of MIDI and audio equipment interface, and this has got to be the worst software program I've ever seen. Don't be fooled into \\"upgrading\\" previous versions: they were so primitive that as late as 1996 they actually still used basic program language (.pbl) printer drivers. Try aother brand.

Obviously, there are some pretty good tracks here--Kathleen's Song (although swamped in strings), Pale Blue, Glory Glory--but there are also some absolute stinkers--Tunnel of Love, I Wanna Grow Up to be a Politician. What saved this album for me was Jamaica Say You Will, with a very evocative performance of a great song. This was my introduction to Jackson Browne (who wrote the song), which caused me to buy his first album when it finally came out. Regardless of the merits of the rest of the album, this alone justifies the existence of Byrdmaniax for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Byrds!","review":"I grew up listening to The Byrds, so I went along with all the changes. I loved all the different sounds they provided. My favorite is \\"Sweetheart Of The Rodeo\\", but I never disliked Byrdmaniax or even read the reviews when it was released. I never paid too much attention to that stuff, as most critics usually didn't have a clue, and I was too much the collector to listen to them anyway. :]My favorite tunes from this LP have always been, \\"I Want To Grow Up...\\" and \\"Glory, Glory\\". But really, there is not a bad song on it. I never tried to compare one Byrds LP with another. They're all Great, some better than others, that's all!I'd rate any Byrds LP anywhere from an A+ to a B+.You can't lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably Unremarkable","review":"This stuff doesn't come anywhere near the Byrd's best releases. There is very little attractive about it. The only tracks that come anywhere near the quality I expect out of a good Byrds record are #3 and #6. Do yourself a favor and DON'T get this one. This record is much maligned, and it deserves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than you think!","review":"This is the worst of the Byrds albums. The production is terrible, but may have been necessary to cover-up the poor performances. It seems that the Byrds had run out of songs to record and lacked the enthusiasm to record them. Other reviewers have identified a couple of cuts that are acceptable - I disagree. I can't find a single song that I would ever play again. The McGuinn/White/Parsons/Battin team struck out with this album, but finished on a high note with \\"Farther Along\\", the last Byrds album (before the boring \\"Reunion\\" album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Great","review":"It's so disappointing when a really interesting concept is ruined by horrible, cliche-ridden writing and cringe-worthy dialogue. Such is the case here. The novel starts strong but slides downhill quickly, devolving into a series of ever-more ridiculous scenes with, truly, some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. And without providing any spoilers, the final scene is unintentionally hilarious in its sheer awfulness. Seriously: read anything but this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"As many other reviewers here have noted, the idea is fascinating, but it proves too much for the author to handle. The impact of all the various splinter groups is so vague and confused that it's hard to see how any of them actually affected history, and in fact most seem more interested in increasing their investment portfolios. And if this 'science' was originally developed independently by at least three groups in the 19th century, all of whom managed to build Babbage Difference Engines secretly, then why hasn't a modern group, using modern computers, likewise developed it? The 'secret' of the society is pretty easily cracked by the lead character, who lacks only a cape and a mask to qualify as a super-heroine. Most of the rest of the large cast are pretty much names without faces. And finally, though the book ends, the resolution is vague and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting idea but a stale story.","review":"The idea of clioligy was very interesting and certainly this makes the book worhtwhile to some extent, but the characters are unreasonable and silly in places. For instance the poor woman overcome by lust when she had the game won.(No I don't remember their names...started witha G though...) The clioligy is just window dressing to a poor spy novel. I was hoping to see characters working over a long term trying to influence history and really exploring the possibilities. I'd probably try something else if I was looking for a good sci fi read. However,I will keep my copy for the clioligy appendix. Interesting idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the Wormhole answers all your questions","review":"Morgan Freeman has an authoritative voice, which makes you think he wrote the DVDs all by himself. But he probably got some help.I first saw this series when I was in a nursing home after I drank too much wine and fell on the hardwood floor of my house. In the nursing home, every bed had a TV, and if you didn't turn up the volume on yours you would hear all the crap from the other TVs. When I found Morgan Freeman on the Science Channel,I got really mad when I couldn't hear what he was saying. As Jean-Paul Sartre once said: \\"hell is other people\\". So when I got home with my cat Monkey and only one TV and no wine, I started buying Through the Wormhole. You can watch it on the Science Channel, but you'll be bombarded with crappy commercials which are louder than Morgan Freeman. I have the first three seasons and they're all excellent. I'll get season four as soon as it comes out. Monkey likes Through the Wormhole.

First of all, this book is SEVEN years old and unrevised. It still thinks they are two AWA essays, even though there's only one now. More importantly, this book doesn't even know about the existence of the Integrated Reasoning section, which was introduced in June, 2012. It may be that this book is unintimidating to a beginning, but that's because the questions are on the easy side and the advice is superficial and generic. If you use this book as a starter, you definitely need a more solid book to get you up to speed. Honestly, I would recommend not wasting money on this particular volume. There are just too many excellent prep sources from which to choose ---- it just doesn't make sense to spend money on mediocre out-of-date material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I used this book as my only prep material for the GMAT. I mainly studied the Quantitative material and spent several months reading and studying every concept. I took the practice math exam in the book and finished it early - only missing one question.When I took the actual GMAT the math was nothing like what I studied in this book. It was much more difficult and had far more data sufficiency question types than this book predicted. There are only a few pages to prepare you for those kinds of questions and it left me totally unprepared. I did not finish the math questions in time and scored far below my potential.I will be purchasing a different book to study the math concepts that are actually tested on the GMAT. Overall I am very disappointed that I used this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"scared of the GMAT? good book to break you in","review":"The GMAT prep books can be overwhelming, especially for those of us who have been out of college more than 5 years! I tried starting w/ the OG and my moral was crushed! This \\"dummies\\" book, like all \\"dummies\\" books is very straightforward and simply written. Which is a good thing! If you have the luxury of having at least 2 months to study and therefore have the time to work through this book, invest in it! it is a good book to start with to not only explain the test, but to also give you some basic practice questions, some tips on strategy and some decent solution explanations. Good confidence builder prior to moving onto the OG, Kaplan, Barrons, EZ Solutions. From this book(again assuming you have at least 2 months to study) I would move onto Crackin the Gmat, then onto Kaplan and Official Guide(OG), for extra practice throw in Barrons and for subject specific help, look into EZ Solutions and PowerScore...=)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This new edition is completely different and much bettter!","review":"The previous reviews must be about an earlier edition of this book because I thought it was an excellent study aid for the GMAT. There were no typos that I could see, and the material was right on relevant to the way the questions are presented on the GMAT test.The book was easy to read and actually (gasp!) made studying for the GMAT enjoyable. The practice test seemed to be at the same level as the actual GMAT, not harder and not easier.This is a great prep tool. Check out this new edition by new authors. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice review, but watch out for some of the questions","review":"This is an excellent book to start with. Very quick to go through, and once you get the basics/tricks down the problems in the Barron's/Kaplan/Princeton Review books become much easier.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"If you want a book to give you an idea of what to expect this is the one. It's a very easy read, and gives you the basics to start studying for the GMAT. I wouldn't recommend this book to be the only one you look at before taking your GMAT. If you did that, you would be very unprepared. Look into buyingThe Official Guide for GMAT Review, 12th Edition,The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review, 2nd Edition, andThe Official Guide for GMAT Verbal Review, 2nd Editionif you are serious about taking the GMAT. They are a lot more informative and give you many more test questions to study with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for beginners","review":"This is a book for everyone who needs the get an idea about the gmat.

Only downside is that red-eye reduction feature is not very effective. The use of a red-eye lamp seems less effective than the strobe type flashing that my previous Canon (SD110) used for red-eye reduction. Easy to fix in iPhoto though, so no biggie. Oddly, Canon has the image quality preset to fine, rather than superfine, which makes for smaller image file sizes but doesn't use the full capability of the sensor. I didn't discover that until I'd used it for a day. It's an easy setting to change and you never have to worry about it again.

After speaking to a friend who has sold cameras in the past, I was advised to go with a canon because they all have a glass lens instead of plastic. I find this camera very easy to use. After reading the owners manual only once I am able to use the manual settings easily. The only problem I have had, is that when I use manual mode and zoom in on anything, I tend to get blurry pictures. I'm assuming this is a problem with me not the camera. I may need to adjust shutter speed in some of these modes. I purchased lithium batteries and have been pleased with the battery life. The software is easy to use, and uploading pictures to my computer and the internet has been easy. I have not printed any yet. My sister also has a canon powershot, the one she has is 5 megapixels and she is just as pleased as I am with my 7.1 megapixel. I think this camera was great deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small package; BIG photos","review":"I still shoot 35mm film with my Canon AE1, but I've been looking for a small digital I can carry in a pocket or small bag while traveling. I've always trusted Canon's quality, so after research, I chose this one. I just returned from Alaska, and found this little camera went places my film camera couldn't.. like trail riding outside of Skagway. The camera easily fit into my jacket pocket and I could still photograph from the back of a moving horse without dropping the reins to focus. I never really thought I'd find a digital camera that could perform as well as my trusty Canon AE1, but this definitely does at 1/4 the weight. Get one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try to expediate this product","review":"I spent 30.00 extra to get this product expediated to the person I bought it for.

This book certainly confirms that view. From the very beginning, one thinks, \\"Wow, this guy REALLY knows what he's talking about.\\" Hardy was, in fact, one of the greatest number theorists of the twentieth century. Hardy gives actual intuitive motivation for almost all of the theorems in the book (intuition is often overlooked by mathematical authors who use the confusing traditional \\"theorem-proof\\" approach), and his proofs are elegant and easy to follow. Once, I spoke to the chair of the math department at a major University (Wash U. in St. Louis) and he told me that he reads Hardy and Wright at least once a year to refresh himself on the basics. I would recommend this book to anyone who is learning about number theory for the first time, and wishes to pursue the subject through self-study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Bevington!","review":"Although the product description includes a long section called \\"From the Back Cover\\" which explains in excruciating detail why the Bevington is the best edition, it turns out this text has nothing to do with this item and is not the back cover text. This is not the Bevington edition, and the much praised notes and numbering system are not used in this item.This description should be modified, as it is extremely misleading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Kindle was made for...","review":"As I had another version of the complete works of Shakespeare in old-fashioned book format, I hesitated a while before buying the same thing for Kindle. What was the point? I knew most of the plays anyway, being a WS fangirl. I was finally tempted by the apocryphal content. A couple I had heard of, but most of them I didn't know.One of the advantages of the Kindle (and forgive me for stating the obvious) is that no matter what size the material you are reading is, your book format remains the same. And this is no small consideration when you're dealing with a writer as prolific as Will. My paper and ink version is an absolute doorstep and therefore I'm hardly going to pick it up on a whim to re-read Hamlet, however much I love the play. Now, however, it's as simple as clicking on the list in the table of contents.The layout is easy to read, the content doesn't need me to review it, and I'm thoroughly enjoying spending time with old friends. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is an absolute waste of your time and money","review":"No table of contents. No way to figure out what play you are reading without going back to start of the play. No indication of how far you have progressed in the play. None of the nice features described in reviews of the hardcover version - just straight text with no annotations or introductory essays. An absolutely poor execution of conveting what likely a great book into a less than substandard kindle edition. AMAZON, PLEASE PULL THIS TITLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE KINDLE LIBRARY. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible formatting","review":"Don't buy this if you want to read it, the formatting is terrible. It's like whoever created it just rendered the public domain version in notepad and converted that to a e-book.

I was misled by reviews of the paper version and did not realize that the kindle version is unusable until I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful extras","review":"I already have a 'Complete Works of Shakespeare' on Kindle. The advantage of this edition (apart from the fact that it is cheap) is all the 'extras' It has those hard-to-get 'apocryphal' plays which I happen to have a reason to study. For me this alone makes it a good deal. But the other extras are useful too particularly the commentaries by Johnson and Hazlitt. Modern Shakespeare scholars often refer to these works and it convenient to have them ready-to hand on my Kindle. It is easy to navigate using the TOC (which is where some Kindle editions fall down on the job). So all in all I rate it as excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What table of contents?","review":"I just purhased this version of Shakespeare's Complete Works and there is no table of contents when you open it!

This is great for students in particular for so much is available at just a click of the Kindle keyboard.

In this Kindle ebook, stage directions fall right inline with the text, undelimited, hard to distinguish from the dialogue. Also, the speaker's name is not offset. The Mobi editionComplete Works of William Shakespeare. 154 Sonnets, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, The Tempest, Julius Caesar, King ... Cressida, The Winter's Tale & more (mobi)is just a few cents more and puts stage directions in brackets and tabs in the speaker's name. Those are subtle differences that actually make a huge difference when reading the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book to Begin Your Shakespeare Studies With!","review":"Bevington's The Complete Works of Shakespeare is an excellent place to start or continue one's study of Shakespeare and the Rennaissance Period. This is the book we used in my Shakespeare class in college and I found it extremly helpful in understanding not only Shakespeare, but also Elizabethan England. Bevington includes plenty of pictures to help one see what it looked like in the middle to late 16th Century and early 17th Century. Also, Bevington includes indepth introductions to each of the plays and explanatory notes on words Shakespeare used in a different context from what we use them today. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to start or continue to study the Bard."},{"rating":"1","title":"turn back, it's a trick!","review":"Perhaps this actually is the complete works of Shakespeare,but with no table of contents, or section headings or anything similar, it is impossible to use.

I would have given it 5 stars for content alone, but in order to get at that content, you need a good table of contents. There actually is one, but you won't find it under the GO TO button.

Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is a Guttenberg Project text and probably illegal","review":"To my great disappointment, the Kindle edition is simply a Guttenberg Project text, complete with their copyight notices prohibiting commercial distribution. The Kindle publishers did not even bother to add a usable table of contents. How can one locate anything in 50,000+ pages of text without any cross-referencing? I will be informing Guttenberg project about this - they are being ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will there be new favorites?","review":"I am very happy with this collection, especially considering these new plays!

I always loved 'My mistresses eyes are nothing like the sun...' and my favorite plays are Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Midsummer Night's Dream...With this collection, what is really exciting me is that I can't wait to see if any of the new plays are good enough to get into the top favorite positions...We'll see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A favorite line marred by typo","review":"Having just downloaded my copy, I eagerly searched for some favorite quotes.

Its everything I was looking for and a bit more. I wanted a complete Shakespeare collection, with all his plays and poetry, so it was great to find this one that had these extra plays as well to make it the most complete collection.

If you are not experienced in reading shakespeare, this is NOT for you. The annotations that it claims to have are there, but there are not at the bottom of the page like they are in a book, you have to go search in the poorly designed appendix for the annotations.NO LINE NUMBERS. If you buy this for a college class, you will be lost.

The Bevington book is only for sale in hard copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare is an inspiration","review":"I think Shakespeare is an inspiration. The fact that after so many hundreds of years, people still relish his work and still find amazing beauty, mystery and wonder in his words shows what a amazing genius he was.I often wonder about today's literature and if it can possibly stand the test of time the way Shakespeare's has. And I seriously doubt it.What I think is most amazing is that whenever a new medium tp publish arrives, Shakespeare is still one of the first writers to be showcased. And rightly so!As for the collection, I can't really fault it. My favorites are there and its really nice that the publisher has collected not only the traditional, but these apocryphal plays. It immediately drew me to it. I have already read one of the new plays and it was fascinating from many different perspectives. I can't wait to read the others, although I am trying to pace myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly formated piece of garbage.","review":"There is no table of contents. Best you get are categories \\"Comedy's\\", \\"Tragedies\\", etc. From there you have to flip page by page to the play you want to read hoping that you one day find it.

There are singable songs for family moments (Bathtime, Eight Piggies and Teddy Bear Hug). There are danceable songs for music and movement session (Brown Girl in the Ring, Let's Make Some Noises and The Mountain Polka). There are two precious international children's songs(Savez-Vous, Russian & Haru Ga Kita, Japanese). The theme \\"Everything Grows\\" rings through all songs and summarizes the CD with sound of waves to introduce \\"Just like the Sun\\" that says the prayer of thankfulness for gifts mother nature gives for everyone.

Like all other fans of Iced Earth I was quite shocked by Matthew Barlow's choice to leave the band, and also quite disheartened that this might be the end, then came \\"The Reckoning,\\". I would like to say that I am also a fan of Tim Owens, I like his vocal approach and style. The Reckoning is just a sample of things to come for this band, it is a change from their darker stylings to something of a new direction. John Schaffer proves himself a craftsman, for proof listen to their past albums and then listen to this single. It holds it's own against Barlow's godly voice.In short they prove themselves worthy of being one of the best metal bands out there, especially when the music industry is producing such crap that the truly talented are often overlooked.The Reckoning is the future for a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THE CHEAP ONE!!!!!!!","review":"I got this for 4.99 from a private seller Not Amazon.

Pull stroke saws can be thin, are easier to control, and cut fast. I have three sizes of these, the big 18 inch one is great for cutting beams, or those landscape timbers, 4x4, 4x6. I got aquanted with Japanese saws as a woodworker cutting dovetails, and those are very thin and expensive, very fine teeth, but best for very detailed work, and you don't want to use it except for that.These saws are an affordable alternative to push saws, which unless you spend a lot of money, or know how to set the teeth and file them, have never been all that useful to me. And these are much easier to cut a straight line with.Get one and see for yourself.

It is as good as Soilwork used to be, and their sound can be compared in a sense to Darkane as well. It is different than Dark Tranquillity, however, whom I still like the best out of the melodic death genre. They deserve four stars for their efforts here, but they lack the variety and technical skill of that band. Don't get me wrong, they are good. Any fan of the Swedish/Finnish \\"Gothenburg\\" melodic death metal style will enjoy this Dutch band. Check out their previous album. It is just as good, if not better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoving Was A Jerk","review":"Thomas Hoving was an arrogant jerk.

Now, having read the book, I know slightly more than less than any human alive. It's an easy, fun, broad introduction to art. It suffers terribly from insufficient illustrations (what do you want for the low price?) and the color prints are in isolated sections that are not well keyed to the text which means you spend a fair amount of time looking for the piece in question. All said there is good information from a reliable source for someone just \\"walking in the door\\", so to speak.From here the next two books are the much more thorough and pricier books: \\"History of Art: Slipcased\\" (sixth edition) by Jansen and, for art appreciation, \\"Living With Art\\" (fifth edition) by Rita Gilbert. They are the standards in their respective fields. These two and, of course trips to your local museum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting, few illustrations","review":"I have to disagree with any reviewer who says it's okay for an ART book not to have lots of illustrations! This book has very few illustrations, most of them in black and white - and the color ones are too small and are not good reproductions. If the writing were really good, I might be able to overlook the lack of illustrations, but it's just mediocre.

More Like Swing the Blues!","review":"The sound of Count Basie's orchestra was one that influenced a new direction in swing music. The driving pulse of his rhythm section and the emotion of the soloists characterized this new direction. On BUCK AND BUDDY BLOW THE BLUES one can hear what has happened to the sound of the Count Basie Orchestra as the players matured into their own musicians. All of the players on this record, except for the pianist for obvious reasons, played with Count Basie during their careers. The influence of playing with Basie can be heard in the ferocity of the swing, though at the same time one can hear the amount of relaxation with which each musician plays now that they have come into their own. Overall, this album shows Buddy Tate and Buck Clayton in a fresh light, a light that has become their own through age and experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscin' on Buck and the All-star Jams..","review":"This is a well recorded, swinging session from 1961. I have not seen too many Clayton All-Star Jams reissued, so this is as close as it may get. Buddy Tate, in the first track, \\"Rompin' At Red Bank\\" 'tips his hat' to Lester by playing the signature riff from \\"Afternoon of a Basie-ite\\". Barring any other reissues of Buck's legendary (and prolific) All-Star recordings - one in particular, with Ruby Braff, and even Jimmy Rushing is stunning for its feel and flawless master recording (on Columbia LP) would really be nice to see, but this one serves well. Sir Charles Thompson, Gene Ramey, and Gus Johnson definately \\"Blow The Blues\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent quality","review":"These are nice enough, but I don't think I would pay more than $10-$15 tops for a set of 2--certainly not the ridiculously inflated \\"list\\" price of $75!

I'm replacing a very old Radio Shack Realistic stereo receiver and Epicure 150 studio monitors. the salt in the air finally did in this old reliable equipment. Since the TEAC hasn't yet arrived, I connected the SS-B3000's to a SONY STR-K660P 5.1 receiver. Wow, was I impressed. They sound nice sitting right on the floor, no need to elevate them. Although, I've only spent a few hours listening, I must say they are well worth $99.00. Thanks Amazon for such a quick shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"Amazon has jacked up the price of these and all the rest of their Sony speakers they have in stock. My wish list literally says the price has increased by 63% since I added them to my list. I gave the item 5 stars, because I've found Sony makes fantastic audio products and usually they're affordable. I'll wait and see if Amazon gets their pricing right again and I'll buy these. I wish I would have just clicked \\"purchase\\" instead of \\"add to wishlist\\" a few weeks back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really impressed with speakers","review":"Wow, I am really impressed with these speakers. I compaired them to a set of Pioneer speakers and although they do not have the depth of the 12\\" base speakers of the Pioneer, they did hold their own. The mid-range and the tweeter or upper range speakers are exceptional. With the Graphic Equilizer in the 1500W pre-amp, I can seperate the sounds and get a true evaluation of the three levels of output,and I am really impressed with this product. For speakers that do not have the foot print of the 12\\" woofer system, the Sony SS-B3000 speaker system does an excellent job of transporting the sound from CD/Record/USB device or the I-pod to a clear and crisp musical representation. I must point out that I used 18 gage speaker wire and not the smaller gage wire that came with the speakers. Perhaps that improves the sound quality. I would highly recommend these speakers to anyone who does not want to spend far too much money, but has a good appreciative ear for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"I bought these speakers on a tight budget to replace an aged and worn-out pair of Klipsch bookshelf speakers that I bought over 25 years ago for $450. These little Sonys for less than $100 sound every bit as good as the Klipsch in the mid and upper range. Bass is OK. You might add a subwoofer if you really need to feel the low notes. Sony can't beat the Klipsch for heft and appearance, but they SOUND great. Their subdued black appearance will blend with any room.

Great improvement with a lot more power and clarity compared with the old smaller bookshelf speakers. Just note that these will not disappear into the room. They are decent sized, however, the added power and clarity more than make up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for the money","review":"I bought the SONY B3000 speakers to go with the TEAC AG-790A receiver because my old system (more expensive) was rumbling and couldn't be fixed.

I think they are a very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers, but shallow sound","review":"I'm on a tight budget because I'm a college student and I was looking around everywhere for speakers that could handle everything by themselves (good bass quality, nice highs and mids). As of right now, my setup only has these two speakers and they are hooked up to a Denon AVR-1507 and they sound really good. The only concern of mine with the speakers is that the sound seems a little on the shallow side for the bass, but its not too bad. By themselves these speakers definitely can stand on there own and for anybody on a budget looking for great speakers these are it. I feel that even though the bass is just a tad shallow it doesn't merit giving these speakers 4 stars, they are definitely 5 star speakers. As soon as I pair these with a woofer, I'm sure they would sound even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound for the $","review":"Sony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers with 8-Inch Woofer (Pair, Black)These guys sounded so good at such a good price I just ordered aother pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"The bottom line is that these speakers are flat. that makes them great for a studio but not very fun to listen to for most people.

I had listened to the smaller versions of these but were 2-ways with little bass. These 3-ways are the way to go along with a center speaker for voice and a sub-woofer for bass. Best Buy could get these at $110 a pair but when I ordered them, they never called me while the same day I ordered these from Amazon and they showed up a day earlier than Best Buys would have...plus Amazon shipping was free and no tax.

Excellent definition but a little on the bright side. I would prefer a fuller, warmer midrange. I'm using these on a pair of wooden floor stands that gets the speakers about 14\\" off the floor, which enhanced clarity and smoothed out the bass response. With this and a discontinued Sony receiver, I was able to get a great sound system for my high-ceiling bedroom for about $150."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice inexpensive speakers","review":"I bought these speakers along with a Pyle Home PCA4 Mini 2x75 Watt Stereo Power Amplifier.

The speakers hit the lows well while not sacrificing any of the highs. And did I say these speakers can get loud? However, don't plan on matching them with a receiver that matches their watts perfectly or you will blow the mid and tweeter speakers. I had a perfect receiver matched up with it and 2 of the 3 speakers don't work. Thankfully, Sony has a good warranty and are being fixed free of charge.

Great buy, and know I'm getting something good from Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small and clean","review":"Bought as part of a system of matched speakers and Amp.They do take alot of power to drive I will say that.Good sound needs a sub for the lows, I think Im used to the Sub Lows by now anyway.This is a Balanced speaker No speaker over rides the other, Havent fully pushed them yet, But I will see what they can take.The written specs they have from Sony are true specs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Serve My Purpose","review":"I simply wanted to receive better sound from my Mitsubishi DLP HDTV.

Let me tell you, this record is no different. Naysayers would have you believe this album is a pretentious, even masturbatory, mesh of children's music cliches, but one needs to look no further than the opening track to see this is simply not true. The song, Baby Beluga, opens to the sound of whales communicating amongst each other. This ambiance is broken almost too soon by Raffi's commanding voice, as he belts out the oh-so-familiar lyrics to a song we all know and love. Other tracks worthy of noting include \\"Kumbaya\\" and first single \\"This Old Man\\", which features Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) on drums. All in all, this is a VERY solid record and one of the greatest children's albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"Generally I don't like to listen to children's music but I make an exception for Raffi.

All his music CDs are highly recommended and this title is selected and referenced on Garden Haiku p.98. This album is very special with the famous Baby Baluga, who will teach young children to love sea life and be eco-friendly. By asking Baby Baluga \\"is your mama home?\\", kids and moms are bound to laugh and imagine themselves to be whales in the big wide ocean. All the songs in this collection are Raffi's classics. This CD is perfect for playtime, a trip to sea world or simply when you want to hear your children's singing and laughing voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raffi CD - great!","review":"Great children songs!

I bought this for my 10 month old grand daughter and her mom and I know every word. Cailyn gets such a kick out of the songs. She will bounce or sway and the songs are easy to learn and sing to her. Baby Beluga is a great bedtime song, fussy baby song. Also the song \\"All I really need\\" is such a sweet song. It's so true. Babies don't need so many \\"things\\".

I am so pleased and happy to have found it. He would ask me to sing Baby Beluga to him when I would visit, but I had never heard of it. I found it on Amazon and bought 2.

Robson puts massive amounts of historical and visual details in her book and doesn't develop the characters well.

If you want to paint a picture of this time, read the book, but if you want a story, pass over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO much detail","review":"I loved RIDE THE WIND and other books by this author, but this one is a struggle for even a history lover to read. I appreciate the exhaustive research she obviously put into the book, but the details obscure the characters and make the novel dull, dull, dull. Unless there are well-developed characters, all the earthy language and descriptions of customs in the 17th century won't make an interesting book. This was supposed to be a historical NOVEL, wasn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"I had never heard of this album when I got it. The casual Byrds fan is probably unfamiliar with it because it was released a while after they had reached the commercial peak. It is full of hummable, well-sung, and well-played country rock songs. The style of playing on the allbum is not that close to stuff like \\"mr. tambourine man\\" and \\"turn turn turn\\" so be warned. But if you think you might like an album of (mostly, some stuff veers into psychedelia and swamp rock) really good country rock you won't be dissapointed with \\"untitled/unissued\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"and a half, as well","review":"For years, the only Byrds' songs I heard were from their greatest hits collection. I never imagined they had transformed themselves so much in the late '60s, early '70s. After buying The Notorious and Sweetheart albums, I willingly spent 25 dollars for this CD. What a treasure! The only songs I dislike are Eight Miles High (too long and too boring) and Yesterday's Train, which is hokey and too oaty for me. Otherwise, this is a fine collection of rock/country songs. I'm a little amazed that this hasn't gotten more attention. In fact, I'm amazed that many of their later albums haven't gotten more attention. I'm hooked, and now I want to check out the Flying Burrito Brothers and others of that ilk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence...","review":"This Byrds album is something of a special gift to any who take the time to listen. Unwrap it and listen for the first of many times with relish. These live tracks on the first disk have been vastly improved in quality, on my old disk \\"Nashville West\\" faded with the first guitar riff! They take on a new and better quality from the original studio versions thanks largely to Clarence White and Gene Parsons. The studio tracks are mostly brilliant songs brilliantly executed. McGuinn's partnership with Jacques Levy produced some of the most introspecitve and touching songs in the whole Byrds catalog. The second disk hails a much improved version of \\"All the Things\\" as well as \\"Lover of the Bayou.\\" The live versions were typical of the early seventies Byrds, a great live lineup. Missing out on this terrific double album, especially if you are a fan of country rock, would not be advisable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"actually four and a half","review":"I'm normally skeptical of expanded reissues, as too often the extra tracks consist of inferior material that dilutes the power of the original release.Not the case here. This incarnation of the Byrds was a smokin' live band, and the additional live material here showcases the band at its live best. The bonus studio tracks are as strong as the original studio material.This was the last truly great Byrds album, and the additional disc of bonus material actually makes it stronger. Combine the strength of the previously unreleased material with great remastering, great packaging and great liner notes, and you have a reissue project second to none and certainly as good as what has been done with the Who's catalog. Who's Next, EMI?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is one of the top albums of the golden era of \\"rock\\", that is1967-1975.

I as well as all their fans miss them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Y?N-Vee Tells You Why You Are Some Tricks-In-Training","review":"A group out of south central in '94 appeared on 2Pac's Thug Life CD and made an impact so much that they was given an opportunity to show off the pimptress lyrics and sounds on the debut and only album that featured the hit \\"Chocalate\\", a remake of the classic of the late Rick James \\"Mary Jane\\". Also, I agree their version of \\"I'm Goin' Down\\" is better than Mary J's and this was released before hers subsequently in early '95 but did not get a lot of airplay on the radio. Some of the songs on here don't have the best production but Y?N-Vee makes up with their g-funk lyrics and voices like on \\"Tricks-N-Training\\"(my favorite), \\"Str8 Hustler\\", the title track \\"Y?N-Vee\\" in which they rip the track up, and \\"We've Got A Good Thang\\".

Truth is, the people around Cole should never have let her issue this overripe execution of underdone fare.

I'm all for expermentation and pushing the envelope, but when you're singing about critics negatively reviewing your album (as Paula does on AMEN), it feels to me that not only did she make a BAD album, she KNEW she did. I attempted to exchange this at a used CD store in my neighborhood, and the dealer had more than he needed, and refused me. 3 weeks after this album's release. That speaks volumes, people.

The orginality and spark that marked her last two albulms has been replaced by a vapid, polished, overproduced and preaching list of songs. One of her songs, refers to all the \\"jaded\\" people who will react negatively to her new direction. Add to that, that from most of the songs, Paula seems to think she's become a representation of inner city life, going so far as to adapt a Zola Neal Hurston story and to explain in other songs how rough she has it and the \\"Full of herself\\" meter is filling up fast. Besides the music lacking inspiration, the lyrical cleverness so apparant on \\"This Fire\\" seems to have been replaced by her deisre to repent for past behavior. Definitley one of the major disappointments of this year. I've already sold the disc to a used music store. Save your money and buy a CD at random for better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare to This Fire","review":"After listening to Amen I would think twice about purchasing another Paula Cole CD. I was extremely disappointed in the Amen CD considering I loved This Fire. It doesn't appear that Paula Cole is writing songs that the same audience would appreciate. In addition, a lot of the words of the songs are barely audible making listening to the words in your car, let alone anywhere else, practically impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music , great singer","review":"This particular CD, as i am writing, is now unavailable. I definitely enjoyed listening to this album the first time it came out. With the four extra tracks on this import CD, distributed by WB records Australia, makes it more a worth buy! All superb sounds, moving beat, and passion. Music is missed by the likes of Ms. Cole's absence nowadays. Do hope someday she'll make a great comeback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula, Stick with what you know.....","review":"\\"Amen\\" equals \\"Ouch\\". Paula, if it ain't broke don't fix it.....This departure into soul/r&b/rap stinks on ice. You are an exquisite vocalist and writer,,,,why have you taken the low road and produced such a typical sound on this new cd? You have been an extraordinary new force on the music scene since \\"Harbinger\\" and I have been a fan since day one, seeing you perform live in tiny venues such as Philadelphia's Tin Angel before no one knew your name.....and now with the success of \\"This Fire\\"s\\" worst song...\\"I don't want to wait\\" you continue the popsy, common sound on \\"Amen\\". Yuck. This schlock belongs on AM radio.....'nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush Job","review":"You would think in the CD age, a person could afford to put more than 9 songs on a CD. This is obviously a rush job for Paula, and a ripoff for anyone who pays full price for this CD. Not to mention, of the nine songs, there are only a few choice cuts on the CD to choose from. The opening track \\"I Believe in Love\\" is the real highlight of the album, although the lyrics sound a bit lame. Whatever Paula is going through right now personally, I can respect, but this CD really underlies her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula, What Happened?","review":"I would most certainly consider myself a BIG Paula Cole fan. I would consider Amen to be a BIG Paula Cole disapointment. This CD completely lacks the passion that fills her other musical efforts. I would even go so far as to say that this CD is not even worthy of a third listen. I listened twice to make sure I wasn't missing something. I wasn't. Hey, I know that not every CD by an artist will hit a home run. This one doen't even make it off the bench."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amen For Paula","review":"I really liked this CD. You really can't expect Paula to want to duplicate the same style as she did on 'This Fire' do you? I loved about 6 songs of the 9 on the cd. The songs are long enough to make up for the low number. I didn't feel she was preaching, only showing her spiritual side. Her voice is soothing and comforting. Now, it all depends on which mood I'm in and which of her cd's I'll listen to at that time. I loved This Fire. I want to buy Harbinger next. Anyone who loves Paula Cole's voice should buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe in....","review":"I was SO excited when I heard the first single off this album...then I bought it. How could someone create a masterpiece like \\"I Believe in Love\\" and then fill the rest of the cd with diary entries? How could someone as talented and original and unique as Paula Cole display NONE of those attritutes on her new album, except for one track?? How could an artist listen to the final product and not think, \\"you know, it sounds like we put all our efforts into the first song, let's go back to the studio!\\"? I can't believe the same person I saw progress from \\"Harbinger\\" to \\"This Fire\\" put out such a dull, trite, insipid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula Cole finds God, loses music. . .","review":"If Whitney Houston was backed up by the theme from \\"Shaft\\" you'd have Paula's new sound. . .it's new, it's old, it's very odd, and it's not much like the wonderful and idiosyncratic set of previous CD's she's done. I'm waiting for the next one and hoping that her original, erotic and beautiful voice and song writing style return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Overall, Amen is a well put together album with songs that explore Rap(i.e. Rhythm of Life)and some R&B. The most \\"Paula Cole\\"-like song is the first track, \\"I Believe In Love.\\" Althought this album is well put together, some songs lack development. The most developed songs that are on this album are \\"I Believe In Love,\\" \\"Amen,\\" \\"Pearl,\\" and \\"Be Somebody.\\" Definitely a more unique album that Paula has released, \\"Amen\\" doesn't include the strong beats and powerful lyrics that \\"Harbinger\\" and, certainly, \\"This Fire\\" has included that most Paula Cole fans have been listening to in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, rich vocals. Not overblown in any way.","review":"Paula Cole has the ability to \\"go off\\" with her vocal prowess like Michael Bolton and his falsetto histronics however, she doesn't, and it is a welcome surprise. Amen opens with strength that I haven't heard or felt in a long time. Yes, it sounds like \\"Disco\\" but, it is much more than that. Bottom line: Paula Cole can sing and she shows that on Amen. I really enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori and Sarah do it better...","review":"What can i say besides \\"yuck\\"? i loved \\"This Fire\\", but \\"Amen\\" definitely does not meet the same standard of quality. Let's face it though, Paula will never surpass her other female peers such as Tori Amos or Sarah Mclachlan in terms of music or lyrics. Go buy Mirrorball or To Venus And Back. One reviewer below said that Paula had more to offer than songs for a Dawson's Creek soundtrack...Well, i agree, she does have more to offer. Unfortunately, nobody wants it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I'll keep this short...like the length of time that I owned this album before selling it back to a local CD store. One customer who previously reviewed this album on Amazon.com said it best: \\"What is this, Christian Rock?\\" I own the 2 previous albums by Paula Cole, and this third one absolutely stinks--it's whiney, has too many religious undertones, is often very cheesy and sadly mainstream--Which is why you'll find it typically on most of your \\"Top 40's Hit's\\" Radio stations--right along with Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this? Christian rock?","review":"I didn't expect an album called \\"Amen\\"-especially coming from Paula Cole-to LITERALLY be filled with God-speak and dull lyrics. \\"I want to be somebody...for we all are children of the father\\" or \\"I wanna be free\\" sounds like something from \\"We are the world\\". Too many songs on this album are dragging, simplistic, and preachy. I'm going to the CD exchange place as soon as possible. I give one star for \\"I Believe in Love\\", the only song with potential on the album, although it, too, lacks originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please go away......","review":"Paula Cole is easily one of the most overrated performers of the past decade. Her voice is weak, her production is sloppy, \\"Where have All the Cowboys Gone\\" has some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever heard, and if I have to hear \\"I Don't Want to Wait\\" once more I will throw myself in front of a bus. As part of my job, I had to review the \\"Amen\\" CD. I couldn't listen to it all the way through. Simply awful, pretentious and preachy. And it is a complete flop, both critically and commercially. Maybe now we will never have to hear her again. Now, if the same thing would only happen to Jewel....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please go away.","review":"Paula Cole is easily one of the most overrated performers of the past decade.

At not even platinum, it seems that the 2 million or so who were suckered in by its predecessor [thank goodness for promo CDs] knew better the second [or third, but who heard the first one?] time around. Music masochist that I tend to be at times, I finally decided to dive head first, barely surviving this self-prophecy at its most self-aggrandized. My grade: C-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent disc from Paula Cole and her band","review":"I bought this album because of the excellent song \\"i believe in love\\" and I have to say that this is for sure one of the best albums that I have heard this year. Paula's voice is full of soul and character and makes for a joyful listen throughout the disc. \\"Amen.\\" is like a storybook, with each song weaving a different tale. The musical arragement and lyrics are some of the best that I have heard in awhile. I have never really heard any of the other Paula Cole albums but I'm probably going to buy them to see if they are as good or even better than \\"Amen\\". I only have one problem with this disc, 9 songs isn't totally enough for me, so that's why I gave it 4 stars but other than that it's a wonderful cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Has All the Talent Gone?","review":"Forget \\"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone\\". Where has Paula Cole's talent gone? Except for the opening track, it's not on display on this disappointing, forgetable cd. It's nowhere near as good as THIS FIRE.Sorry Paula, but this stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better.","review":"Amen should have been called \\"This little fire\\". I am writing this review without comparing this CD to Paula Cole's earlier works. There are some really good songs like \\"Amen, Pearl, Free, I believe in love\\". Then there are ones like \\"Rythm of life\\" for which I just can't say any words.What was she trying here?. All of them sound or seem to reflect a more gentle or mellow Paula Cole. The best song on this CD has to be \\"Be somebody\\".Pearl Amen and Free give the CD life and \\"I believe in love\\" might give it some staying power. But I am kind of confusd about what Paula is trying to say this time?. Or maybe the problems with me, I read too many lyrics. Overall a good CD by Paula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from good","review":"I enjoyed her first cd so much I cant believe this is the same girl.There is 2 or 3 good tracks the rest are boring and yes I listened to it at least 10 times thinking I might change but no it did not happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Paula, get it together","review":"This album was a total diappointment, with a capital D. There are a few songs that are OK-like Pearl and Amen-but adding hip-hip and rap styles to this album was a definite MISTAKE. I personally abhor rap and hip-hop, so naturally this album was a waste of money for me. I wouldn't have given it even one star, but there were no other choices. If you like rap and hip-hop, then you will be pleased with Paula's transitions here. I hope she departs from the style of this album is she produces any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems","review":"i bought one of these fans last year on sale and thought it was okay, my son bought us another one and it smelled like it was burning up each time we turned it on, it finally stopped smelling, runs alright. but not worth the full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not believe whisper-quiet operation","review":"The fan is not whisper quiet. i.e. if your watching TV and you turn on the fan you will have to increase the volume several notches.

If you anyone has any suggestions for a whisper silent fan please let me know. thx"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud Loud Loud","review":"On the lowest fan setting, the noise level is about 50dBA.They call that quiet?????To me anything above 40dBA is too loud for a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just bought my second Vornado","review":"I now have two of these--one in my bedroom, one in my office. I have them running constantly in air conditioned rooms because the movement of air makes the rooms seem significantly cooler. Well made, quiet (not silent), good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to it's reputation","review":"This fan does what it says it will do. I have been able to turn my room air conditioner down to low (even through this horrible heat wave) as long as the Vornado is running. AND I have never had to turn it on above low! It is the quietest fan I have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but it's overpriced and much louder than I expected","review":"I expected more from this product.It does move a fair amount of air, but it's far too loud at all settings. At the lowest setting, calling it 'whisper quiet' is a joke.It is solidly built for a plastic fan, but it hardly merits the price. It only has a handful of settings/adjustments. Vornado must be making a TON of money on each fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****","review":"I really like this fan. It is small, lightweight, easy to move around and pretty quiet. I have it positioned by a window when the AC is off, and move it near a vent with the AC on and it does seem to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for large rooms & worth the $","review":"This fan is used to circulate air in a large bedroom with a vaulted ceiling. By placing it over an ac vent, it circulates air well. When used with a ceiling fan, it circulates cool air well. Works great on its own too. Has made the 95+ degree humid days and nights tolerable. Just bought a 2nd one for our LR. The High setting noise is tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"The squiggly rails looked like a gimmick at first, but they really work. Compared to a standard straight rail fan, this one pushes a column of air much wider than its own blade. Enough to cool more peoples faces than an oscillating fan with a much smaller footprint. It is powerful and quiet. We are able to live without air conditioning much deeper into the summer so despite the high price, it will save you money in 1-2 summers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This thing really works! Unlike every fan I've ever owned before, this one gets the air in the whole room circulating! Standing perpendicular to the air flow, several feet away, you can feel the air in the room moving all around you. It's not excessively noisy either. I'm very impressed! This will come in handy during the hot summer months to help the air conditioner work less hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vornado dynamo!","review":"This little beauty works quietly and efficiently to move the air in a 12 x 18 bedroom.

Now, the comfort level is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little fan","review":"Good fan, but a bit noisy on higher speeds. Only having 3 fixed angles to the base is a bit limiting. Overall I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice fan","review":"the fan is small and quiet. it blows a lot of air around! the fan is very compact and fits any where. the low volume of noise means it doesn't interrupt watching t.v. or listening to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vornado Fans are just better","review":"I own 3 Vornado fans. The first was a small personal fan for my small apartment. Ran that thing 24/7 on low and was always impressed with the airflow. Moved to a larger place with multiple rooms and bought a larger full room Vornado.This fan is my third and if it lasts as long and functions as well as the other two I will be very happy. The low setting creates nice airflow and is very quiet on all 3 fans. The high speed setting is loud, but it really pushes the air.Vornado fans are sort of like Dyson vacuums. They are far more expensive. Some folks feel the price is all about a gimmick and it isn't worth the cost increase. I feel the price difference is worth it and recommend Vornado fans. I wouldn't have bought 3 different Vornados over the years if I didn't feel they were exceptional at what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"Great for getting circulation in a room. Bit noisy at full speed but you can adjust and the best effect is produced, as the manufacturers recommend, by aiming the fan at a wall so the air currents bounce around. The customer service is outstanding - my experience is they provide thoughtful, thorough email replies within 24 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit noisy, but moves a LOT of air","review":"I use two of these to help ventilate an art studio, and to stay cool at home with less A/C. They move a ton of air. The only down side is that they are a bit noisy, but I don't know if that can be avoided when you're moving so much air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vornado Fans","review":"I've had vornado fans for approx 18 years and only had to replace one.

Haven't decided. We got it to move air in our 20 ft. by 25 ft. family room with a vaulted ceiling and 2 full walls of windows. Started using it along with the two ceiling fans we have already there so don't know if we're getting good flow BECAUSE of this or if it's the combination of all the fans together. Anyway we used it throughout the month-long 100 degree-plus weather we had in July and it did move the air. So, all in all, we're pleased and it's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is a good fan. Thought it would be stronger than the Honeywell fan I had when I was a kid.

I have own the original 33 1/3 Lp for over 30 years, and have replaced it with the CD. For anyone wanting to hear one of the great, but under rated, jazz trumpeters playing impeccable, tasteful, yet beautiful music with a full orchestra of other great musicians -- this is your album. Guaranteed. Along with Clifford Brown's strings album, this rates among the best from the classic jazz period of the 1950s-1960s with a full orchestra. For aficionados, only Miles' work with Gil Evans can be rated above this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure of a trumpet player!","review":"I still have this vinyl LP in my collection. Before CDs, I listened to it dozens of times. Blue Mitchell has a unique tone and unmistakable phrasing. This is one of my all-time favorites. The strings provide an exquisite frame to Mitchell's trumpet. Recorded long before editing became sophisticated, there is one point where Blue misses a high note, but goes one.

I properly installed it without touching the bulb or bumping anything. Just like playing a game of Operation. Although the bulb is bright and clear, I'm very disappointed with it's life performance. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Average brightness, horrible life","review":"I read the reviews for this bulb, and on reading about the less-than-stellar life of the bulbs, ignored the advice to stay away because I assumed the life was shortened due to installer error (touching the bulb, bumping it during install).Well, my first pair of bulbs lasted 4 months, and I did not touch the bulbs (only the plastic base connector) nor did I bump them against anything while installing. I even wore clean, plastic gloves to prevent any accidental contact. After the first bulb burned out, the other one burned out within a week. Luckily, my order for another pair of bulbs had arrived. Amazon was running a great sale on these bulbs so I decided to give them another shot. We'll see how long this pair lasts.Just for comparison: the OEM headlamps on my car were Osram Sylvania (same brand) bulbs, and they lasted 3.5 _years_.My advice: do some research and just go to a local parts store to buy your headlight bulbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I have had months of chronic insomnia and thought it would be a permanent part of my life.

(I'm the type of insomniac that falls asleep easily, but after 4 or 5 hours, wakes up continuously. I also need earplugs, so even if this cd was starting to work, I still have to sit up, turn it off, put in earplugs, and try to fall asleep again).Shapiro's repetitive instructions just annoy me (I heard you the first time!), and tracks 3 and 4 (to lull you back to sleep after you've woken up) were much too short and hard to visualize. As track 2 progresses, her voice gets too soft to hear, making me strain to hear it and waking up again.I give it 2 stars because I like her mind-clearing technique; I use it along with some mini-moves from \\"The Insomnia Solution,\\" a book that's finally helping me calm my mind and get some rest. Forget the cd and try the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - doesn't work for me","review":"I have not found this CD helpful in getting to sleep.

I tried several other sleep/relaxation CDs but this one is the best I've found. With this CD, I'm actually sleeping through the night and as an added bonus having pleasant dreams!

I have tried many different methods to overcome my insomnia and this is the first time anything has worked consistently. I cannot say enough about how soothing Roberta's voice is and how she just talks me to sleep every night. I turn on my ipod when I get in bed and I am asleep usually before she even gets to the violin part. It is amazing. I rarely wake up in the middle of the night now and if I do I use the \\"signal breath\\" and the \\"sweeping away\\" visualizations and I am back to sleep within minutes. This is SO worth the price.

Not enough direction, basically a disembodied voice telling you to clear your mind, sweep thoughts away, think of sunsets and beaches .. but not much direction as to how. If it was that easy to clear one's mind, we'd all be sleeping. The main track was not long enough to put me to sleep and having to get up to increase the volume on the last two tracks destroyed any beneficial effects from the first tracks.

I will not be buying any more of her cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality CD, purchased from Amazon","review":"As soon as I took this CD out of the packaging, I could tell it felt thinner and lighter than a better made CD. The first time I listened to it, the first track played (introduction, beginning meditation). After that, the CD sounded like it was playing a selection of scratches. When trying to play the CD from the start another time, it only spun and would not stop on a track at all. Other CDs of mine play fine on this same CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Sleep CD on Family Guy","review":"On Family Guy (I think), they had a CD to help you sleep-- it was supposed to be \\"the sounds of nature\\" or something like that. When they played it- instead of hearing the leaves rustling in the wind, or the waves breaking in the ocean, you heard a grizzly bear attacking other animals, and other frightful sounds of nature.This CD works A LOT better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sleep solutions","review":"Terrible.

I like the different viewpoints of the two authors. I did think that some of the historical information tended to drag on a little and you can definitely pick up on the political views of the author but it was still a good read... It really reinforced my desire to go cruising!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging adventure","review":"This is a good read. The adventure is unpacked by the author, Jerry Mashaw in a very engaging way with a lot of information about the varous places they encounter along the way down the east coast of the US and into the Caribbean. A good deal of history and insight into the sorted history of the slave trade and economic struggles that are the reality of much of the caribbean. The story is further enhanced by Jerry's partner and crew, Anne MacClintoc with journal enteries interspersed throughout.The authors capture the anticipation, excitement, and even fear very well and draw you into their world. I truly felt like I shared their adventure. I considered this along the lines of Ann Vanderhoof's \\"Embarrassement of Mangos' Anchor Canada, a division of Random House Publishers - which is a must read if you're into sailing adventures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sailing book","review":"Arrogant Yale law professor and equally annoying wife whine about the South, conservative thought, etc., while onboard their sailboat.

The recording is very mellow. The tempos range from kinda slow to really slow. But the playing has such intense feeling; it just cuts right through you. When I finish listening to this cd, I feel like crying. Not because the playing is so melancholy, but because I don't believe that I'll ever hear something so deep and beautiful as this recording. This is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I saw this recommended in an essential list compiled by NPR.

The photos are even substandard."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAD AND SIMPLY, WONDERFUL.","review":"This collection is very fast, to have so many songs. It's a very intimate session with Billie as she moves through the songs, we hear her talk, cough, and cry in these beautiful tunes that remind you of how beautiful and honest and unique this woman was. A candid experience, not for the weepy, or for the weepy to weep on with. A great buy.Some might be offended by the album company's cutting short of her songs, I think it adds to the power of the line up however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Nice Enough For Beer","review":"I purchased this for a special occaision and am sending it back because it's just not nice enough.The problem is the little handles on the side.

Instead, the narration and storytelling is done by actual group members. It gives you an inside view of the chemistry of a group as they go on a long journey by bike. The way it is done, you sort of feel like you are a part of the group.The scenery is incredible. It makes you anxious for the warm weather to return so you can hop on your bike and experience as much of the country as possible. I say \\"experience the country\\" because that is what happens when you ride a bicycle rather than drive a car. In a car, you are just trying to get somewhere. On a bike, you become a part of the journey, and that is one of the things these guys show you through their own journey.I am planning my own journey/loaded bicycle tour along a portion of the same route for the Summer of 2006 and this film has definitely helped me through the long winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film of Dreams","review":"In the fast paced world of getting an education, job, career, and family it is great to see that there is still hope for those who are willing to work hard, make a commitment, and sacrifice a lot in the name of living a dream. This documentary takes you through parts of the country that few have ever seen, let alone seen at the pace of a bike. You get a true since of the great people and landscape that makes up this great land of ours.Through sharp and concise footage, supported by a wonderful soundtrack whose words lineup directly with the film can all the greatness of our land be captured on film. This film will inspire you to follow your dreams no matter what they are.It is truly a remarkable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Trip Worth Taking","review":"\\"Share the Road\\" provides a view of America you need to see. Even if you're not a biker (I'm not), this is a road trip worth taking. This documentary gives us a 60-mile- a-day rather than 60-mile- an-hour look at the American landscape, a pace at which, as one of the narrators says, \\"You can find the real America.\\" What a refreshing break from the fear-driven CNN this-just-in disaster reports we're pummeled with through the media. I found \\"Share the Road\\" a genuine breath of fresh air. The story is good. The scenery is gorgeous. The original soundtrack for this film is exceptional. (They should release a CD with just the music. Great stuff.) If the spirit of freedom, fun, and adventure captured here doesn't stir you just a little - you might want to check your pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"I had to get this after I saw their first documentary on hiking the Appalachain Trail, \\"TREK\\" . That was amazing in and of itself, but they have gone leaps and bounds above that documentary in terms of production and presentation. This truly engaging and inspiring DVD chronicles their bike trip all across the United States over the course of one summer. They are a rare group of souls who truly follow their dreams, and have been courteous enough to share their adventures with the rest of us. I highly recommend this DVD. It makes me want to get out and see the world. You will be inspired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but just ok. Lacked detail and clear storyline.","review":"Like most, I bought this because I enjoyed their other film, 'Trek'. Well, 'Share the Road' isn't even close to as good as 'Trek'. Trek presented a clear storyline and did a good job of introducing the principle characters. Share the Road, however, does neither. For the most part 'Share the Road' is a lot of shots of riding bikes and post trip narration about how great it is to take time off from the daily grind. There is almost no explanation of the landscape and the towns they go through, and only cursory discussion about who is part of the ride.Because I want to support the guys from Circ, I am a bit conflicted about giving this film only two stars. But it really isn't worth more. The film is short, repetitive, and not worth watching more than once. At a price tag of $24 it isn't value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunset Magazine Finds A Great New Book About California!","review":"This is a multimedia production, featuring two compact discs or cassette tapes meant to be played on your car audio system as you tour.

Do you really feel that selling a book which the Firm urges we keep internal is a good idea? If nothing, you should atleast respect the legacy of Marvin Bower in shaping the management consulting industry and refrain from buying a book that you really shouldn't have. Ethics drives this business, and should drive your actions as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color of the Night","review":"\\"The Color of the Night\\" is one of the most beautifully sung song that I know of. The lyrics and the music goes hand in hand. It is a somewhat sad song but the meaning of it makes it worth listening to. See if you can get the movie \\"The Color of the Night\\" starring Bruce Willis, and then listen to the song when the credits roll in the end. Trust me, it's a very emotional song. As for the rest of the tape, I could care less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lauren Christy","review":"Stop LYING! This CD does NOT contain 12 songs, with #7 being The Color of the Night. That song does not exist on this CD. I know. I bought this CD and The Color of the Night IS NOT on it. Do not, I REPEAT, DO NOT allow this lie to continue!I never even took the cellophane protection off the CD. It was obvious, from reading the back of it, that there were not 12 cuts because The Color of the Night, the one song Lauren Christy is best known for, was NOT on the CD. And I would give it less than 1 star. Not because of Lauren Christy or the quality of the CD. Because this is a lie. The best song of all her songs isn't on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Early Work of One of Today's Hottest Producers","review":"I remember this album ten years ago. I had heard a few songs on it, which I liked, but never got around to buying it. Fast forward to today, and suddenly I'm reading a lot about Lauren Christy because she is one-third of the songwriting/producing team known as the Matrix, who wrote all the hits for Avril Lavigne's album. Suddenly, they're the hottest hit makers in the business, with Britney Spears, Rickey Martin, Mariah Carey, and Liz Phair among the singers wanting to work with them. So I finally bought this album, and it's gorgeous. I've been listening to it over and over. On top of that, I love how Lauren Christy has transformed herself into a mega-producer, after not becoming a big success as a solo singer. You go, girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving, passionate, and overall incredible cd!","review":"I bought this cd in 1993 after reading a Kate Bush comparison or influence. There is a touch of that in the classiness of their vocals, but Lauren's cd is more straight forward, yet uniquely touching pop music. The word \\"class\\" just keeps coming to mind, and sweet melancholy. The songs and writing are excellent. I have over 1300 cd's and this one is in my top 15 or higher. It moves me in a way similar to Sarah McLachlan's Fumbling Towards Ecstacy cd. Anyways I give this cd my absolute highest recommendation. I was very disappointed with her follow up cd, Breed, where she totally changed styles. An artist certainly has the right to do so, but I have the right to express my sorrow as I was hoping for a follow up in a similar vein of this cd. Hopefully one day she'll do another like this cd. (Please, Lauren?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Listing","review":"I received a CD with 11 tracks, not the 12 tracks AS LISTED. Of course, the missing track is why I ordered this CD in the first place. I will be keeping it, because I like Lauren Christy, but this discrepancy needs to be addressed.

Smart guys all, characterized by sophisticated guitarists taking unique and brutal approaches to \\"simple\\" three-chord music. Sardy & Co. were at once more melodic and atonal than those above, and markedly different. Along comes Gimmick, an astounding, densely layered wash of words, feedback, hammered trash cans, and guitars. It is rare indeed when a band with this many good ideas is also so well-focused. Think late '60's Magic Band, mid-'70's King Crimson, or Tom Waits's Black Rider: brilliant songcraft, large dark spaces with a million well-executed details, epic and confident. In this case, pile irony upon irony and a goodly dose of homicidal rage. In short, a power trio at the top of their game. Buy two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mejor desplazamiento del mouse.

He puts on a good concert, but it is only entertaining b/c of his jokes not songs; the only good song he played anyway was a cover.

Totally reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"school days","review":"Laura's teenage years, her feelings and thoughts and actions, are memorably recorded in this book. Laura's feud with her unfair teacher (and future sister-in-law!) is hilarious! And her equally strong feud with an old childhood rival, who somehow managed to end up traveling from Minnesota to South Dakota at roughly the same time as Laura, is also amusing. Nellie wants to ride behind Almanzo Wilder's beautiful horses, but Laura ends up *marrying* the guy! (Not in this book, but you can pretty much see where it's going.) And the baby kitten, and Mary's desire to go to college and Laura's desire to sacrifice for that goal....Well, this is just a good, good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More love and laughter from Laura.","review":"More adventures of the Ingalls family, full of the loving details that make these stories come alive.

A pleasure to share with your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Town on the Prarie is a great book for kids.","review":"I love this book because it tells just how a girl feels about her family, her life, and everything that happens to her.

She has several Little House books and I was happy to add this one to her collection. Very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable book","review":"In the other books, Laura and her family were more isolated. Part of this was of course due to her youth, but as Laura moves into womanhood, she is able to enjoy and do more things, and be treated more as an adult, including getting jobs to help raise funds for her sister to go to a college for the blind. Town life is also emphasized here, as opposed to living in the big woods and the prairie. And lo and behold, here's Nellie Oleson again! Yes, really! And she has the same bratty attitude as well, which makes for some rather entertaining parts in this book. Overall a great book in the Little House series, if you've enjoyed the other books you will enjoy this one too. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There were a few decent pieces of information, but overall I was not very impressed. Some of the content was OK, but the grammatical errors and different writing styles made it a very disappointing read. There were four different authors which contributed to the flow problems, and it was obvious that some of the chapters were more poorly written than others. In addition, it didn't seem like anyone even proofed the book. I can understand a few errors, but I found myself re-reading sentence after sentence trying to understand what words were missing, misspelled or out-of-place.The chapter on transactions was pretty decent. I liked the information on compensating transactions, which I had heard called three phase commit previously. The chapter on UDDI was pretty decent as well. I was disappointed in the last chapter on Event-Driven Architecture. It just seemed to be a hodge-podge catch all of the author's thoughts without much meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest authors","review":"These folks use my book, \\"How to Open Locks With Improvised Tools\\" in their work.

The title page, including contact info in my book, is concise and clear. Harper Collins has never touched it. No, they didn't ask permission for use, and there are so many spelling and grammatical errors that it is obvious they cut corners in other places, too. Since they're happy to invent spurious references when the real thing is readily available, I wouldn't hold much faith whatever else they cranked out.

The Quit Smoking company try sinister methods to try and get the man to quit.The second part is the main NON HORROR film. It's about a man who is forced to walk around a ledge on the top of a tall hotel. An average thriller, but not scary.The third is where the supernatural comes into it, but the monster has little bells on it's head and is about ten centimetres tall, so this is the worst story of the lot.

It definitely helps knowing that a car is coming and how close it is instead of wondering or looking over your shoulder and taking your attention from what's ahead. The mount is easy to install and sturdy. You can tighten it as much as you need to keep it rigid, but it's better not to tighten it all the way so that you can make adjustments on the road if you need it. Also, the frame is plastic and you'll damage it. Overall, it's a great product and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mirror","review":"This mirror is very reasonably priced for the quality. It installs easily in the end of the handlebar. Best of all, the glass mirror itself is high quality with no distortion for a convex mirror, unlike some of the plastic mirrors I have used.

The long screw that actually mounts the unit to the bike was fine. But there are two shorter screws that assemble two arms to the mirror. These shorter screws were EXTREMELY tight.

I am very pleased with the quality and design of the mirror, it folds inward easily should you hit it with an obstruction or if you need to flip your bicycle over for maintenance.

You cannot see a great distance behind you however. If I have someone trailing behind me about 200 feet you can barely make them out. If there is anything within close proximity however you can see it clearly. The glass on this is not the strongest it only lasted me about three days, but this was after very a few intense rides.

It stays in the handlebars snug and does what I need it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror broke fairly easily","review":"I purchased the mirror a few weeks ago, and the purchase/delivery were fine. The mirror and frame assembled as directed. Just before my first ride the bike fell over as I was putting air in the tires, and the mirror hit something (ground perhaps) and cracked beyond useability. I checked the web site of the manufacturer and the replacement cost of the mirror alone was $5, but the shipping was another $5. The replacement cost of the mirror was almost the price I paid for the product in the first place.I contacted the manufacturer (explaining my situation) and was hoping they could send me a mirror with the shipping for $5, and they refused. They suggested buying 2 mirrors as an alternative (to make the shipping more palatable?). Very disappointed with the response.Anyway, I feel that the frame and design is great, but the mirror is way too fragile for a product that is sold as a \\"mountain bicycle mirror\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mirror!","review":"This mirror was a cinch to install and now offers me a much safer way to see what is behind me while I ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"i do not know how to install that","review":"i do not know how to install that.

This new mirror is a very sturdy design and the mirror has curvature which is very useful. Very well constructed. Screws that hold the mirror onto the mounting arms go into brass bodies that do not permit the screws to loosen. The instructions tell you that the Allen head screws are take significant force to install and that you don't need to be afraid you'll break the plastic handles. They were right.

Getting ready to order another for my wife's bike.UPDATE: So I liked the mirror much I put it on my wife's bike and ordered another one for mine. Opened the package and found a broken mirror lens. Amazon was great (as usual) about the return and sending a replacement. So I mount the mirror just snug enough so that it stays put but can be adjusted fairly easily, also figuring the flexibility would protect the lens if bumped. Well, I bumped the end of the mirror and the lens broke - in less than one day!!

Even though it's not designed for drop handlebars it works pretty well on mine.I LOVE the size of the mirror and the full view it gives of the road behind. Although it's slightly convex and warns that objects are closer than they appear the distortion isn't bad.The only problem using this with my drop handlebars is the clearance between my hand and the mirror is a bit tight. This is most bothersome when trying to shift with my STI shifter levers, particularly shifting up. The mirror interferes slightly with the hand flex required to make the shift.Still, for the GREAT view it provides I'm willing to put up with this minor inconvenience. It's a shame they don't provide an optional ~1/2\\" to 1\\" extender segment.

I like that it lifts the mirror higher than the bar so it is easily visible. It is more stable than most mirrors I have tried, and easy to adjust in each desired dimension. I also use one on the left to hold a \\"Serfas Stop light\\" led light on the left bar end to provide a wider look to the bike when cars pass me at night. It turned out to be an easy way to mount the light. When I bought the second one for this purpose, I thought I'd have to glue the light to the back of the mirror, but I screwed the light mount to the mirror mount with only a little filing of plastic. The mirror is also mounted and I can use the mirror during the day, and the light at night. BUT the light is too heavy with the batteries in it, and it causes too much bouncing of the mirror to be useful. So I will remove the mirror and use the light only on the left.

I started with the velcrow strap mount model that looked good and had good reviews on another site, but it never stayed in place well enough. I looked at the larger helmet mount mirror, but did not like the idea of the distracting mirror.This mirror provides a far superior mount, and is stable once you adjust it. The mount is well designed and it works as well as I could expect, providing a higher level of safety without any distraction.I can't think of anything I would change about this mirror, and higly recommend it for mountain bikes ridden on the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy mirror","review":"Handy bicycle mirror.

It sticks out far enough from the handle bars to get around my rather large body and show me what may decide to run me over if I am not mindful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good visibility, poor materials","review":"I really have only one gripe with this mirror.It's made of a very hard and brittle plastic. This, when combined with expanding fasteners for the screws to spread apart when tightening, shatters with the slightest impact, and sometimes just from overtightening. I've gone through 5 of these mirrors in less than a year. I first ordered one due to the good reviews and the appearance (in the photo) that it was flexible to reduce the chance of breakage. My bike is a commuter, and I usually park it on the centerstand, but every so often it falls over. Result, broken mirror.If you buy one, buy a couple spares. Otherwise, be very careful setting your bike down and don't bump into anything with the mirror or it will break. I'm switching to a more durable hinged model."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"best mirror i ever boughti use to buy the $7 wal-mart mirror that would always break if the bike tip overi bought this had another one before (got rid of bike)(too lazy to take it off)my old bike tipped over a couple of times on the mirror side and all it did was put a white scuff mark on the back and bent the peace where it connects to the handle bars and still worked perfectlyit did its job by collapsingall you do then is re adjust itcompletely recommendworth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Mirrycle","review":"I LOVE this mirror. This is the second one I've owned. The first was on a bike that was stolen. I replaced it immediately as I consider it to be a fundamental piece of biking gear. This mirror has made me feel much safer when riding on roads here in Colorado. I can see cars coming a long way away. I've owned other mirrors, but this is by far and away the BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-made item","review":"I just received this item in the mail and have already installed it within 15 minutes. That includes opening the box, reading the instructions and final adjustment. The instructions were very clear and even advised to expect tighter than normal resistance of the mirror and mirror arm mounting screws. That is to be expected with any system which allows for adjustments-on-the-fly. Seriously, the arms will not break if you tighten the screws by hand. I can't say what would happen if you used a power tool but I warn against that as I have seen such things occur in my career as a machine mechanic. That experience also allows me to say before any road testing that this product is going to work just fine. The delivery was prompt and the package arrived intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mirror","review":"As I continue to mature in my cycling, I wanted a bar end mirror that would allow me good rearward visibility. The mirror is convex glass. It sits high enough above my flat bar to provide good line of sight. It's stiff enough that it doesn't shift without intentional manual input. When on the road I don't perceive any vibration. The arms and shims are plastic, and I'm not sure if the bolts/washers/nuts are stainless, but thus far I haven't noted any rust or discoloration with the hardware. I was happy enough with the mirror to purchase a second mirror my wife's bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending back, screws don't fit thread","review":"It seems like it should be a decent enough product, however, the screws do not always fit the thread. Trying to assemble this, I have about half an inch of the screw that will not thread into the mirror fixture (yes, I am using the correct screws in the correct location), leading the mirror to jostle freely and not stay in it's intended position. I am very, very annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"I bought it for a cruiser and it just didn't get the job done. Neither did the other one that I tried.

After more work than i was prepared to do for a bike mirror, it did not stay on, so I donated after a few users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke almost immediately","review":"It looks nice, was pretty easy to install - it was very hard to screw the bolts in, and it felt like the plastic would break, but the instructions said \\"Don't worry that it may break\\", so I went ahead. It was easy to adjust, and worked great the first couple of times I rode my bike. But then I leaned my bike up against a wall and the mirror tapped against the wall - not even a very hard tap, certainly something that would be impossible to avoid - and the plastic housing snapped into three pieces. The plastic is much too brittle for this use."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible to assemble","review":"I almost broke the thing trying to assemble it. you have to be very strong. otherwise, its an OK product."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect mirror","review":"Read reviews and searched for lots of mirrors before buying this one. I don't like the ones that strap around the handlebar so I was looking for one that went in the end of the handlebar. This one fits perfectly. Just follow the directions. It took all of about 5 minutes to install and it doesn't wobble or vibrate but yet adjusts pretty easily. The image is clear. Highly recommended. I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!

It is very adjustable due to its \\"L\\" shape and the image is very clear. It is slightly convex making the images appear smaller than they are but due to that, it gives an adequately wide field of view. I would purchase this item again if the need for a bike mirror arose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror","review":"This is a pretty good mirror, it adjusts easliy and holds up under moderate trail riding.I would recommend this mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mirror","review":"It has a big field of view and installed very easily onto my bicycle handle. Just make sure you have a hold at the end of your bicycle bar and it will install. Comes with two inserts. My mountain bicycle used the bigger of the two. You stick it into the handle bar and keep twisting the allen wrench until it expands inslde the handle bars and has a nice tight fit. I seem to have to adjust it everytime I go for a ride but I do bump it a lot. I can ride through the neighborhood and easily see anything approaching behind me with this. Well worth for the piece of mind it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable.","review":"I've owned three of these, but will buy no more; it's too easily broken. It was easy to install, and it's not too hard to adjust.The biggest flaw is durability. I bicycle commute 16 miles a day, through a park and on city sidewalks. Even in this rather benign environment, this will get broken or wear out in a few months. The least impact at speed with bushes, tree branches, poles or other obstructions can crack the mirror or break the plastic mount.Also, a few months of adjusting the mirror via the friction mounts wears them out and the mirror will no longer hold position.I cannot imagine these mirrors lasting more than 2 or 3 rides on mountain trails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now husband wants one, too","review":"Hubby and I are new bike riders. We each got a mirror that attaches to the helmet. I realized right away that it wouldn't work well with my progressive lenses, so bought the Mirrycle instead and love it. We just got back from a 25 mile ride, and now my husband wants one, too. I highly recommend this mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bike mirror","review":"Bought this for my wife to replace a helmet-mounted mirror. She says this gives her any easy and informative view of what is going on behind her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively the BEST bike mirror","review":"I've tried at least a half dozen different mirrors for my bicycle, and they all were failures. THIS mirror is a very high quality item that WORKS! Don't let the word 'convex' scare you; it's a very slight convexity that doesn't make everything disappear after 20 feet. You can precisely tweak the adjustment 'tension' to your liking, and it will not shift or shake. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what is supposed to do","review":"This product is good. For 12 bucks, it serves its purpose. Not more, no less.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, Adjustable, Feels Durable, and Yes, Objects are Closer than they Appear.","review":"Installation was straight forward, it is easily adjustable, and the mechanism holding the mirror feels solid. I like the up an out mount, so that your arm does not block the view. You may have to get used to the way that the mirror compresses the view to allow a greater range of vision. Although the cars behind you may look small and \\"far away\\" they are really almost right up next you. Once you can properly gauge the depth, you will feel much safer. When in doubt I still do full head turn checks just in case.

I researched all the mirrors and chose this one as it met my needs of being low profile, strong , yet versatile with several installation options. I 've had this on my Trek Fx 7.3 for about 4 weeks. The installation was super easy. It was harder to remove the end of my grip than it was to install the mirror. Now I can clearly see any traffic behind as well as my riding partners. The mirror doesnt vibrate nor does it get in the way of any brake or shifter levers. I have it installed going down and in towards the bike and it works great for me. This mirror seems to be very solid. This shipped and arrived very quickly and the price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mirror","review":"I too own an Electra Townie and needed a mirror.

Viewing the pics of the product online, I thought the ribbed-looking arm piece was perhaps some of flexible plastic or rubber but its actual hard plastic or even wood maybe. I thought I would be able to bend the arm to get it in the rearview position I wanted, but that's not the case. You have to pivot the hard plastic pieces. Not quite what I was expecting, but it'll do for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Been using these Bar End Mt. Mirrycles, left and a right, since the turn of the century. Only downside is they extend the width of my hybrid handlebars 3 inches per mirror. No such problem with the \\"Original Model\\" for dropped handle bars. Anyway after 12 yrs. modified the Mtn. Mirror on my rt. (added an extension or two, comes with the mirror)to save 3 inches on that side, losing some visibility and adding a bit of shake in the process. Wouldn't commute or ride without these Mirrycles, Workman Horn and a tailight !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice quality","review":"best mirror yet. I tried a cheap handlebar mirror from the big box store, but it didn't fit my handlebars. I tried a helmet mirror, but it was too small and blocks your peripherial vision.

I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"To make a long story short: My bike pal and I ride a lot every week. He got same mirror installed at local Trek shop and liked it. I ordered from Amazon. Took a few minutes to install. Fit nicely on my Trek handle bar. A great and needed safety feature.

The assembly was clear but the machine screws were somewhat hard to put in. Other than that I'm entirely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, reliable touring mirror","review":"I have this mirror installed on motor assisted city bike. It does not vibrate even with the engine on, and strong winds do not disturb it enough to be annoying. I like it very much. It is a little delicate, but if installed properly, it will allow the mirror to be adjusted by hand or swung over the hand grip to clear doorways when storing.ATV mirrors are a good choice also, but much heavier. This is a satisfactory bicycling product and I will buy another.If you follow the instructions, your grip will not be \\"mutilated\\", and you can use a $.50 handlebar plug if you take the mirror off for offroading or events. Take an exacto knife or razor, make a + shaped cut in the center of the grip's capped end, reaching to the metal, then trim around the inside diameter of the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bike mirror you can get","review":"Fits on straight type MTB and hybrid handle bars.

I was sold on how easy it was to use and how nice it looked. I looked at other \\"album\\" programs and was about to purchase another (Easy CD Platinum) but decided against it after reading so many reviews mentioning system problems. Anyway, bought Flip Album for almost 1/2 the price and am excited to get started right away. I have yet to use it on my own computer (hasn't arrived yet) but my buddies works great and it was so easy to learn. He has Windows 98 and a Dell, and I'm hoping my Millenium OS works just as well. I would recommend purchasing this if you want to send self-running photo albums to friends/relatives. I did not buy the CD Maker program that is recommended in hopes the one that was on my computer (CD Maker) will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than you bargained for","review":"The concept of FlipAlbum is great and when it works it's great. Which isn't often. I found it to be full of bugs - lots of things not working as they are supposed to and I had to do things over and over and over because the program reverted back to an earlier state. It was extremely frustrating. Tech support? - just terrible. If you actually get a response after a week or so it's something to the effect \\"did you follow directions?\\" and when you answer \\"yes\\" you never hear from them again. If they ever get it to work properly I might take another look at it, but I've found simpler programs that aren't quite as fancy but they work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"next step\\" after Bad Girls...","review":"Let's face it, anything Donna put out after Bad Girls would have been seen as a letdown. That taken into account, this album is better than 90% of her fans (myself probably included) would have expected. No doubt it helps that Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte stayed with her when she made the move from Casablanca to Geffen. They probably realised that disco was evolving, if not completely dead, and accordingly came up with a reinvented Donna for the '80s. The album is eminently listenable, and even has a few near-great songs on it (The Wanderer, Running For Cover, and Cold Love come readily to mind). The only song on the album that really makes me cringe a little bit is the finale, I Believe in Jesus. It really doesn't fit with the rest of the album. Even so, the album as a whole is better than its reputation. You won't be disappointed, especially if you can get it at a decent price."},{"rating":"2","title":"a diamond in the rough!!!","review":"Donna Summer always amazes by virtue of her vocal prowess. That said, she takes a \\"leap of faith\\" and tries to let the world in on her real soul journey. But fear not as the music on this cd will rock you out of your shoes. From the quirky funkiness of the title cut, hard rocking \\"cold love\\" (my fav.) and \\"running for cover\\",\\"nightlife\\", and \\"stop me\\" (no we hadn't heard that one before!!!) to the seemless pop-ness of \\"who do you think...\\", \\" breakdown\\" and \\" grand illusion\\"... to the inspirational musicality of \\"looking up\\" and \\" I believe in Jesus\\", there is not a mis-fire on this cd. She should be so proud of this collection of rock-n-pop dynamite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial information only","review":"The book provided little insight or information about these virtual worlds, and completely failed to enlighten the reader as to the technology which made these worlds interesting. It provided an basic overview of the worlds, a brief history, and how to manuever around in them, however this failed to give any substance to the writting.As the author notes in the forward, this was his first attempt at writting, and it clearly shows as entire text was written at an elementary school level. This made the reading uninteresting as well as uninformative.For those uninitiated with the Internet, virtual worlds, or any other form technology, this might serve as a good spring board. However, if the (to be) reader is looking for anything more than a general overview, I would recommend finding a different source from which to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce doesn't get it....","review":"Really, a hopelessly outdated book even at the time it was published.

Maybe it's not the best for most children because a lot of the dialogue and humor is about alcohol and there are vague sexual references. There is also wordplay which may be harder for your average small child to understand but of course only the parent can know what their individual child can handle and what is appropriate.

No serial killers, rapists, murderers, obscenity, nudity, hopelessness, or cynicism -- nothing negative. Just joyous life, lived to the full, spilling over on everyone. It's a place to go and rest from CNN, the presidential race, and network TV for a couple of hours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Auntie Mame Starring Rosalind Russell Is Still Funny","review":"I just love Rosalind Russell. She was a wonderful actress. They just don't make this type of actress anymore. She had style, class and talent. My family and I just cracked up at her antics. I also saw Auntie Mame starring Lucille Ball and although I liked that version, Rosalind Russell singing \\"Have An Eggroll\\" was hysterical. Funny, funny movie. I highly recommend for the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Movie","review":"Auntie Mame is a classic and has been a favourite of mine for more years than I'd like to admit. Rosalind Russell is at the top of her game in this one. This is the movie that I play whenever I feel down in the dumps and need something to lift me up and put a smile on my face. I highly recommend Auntie Mame to everyone - no matter what your age - it's a wonderful experience! By the way, as much as I Love Lucy, forget the musical version of Mame with Lucille Ball - it can't compare to the original with Rosalind Russell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosalind Russell as \\"Auntie Mame\\"","review":"This is the original, the one and only Mame that matters. I love this movie; it is absolutely my favorite of all-time. It's funny as all get out, touching, and has a message. Who needs the musical numbers to interrupt the flow? I see no reason at all to bother with the Lucille Ball version, especially when you can spend a couple of hours with Rosalind Russell (who should have won an Academy Award, but lost to Susan Hayward in \\"I Want To Live\\"; who remembers that movie?) and have far more fun. Get ready to laugh yourself silly. This is it, dear people; the funniest, most delightful film you could possibly indulge in. So what are you reading this for? Get a copy of \\"Auntie Mame\\" starring Rosalind Russell and you'll be in love for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT STILL!!!","review":"I love this movie. I saw it several years ago along with Mame (starring Lucielle Ball) and loved both for very different reasons. My older kids (aged 15 and 17) are into school play ans musicals so I got it for them to see and they both loved it. They laughed through the whole thing. Rosalind Russell is an amazing woman who brings Auntie Mame to life from the pages of Patrick Dennis' book and everyone is able to associate Mame Dennis with that one member of every family who is a bit eccentric."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has everything!!!","review":"I am 20 years old, and I love this movie. It has style, comedy, and drama. Ms. Russel was absolutely amazing, and after seeing this movie about 100 times, I wish I had an Auntie Mame. This is a movie for all ages and is a classic. I highly recommend this movie to all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good line, and a question","review":"Good line with \\"life's a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death\\" rightfully in the top 100 AFI qoutes. but a one question was this also the movie (or am I getting it messed up) that said \\"you have live agnus live\\" and then they run up the stairs and wave scarves and all? can anyone help me on this and either tell me that this is the movie in which it happens, or if not maybe you know the right one. either post here or e-mail me at [...] use a subject line so it doesn't go in SPAM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Live LIVE - Auntie Mame is a CLASSIC Hollywood Romp and Inspiration for Every Woman","review":"Even back in college at Smith, the seniors made reference the faux book which Mame was writing in their Senior Last Will and Testament to Rest of the Dorm when they cited the phrase, Live, Live, LIVE!Auntie Mame was originally a Broadway show, with Rosalind Russell as the original and defining actress to play the role of Auntie Mame. 1970s Game Show Fans will recognize Agnes Guch, Peggy Cass. FTroup fans from the 1970s TV show comedy will recognize Forrest Tucker not realizing he started as a film actor.Auntie Mame is one of my all time favorite movies, and YES, I had to OWN it not just rent it periodically from Netflix. When I am in a relationship and want to qualify the man as a Life Partner, are we aligned in our Life Values, we trot out and watch \\"Auntie Mame\\" as a discussion point around the kind of stimulating and FUN kind of Life I desire to live.What about you?How has Mame inspired you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie looking for this for some time","review":"Was sent in excellent condition and in a timely manner.

Should be shared with each generation. It has a lot to say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish she was my Auntie Mame!","review":"Once you've seen Rosalind Russel in action you never forget her. She and Lucille Ball would've made an unstoppable duo. Auntie Mame is one of those movies that I just started to watch on TV one day, out of boredom, and I couldn't stop watching. It's an old movie that makes pretty much anyone who watches it laugh and feel good. How can you go wrong with that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"old movie lover","review":"This movie is as good as I remember from watching it as a kid. Funny and sweet. A \\"must have\\" for those who enjoy the good old flicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical, warm, REALLY TOP-DRAWER!","review":"I'm a big fan of this movie after only seeing it 3 times. It's filled with great scenes and one-liners that'll have you laughing for days on end. I won't spoil them; you'll have to watch the movie to find them. Rosalind Russell gives the performance of a lifetime. She's got great dialogue and great costumes! Not only that, she's a very warm person and shows true love for her nepwhew. I really wish I had an Auntie Mame, or a Rosalind Russell in the person of Auntie Mame! there are plenty of other great performances, too, such as Peggy Cass, who's an absolute riot as mame's hopelessly out-of-it secretery, Agnes Gooch, and coral browne, who's good as Mame's friend, the first lady of the American theatre, Vera Charles. A wonderful movei, one that I definitly recommend. However, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE MUSICAL REMAKE, MAME, WITH LUCLILLE BALL! That's not nearly as god as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Mame for Me","review":"I remember watching this movie as a child falling in love with Rosalind Russell from the very first time, in her role as Mame. Who doesn't want a slightly whacky, eccentric aunt? I love this version of Mame, and it's the only one I own. However, my mother prefers the Lucille Ball version, and when we decided to watch Mame together, she wants her way, and I want mine. Rosalind Russell is the only Mame as far as I am concerned, and she plays the role well. It was made for her, and for her it will always be. This is one of my favorite lines from the movie!Mame: Oh Agnes! Here you've been taking my dictations for weeks and you haven't gotten the message of my book: Live!Agnes: Live?Mame: Yes! Live! Life's a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!(..)This is a movie the whole family will enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Auntie Mame is a movie for all ages and all the ages.

I can never get enough of this film! It's just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Russell operating on all cylinders!","review":"I am probably a tad biased because I don't recall ever seeing Ms. Russell in a movie role that I did not like. Auntie Mama is quite possibly my favorite, though. The diverse characters - Vera, \\"Glorie\\" and her parents, Agnes, et al - provide a laugh a minute. A thoroughly enjoyable way to pass some time alone or with friends. I never tire of watching it! Live, live, live, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"Auntie Mame on DVD how exciting. I saw this film for the first time when I was seven and it has grown to influnace my entire life. The original version (not the remake with Lucy Ball) is the ultimate in fifties ciniema. Bigger then life charecters, beautiful sets and customs and Rosalind Russell in one of her best preformances. The message of living life to it's fullest has inspired me the way \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" has touched many. If I ever feel down I put in my old video copy and it cheers me up. Now I can have it on DVD. I hope that it will have a bunch of extra features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly funny","review":"It's unbelievable that I hadn't heard of this movie before my friends showed it to me. Absolutely hilarious! Great sarcastic humor and wit, with a lesson about life included. Hollywood at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosalind or Lucy...it's up to you","review":"I am one of the rare breed who find both \\"Auntie Mame\\" with Rosalind Russell, and the musical \\"Mame\\" with Lucille Ball both very entertaining and quite funny. Rosalind Russell's acting is definitely over-the-top in Auntie Mame but I think that's what was intended. She is flamboyant, fun, irreverant, caring, and rarely sober. How do you put all of that into one character without being a little over-the-top? I do agree with a previous reviewer that the Patrick Dennis character is too whiny - but his fiancee easily makes up for any shortcomings I find in his character! She's definitely top drawer! Overall, both are worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic and Fun 50's Theater on the Screen","review":"I great platform for Rosalind Russell's talents and the movie is well directed by Morton DaCosta who also directed the film version of THE MUSIC MAN. Teacher's Note: AUNTIE MAME remains a viable choice for high school drama with lots of character parts surrounding the central Mame. If you've never seen it, it's worth a look for a type of comedy and characterization that thrived 50 + years ago. It's fun to see what was considered \\"daring\\" in those days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auntie Mame DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD for my father on his 90th birthday.

She left an indelible mark on my soul & I am so much better for having met her. I recently ordered the DVD (waiting impatiently for it to get here) & I cannot wait to introduce my children to her! My sister & I quote this movie relentlessly, almost every conversation has at least one! Everyone MUST see this movie. I attempted to watch Mame with Lucille Ball and that was all it was, an attempt.

I removed the batteries and unplugged the set as I did not have a need for them until early December.

Automatic tuning is very fast for a few channels, but very slow for others. They sometimes lock onto an unknown channel or other source. The sound is very loud on some channels and very low on others for a given volume setting. Manual tuning is not available although a tuning label appears next to a false knob. Moreover, the instruction manual addresses manual tuning, which apparently was intended for the Model 722, which does feature manual tuning.

I had to return the first set a week after buying them due to the 'phones failing to charge (apparently a common problem based on reviews). I was hesitant to buy the same model again, but they were the only thing in the price-range. The manufacturer claims that the base will transmit up to 150 feet through walls and floors. In that case, why I am getting horrible static at 20 feet across a room with nothing in between? The auto-tune doesn't seem to make any difference, although tilting and moving my head will help for a bit.

I started to like that one a lot more that my parents forced themselves to upgrade to CD. I'm almost 20 years old and I've been listening to this album every year ever since, going as far as putting it on my iPod touch, and putting it on the top of my intense collection of Holiday albums.

We have 2 other Raffi CDs which we enjoy very much. The Christmas one won't disappoint either. There are a few 'original' songs which is what I was looking for, but there are also some common carols that the girls recognize and like singing along to. The only downside to this CD is that the carols are accompanied by children singing (sometimes for half the song without Raffi singing at all). I was a little disappointed, but the girls don't care, so it shouldn't matter. I was surprised to hear 'Must be Santa' as I haven't heard that song since my childhood and I love it. Good choice to add to your children's Christmas CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific kids xmas cd","review":"Raffi of course is wonderful, and he has children singing along with him on this cd, which as it should be for a Christmas cd.

Then there's Jingle Bells, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Up on the Rooftop, and Must Be Santa, the ones kids love to sing. There's several more good ones.

I can see us enjoying this CD for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flyweight, but stable and effective","review":"Bought 3 of these for use with binoculars (bird watching, sports, hunting). Every design is a trade-off between robustness and light weight. This one is very light weight, so the cameras, binoculars, scopes, etc. should weigh less than 4 pounds - good for all but HUGE equipment. Light weight and small size when folded also means you are more likely to carry it along.Weight saving makes this tripod somewhat fragile, but it is still very stable, lightning quick to set up and easy to level on rough, uneven ground. Because it is based on grooved aluminum tubes sliding into one another, the first time that someone crashes into this tripod may be its last use. Any twisting, bending or warping force would wreck it.

The part dealing with the USSR was somewhat one dimensional but made some good points. When examining the USA however the author spoils some valid observations by creating people and situations that become excessive and left rather an unpleasant taste. Knocking down straw men is an easy pastime. The author's obvious point of view, with which I have a little sympathy, is totally negated by the charicatures he has created. This book tries to illuminate some complex and important issues, sadly it only deals with them at a simplistic and facile level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunningly beautiful movie","review":"This is an absolutely lovely film with REAL characters that you actually care about.

But like most of these recordings, there are highs and lows. Terry and Edison are mostly superb and as history would bear out, these two had the most years left to treat us with their magic (not counting Faddis of course). Dizzy has some good solos as well but has just as many weak spots and Roy is struggling here to recapture the old magic. But it's still a wonderful collection and as always, no one knows how to make a duet happen like Peterson. Faddis's single solo shows a lot of technique and skill but not much originality. Yet who can really fault him this early in his career surrounded by the masters. Not a 5 star but worth adding to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Design","review":"I purchased two of these pitchers at the same time.

It seemed to me that there must be a second book that brings her odyssey to a conclusion. Hopefully a happy conclusion.

In many ways, Christine was sort of a teenage 'everywoman' thrust into a horrifying and non-sensical world during the siege of Budapest in WWII. I can't imagine going out onto the street because someone has found a dead horse on the road, and needing to act quickly in order to carve up the meat to bring home. I remember her aching crush on the young soldier, Pista. I remember how things suddenly seemed to look better and then one of their neighbors was almost casually gunned down, after having survived so long in their brutal world. Perhaps it was simply that I was the same age as Christine when I read her book, but I have never forgotten this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book for pre-teens and teens to read.

It's a simple, straightforward set of interviews with police officers.There is no \\"case\\" to make, or any ax to grind.Fifty years ago, Jack Webb tried for the same objective in creating \\"Dragnet.\\" However, as it translated to the TV screen, it instantly became a cliche and the butt of jokes.It's much harder to joke about what's in this book, though. The main consequence is that the reader is simply grateful for the presence of our police, and finds a new appreciation for their daily contributions. Its sheer simplicity is what lends this a lot of narrative power.It was given to me by by nephew Tim, a tactical officer with the Chicago Police Department, and I thank him for the book and for everything he does. I admire his attitude; instead of becoming jaded and cynical, he takes his street experiences and translates them into gratitude for his wife and his two children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little out of date....","review":"A little behind times.

The book is suppodded to tell \\"what's it really like to be a cop\\", but it doesn't deliver. There are lots of stories told by Chicago cops, but these stories are really just anecdotes; the shortest are just one or two sentences long. You just can't tell much in two sentences.Another problem is, the book is arranged in topics. In practice this means that a cop after cop is telling you that \\"you don't forget your first corpse\\", and this goes on page after page, until the author moves on to another topic. It would be much more interesting, if there were about two or thee dozen stories in the book, each 5-10 pages long that you could read like a short story. But the way this book is written, it simply is not interesting to read, and you don't get much from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not especially notable.","review":"It's wonderful that this broad decided to work as a cop to lend her books authenticity, but I don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - This is not Erotica","review":"Or at least it doesn't compare at all to what I've previously read. The first two stories are like any Harlequin short story. The handcuffs added a touch of humor to the stories and the abduction, if it can be called that, was pretty mild mannered.The biggest disappointment was the Jaid Black story. The first few chapters were good, the plot, the leading lady, but after the Hunter claimed his \\"rights\\" to marry, it turned into a disaster. The dialogue was crude and uninspired. It felt like being catapulted into a bad parody of an x-rated movie.

Very nice for holding my machine and accessories. However, the velcro constantly catches on the ground and the outer flap zipper area (visible in the AMZ picture only as a small black band, not the zipper strip visible here) tore within weeks.The back is still otherwise fully intact and excellent: apparently this extra unneeded zipper was a serious design flaw, because I never stress it and the rest of the bag has been consistently stressed without failure.The small top handle is a little too bulky and sometimes get caught between the bag and my back, which is not pleasant, although easily flipped out of the way.All in all, not worth the $60 AMZ is currently asking, but a steal at $30."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Rush","review":"This brilliant Klondike comedy follows the antics of Chaplin's Little Tramp character through the trials and tribulations of frenzied fortune hunting in the Alaskan wilderness. In addition to the famous boiled-boot sequence, the visual gags are plentiful and hilarious, especially concerning the three prospectors' impending starvation (just watch Big Jim chase Chaplin around with an axe). But it's the bittersweet love story involving Hale's contemptuous saloon girl that makes \\"The Gold Rush\\" quintessentially Chaplinesque."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Rush (2 Disc Special Edition)","review":"A classic that captures the essence of survival in the far north softened by the humor of Charlie Chaplin's character of \\"The Tramp.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong version, Image DVD!","review":"I cannot agree more with \\"A viewer from Dallas, TX\\" -- this 1942 version lessens the whole \\"Gold Rush\\" experience, even though the video quality is astounding. Having just watched \\"The Kid\\" and \\"City Lights\\", I found the commentary on this version most annoying and distracting from Chaplin's fantastic pantomime. While in the other films one becomes engrossed in the visual elements, in this version of the film it is impossible to become fully involved, as the commentary actually distances you from what is going on. It would be such a grave mistake if this version would be the only one available for today's audiences, so I urge and plead: Image, please release the original 1925 version on DVD too, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, the REAL Gold Rush is on DVD","review":"The real news here isn't the second video release of Chaplin's 1942 talkie reissue of the 1925 film, with narration in his plummy later voice detracting from much of the fun. What's significant here is on Disc 2-- the first video release of a definitive version of the original silent classic, which has been restored by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill from Chaplin family material and is about 14 minutes longer and noticeably better quality than the best previous version, the Killiam print which had seen assorted releases on tape and laserdisc. The Chaplin family had previously refused to release that version, believing that the 1942 version represented Chaplin's final thoughts on the film, when what it in fact represented was Chaplin's best idea of how to make an old silent film seem relevant to Casablanca-era audiences. Now it's the '42 version which seems old fashioned, while the '25 one is timeless as ever. Be sure you get this new Warner/MK2 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not normally a Chaplin-ite....","review":"To be honest, I've never really been a fan of Chaplin. Too much pathos, too mush sentiment, too clever by half.I've always fallen on the Laurel and Hardy side of the fence as we much prefer to watch \\"Fresh fish! HONK!\\" to a tramp eating his shoes. However, The Gold Rush I can make an exception for. The sentiment is there but the gags work well and the impression for once is that this is a comedy and not a tragedy with the odd falling over scene. There's no doubting it's technical brilliance either and its originality and innovation, which don't matter much to us without the laughs, but there's plenty of those as well so, in it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Goldrush","review":"The tape is in really poor condition. It is an old \\"silent movie\\", but the piano music which accompanies it disappears halfway through the show. You cannot make out the \\"writing\\" the writing being the script that the actors are \\"saying\\". Guess I have to wait until the DVD comes out and hopefully is in way better shape than the VCR tape. Waste of money unfortunately! Much as I love this movie, it is in too poor shape to attempt to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real nugget of a film","review":"I have seen many Chaplin films and believe that this is one of the very best, if not the best. It's set in the klondike as Cahpalin sets out to find his fortune in the Gold Rush. There are absoliteley hilarious scenes in a wooden cabin in the mountains where the starving Chaplin enjoys a fine dinner of roasted boot. The funny part is not that in itself, but the gentlemanly and elegant way he sets out to eat it, table manners and all. As a result of this and other scenes there are many valuable lessons about life and its full enjoyment in this film. I also think that the score is Chaplin's best. It can be enjoyed at almost any age and its lessons are universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmingly witty","review":"Charlie Chaplin is a comic genius and brings his wit to bear in this classic of the Alaskan gold rush. His expressive style shows how far acting can carry a movie that has no sound. His oft-repeated \\"table dance\\" using forks stuck into two potatoes is a scene that truly styles Chaplin's wide-ranging comical creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us the original !","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this, my favorite Chaplin movie, on DVD, but now I think have to get rid of it again, I'm afraid. The picture quality is nice enough for such an old film (hence the 2 stars), but unfortunately this is not the original version but the lame one Chaplin re-released. Here's what's wrong with it: Chaplin un-necessarily narrates the story, the ending is different, the titlecards are removed, or rather, it looks more like the picture was blown-up cropping the sides of the picture !. This is not the movie I love. Somebody apparently thought: \\"well, if Charlie himself changed it this must be the director's cut, therefore we'll release this version\\". How wrong they were. We want the superior, and longer, original silent version !. Chaplin fans rebel !."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tramps Suffering is eased with Brilliant Comedy...","review":"Gold Rush is one of Charlie Chaplin's legendary films about the Tramp who seeks fortune and a better life in Klondike, Alaska, during the gold rush. In his quest for fortune he encounters several questionable characters which often lead to comic situations. Underneath the comedy there is a serious undertone of struggle for happiness and prosperity where the Tramp becomes easy prey as he helps those in need. However, through his kindness he ends up being hurt in several ways. Throughout the film, Chaplin conveys his messages with comedy that makes it easier to look at the hardships the Tramp encounters, and through this comedy he teaches the audience valuable morals. Overall, Gold Rush offers a brilliant cinematic experience that offers something for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't drive you to the brink of psychosis","review":"Unlike most other children's music, Raffi is actually fairly tolerable for adults who have to hear each album over 40,000 times. It will not drive you to a psychotic state as will other kiddie favorites like a large purple thing which will remain nameless. Raffi's singing and playing are quite good--from an adult standpoint, he's a pleasant folksinger who sings children's material. He has a charm about him which really appeals to the children, which is lacking in something like the Jerry Garcia/David Grisman album for children. Raffi's sort of charm is not corny or overbearing, so adults will not want to run into the street screaming. All in all, he's the ideal artist if you have children under five and hope to keep a shred of your sanity, music--wise. For that I say, Thank God for Raffi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"15 years old and still loving raffi!","review":"I love raffi. I used to listen to him when i was little and i still love his music.

Thanks, Harry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Cool, as always!","review":"This re-issue of Carmen's Groove Merchant album is a winner, much like most of McRae's vast work in many decades. Here is Carmen in the 1970s, taking on some of the decade's hits and infusing them with her intoxicating jazz vocal stylings. Stevie Wonder's \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\" and \\"You and I\\" are top-notch Carmen. Her wry reading of \\"The Good Life\\" puts all other versions to shame. The instrumental backings may not be to everyone's taste. The drum machines (noticeable on at least one track), obnoxious as they always are, do not take away from McRae's brilliancy. This will be a treasured CD for your jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba","review":"Great book and oh how I love Reba and her songs.

One of her early works, but, one of her best. Reba showed emotion and inspiration, but made it coutry. 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"you can't have too much reba","review":"Aa 2-cd pack of early Reba Mcentire--now is that heaven or what? Nobody sings like her, except the late4 Patsy Cline, who she covers with a couple of numbers on this album and whom she greatly admires. none of her late stuff is up to the standard of this album. My fingers tremble just typing these words about songs like \\"To-day all Over Again,\\" \\"You're the First Time I've Thought about Leaving,\\" and, most of all, \\"I'm not that Lonely Yet,\\"--her best of the best. Many have covered \\"Only You,\\" by the Platters, but only Reba can do that and not make it seem desecrated. of the many albums of her that I own, this is Reba's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"best Carly cd in 10 years","review":"Carly somehow manages to record songs by The Beatles, Cat Stevens, James Taylor and Simon & Garfunkel and make them her own. Not an easy thing to do. And her voice which I thought was weak in her last few recordings sounds clear & beautiful. The 2 new songs sounds like great old Carly songs and she didn't write them. Her harmonies with her kids (Ben & Sally) could bring you to tears. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into White is out of sight!","review":"I've purchased 9 copies of this CD so far. Three are on various players: in my car, in my bedroom, and in my garden. The rest I've given to friends, my sister, my niece... I'll probably purchase more! Carly's fabulous voice sounds better than ever, and I've been a big fan for years. The songs are sweet and nostalgic, from my childhood (The Riddle Song), teen-age years (Everly Brothers, Parsley Sage Rosemary & Thyme) and the new ones (You are the Love of My Life, Quiet Nights) are going to be lifelong favorites. TRUST ME! Try one, you'll want more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing for the selections if not the execution...","review":"Titled after one of Cat Stevens more obscure cuts, Simon commits a solid vocal effort to arrangements that are so ethereal they might float away into space; much less grab your attention. It's an intriguing mix of traditionals like \\"Oh, Susanna\\" and \\"Scarborough Fait\\" with covers of James Taylor, the aforementioned Stevens and The Beatles, but the execution is just not compelling. All the songs are set against such a delicate sound that only Simon's vocals are left to interest the listener and after awhile that is not enough and by the time I got To \\"I gave my Love A Cherry,\\" I know why Bluto broke that guitar. It's pretty, but also instantly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song Selection","review":"I bought this CD because I like Carly's voice but was dissapointed with the song selection, it seemed like I was listenning to a CD of nursery rhymmes. However the music arrangements were good.Very dissapointed and threw the CD in the bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of an Album...","review":"Hi Everyone: I bought Carly's album \\"Into White\\" somewhat late but found that it is simply a Masterpiece of an album, fantastic vocals and instrumentatiton with great guest vocals and playing by Ben & Sally Taylor on various songs. The artwork for the CD is also beautifully done and Carly's voice is just fantastic...Add this album to your Carly Simon Collection if you don't already have it. An incredible recording...Best, Kenneth Janeway, Songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Carly's time has passed...","review":"I love Carly Simon's music, but unfortunately, her time has passed.The songs are all a bit slow, lacking something from her days gone by. Enthusiasm, passion, a little oomph? Additionally, her voice just doesn't have the strength it used to have and one tires quickly of the wispy refrains. The choice of material just doesn't cut it either. The only songs that really evoked any feeling from me were the ones done with her children. I say save your money or buy Ben Taylor's new CD (her son)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible disappointment","review":"Fortunately, I took advantage of auditioning the public library's copy of this before I placed an order for it. I looked forward to listening to this CD after having really enjoyed her earlier \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" CD. My first impression of this was that it was for playing in a baby's nursery. Perhaps that was the point, but the library's copy didn't have any of the liner notes to offer any explanation of the song choices. I didn't find anything here that I even found remotely interesting. Only recommended for ages 3 and under."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Snooze.","review":"The songs on this CD are indeed lovely, but collectively they make me want to curl up in a ball and take a nap.

She sounds like a singer that should have taken a bit of rest instead of winging it on the strengh of her reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but it's SO BORING","review":"I'm not too much younger than Carly and have been a fan for years. Her voice still sounds lovely but this album is a real yawner - and not because it's supposedly a collection of lullabies (Oh Susanna as a lullaby??? Please!). There's no energy here, no creative arrangments - just a monotonous collection of covers. The prettiest song by far is Quiet Evenin' because there's a little originality there. Then there's the problem of who this album is aimed at. Adults? Kids? I wish she had just made a nice collection of sweet songs for children which would have made far more sense then this disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"we all love Carly, but let's be honest here","review":"Carly Simon is a great artist, and deserves respect for past achievements, but let's be honest: This CD is TERRIBLE. In the words of my child, \\"Who is this guy with the awful voice, and why is he singing all these boring kids songs.\\" There is none of the sexy, raspy Carly herein. Instead, the CD sounds like a homemade soundtrack of the oldest lady in the church choir hosting a sing-a-long at Happy Acres. Save your money and stick with the music that is already in your Carly collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD...............","review":"this album was so hihghly waited to be listened to and what a big disappointment, no need to say anything else"},{"rating":"1","title":"How The Mighty Have Fallen....","review":"A friend at work let me listen to her copy of this disc. Oh My! Where to start? The choice of songs was poor and the performance was maudlin. Each song sounds basically the same. There is hardly any emotion being conveyed here. Bringing her children into the mix wasn't a wise choice either. The song, \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\", by her ex-husband is a case in point. Someone is singing off-key in the backround. Sorry, the son and daughter don't have their parent's talent. I could picture James Taylor singing his own version of the song. There is just no comparison of his singing this tune to this mess of an album. I gave Carly one star because of what she has done in the past. This really deserved a big, fat zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"There is only one song on this CD worth listening to : \\"You can close your eyes\\". All other songs make Carly's voice sound sad, crackly, out of tone, and emotionless. She should avoid solo performances and stick to harmony with her children."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic!","review":"This is an album that Carly Simon seems to have put together just to have something to make an album out of. Unbeliveable. Bought it and gave it away. Does not do the name Carly Simon justice. Her other music is so well written and beautiful. Also can't figure out when I would play this due to the large range of music included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed to the Max","review":"When I heard Carly had a new CD called Into White, I ordered 3 of them because I always loved her voice. When I listened to the CD, I was truly disappointed. My wife hated it, and so did everyone else that I tried to give the CD to. I sent the two unopened CDs back to Amazon and threw the other one in the trash. Two weeks later, I read an article in Business Week and the author of the piece was talking about how wonderful Into White was. I disliked the CD so much, I had to write a rebuttal to his story. Don't order this CD, IT IS AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into White Carly Simon A LETDOWN","review":"Voice is the same it always was-- The standards are not well served by her rendition of them. The musical score on these tracks tries to hard to feature her voice and much is lost inn the meaning of the song. Some of the new songs are pleasant to listen too, but are not that outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home again","review":"Carly Simon has always been one of my favorite musicians and songwriters. This album adds to her legacy as a musician and interpreter, and it's damned impressive.Her vocals are impeccable, and the choice of material on this quiet, introspective, and lovely recording is first-rate. I find myself wishing she would do an album of Stephen Foster's songs after listening to \\"Oh, Susanna.\\" Or that she would play the banjo.Includes notes written by Simon about the album's creation, which add to the overall aural appreciation of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into White by Carly Simon","review":"It's great to hear music that comes from the heart, and Carly, if you ever read this, know that I could feel your heart in this work! Thank you for the beautiful music that unfortunately doesn't get enough radio air time.I would vote for the Nobel Peace Prize in music for you, if there were such an award. If more people in this troubled world listened to music like yours, and more artists like you made CDs like this, perhaps we would finally learn to love each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING,DO NOT PLAY IN YOUR CAR","review":"I ADORE Carly Simon.I will to the end of my life.She has given me great pleasure over the years with her wonderfull music,and I know she is one of the the nices artist out there,and I have met her in person,and she was.\\"Into White\\" is so boring,except for the first track,\\"Into White.\\"This is the only song I play Over and Over again.Its BEUTIFULL.The rest fo the record takes alot of patience to listen to .(Wait untill you get to the \\"LaLa\\" cut.Thats the entire track}There are a couple of songs I enjoy,but they would be the cuts you would have for fillers on a regular album.The voice is still beutifull,but \\"Into White\\"is probally the least of my favorite records from this GREAT ARTIST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Carly","review":"I really love this CD - if you are a Carly fan, this is a must have.

I'm sure there will be some who would prefer a louder album, but this one is great because it mixes really old songs with covers for our contemporaries with a few surprises also in store. I especially enjoyed her duets with her son Ben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly's still got it!","review":"Carly's latest album combines new songs with some early American folk items, rock and roll standards, and standards. The result is very easy to listen to. Many of the songs are sung with her Ben Taylor, who sounds very much like his father. Their sound is delightful. My only quibble is that none of the songs is up-tempo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a good voice","review":"I was very disappointed by this CD. She made no use of her vocal strength or range.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it 1972 Again?","review":"It feels like it, after taking a first listen through \\"Into White.\\" As a longtime Carly Simon fan, I was initially attracted to songs like \\"Julie Through The Glass,\\" \\"Anticipation,\\" and \\"That's The Way I've Always Heard it Should Be.\\" And after many detours trying to stay relevant and sell records, Carly has returned to exactly the kind of introspective and ethereal music she made her name with early on. I don't think there's a track on this cd that I don't love. Where \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" felt like the marketing departments' idea, this record is hearfelt, and a great showcase for a really great interpreter of popular music. If you're a fan of Carly Simon, buy this cd. For those writing about how boring it is, did you look at the song list before you bought it??"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Carly Simon dream album.","review":"This has become one of my favorite albums when I want to listen to something soft and lovely.

Later I bought it on cassette tapes and after many years they just fell apart-the tapes practically snapped in half after constantly playing them. I am disappointed that this was never re-released on CD and that if you find it, it is way overpriced. If you can afford it-fine, then buy it. One of the best Live albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar","review":"This album is perhaps one of the best live rock albums of all time, capturing McCartney at his best. Two discs contain stellar material from start to finish, including some gems from the Beatle era, and even Denny Lane singing on the Moody Blues' hit \\"Go Now.\\" The highlight of the album, though, is probably \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" by all accounts a performance that eclipses the studio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterilized Rock!!!","review":"I saw Paul (Wings) 3 times during the 1976 tour. He was/is an amazing performer. The performance on this tour was top notch. However, although the sound on this album/CD is great, it is too \\"studio-ized.\\" You do not feel (or hear) the excitement of the audience. You hear the song and instruments as if the microphones fed them into a basement, and that's how the mix sounds to me. As I stated, I was at 3 shows, and although the music sounds like it did live, the sound doesn't. It doesn't even come close. I have a 3 album set bootleg (Los angeles, June 1976; red, white, blue vinyl) that kicks this CD's butt as far as reproducing what the concerts were like. If you are interested in \\"experiencing\\" the concert, buy the bootleg, skip this one. I'm not knocking Paul or the performance. In fact, if you weren't at any of these shows, you may prefer this type of mix. However, if you were..........You may be (like I was) major disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this not available for download?","review":"This is one of the best Wings recording - I especially like Picasso's Last Words - Richard Cory.

If you are a fan of this type of genre, you will love this DVD.What I Can Tell You:I am a huge fan of A&E; and I am also a huge fan of paranormal shows. Trying not to compare it to other widely popular shows, Paranormal State is headed by Ryan Buell who is also the director seems to really care about his cases. Although he is a little less empathetic than he was in earlier seasons. This series is different from the others because they use a psychic medium and often times bring in a priest to cleanse the house of any spirits.

There is only one guy on this series (big guy, Mike?) that occasionally overreacts, but that is occasional, while the other series, particularly Ghost Adventures, rely on their heavy diet of beans and Mexican food to get them through an episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season","review":"The show has come a long way since season one. I actually watched all of the shows in this season because I found the cases more interesting than some of the over dramatized earlier seasons.

He played off his awkward character quite well, but it was almost painful to watch because I was embarrassed for the kid. Actually, most of the characters were awkward. Maybe that was the intention, but there were some VERY strange moments that I didn't expect. I just expected more from the movie, and after watching it, it seemed empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I want is to return this movie","review":"I have to admit, I bought this movie because I am an Eli fan. And he was good in this but his character was very weird and frankly disturbed. The movie has very little plot or point and far too many daydream sequences. It is rather stupid and very boring. Rent it before you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Dissapointing","review":"I admit, i purchased \\"All I Want\\" (formerly known during production as \\"Try Seventeen\\") for Elijah Wood, yes, i admit. I was very excited when i heard a movie with Elijah Wood, Franka Potente, and Mandy Moore was being made because I absoluetly love them all. When I started to watch the film, it's opening was a bit iffy, but all doors were open. As the film got rolling, I found myself becoming more and more disinterested. There were some moments I found myself cringing from the acting. At others, I felt myself doze off into a fuzzy haze of bordom. By the end I wished i had my two hours back, and cursed the writer and director for their shoddy job. The movie had great potential, but in the end, was predictable, and uninteresting. I give it one star for (*) a waste of two hours, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very BoRiNg!","review":"This movie was so boring it was a drag to watch, it was cheezy too but I saw worst but I SURE saw better.

Elijah Wood is a 17 year-old who is out on his own in the world. He leaves college after only one day and gets an apartment where he meets two girls whom hate each other. Elijah is adorable (as usual) and you really feel for his character. Franka Potente is very good as well. While she seems crazy at first, she ends up being a very lovable character. Mandy Moore, on the other hand, was very unconvincing and had very wooden acting. I liked her in \\"A Walk to Remember\\" but she was just plain horrible in this. Besides her stinking up the movie, it is very lovable and I reccomend any young adult to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All That You Want and Funny","review":"Elijah Wood fans will like this movie. His performance was great. It's alittle confusing if you don't pay attention (fantasy or dream sequences). It is a sweet and funny coming of age movie. All the actors gave good performances. It is a bit of chick flick but not just for teens, as I am definately not a teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and entertaining","review":"I enjoyed All I want is all I need. I found it quirky & entertaining. Elijah Wood is the sardonic and jaded about his own life, but naieve about relationships. I found a lot to laugh at, especially his frankness to Lisa (Mandy Moore). His neighbors are an eclectic assortment that help him learn about life. Elizabeth Perkins embodies the Country Club mom. I found this different from the average same old story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same plot... again.","review":"How many times now have we seen movies that feature;*\\"Troubled teen\\"*Aspiring to be a writer*Flashes to sceens of \\"troubled teen hero\\" acting out the phony adventures he writes about.*dual 'love interest' goodgirl vs badgirl.Yawn, someone do something original already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frodo finally gets some","review":"This is a pretty poor romantic comedy/coming of age film, with all the conventions that you would expect: broken home, overly sensitive boy, wise older woman friend, rampant fantasies, etc etc. I really didn't find anything about it very interesting, with the exception of how his relationship with his mom evolves. But the silliness and frivolous ticks throughout the film never worked for me. All in all, I felt like it was a waste of time.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading too much into it...","review":"I think people read too much into this movie. I don't see it as a coming of age story or a teeny bopper flick. I mean let's face it, the only teeny bopper is Moore and she plays one of the older women. Granted the story line isn't the best, but the characters are amazing. You got a young dreamer played by Wood who is not satisfied with what the world is handing him and finally does something about it. There is a striving actress who is not good at all and it shows in her all around character. Then there is the mysterious photographer/artist who is a little freaky, but then a door opens into her life and we see her for what she really is. I really don't think the fact that Wood plays a seventeen year old should be relevant. It only says that seventeen is usually the age where your life makes its first drastic changes. I for one loved the change that Dillon and his mom had towards one another throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"All I Want looked like a promising movie with fresh bright actors, but instead was a \\"Teen\\" plot with the same mindless drivel as many other teen movies. The seventeen year old Jones is a similar character to Igby in the movie Igby Goes Down, the only difference being Jones stays a virgin. Don't waste your time or your money on All I Want."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I rented this movie simply because I'd heard of it previously since I adore Elijah Wood. I think this was a great movie. Very cute in it's own little romantic way. He's adorble and the movie is as well.

Opera singers love this stuff. It sure helps me. Start with 600mg orally, twice per day. It is a white powder, and has the look and feel of icing sugar. It has a very bitter after-taste and should be taken with lots of water. 500 grams of this stuff should last me a year. Great value.

I liked it a lot :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Play for All Times and Places","review":"Arthur Miller's play \\"The Crucible\\" is a play that defies all boundaries of time relevancy. It applies not only to the literal period in which it is placed, but also for other time periods most notably the Red Scare of the 1950's, set off by Senator Joe McCarthy (R-WI). It deals with the idea of hysteria and the terrible concept of guilt by association, and blindly blaming individuals, or blaming them for one's own financial profit. However, the play in and of itself is a great literary work. Miller does an outstanding job to convey the dark, melancholy atmosphere. He also portrays the hysteria of the town very well, chilling sometimes even his reader. Miller does a good job at showing a variety of characters and an intriguing plot. Miller creates a compelling story that explores the basis of a society powered by fear and greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good condition, but already written in","review":"The product itself comes nicely, but there is alraedy writing and highlighting in the novel, which is a major bother when reading it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand","review":"I bought this so my learning disabled students could read along in class with the play.

Miller's powerful language portray the chaos and fear of the time in spotless fashion, as the accusations of witchcraft get passed around like a basket of buns at a Thanksgiving table.

However, in reviewing the item in light of the fact that the local High School is putting on the play, I am struck by a common theme many of the other reviewers have touched upon. That being some common thread between witch trials and Joe McCarthy. McCarthy was many things, many of them bad. However, the substance of his claims were far more right than wrong. America, including many high offices in the government, of the 1940's and into the early 1950's was substantially infiltrated by Communists. That fact is provable by records opened to the public after the fall of the USSR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore Fest","review":"I went into this play with an open mind and a sort of delight for anything to do with history but I was EXTREAMLY disappointed!!

If not, make sure you have a pillow with you when you open to that first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsatisfying read.","review":"\\"The Crucible\\" is about a fascinating time in America's early history: The Salem Witch Trials. I found that Miller portrayed everyone as being naive and at times childish, and I found myself focusing on the utter stupidity of events, rather than the complexity of the characters. Until the fourth act, I found myself bored and frustrated. But, the pace picked up by the last act, and true drama surfaced. With very little stage direction, I cannot be fully taken with this play. I think it would have been better as a novel, as that is how it currently reads. You could write a good character analysis, once you get past the yearning to scream at the characters about how wrong they are. But other than that, this play is somewhat of a letdown. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"say no \\"what\\" you fool!","review":"The whole movie and book were a wondiful discription to what itwas in real life but whoever says that this was a bad and wastful book is very disturbed in the mind and sould get my and \\"Miss Cleos\\" profestional help! also if you even thought this was a great book but have troubl with family friends or mates please call me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for Drama Students","review":"This book is an alright book to read, if you were acting it out in Drama. If the book was written in regular form, then it would be good for the classrooms. This book was interesting to read but hard to understand. You had to some what jump back and forth between people talking. I feel for the people who had to be put in the concentration camps, and were forced to work against their will just to keep their family members alive. I do not think that people have a right to degrade other humans beings of their own kind or culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAVE YOU EVERY WANTED TO SCREAM AT A BOOK?","review":"This book was so amazingly moving, and so terribly fast-paced that I wanted to scream at it more than once. You will find yourself become so entangled in the wonderfully written dialogue that the reader becomes part of the Salem witch trials. It has a brilliant theme, and excellent direction.

Trust me, you will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a profound example of excellent literature","review":"This was an excellent play! The characters' lives were intricately woven with each other without a huge mess. A pleasure to read, but slightly disturbing, too.

If you want an involving, deep, intellectual book, this is one you should definitely consider!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that shows how stupid McCarthyism actually was.","review":"The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the \\"perfect\\" people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book....and the title does make sense","review":"I have always been interesting in the Salem Witch trials, and this book just heightened my interest. I read it in class, and there are so many nuances that you might never pick up on if you read it by yourself. For instance, the title. Another reviewer stated that it didn't make sense, but really, it did (that person's review made no sense at all). A crucible is a small metal container that you use in lab experiments, you place it over the fire, and it gets hot. This refers to the hysteria that was going on in Salem at the time, the heat is the mistrust and accusations being thrown about the town. Anyone who enjoys historical fiction would love this book, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PLAY!!!","review":"I didn't like this book at all!!! I think Arthur Miller tried to be like Shakespeare with this novel in combining high quality drama with torn love and also integrate more feuds into the poor plot of The Crucible in order to add fuel to the fire and of course we can't forget the difficult language as well as the detailed summaries as feedback to the reader on what he/she missed...The play only basically had two lines, in my opinion, throughout the whole novel....\\"you're a witch\\" and \\"you slept with my husband\\" that's all the novel was about yet there was no build up to these accusations....they just came out of thin air and I could care less about people being witches and affairs between people whose relationship is rocky from the start....I strongly urge you to not read this book...if you have to read this play for school, GET CLIFF NOTES because I can guarantee you that you will fall asleep right away at the slow moving action from this poor excuse of a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Understand...too confusing!!","review":"This book didn't help me in the least bit. I tried and triedto see if I could understand this book but it just wasn't enough. Theplot is basically the same throughout the story with people justaccusing each other of witches which I thought was pretty lame. I didhowever like the ending but the ending won't make my rating go up to 2stars. This book is harder to understand than a Shakespeare novelwhich to me is extremely hard. I wouldn't recommend this book toanybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crucible","review":"When reading the Crucible by Arthur Miller, I found that it was rather interesting to read. Even though that it was not my favorite book, there came a yearning to follow through with the book, to read till the end.The Crucible is a fictional play, based upon the witchcraft which had taken place during the Salem Witch Trials. This is always intriguing when an author takes past events and creates a fictional masterpiece.I was rather pleased with this play, but I will not be reading it any time soon, but it is worth the money to keep in the book case for later use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't co-mingle different readings","review":"All of these reviews appear to apply to the L.A. Theater Works reading of The Crucible. I wanted to read reviews about the Lincoln Center version. Co-mingling can be confusing. The Lincoln Center is unabridged and the reviews for the L.A. Theater Works make it sound abridged. I wonder if this review will end up in the L.A. Theater Works version reviews as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"In which time period is this book set again?","review":"The Crucible by Arthur Miller is not really a book, but I've decided to count it anyway. The play is short, and I finished it in one afternoon because I was so engrossed. Also, I enjoyed it much more than I did The Death of a Salesman, also written by Miller. One of my favorite aspects of the play was its relevance to modern times; at points, I couldn't tell whether the action was set in Salem in the 1600s or Washington DC in the 1950s. In addition, the first act included one of my favorite lines I've read recently: \\"Their fathers had, of course, been persecuted in England. So now they found it necessary to deny any other sect its freedom, lest their New Journalism be defiled and corrupted by wrong ways and deceitful ideas.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Assumption the Ultimate Deceit","review":"After reading \\"The Crucible\\" by Arthur Miller I've begun to realize the importance of children's actions. Assumptions can lead to anything, even death. In \\"The Crucible\\" Abigail a young beautiful girl terrorizes a peaceful town in Salem, MA. She accuses her fellow residents of witchcraft, which sparks a fire of assumptions made by the high and mighty factions of the town. These factions are thirsty for greed and land. They'll do anything to acquire land, leaving even the holiest in the community to trepidation. Abigail brings upon an accusation upon John Proctor her one-time lover. He provails morally in his quest to save his family name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Book","review":"It was an ok book. Some parts were interesting, but some parts were left to be desired. It was a bit complicated too, too many characters, kind of hard to follow along. But other than that, it was pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good play...","review":"This was a very good play. I was actually forced to read it for school though. Usually I'm reading books like \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The A-list\\", so this was a big change. The whole play is based around the character \\"John Proctor\\" who had an affair with a young girl, also neice of the Reverend, Abagail Willams. Abagail is determined to get him back, but John does not want her back and has to live with his guilt of adultery forever. Abagail,angry that John doesn't want her accuses his wife of witchcraft, along with many others. I won't tell you the ending, but it is pretty simple, how these people really thought that these people living around them were witches. The play is based on Mcarthyism... it was a really good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow along","review":"I bought this cd set to read the play along with my students. It's very theatrical and there are a lot of sound effects. The actors go so fast, that it's hard to follow along if you're reading the play. There's a lot of mumbling, sighing, heavy-breathing. Anyway, if you are wanting to just listen to it, this is a great purchase. If you want to read along, I would try a different cd set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop breathing into the mic, please.","review":"I was hoping to use this in my 11th grade class to go along with the text of The Crucible, but there's just no way. The readers certainly do express the emotions in the scenes, but it's pretty overstated. Did they record this whole thing in a sauna, or something? Enough with the heavy breathing! If you just want to listen to it for your own purposes, it's great, but in a classroom, expect your students to feel awkward and make jokes about how some parts sound like a bad porno."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"THE CRUCIBLE is a book about the Salem witch trials. The Salem witch trials are an interesting topic, but this book disturbs the events. This book bored me and it kept on talking about Satan. Why did it have to keep on talking about Satan? It would've been fine if the author would have just explained the hysteria that occured at the time, and not waste the reader's time by reading about Satan and Satan's power."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Respect Miller's Motives Most of All","review":"I understand that \\"The Crucible\\" serves as an allegorical attack on McCarthyism and Black Listing and I praise Arthur Miller for his wonderful use of allegory in the Salem Witch Trials. I personally, had a hard time reading this piece of drama. It was forced reading for English class and I may have found it more interesting if we, as a class, read it aloud with different students reading different parts, etc. However, my English teacher felt it best to assign an act a night leaving me confused and tired. I didn't find the story that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I don't think i have hated many books more than this one. The writing, syntax, diction and those aspects were okay, but the stupidity of the characters was so frustrating that I destroyed the book and returned it to my English teacher in pieces. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"I never received this product. I was told it was mine and that it was shipped.

Since I was unable to view pages on the website I was unaware of the print quality. I would choose a different edition, if I had it to do again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three-room boredom","review":"How incredibly dull! What poor character development! Miller has to develop his characters through long, boring paragraphs instead of just allowing them to speak and define their personalities that way. This guy should take a hint from Shakespeare (specifically, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar): develop characters by what they say and the way they say it. And then, on top of a slow plot and dry story line, Miller has the tenacity to set the entire play in only four or five rooms. For two acts they are in Betty's bedroom and Procter's living room. This book is a sleeper. But I do commend the grammar and sentence structure he used to at least make the characters seem like they're from New England in the 1600's."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's great.","review":"I have finished reading the Crucible - it is simply great. The text is wonderful, full of ironies and dramatic scenes - for example, the scene where Elizabeth lies for the first time in her life to save Proctor's reputation, only to realise that her good intentions have unwittingly helped Abigail. Land wars, revenge and a host of other reasons show us the repressed state Salem was in in those days. The relationships between the main characters : Proctor, Parris, Abigail, etc, were understandable and one could actually feel himself or herself praying that a particular character would survive the madness, or feel sympathy for even the villains. The Crucible was a great experience for me, and I hope that via this review many of you out there will go and buy this book to see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine","review":"Although i didnt like the story very much, i still had to read it for school.

However, there was some highlighting on the first couple of pages that bled thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I bought this to use with my basic 11th English class. It goes too fast, skips and rearranges lines, and is too hard to follow. At the end of one reading, several students left the class saying that they had no idea what the play was about so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the unabridged version","review":"While this version is a fine audio production, it is labeled incorrectly as the unabridged version. There are several parts that are edited out. I purchased this one as a supplement to the unabridged version in my classroom. However, it simply is no the unabridged version. If you do want this version, you could download this version from itunes in a matter of minutes rather than waiting for it to ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"my crucible reveiw","review":"I thought this book was an interesting peice.

It kept my interest. It went pretty fast, also. I tend to like things with drama in them. This play was full of drama. The book cleared up a lot of things for me, actually. I had always wanted to learn more about the Salem Witch Trials, but I never had time to. It also gave you some background information on how things were when America first started to develop. How similiar it is to today, but also how much differant it is. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning about history in a non-history teaching way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"An obvious metaphorical look at the McCarthyist 1950s, this play is stark and no fun.

Abigail Williams, along with several other women from the village, have been accused of witchcraft. If they do not admit to these accusations, they will be hanged. I believe the theme Miller is trying to convey throughout this novel is hysteria. People are accusing these women of crimes for which they have no proof of their guilt. The major conflict in the book is that society is too accusatory. Everyone is guilty by association in their eyes. Miller uses metaphors throughout the novel to allow you to visualize objects better in your mind. I did not like this novel because it's characters are too suspicious and unreasonable. They threaten people with death if they do not admit to crimes they didn't commit. It's crazy! The novel itself was just depressing to me. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I read this in high school and saw the movie for the same class, and it is not just a play, but a social commentary on that time, including different attitudes like hypocrisy and manipulation.

This album is very good with exceptional lyrics and awesome bass booming beats. Songs like, \\"Room to Breathe\\" and \\"This is a Visit\\", are the cream of the crop; along with \\"Natural People\\" and \\"Radioactive\\" not too far behind. The best part about this album is the rap songs that make you want to kick back and chill to, like \\"Catch the Wave\\" and \\"Summertime\\", which are also great to listen to during the summer months.

We like the 'random' feature, but that has completely stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real MP3 support","review":"If you care about using MP3 CD's, I think this is the unit to get. Many units will play MP3 CD's, but this is the only one I found that displays artist/title info for MP3 tracks, and lets you select and play tracks as organized by folders on the disks. I exchanged a Denon DCM-27 for one of these and I am much happier with the Onkyo.Cons:No CD-Text display.Some functions are exclusive to either remote or front panel. (Why does the remote have a tray-open button, but no display control/dimmer buttons?)No headphone jack. No A -> B repeat.A bit larger than some (due to its 6-disc capacity).It's as slow (15-20 seconds between tracks) and clunky in multi-disk random mode as the other carousels on the market (but doesn't squeal when seeking the next track like the Denon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I've had nothing but trouble with my unit. With brand new CD's it sometimes will play all the CD's loaded, sometimes not. I have to turn the machine off and on and otherwise it will refuse to play CD #2 or #4 or whatever. If you are looking for a CD player that you just load up CD's and hit play this unit does not work, but the CD's play just fine in my older CD player. Onkyo support does not call/email/write back. This was a new unit. I suggest you save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onkyo DX-C390 CD Changer - Poor Quality Unit","review":"After purchasing this changer I will never buy another Onkyo component again. Approximately 20% of my CD's will not play in the random (shuffling)mode, those that do play will frequently stop playing, the display timer does not work, and Onkyo's customer service is non existent.When I contacted Onkyo about the problems the only recourse I was offered was to return it to the point of purchase for an exchange. I did not consider this a fair solution since J&R; is 3,000 miles and 2-3 weeks away via UPS. There is an authorized Onkyo repair shop a couple of blocks away from me, but Onkyo refused to assist me by dealing through them. I have decided to just cut my losses, just go buy another brand of CD changer.and tell anyone who asks what I think of Onkyo products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"Over the years I've owned many cd players. After purchasing my OnkyoI was so impressed by the sound it produced that I purchased a second one for my other system (yes I have two systems). The good news is that this player will play any disc and play through scratches and imperfections. The bad news is that both of my Onkyo's developed problems after 1 1/2 years. The players wouldn't turn on or off from time to time. The drawer wouldn't open. Strange error messages lit up in the display area. To turn off the players I had to unplug them. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are deceiving","review":"It looks good on the surface but looks are deceiving. This wasn't very heavily used in our household but the first part we had to replace six months after purchase was the imaging module. That took the player out for more than a month while we waited for a part and then the repair person could not exactly match the original manufacturer's part. Now it's stopping in the middle of songs, turning off and on by itself and has once reported some kind of error code on the front pannel though after a short wait started working again.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk IMHO. Your experience may varry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onkyo DXC390 6 Disc CD Player--Doesn't Work as Promised","review":"My first Onkyo 6 Disc CD Changer died in March of 2011. It had played music without interruption for 19 years. What a great piece of equipment! Since then, I have ordered two new CD changers in the past month (March 2011)and neither one of them compares to the first. There are a number of issues with the new version. They do a poor job of playing CDs that are copies of original CDs. They stop in mid song and quit playing. Then mysteriously moves to the last song on the CD. We have no clue what makes the machine do this. It must be possessed! Finally, on some CDs, when the last song has played, the changer will not switch to the next CD. We are totally bummed out by this. The overall machine doesn't have the same quality as the old model and appears to be of cheaper materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems as everyone else","review":"Stay Away from this one. This is my first review on Amazon and I just wanted to let people know that my unit froze up at the first year mark as other people have posted.

Very disappointed in Onkyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Product","review":"Bought this product in June 2008, and had good service from it...until September 2009. The unit refused to come on with the remote or manually. Pulling out and reinserting the power plug resulted in the unit coming on, which allowed me to get all but 1 of my CD's out. The unit, however, will not play the CD that has remained inside. I expected a better product from Onkyo, but this has definitely been a bug disappointment. I certainly would not recommend this product. Heed this warning, and those from the other reviewers who had problems with it. I should have paid attention to the poor reviews, but instead, I took a chance and got a product for < $150, to use for 15 months...Works out to roughly $10/month rental of an Onkyo DXC390"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"After having this CD player for about 11 months, it started switching itself on at random times. I changed the surge protector/power bar it was connected to and made sure none of my remote control devices was creating the problem. Once the surge protector was changed the program disappeared for about a week or two, only to resurface. Now the device won't even switch on. No other device connected to the surge protector (ADM tuner, Yamaha cassette player, Acurus amp, Teac turntable, Terk antenna) has developed any problems over the same period.

After several weeks however, it would power on randomly with a flashing blue light. We would turn it off, but a few minutes later it would come on again. Some CDs wouldn't play at all. Often it would start playing in the middle of a CD that was no longer in the player. Unfortunately, although it was a good idea, we would never buy this one again. It had so many issues it wasn't worth trying to repair so it was put out with our E-waste less than a year after we bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst CD player I've ever had","review":"I love Onkyo products.... They work and sound great and do everything that you could ask for.... Except this one. After a little over a year, I was noticing that the CD player would turn itself on. Soemtimes it would start playing the CD, others it would start and pause it. There were even times where I couldn't control anything. I did some online research and it seems that there are a good amount of consumers having issues with this CD player. It was great before the issues started, but for $200 I shouldn't have issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Changer","review":"Purchased this five CD Changer at Christmas as my previous CD Player (Sony) would no longer work as it was suppose to.

The Sony became less and less reliable in playing all selections when the player was in the random mode. This Onkyo player works great and is completely reliable in the random play mode. I would recommend it for anyone. Although nothing is said in the advertising about this unit coming with a remote, it does, and the remote has features not found on the old Sony remote. It's a great piece of equipment at at very fair price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is the second Onkyo CD player my Grandparents have owned, and also the second Onkyo POS to die in 3 years. I've had good luck with my Onkyo surround sound system, but after doing a little reading on how Onkyo is treating its customers with this CD player, I have to say I'll never purchase another unit of theirs again. I understand stuff happens, but FIX IT when it does happen! The thing just goes haywire. Doesn't recognize CD's, the Pause light keeps going on/off randomly, it turns itself on, shows EEPROM-XXX:XX messages on the front, doesn't eject the tray half of the time, etc. WORTHLESS!

The height is a bit to long though.I hooked up with Onkyo TX805 and it sounds amazing. Also it has good features as blue light on when the Cd is playing, random play, track selection and so on.I bought this because my Philips DVD (Upscaling and Region free) has a major fault playing CDs which is it makes a small noise when playing CDS.But this Onkyo CD changer can contains 6 CDs and sounds great so I am happy to have this.After using it for a couple of months, it begins to avoid playing a lot of CDs.Lense problem starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while/if it lasts","review":"I bought this [new] from Amazon not quite 1 year ago and now it's dead.

I even bought a CD-brush cleaner but the problem wasn't as simple as a little dust.Why are stereo components nowadays made so crappy that you have to keep replacing them? Is everything made in China? Too bad they didn't make CD players back in the 70s when stereo electronics were made in the USA and Japan with QUALITY.

Overall, this album isn't as good as E.1999, but the good songs may be better than some of the best songs on their earlier album.

Once home, her mind and memories slowly returning, she makes contact with a beloved childhood friend. So close and intense is this friendship that her friend willing entraps and tortures victims to keep the reluctant vampire well fed and healthy. The blood drinker suffers from such anguish that the viewer is sooned asking just who is the real monster in this sad and ultimately tragic tale.

There are, of course, classics that I am familiar with, but there are plenty I am not. He does have a good voice, and the use of children singing along is not overdone as can often be the case.

All the books are wonderful, but Taran Wanderer has always been my favorite. It has a different tone than the other books. In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out on his own to discover what he should do with his life. There is something noble, profound, and a little lonely, about this kid wandering around on his own, with only his horse and Gurgi, trying to figure out what type of man he should become. This book is more thoughtful and moving than the other books, and sets the scene for the big finale in The High King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Loydd Alexander is a wonderful writer, however this book is by far the worst in the series. The main charactor Tarran looks for his realatives to find if he is of noble birth.

It is a side-scrolling beat'em up type of game (like: Renegade,Kung Fu,Double Dragon). Your girlfrined (Madonna) is kidnapped by some punk a** skinheads. You must go through several levels/stages & fight them to get back your girl! As you go through the game, you can grab items such as nunchucks. It was a great game & had great graphics for it's time! It's a simple button game that can be somewhat repetetive, yet fun & replayable. I recommend this game to those that have a Turbo Grafx16, those that love old school games & fighters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I don't want to go on too much here, but Crack the Sky is one of the best bands around (still gigging in the MD area, check out their website if you're interested ..., and White Music is a good example of CTS on the top of their game. Not the absolute best CTS but very cool songs featuring some of JohnP's typically sarcastic songwriting and great playing from the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!","review":"Wow, let me 1st state that i'm a newbie to the Red Chord. After hearing the first couple of songs it totally exceeded my expectations 10 fold. I would describe them as mixture of metalcore, death, and grind. Pretty much everything i want in a metal band. It's definately something some mainstream and death metal fans could get into. It has lots of blast beats and brutal, growling vocals. I must say The Red Chord is now my favorite band and i'm telling all my friends to pick up this cd. And if anyone says they suck they can go suck a d**k."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Chord...back with a vengeance","review":"Do NOT listen to the guy who compared this to Throwdown and Hatebreed. He's an idiot. If those two bands sounded like this, i would actually like them! Clients is brutal, technical, and angry. The song writing overall is better that on Fused Together in Revolving Dorrs (a classic) and the production is top-notch. If you like heavy, fast, grinding, extreme music, you must buy this NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a bit different","review":"The Red Chord kinda puts a new twist on extreme music. I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \\"Death/Grind\\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I read the reviews and everyone said this was a great piece of work. Well I agree that it was a peice of something but I won't go into that. This album is nothing but noise. There is no rythum to the album what-so-ever.

As for this album, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the F*** is this?","review":"This is by far one of the worst cds I have ever heard. This singer is terrible and should be shot with a very heavy animal tranquilizer. I never was a big fan of grindcore or hardcore so I guess this isn't my cup of tea at all. The drummer is damn good though. He should start another band and leave these guys to play a half empty venue the rest of their lives with the likes of Blood Has Been Shed, Hatebreed, Bleeding through.Don't buy it because it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What word should I add \\"core\\" to?","review":"I don't believe in labeling metal now'a'days with \\"core\\" on the end, deathcore, grindcore, metalcore, polkacore. It's ridiculous. This band does have many influences but I think that they're mostly rooted in death metal. I'm not a big fan of death metal, but I do love this CD. Listening to this album, to me, is like stepping onto one of those amusement park rides that whip you around everywhich way until your head is about to detach from your shoulders, and IT'S FUN!!

Even the backgrounds lack depth and interest.Yes, there are colorful displays of fireworks, at times.

It's the 14th Century and evil queen Malificent curses Aurora, the king's infant daughter, taking away her happily-ever-after. Or so it would seem.The brilliant interpretation of Tchaikovsky's ballet score and the distinctive medieval-inspired art of Eyvind Earle's detailed, pastel-hued, vertical-horizontal compositions, make this timeless romance -- based on a folk tale that arose after the Dark Ages (and a metaphor for the times?) -- a must-have for the digital family library and a masterpiece of animators' art.

Maybe, its my slightly warped personality that makes me root for the villains. \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" boasts a humdinger of a bad girl in the guise of Malificent, maliciously voiced by the late character actress Eleanor Audley. She had the perfect pipes for the portrayal of one devoid of compassion and love.The actress had previously made a distinctive contribution to an earlier Disney film, the classic \\"Cinderella\\" (she was the wicked stepmother). '60's audiences also remember her as Eddie Albert's mother on the comedy classic \\"Green Acres\\" and her frequent appearances on that other country-themed comedy \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\".Also, being a dragon fan, I love Malificent's final transformation as she takes on the valiant, handsome, and dashing (although, bland) prince.Unfortunately, the good guy wins."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail MALEFICENT!!!","review":"This is my absolute FAVORITE Disney movie!!

That release was pretty much on the \\"Platinum\\" status to me. They should have done this then. Maybe this is part of their plan of releasing their classics every 7 to 8 years. I guess they started a little early with this one. I heard they'll be releasing Beauty and the Beast again in a couple of years, so I guess we're beginning another cycle of paying for things we already own. I'm talking about the DVD fanatics, of course. This is still a maybe for me since I have the other version, but I'm still glad they're putting it out again for the future generation. I grew up with it. Others should too.

The only problem with the copy that I got was that I had ordered a used one to include the DVD as well as Blue Ray. All of the disks were included, but the cover was only for the blue ray and the DVD copy came in a paper sleeve inside it. If it doesn't have it's own place in the case itself, I'm not sure how well I'll be able to keep track of it before it gets lost or even broken. Once again.

Very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond Childhood Memory","review":"This has to be the sweetest, most enchanting fairytale of all. How could I have ever forgotten this captivating fairytale? The three fairies that help protect the Princess Aurora, the mean, evil witch, Prince Phillip, the dragon, all spun together to make a tale that boys, girls, young & old would enjoy. I saw the beauty of this movie thru my eyes as a child, now my grand-daughters eyes.This timeless movie is a must for all children to see. Its a remembrance of a time when life was magical and beautiful, full of the things sweet dreams are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Amazing","review":"This is a great DVD! It had been such a long time since I had seen this movie that it was almost like seeing it for the first time. The animation in this movie is awesome, classic Disney, very detailed and engaging, in a clean and simple style.The remastering is perfect, they didn't try to remake the movie. They preserved the movie and enhanced the image so that it looks more seamless, almost real.This is a great story, one that people of all ages can enjoy. I highly recommend this DVD, no collection will be complete without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD lacks of something...","review":"The title has just been released in Mexico in DVD and I bought it as soon as I knew it was available. This is my favourite classic Disney movie and was expecting that all the extras would be treated in the same way as in Snow White or Beauty and the Beast, but was very dissapointed. Most of the \\"Extras\\" are just plain text and the menu in the second disc is very plain, nothing to talk about.The images are very clear and the sound very good, that's the least Disney could do for its very first movie in stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Good Thing\\"","review":"When I was little, this was the movie that I rented every single time we rented movies because it made me happy, it made me sad, and it scared the crap out of me when the dragon came so much that I had to hide behind the couch. This movie is my favorite disney film. Both my sisters called me gay when the saw me come home with this movie when it was re-released on video. I watched that tape so much that I wore it out and I had to throw it away. I was so sad. When I saw the dvd in wal-mart one day I picked it up right away and payed for it. The picture was even better than I could emagine, I saw things I never did before thanks to the widescreen formate, and the sound quality was awsome. I am now 17 years old and its still in my dvd player at least twice a week. When I have kids, I'm going to show this movie to them and all the rest of the old disney movies and I'm sure that their emagination will take them into the movie just as mine did, and that will be a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Beauty BD","review":"I consider this a must-have for:-Baby Boomers who have kids-If you have a DVD, BD, HDDVD collection.If you fit either one or the other of these two criteria but not both, then this is a 'maybe' and the economy may be the swing vote.If you fall into both, then I don't think you'll regret the purchase regardless (not irregardless; You know who you are!), of what shape your finances are in."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONLY BEAUTY DESERVES THIS HONOR!!","review":"I cannot think of a more deserving Disney animated classic than SLEEPING BEAUTY to be the FIRST to be released on a platinum edition BLU-RAY disc.Owning the two-disc DVD edition, and seeing the splendid already restored negative in that release, I can only imagine the magnificent quality of the 1080p picture and 7 channel Dolby soundtrack. This is one of Disney's most ambitious and yet underestimated film, in my opinion the best of the animated classics. I cannot wait until October 7th to see this on my home theatre screen. Hurry Disney!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I ordered two copies of the DVD for Sleeping Beauty, one for each of my three year old granddaughters. The DVDs do not play correctly they skip a big chunk of the video and the color is off!! I will not order another DVD from amazon when the DVDs came -- on the back of the DVDs it says made in Mexico. These are not worth the money that I paid for them --- expected more from an Amazon product."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISMENT!","review":"One of my favorite Disney movies of all time. Just wish THIS WAS THE SAME PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED AND PICTURED! Bought the DVD/Blu-Ray combo, received just the blu-ray version. Very dissapointed. Seller has no intention of changing advertised picture and description. I'm not the only one who has had this problem. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Outrageous !!!","review":"I was charged for more than USD 40 for this Blu-Ray, I was surprised to see a sticker from Best Buy for more than USD 20, I just can't believe It !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Ray disc was scratched and will not play.","review":"I understand I bought a set of used discs, but I don't feel a disc that is scratched so badly it wouldn't play, is not acceptable. I know the scratch was there when we received it because it was visible when we went to play it. Very disappointing.We didnt send it back because the other disc worked fine and returning it would have been very time consuming and would have cost more in gas than the DVD was worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Well worth the wait. Color was great in blue-ray.Always enjoyed this movie, but now it is even greater.Will watch it over again with my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy!","review":"I loved the condition and time span it came between.

The dvd has been watched numerous times and always a delight to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Maleficent.","review":"The blu ray version of Sleeping Beauty looks absolutely beautiful. The colors really pop off of the screen. They did a great job with the transfer. This is a must have for any Disney fan, in any format, blu ray, DVD, VHS, out doesn't matter, you just need to own this movie. This is where it all began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disney Animated Movie Ever","review":"I have had this blu-ray for over 3 years now and I have come to love this movie a lot. This movie is filled with many compelling characters and a well-developed story that makes you want to watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of extras","review":"I am a big fan of extra features... and this has it. I loved the feature of having some art fill the black on the screen while it was playing. The Blu-ray also has the option of leaving messages to loved ones or communicating while watching the movie with a family member who is also watching it. I haven't used this feature but I can only assume it would be exciting. I love the extra features this has. The whole story behind how they built the Sleeping Beauty attraction in Disneyland Resort was Awesome!You can't beat having two of a good thing. I love this movie and I know not everyone has Blu-ray, yet, so having a DVD copy helps. I can lend this movie out to friends while still having my Blu-ray copy on me.I thought it was an amazing buy for me. If your even a little fan, you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite disney films","review":"I still have a vague memory of seeing this film in the theatre when I was around 3 years old. I remember I loved the good fairies, especially the bright blue one.This film is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by both males and females of any ages, although I think it appeals mainly to the 6-12 year old crowd. I think the ending scene with the dragon is too violent for kids under 6.The music is gorgeous and the drawings are all so detailed, unlike the recent Disney stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"What a nice restoration job was done when transfering this to DVD. It is sharp and beautiful. The audio is outstanding as well. The film is as vibrant as the outer packaging is and the special features only enhance the value of this wonderful DVD. A true classic and suitable for even the smallest children.These releases are great and you should collect them all because at some point they won't be there any more unless you want to pay big bucks on e-bay. Things this wonderful never last. Purchase it now. If you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself and your child to own it.Amazing...!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Beauty","review":"The colors in the Disney DVD make it wonderful to watch.

It was a treat for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood favorite","review":"I saw this at the Fox Theater in Detroit Michigan when I was twelve and fell in love with it...it is a must have for all Disney fans.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Beauty","review":"This is one of my favorite Disney films from their classics. I had a great experience purchasing it from the third party seller and would purchase from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Disney Classic","review":"It seems the old Disney movies have the scarier villains. Sleeping Beauty is no exception. Something else that is no exception is the way the girls wait around for Prince Charming. And let me tell you, I'm REALLY REALLY MAD about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail Aurora and this Edition of Sleeping Beauty","review":"To be very honest, I debated on whether or not to purchase this edition of Sleeping Beauty because I have the 2003 version. I was skeptical because I was afraid that the bonus features on this new edition would excluded the Grand Canyon featurette and the Story of Peter Tchaikovsky until lo and behold, it was included. I have yet to have seen all of the bonus features of the DVD but the film looks and sounds greater than the 2003 version I noticed more detail and the sound was outstanding. The Disneyland Walk-Through feature was just breathtaking as this was the version I never saw.I strongly recommend this for any Disney fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Little Girls","review":"My 5 year old has been wanting Sleeping Beauty for months, but it is not available in stores. I found this on Amazon.com and bought it. I was a great purchase. I think she and her little sister have watched it a million times already. It is a great movie. I highly recommend it to anyone with little girls who love Disney Princesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Beauty!","review":"Disney really gave this film the art-treasure treatment. The film is nearly 50 years old, but the colors glow and the sound is wonderful. A painstaking frame-by-frame restoration was conducted, and the soundtrack remastered, resulting in a film which probably looks better now on DVD than when it was originally released. This film has always been a favorite of mine of all the Disney classics, and I think the music has a lot to do with it. \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" is truly beautiful, which is a given considering the classical composition it was based on. The artwork is superb, even for Disney in its heyday. This movie is rightly considered a classic, and has finally been given its due on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a great addition to the disney BLU-RAY store","review":"So, this has always been a great movie. I know that this will look spectacular on BLU-RAY.I just have one question: Does any body know when the other original disney movies will be released on BLU-RAY??UPDATE: I have purchased this item, and it is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wont play","review":"Cant tell......didnt see it.. My blue ray player wont recignize the first disk. Which is the movie. But does play the second disk that is the games for kids....... So, not happy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was so psyched to see this movie again--I LOVED this when I was a little girl! Sadly, it just isn't all that I remembered it to be--we (the hubby, my 2 year-old and my 5 year-old) almost fell asleep on this movie. It is slow-paced and uninteresting. The music is lame; the premise is lame. The fairies are still as fun as I remembered, but not good enough to carry an entire movie. Lest you think I am too picky, I do want to say that we all enjoyed Snow White, & Cinderella and both of these movies were made before my mother was born (I am 35 years-old). It is NOT that this movie is old--it's just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Beauty\\" of a DVD","review":"Sleeping Beauty has been a classic story for centuries and now it's special edidtion release on DVD means more people can see this tale the way it was meant to be told and although it's a great story with brillient animation and an excellent plot it doesn't quite match up to some Disney classics like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Sorry folks but this tale ain't gettin' a high vote fae me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another twisted Disneyfication of a classic fairy tale...","review":"This is another Disney \\"classic\\" in which almost all sense of the original fairy tale has been removed. In this case, things like rape, adultery, cannibalism and more. In place of the original story line Disney adds annoying soprano's trilling away, an evil witch that turns into a dragon, and a 16 year slumber party at the good fairies house!?! To experience the real Sleeping Beauty I suggest reading Giambattista Basile's \\"Sole, Luna, E Talia\\", Charles Perrault's \\"The Sleeping Beauty In The Wood\\", or even the Grimm's \\"Brier Rose\\". Disney destroys real classic fairy tales and controls the minds of your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"This was a gift for our granddaughter and the DVD is defective. We will soon be going through the return process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Beauty","review":"The defect with the Sleeping Beauty DVD is that the movie only shows in the middle 3rd of the TV. We have viewed 3 separate DVD's and the all do the same thing. Amazon sent us the 3rd movie free but it still has the same defect as the other 2 DVDs. If you have a Sleeping Beauty DVD that does not have this defect, we would like to receive a new DVD without the defect.

My mother didn't like this movie because of the 3 fairies in it, we don't believe in good witches. of course the second fairy who had a blue dress was a very mean one. and the movie gave me nightmares because their is a scary fairy but that's not the scariest part the most scariest part of this is the music. The music was so scary I got terrified.

I love the DVD format and was thrilled at the great condition this arrived in as I purchased it used. Although the story is timeless, the music and singing are very operatic, which is fine because it was so well done. Indeed, it's great to have a mix of styles within our Disney Collection. Besides, how can a kid really enjoy Sleeping Beauty's Castle at Disneyland and on every Disney movie if they don't see this wonderful story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Legal?","review":"All packaging says it's Sleeping Beauty, 50th Anniversary, Platinum Edition.

Embarrassed to give item as gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's Greatest Effort","review":"My grandmother owned movie theaters in Pittsburgh when I was a boy, and I went to the movies every weekend. I got to see all of the Disney classics, but Sleeping Beauty was, far and away, Disney's finest hour. The colors screamed off of the screen, and were at their best when the fairies were \\"warring\\" over what color to make Aroura's birthday dress. The fairies themselves were incredibly fun to watch & listen to, but the real star of the film was the most evil of all Disney's bad guys: Maleficent. When she laughs, your blood crawls. And when she turns into a dragon, the graphics are amazing.I can only imagine what the restoration process will do to the colors in this movie, but if the restoration of \\"Snow White\\" is any indication, then the relaease on DVD of Sleeping Beauty will be the masterpiece of all animated films.I can NOT wait until September for the release of this film. Even my kids are salavating at the thought of having this in our family DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was a just a kid when I first saw this movie.

I give it a thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Magical after all these years ^_^","review":"I grew up in a time Fairy Tales were the stuff of every little girl's dreams... I grew up almost every day with Sleeping beauty.Although I prefer (visually) the older, grittier version, It's great that Disney has taken the step to preserve this masterpiece of color for the new generation of watchers.Personally, there are only a handful of real Disney treasures. And their color, attention to detail, and depth is beyond perfect. In the world of mass production, Disney's creations today has become a flat and somewhat monotonistic in color and depth. So nothing will beat the meticulous art that have been poured to Disney Classics such as Sleeping Beauty, Snow white, Pinocchio, Lady & the Tramp, and Little Mermaid ^_^Still. This 2-disk edition is a very good tribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Beauty","review":"We are in the process of updating our Disney movie collection from VHS to DVD since we no longer have a VCR.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great packaging!","review":"It was packaged very nicely and with the product sleeve, which is the most important part of my Disney collection movies.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"something for everyone","review":"True to his nature, this is a very fun and energetic Jools Holland album, enlivened even more by the guest musicians. 21 tracks and over 70 minutes of music also ensures that you get your money's worth. I few of these songs feature artists than I'm not crazy about (Michael \\"Marble Mouth\\" McDonald and Prince Buster) but overall it's a fun, eclectic bunch. I particularly like David Gray's vocal on \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today,\\" Steve Earle doing \\"Play It Sam\\", and the late Kirsty MacColl singing \\"Shutting the Doors.\\" Even Ronnie Wood's remake of \\"Ooh La La\\" still brings a smile to my face. Good music, good times, a good listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe they changed the ingredients recently.....","review":"I really have no idea how this product has so many positive reviews.

Very underrated work. Some deep and devastating tunes on here; inspired and passionate music, real creativity at work, elevated by the singing and those lovely harmonies. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, along comes the closing medley --- clever covers of Prince's \\"1999,\\" \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" by Talking Heads, and Harry Nilsson's \\"Coconut\\". What a delight! Listening to that medley always has me smiling in appreciation --- and pleasure --- that they could merge such a seemingly crazy trio of songs into one seemless piece of music. Great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank Tibbetts","review":"This is one of the best albums of all time! I have literally gone through two of these cd's! Contemporary Jazz/Christian, I've never heard anything quite like this style of music before and I absolutely love it! I keep a copy in my car and one in my cd player in my house.It wouldn't be fair to say that any particular song on this album is any better than the other; all I can say is that this record is a \\"mood\\", like anything from Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin.These two guys are musical geniouses in my opinion. The first album is just as good as this one, so either way, you can't go wrong. Money VERY well spent to anyone who is curious about this. I'm a living testament saying \\"BUY THIS! BUY THIS!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The thrill is gone","review":"It pains me to say this, but I didn't like this album as much as the first two. There's no edge, no bounce, no rap! Prince Be is a great rapper (when most rap sucks), but we don't get to see it on this album. No killer beats or hooks. (The one exception is probably \\"Sometimes I Miss You So Much\\" that has a sample of Al B. Sure's \\"Night and Day\\" in it.) It's good for background ambiance on a lazy day, but it doesn't demand my attention, and I couldn't lose myself in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i don't know why i passed on this one...","review":"For whatever reason this was the only PM Dawn album I didn't run right out and purchase (and still haven't). But now with their 4th album on the way I felt compelled to go back and listen to a group that really had no sound you could pin to one genre of music. The soul-funk/hip-hop music and lyrics of their previous albums grabbed me like no other group had before and after seeing a clip of their upcomming release, I think they're ready to make a definite (and well deserved) comeback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" in your neo- soul collection","review":"Having the opportunity to hear some of the tracks from this album almost a year ago was such a pleasure but a big tease because I have been anxiously awaiting for Geno to release this album for the longest- and let me tell ya it was worth the wait. The way real music should be- going back to the foundation of soul and R&B music with its jazzy -soul feel, this CD envokes you. The lyrics are just as permeating to the soul. A must have in your neo soul collection. Check it out- it is definitely worth it- true artisty at heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a cd with no track skipping!","review":"This cd does not require track skipping at all! If you like Dwele and jazz music then this is for you! Geno should be blowing up real soon!

The hard-hitting \\"Safety in Numbers\\" album that taught us what head-banging really means (while ducking flying matchbooks) now available on CD. After all those years of desparate searching to find a good plastic copy, finding one of my favorite albums digitally remastered is a dream come true. Just thinking of \\"nuclear apathy\\" gives this writer some welcome flashbacks!! While not as numbing, \\"Animal Notes\\" is a nice contrast in witty humor, driven by John P. Maybe it was the conditions in that dorm room that night, but nothing has quite measured up to the \\"Safety in Numbers\\" album and probably never will."},{"rating":"2","title":"All The Reviewers Are Right!!","review":"I had \\"Staircase of a Thousand Steps\\" on my night table, about three books down. Seeing the great editorial and customer reviews here, I was skeptical. Could a book be That Good? Yes, I just finished it (in a marathon reading session). It is: That Good. I agree with what all the reviewers, both professional and customers, have said. It has been one of the great reading experiences this year. I teach Middle East Studies here in Vermont and so must read a great deal about the area. But this transcends anything I've read to date because it is true fiction that also gives readers a window onto a distant time and place. Ms. Hamilton is, without question, a superior novelist. Her characters are perfectly created--they come fully alive on the page. Her book is: fascinating, captivating and most of all, intensely moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great depth of characters!","review":"I read somewhere that this book was a bit slow in the beginning, but I have to disagree; I did not find it slow at all. It laid the framework for a wonderfully woven story by allowing the reader to get to know the characters deeply. That is what makes a great novel leave its imprint! The story is great, the descriptions are vivid, but to me the most important part is getting to know the characters whom I can remember in the future as if I had met them. Not since Memoirs of a Geisha had I been so sad to finish a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding, believable page-turner","review":"Masha Hamilton has created a world steeped in mystery and tangled with superstition, ignorance and merciless retribution mostly affected against women. Her heroines stand their ground in a land where that can cost your life. Magnificent, beguilingly simple story telling combined with deft handling of detailed material that has to come from experience,\\"Staircase\\" is truly a wonderful story. This praise does not come lightly. I truly felt I was there, every step of the way. In fact, with each successive chapter, the feeling of being immersed in the story became stronger, until I finally put aside everything I was doing to finish the book instead. Lovely. Read this book; you'll never forget the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Small Book That Packs a Wallop","review":"I picked up Masha Hamilton's novel, thinking it was a small book because it is, physically. I took it on a plane ride from Boston to London, and didn't stop reading it until I walked through UK immigration counter. Ms Hamilton weaves such a powerful spell here, evoking times long past, an intricate tale in a seemingly ancient world-- all related with such specificity and magical ur-reality, that I couldn't believe I had initially seen it as small. The world created here is huge and all-encompassing. Best novel of 2001, so far. Five Stars and hats off to Hamilton, who is a major talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun dance mix","review":"This is the perfect cd to pop in at a party or kick back.

This story is so cute and has a very creative ending. The pictures are colorful and help to tell the story for children too young to read. I would definitely recommend this book. Especially for children between the ages of 3 and 9 and for anyone who loves a good pirate story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"Roger does not fit in with the other pirates. The tease him and call him Jolly Roger and they don't mean it nicely. When the Admiral comes aboard, Roger is sent below. He wants to be liked so he decides to bake a cake in a large pot that is really a connon. He ends up as the hero with a whole new respect. They make a flag in honor of him, the skull and cross bones, and name it the Jolly Roger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"While on the ship, Roger is constantly made fun of for his odd behavior as a pirate. He is constantly ridiculed and put below the deck when they attack someone. But, in the end, it's Roger's silliness that saves the day for the ship.Roger the Jolly Pirate is not only a well written book, but it's also very well illustrated. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys pirates. The vibrant colors and great detail make for very exciting pictures to match the text. They can easily catch ones eye. Also, the song at the end provides for a great closing to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this lamp!!!!!","review":"The part of this lamp that holds the light bulb, broke off fromthe main frame of this lamp.A piece of junk!!!!!!

While LW4 was stupid, This picture is boring and stupid. And at least the fourth entry had Jet Li playing a villan. This picture has an empty-headed brainless and boring dirty-cop played by the terribly mediocre Stuart Wilson. There is not an ounce of imagination in this whole movie. It's like an episode of \\"Hunter\\" with a bigger budget. Mel is not even a lethal weapon anymore. A better title for Martin Riggs would be \\"Mildly Eccentric Weapon\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"MEL GIBSON AND DANNY GLOVER SHOW NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN","review":"THE PLOT FOR THIS ONE; RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HUNT DOWN A FORMER COP WHO'S NOW A WEAPONS DEALER. ANOTHER GREAT ENTRY IN THIS ALREADY PERFECT SERIES. THIS IS A VERY GOOD ACTION FILM WITH A VERY GOOD PLOT AND VERY GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR AS ALWAYS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BAD ''LETHAL WEAPON'' MOVIE TO DATE. AND HOPEFULLY THERE NEVER WILL BE. ADDED THIS TIME TO THE CAST; RENE RUSSO, WHO PLAYS RIGGS' LOVE INTEREST. AND JOE PESCI RETURNS FUNNIER THAN EVER AS LEO GETZ. 3 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE WAS ADDED TO THIS MOVIE FOR A DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION RELEASED BACK IN 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"This weapon is unloaded!","review":"The worst entry in the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series, (the first will always be the best), \\"Lethal Weapon 3\\" suffers from too much comedy and a very uninteresting story. Richard Donner, who throws a ridiculously stupid left-wing temper tantrum throughout the film by inserting little hidden messages in scenes and dialogue, directs this film with a lack of concern for quality. It's like he was thinking, \\"Oh what the hell! People come to see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Forget about an interesting story. Just make some things blow up real good and put in a couple of car chases!\\" The action is only so-so and the comedy, well...it really isn't comedy. The story involves Mel and Danny trying to stop a criminal from putting guns in the hands of local gang members. There are other plot points as well but nothing of great interest or amusement. We also get an additional member of the team played by Rene Russo who seems to hold her own fairly well. Just rent the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russo Makes This One Two Stars","review":"They add Rene Russo to this movie to help us remember that Mullet Gibson is hetero sexual or at least to make us forget that the homoerotic love fest between he and Glover is strictly buddy buddy (yeah right). Mullet still hams it up with his tongue in cheek, wink wink, obnoxious Three Stooges gimmick and then they add Joe Pesci as a motormouth obnoxious cartoon character who actually gets on Mullets nerves though he can't see that his own stOOpid antics might make everybody else hate him as much as Pesci. This takes the Lethal Weapon franchise even further into funny book land and the movie suffers for it. It is more like Pesci, Gibson and Glover having a cutesy cutesy good time and letting the fans in on it than it is a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"the boys are back and a girl","review":"Lethal Weapon 3 comes fast and furious but mostly importantly it delights everyone with wisecracks,action, and camaderie.

The score oftentimes overwhelms the dialog and in some instances sounds out of focus and is distracting. In addition, the dialog sounds muddy and is difficult to listen to at times. This probably will only be evident on a Dolby Digital home theater system with the volume turned up....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time, space and life.","review":"How far the mighty fell. The first film in this series was an amazing take on the tired cop genre, finally giving the world a protagonist cop who was not some boring stoic or wise-cracking good guy. Riggs was dark, disturbed and suicidal. By the third installment the whole tone of the films changed to this mindless dreck. If only one could excise the last two Lethal Weapon movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This weapon is NOT lethal in any way shape or form","review":"Being a big fan of the first two Lethal movies, I was really dissapointed with this one. It took the whole mood of the first two and made it into a comedy. The first two were like action-drama. Though I love Joe Pesci, he did not help this film out, nor the story, and the bad guy sucked. Worst of all, the had the coolest scene in the movie shown at the very beginning, which tells you that from then on out, the rest of the film will not be as good. I should give it 1 and a half, but the acting between Gibson and Glover fixes that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Jazz","review":"This is unlike any Gino V. album past or present. Here, Gino uses his voice as a jazz instrument along with a fine collection of jazz artists to accompany him. I read the \\"Slow Love\\" review below and must say I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum. I did not like \\"Slow Love\\" and thought it was on that disc that the confidence in Gino's vocals was waning, not on \\"Yonder\\". This is not a synth pop album like every other album Gino and Joe have put out. This is a jazz album with real jazz instruments making real jazz music, which explains some of the musical juxtapositions the other reviewer complained about. Its not perfect, but its a solid 4 and probably my favorite and it contains what I believe will become a Memorial Day, July 4th, & Veterans Day classic, \\"None So Beautiful As The Brave\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well........had to end.","review":"Oh well, I guess artists have to grow. Unfortunately, Gino grew into something that I did not like. This album kinda sucks. It must be a Canadian thing because Rush moved from one (terrific) style to a good style too.I am not saying this album totally blows, it is just that I wanted more from one of my favorite artists. Looks like the gino-boat has left the dock without me. Still, there are lots of earlier fantastic albums from GV to fall back on and they are timeless and tireless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parody for the unimaginative","review":"Obviously being a breast thumping member of MENSA does not automatically mean one posesses side splitting humor. This novel is nothing if it isn't less funny and less creative than the original novels.Relying only on the most obvious gags, this novel makes \\"Three's Company\\" style humor out of an already humorous series. The only things missing here are canned laugh tracks and a sailor who yells, \\"DY NO MITE!\\"I recommend reading the originals again for some real good laughs, and investing the money in something a bit more intelligent and a lot less self promoting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have the Purser Issue this woman a sense of humor","review":"I love the Aubrey novels. I love a good parody. I love an atrocious pun. I love clever and obscure wit. I hate...well no...I dislike this book. It is dull, clunky, disjointed, repetitive and unimaginitive. I sense that Mrs. Wenger was unsure if she was writing a parody, or trying to write a story for inclusion in the series. The author alas demonstrates how so many bright people are also seen to be dreadful bores. I am halfway through the book and I fear I will do what I almost never do...put a book away unfinished. No greater disrespect can I show for any book. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, forced, weak parody. Disappointing.","review":"Its a shame, but i'm only up to chapter four and I'm having trouble keeping awake. The author is perhaps a bit too proper to write a good parody. This O'brian series is a delight but it is also plump and ripe for a rollicking, wicked, down-and-dirty lampooning. Mrs Wegner just isn't up to it (as if you couldn't tell she's just too nice of a lady from her picture). So far the jokes are tedious, thin, and lacking in depth. I really really wanted this to be good, but its not, which is a shame after all the work I had to go to to locate a copy.Don't waste your time, this would do better as fan fiction on a web page. Me...I'm going to reread Bored of the Rings to remind myseld of what a parody is supposed to be. (To be fair parody is tough...the harvard lampoon failed pretty badly on their 2nd try, Doon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An enervating parody","review":"A parody neither particularly inspired nor artful which, like most works of this type, grows tiresome when the novelty wears off after the first few pages.

First read this back in the 70's when it came out and I was a photographers assistant in a popular studio. Flash forward 40 years and I reread the book recently to find that my annoyance with Sontag and her ideas has not changed. Her affair with photographer Leibovitz notwithstanding, Sontag is a dilettante regarding photography and tries to pack as many 50 cent words into a sentence as possible. This doesn't pass for brilliance on the subject, just time wasted when I could be out damaging someones soul by photographing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must buy book on photography","review":"if you have a serious interest on photography, this book is a must buy. It keep pushing you on considering the meaning of taking a pic, the relationship between the real world and photography, and many other perspectives related to photography. It provide large amount of examples to support its views. I truly think this book is a bible for every photographer. Even if we enter the digital era of photography, the content of this book isn't out of date and have precious value.Regard to the fact that there is no picture in the whole book, I think that is a right choice. Any presented pictures will limit the universality of discussion, rather than realize it.Overall, I give five star for this remarkable, historic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"As a high school student in an AP English class I was assigned to read a critics book. I happened to pick this book off of the list. As I began reading it, it did not interest me at all. I found the book incredibly redundant and pointless. She also constantly used huge words, which made it even harder to read. I thought the book could have been ten pages long and covered everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-enclosed, all-too-verbal critique divorced from subject...","review":"Sonntag's gift for language is explanation enough for why she probably took few pictures and certainly not enough to justify cramming image-making into the worn categories of reproduction, oppression, and escapism.

Otherwise, consider this text another example of theory uncomfortably distanced from the object of its gaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-intellectual rubbish","review":"Names sell books. Susan Sontag's name sells books. But the content of this book isn't worth much. Pretentious, pseudo-intellectual concepts (on the level of a clever college freshman's thinking), awkward writing (trying too hard to find academic-sounding words), in general, just plain silly. Sadly, our universities are full of people who read stuff like this, write stuff like this, and assign stuff like this. As a semi-professional photographer and former college teacher (literature), I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill me now.","review":"I'd rather sit on the commuter rail for 8 hours with a crying baby next to me than read this book ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The symbiotic relationship between photography and society.","review":"It is rare to find a book on photography that is neither basic pedantry, nor a picture book.

Her book is a series of essays that were first published in New York Magazine and later compiled for this book. As such, each essay is distinct and does segue easily to the next. Be prepared with these tools when digesting On Photography: a French dictionary, an English dictionary and a philosophy reference book i.e. Bloom's Closing of the American Mind. From the first essay, In Plato's Cave and onto through to Through Images Darkly (an analysis of Diane Arbus' work), once must be familiar with Plato's Republic and know what Arbus' photos look like.

As human communities grew too large for each member to personally groom each other member, we developed language as a means of \\"grooming\\" verbally, if not physically, a greater number of companions.

But don't let its title fool you. His research covers a far wider range than you might expect. He offers a thesis as to how the various parts of the large brain evoloved to meet numerous environmental and social conditions. But the most intriguing part of the book comes in his discussion of optimal group size, an issue that will prove to be of crucial importance in the decades to come. Evolutionary biology and psychology will prove to be the uniting gospels of the future, and their teachings will have their most vital applications in the areas of social ethics, group size, and scale of lifestyle.

It is a brilliant theory of the origins of language, supported by statistical analysis of physiological data (relative cortex size of primates, including humans), sociological data (the size of human groups across societies ranging from hunter gatherers to modern armies) and current social psychology experiments by his grad students (spot checks of random conversations in malls and pubs).

She has woven a large ensemble cast of characters for her story of adventure, friendship, and romance. Apart from the villain who drives the story, most of the characters change and mature as the result of their experiences.There is a very untypical English equalitarian disregard of class and appearances which, while it suits the storyline, required me to suspend my disbelief in order to fully appreciate the many qualities of this ensemble story. My other difficulty was that in addition to there being a large number of characters to keep up with, some characters were referred to by multiple names. For example Legion was also Joshie, the Earl of Wright, Jocelyn, and Josh. This is a small quibble. I really enjoyed the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romantic comedy in print form","review":"I love all of Lansdowne's regency romances.

In my opinion Wesley Dennis is just that. I feel that any fan of true country music would have to agree. I really can't understand why this cd was not a much bigger seller than it was. Perhaps it was complacency of fans such as myself. When this cd was released I chose not to buy it waiting for the price to come down. BIG MISTAKE.

Whoreson was wittier, more intelligent and deeper in the mind of the writer than the other two put together. Pimp, by Iceberg was pretty good too. Please don't buy \\"A Pimp's Rap\\" cause I read about 3 pages and realized that it had to be a fake, a joke, published to see if anyone would buy it. I mean it was just terrible!!

I ordered the book and couldn't wait to get into it.It started out very interesting and got pretty mundane and predictable after some time.

And rather amusingly in light of this album's title, even the selection of tunes isn't really spectacular, with only the old-time gospelly \\"I Want a Roof Over My Head\\" really making me sit up and take notice. None of this is to fault Humes, however. Her perpetually youthful voice, her infectuous joy and her innate feeling for a song are unmatched. Her real masterpiece was probably her next album on Contemporary, Swingin' With Humes, which put her in front of a small group of stellar proportions (pianist Wynton Kelly, along with West Coast stars Teddy Edwards, Joe Gordon, Leroy Vinnegar and Frank Butler) on a far-more memorable set of standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Modern Jazz Albums Ever","review":"If \\"The Space Book\\" was on Blue Note, it would be a bestseller.

It's starts out quite similar to the anime, but branches off from there.The stories are okay; they may seem too silly and outrageous. The complaint I have is the art. The art looks like it had been done either lazily or in a hurry. Most of the time the artist didn't care to use a straight edge to draw buildings, giving it a sloppy look.Also, the anime could incorporate music during the amazing fight scenes. The manga can just have numerous samurai getting their heads lopped off or getting cut in half.If you're a Champloo fan, you might want to pick it up, but if you don't you're not missing much. I'd stick with the anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math 65 An Incremental Development","review":"My 12 year old daughter is just completing Math 65. WOW!Although not produced with Special Learning students in mind, the incremental learning is ideal for slower learning or learning disabled students. My daughter has always struggled mightily with Math concepts. She has made tremendous strides using this program. New concepts are introduced slowly and previously learned concepts are reinforced at each lesson. Each lesson includes a practice, some mental math and problems. At the start it took an hour at school and up to an hour at home to complete the lesson. She now gets each lesson done in under an hour! (It is set up for one lesson a day). I highly recommend this book, and I'm looking forward to using the next books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Purchase of Saxon Teacher's Edition for Math 65","review":"I received the book that I ordered.

There is a fantastic glossary with pictures and examples and an index to help you find your way. There are literally over a hundred lessons! This is a great way to study for any standardized test or help your little mathematician find their way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice album, poor sound quality","review":"Pulp's This is Hardcore is a great record. My review is not about the album, but about this vinyl pressing of Plain Records. The sound quality is awful; it does not have the sound quality you expect from any vinyl copy. It sounds compressed and you don't even notice that you are listening to it on a vinyl format.

It fits my macbook pro power brick, the extension cable, kindle cord, and an extra usb cord with ease. My one small wish is that there were a greater variety of pockets (pouch has two \\"net\\" pockets one on each side of the case) for smaller items, and a bit more structure in the pouch overall. Currently with all my cords inside it looks as if I'm carrying around a small, incredibly awkward package. Neither of these issues are deal breakers, just things that would be helpful in future incarnations of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but annoying issue","review":"On paper this was the perfect thing for my purposes. A small cushioned case with 2 sections to put a small hard drive, cables, iphone and laptop chargers. Unfortunately it isn't really the best designed thing. The two mesh 'pouches' inside are very loose and as such anything you store in them tends to slip out into the middle crease of the folded case when you unzip and open it. Ideally there should be some sort of elastication of these mesh areas (especially the opening) to hold in whatever they contain. This probably wasn't done due to the case being very soft overall meaning any elastic would pull it into an odd shape when not full.Nice idea, poor design. It isn't a very complicated item so how difficult can it be to get this right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait & switch","review":"I ordered a branded product, Griptex, made in the USA.

Fortunately, Wiley X fills that void quite nicely.The 120s have quality (ANSI-rated) glass, hinged temple pieces (another must for me), and great styling. Wiley X also makes a number of similarly-priced models with different shapes/lens colors. My one complaint is that they aren't polarized.I bought my first pair at an optometrist's and over-paid compared to on-line prices. In spite of that, I still think they're a great buy, and as soon as I finish this review, I will be buying (another) replacement pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an Ultimate Classic","review":"If you have not purchased this box set do it now.

It is filled with inaccuracies and the author's bias is shameless. He includes the popular hot buttons of today, like little sections about Women and the Oppressed, while ignoring other groups completely. He accurately refers to the fact that historians agree that the early parts of the Old Testament are not factually based. To my astonishment, he begins his description of Christianity by talking about the story of Jesus using only the Bible as his source, as if it were all agreed upon as fact. He also refers to Martin Luther as destroying the unity of Christendom. What is it with this guy? Does he work for Mel Gibson? Little wonder that he has written one of those books chosen by History Departments and costs ten times what it's worth, changing editions just often enough so that you can't buy an old one and this site offers a big $3.50 for your trade in.

It has the earbud headphones built in so you don't have to worry about another cable dangling.I use this when biking and once it's on, I don't even notice that something is around my neck. For this, it has been perfect.My one complaint is that the unit uses a proprietary connector for the USB. I was expecting a simple USB-B connector (of which I have a number of cables). However, this one is different.

I knew it would be six more dollars shipping so I threw it in the trash...which is where every one of these players by Audiovox belongs as far as I am concerned.

I promptly devoured all of his books and went on to Desmond Bagley and others - the early giants of the devious action/adventure/espionage/double-cross genre. All that aside, the film was excellent for its day, and has stood up well over the decades. I think I spotted a couple of minor anachronisms, all well within dramatic license. Eastwood doesn't talk much - he just kills Germans and blows things up. Richard Burton has all the dialog, but such a voice, such diction, he is always a joy to hear.

I watched it again today, on Turner Classic Movies, and I got it all, I think I can say. Now, I usually use the four star scale, and on that I would give this film a three and a half, despite obvious minor flaws (Germans only speak German to each other, not to Americans/Brits). A couple of parts I think could've been handled better, and a couple didn't make sense, however overall this film will provide you with intelligent entertainment for a couple of hours or so.

In addition, the shooting locations and winter scenery adds great realism to the overall story.This is a very exciting action movie, Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Eagles Dare","review":"A great and often forgotten about WW II movie from the 60's that stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. The plot involves a team of Allied special ops forces attempting to infiltrate a German fortress deep in the Alps to rescue a captured American general. Where Eagles Dare is full of plot twists, tense moments and some of the best action scenes of any war movie, including an epic hand-to-hand battle on a gondola hundreds of feet above a frozen Alpine river. The movie provided much of the inspiration for the acclaimed PC game Return to Castle Wolfenstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great War Movie","review":"This movie, filled with drama, action, and a complex plot that will make your head spin, has it all. Richard Burton is dashing as the cold plotting secret agent who is leading his team on a mission to save D-Day from disaster. Clint Eastwood, here little more than a teenager, is wonderful as the somewhat befuddled American army ranger who cannot figure out why he is even on the mission.Any attempt to go into detail about the story would ruin some of the fun. Suffice to say that you will be riveted both by the action and the performances. One note though, Burton's monologue is amazing.If you like WWII movies and have not seen this one, you don't know what you are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should go \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" !!!!!!!!","review":"When a discussion of Clint Eastwood's most popular films begins the first films usually mentioned(and rightfully so) are his spaghetti western \\"dollars\\" trilogy and his \\"Dirty Harry\\" series.Often overlooked is the taut World War II action adventurer \\"Where Eagles Dare\\".\\"Where Eagles Dare\\" (1968) has a lot going for it; a fantastic screenplay by Alistair MacLean, great performances by Eastwood and Richard Burton,& a superb score by Ron Goodwin.

You don't know exactly who is good and who is bad until the very end.There are plenty of shooting scenes (although they made the German soldiers have very poor aim, the only thing they could hit in this movie was Richard Burton's hand!) and explosions.

Burton is pretty good in his role, but Clint surprisingly doesn't register much. He just doesn't seem to play that well off of Burton. They are from two different words.On the positive side, Clint must kill more Germans in the last 45 minutes of this movie than Patton's entire Third Army did during the entire war. That and a memorable struggle aboard an aerial cable car are two reasons to watch this mindless festival of violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of space on my DVD rack","review":"This movie is why all of the WWII vets cheered Saving Private Ryan for it's realism. Eagles Dare has not one shread of realism. Clint and Burton kill everything that moves without a scratch or reload. The Germans are potrayed like complete idiots falling over like bowling pins. Basically the plot goes like this:Burton tells Clint \\"See that iron fortress on the cliff with the 4000 Germans. Where going to sneak in, rescue a hostage and kill at least 500 guards. Here is an extra magazine in case you need to reload. Oh yeah, see these 4 British agents who are going in with us.

Anyone who knows anything about helicopters will recognize it as an American helicopter, not German, and totally wrong for the period. But that's the only mosquito on the camping trip.

As the plot twists and turns, it reveals the excellent writing and storytelling that Alistair MacLean lends to every book he's written. Richard Burton's character has more facets than a well-cut diamond and Clint Eastwood's role show how an actor can do more with less. The scenery, filmed onsite in Alpine castle, is amazing and the supporting cast was well selected for this movie. While this title never seems to appear on either Burton's or Eastwood's list of career highlights, you will find this WWII film to be an unsung gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Probably the best WWII movie.

I personally am grown up on the countryside in South-Italy and, even if I live a century later than the Malavoglia, I still can find in the place where I live some of the colours and sounds that I love in this book. Someone may find the style disturbing, because of the lack of participation by the writer, but it is something Verga purposedly tried to achieve ( it is the Realism ), and it should not prevent you from enjoying the story told in this book ( even if it is a sad story, like are all the stories, that try to be truthfull). If you really want to get nearer to the heart of such a beautiful country like Italy ( and especially South-Italy)is you really should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My family history in a novel","review":"This novel was written in 1889 and set in 1863 in a Sicilian fishing village within walking distance of Verga's native Catania. My paternal great-grandparents spent their lives in a similar village on the northern coast of Sicily. Reading this novel brought back my Grandmother's voice telling stories of the fishermen with variations on the proverbs, superstitions, Catholicism and village gossip of Verga. In Verga's novel, ownership of the house is lost through payment of a debt to preserve the Malavoglia's family honor. In my family, the two fishing boats were sold to protect the family honor from a false accusation. In the Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel, Verga is written about extensively in a chapter about realism. This book is a delightful validation of social history in post-unification Sicily. These peasants were hard-workers whose family and religion gave meaning to their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian historical novel","review":"If you wondered what life was like in Southern Italybefore our relatives all decided to leave, read this book.In a non-maudlin manner, the author describes life in this little town, social mores and attitudes from a long ago time.Well translated, easy to read.

The mother of pearl background is beautiful and I love the crystals, it gives it a little extra something. It is hard to find a watch that meets my expectations. I liked that I could adjust the band for a custom fix. My husband loosened it and it took a couple of tries to get it right but it fits well. The band is so flexible that at times I forget I am wearing it. it also has a double clasp system that makes sure it won't fall off. This watch definitely delivers, I looks expensive and well made. The band is slightly shiny so it shimmers and it connects to watch with 4 screws so I could probably change band myself.

I find that such large volumes are awkward, hard to hold and really thick. My personal collection of Shakespeare's works consists of single-work paperback volumes, not lovely to look at, but functional.

This made his character especially ironic in his disdain for women. The theatrical poster played this up with a bearded, Bondlike Moore nonchalant as women are crawling all over him. Ffolkes, like several other non-Bond rolls that Roger Moore made are really his best work (particularly Sea Wolves where he has a very Ian Fleming character). As Ffolkes, Mr. Moore absolutely shines and the film itself is a wonderfully taut thriller with Anthony Perkins as a superb psychotic villain. Too bad he couldn't have played Blofeld! This is also a great example of how it doesn't take a huge budget to make an exciting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moore Shines in Mediocre Action Thriller","review":"Released as \\"ffolkes\\" outside the United Kingdom, \\"North Sea Hijack\\" (1979) provides Roger Moore with a surprisingly good character role. However, one wishes this action thriller was more effective. Director Andrew V. McLaglen cannot salvage a formulaic script and lackluster production values. The solid cast (including James Mason and Anthony Perkins) makes for an OK time-filler. McLaglen and Moore fared better with \\"The Wild Geese\\" (1978)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oil rig saboteur","review":"In ffolkes, Roger Moore plays a James Bond-type of role. He is the head of a specialized, anti-terror type group that is contracted by the British government to rescue a massive oil rig platform that is being held for a hefty, king's ransom. The head of the crew holding the platform for ransom, played by Anthony Perkins, is probably miscast. I still just see him as Tony Perkins from PSYCHO.A mild-adventure film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, who did a superb job with Moore, Richard Burton and Richard Harris in THE WILD GEESE(A DEFINITE must-see and must-have for any video collection), ffolkes is a race against the clock for his crack underwater demolitions crew to find the explosives and then conduct their assault on the oil derrick before it gets blown to pieces.

It is a great film, but the copy being distributed must be a pirate copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very underappreciated political-thriller","review":"This 1980 Roger Moore film shows that he could act outside of his James Bond persona. His role as the as Ffolkes --- leader of a band of private anti-terrorist firm --- is as anti-Bond as anything he has ever done. Anthony Perkin's as the main villain is adequate and sometimes his Norman Bates persona seeps through the facade, but not enough to distract.This film is all Roger Moore. His woman-bashing, cat-loving, cold-blooded, bearded anti-terrorist expert is one of the better characters I have seen on film. All the traits shown initially in Moore's character should make him unlikable, but in the end his character becomes the most intriguing and likable of the bunch. The scenes concerning the negotiations with the terrorists and the plan to retake the off-shore refineries is handle ably and there's not too much unnecessary plot threads to clutter the story. A very good film and very underappreciated as the years go by"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper video equals cheaper quality","review":"Always a favorite, albiet obscure, film for action lovers, Ffolkes delivers great action with the wit and charm of Roger Moore. Anthony Perkins is spectacular as a psychopath (no suprise here). Rated simply on the merits of content, Ffolkes is a five star film all the way! However, if you're wondering about the massive price differential between the two offered versions of the film, here is some insight. I purchased the less expensive version and recieved what amounted to a terrible quality pirated video. I expect you could get the same quality by setting up the camcorder in front of your TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining movie needs a DVD release","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite action movies, and given the amount of questionnable product that has been announced for DVD release, it's dissapointing that no DVD release has yet been announced. The movie combines a complex and intelligent plot with great acting from Moore, Mason and Perkins. Moore plays against type, playing a crusty chauvanistic commanndo leader. I would heartily recommend this thriller. Now, if only amazon would give us the opportinity to vote for this movie on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst moderately high budget movies ever","review":"I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews, but this one deserves it. Watching the movie made me wonder if Roger Moore was going to actually say \\"I'm only doing this for the money\\".There are better action movies, better thrillers, and better political commentaries.Catch this some late night on an obscure cable channel, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great film that no one seems to have seen","review":"This is a unique film. I agree with my fellow reviewers. The characters are solid and I think the selection of these actors could not be improved upon. There is no wasted dialog, no special effects, no rap music in the sound track. Why it failed to be recognized in the theaters is a mystery, though I suspect it's the \\"anti-James Bond\\" approach used in ffolkes. No gadgets, no babes, not a smooth talker in this one, Roger Moore is a much more believable character than 007 ever was. I have never met anyone else who has seen this film. Buy a copy, share it with a friend. Maybe you should buy 2 copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"edited version","review":"I remember this movie from the early '80's and loved it them.

Garinin does not respond to my emails for support.I disassembled the device to determine what's wrong and possibly repair it myself. It turns out the gears are cheap plastic and deteriorate rapidly. Yes, this is the \\"new improved\\" model I bought.For as long as I have it, I found that the winder DOES NOT increase the charge of a SEIKO KINETIC, probably because it runs too slow (about 4 RPM). It does fine at keeping a mechanical automatic ticking, but it doesn't provide enough energy to a electric Kinetic even at the highest setting.I highly recommend looking at another manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive solution","review":"I also bought the earlier version and this 2nd gen. winder is much improved. Looks better, occupies smaller foot print and operates silently compared to the 1st gen machine. Like the 1st gen, all plastic construction - don't look nor feel robust. Don't think it can survive rough handling - be gentle with it and it should last. Supplied power adaptor works only on 115 Vac - bummer. Doesn't work on batteries, no problem - visit Radio Shack to get a 2D or 2C cell battery holder and power pin (similar to supplied power adaptor). Just make sure you get the polarity correct otherwise it wouldn't work. And your precious watches can be kept in a secure place, eg. safe, and always ready to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works - But - Noisy","review":"This device works but it is very noisy.

Around a month after I had bought it however, it completely stopped working and hasn't worked since.This is a poor product, although I may have just been unlucky in the one I received or the particular watch that I have.

The product seems to be as simple as open the package, pour some rosin powder on it and start whistling away.After hours at various locations I did not see one bird, To me this is a waste of money. I just wanted some birds to hang with and apparently that ain't going to happen.The product seems costly with the rosin needed to be applied every so often. On top of that the rosin pill that came with it was smashed and half of the powder was gone.Bad customer service, Damaged item upon arrival, If this was ebay I would have my money back.Save your funds and buy the cheaper one on amazon, or don't buy it at all and learn how to whistle... I would love to know where all these reviews tested this bird call because It did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bird Call","review":"This easy-to-use little bird call is a wonder to small children. My grandchildren each received one, purchased by me. They were in love with them! They can be used anytime, anywhere and will have the birds calling back. Such a cute, usable item for anyone. My son bought my mom one years ago, then got it back when she passed away. He still carries it. Such a nice memory built upon a little piece of wood and metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel lives!!!!","review":"Wow, I thought from the title of this that Daniel had passed away. Glad to discover that that is not the case. I really enjoyed most of the covers but I still prefer the originals myself. They have that Nebraska (Bruce Springstein)intimacy to them which I love. For anyone who likes Daniel Johnston I recommend you go looking for a version of Speeding Motorcyle with Yo La Tengo. (It's on Genius + Love = Yo La Tengo) It is probably my favorite thing he has ever done. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD!","review":"Open it up, take the 1st CD of covers, open the window, and fling it ouside like a frisbee (watch out for neighbors and pets, though.)I agree with others; the originals are great, the covers are lame. Daniel Johnston sings with such honesty and raw, unpolished emotion that hearing a bunch of overproduced rock stars trying to cover them is ridiculous. It's like having a 2-CD set of early, acoustic Dylan and then a bunch of Phil-Specterish producers adding unnecessary and redundant sounds to a CD of covers.Go with the original. (And when I say original, I mean ORIGINAL!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Honest Simplt Outstanding","review":"Tracks 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 will blow you mind. The rest of the album will leave you speechless. Honest songwriting that hits home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Nope...sorry. I'm a huge Beat Happening fan...loved Calvin Johnson for years...so I feel I know a thing or two about enjoying music that, technically, is not that good. Just...nope...Y'know how Bernie Taupin wrote the lyrics for Elton John songs? Perhaps Johnston could go that route. Other people singing his words...that seems ok. Not sure why he receives the accolades he does. A converse shoe deal was in the works for some time...a biopic...a rock opera of his songs. I'm sorry, it all seems done out of pity. If you're interested in indie/lo-fi music please check out anything from Calvin Johnson (Beat Happening, The Halo Benders, The Hive Dwellers, or his solo work). People only listen to Daniel Johnston because they heard all the cool/trendy kids do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Book","review":"I downloaded this book for my Kindle since I have an original Hard Bound edition and I didn't want to stress the binding reading it. The book is 259 pages long and the Amazon Kindle version stops at page 115. I think it either should be pulled from the download or make it complete. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to DON'T it.","review":"This slightly interesting book is advice from an older person to youngsters. The book is VERY incomplete, and only the first chapters are included. It is repetitive, and the language is arcane. These things are to be expected, but with the lack of content I cannot recommend you try it even for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly addicting","review":"Tindersticks can't be easily shoehorned into a current \\"genre\\". And that may account for their relative obscurity. But this is one of the best 70 minutes of music you can find today. The baritone vocals and hauting melodies make for a gorgeous soundscape. Very unique and rewarding musical experience. I'd kill to see them in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb music for a rainy day","review":"This album is pure atmosphere. Dark and dreary but at the same time hauntingly familiar. Not familiar in the sense that it sounds like anything else. Not even close. More like music that would be played in the background of your dreaming. Light some candles and dream away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but no room","review":"My daughter is on the short side and she sits in this just fine. At 20 months she loves to watch the balls come down. However, as I see her play in it and now read the reviews I'm not the only one that agrees the play area is too small and her being a small girl, could probably play with this for a while but when she gets bigger it wont be much fun. She tries to jump in them but hits the sides and the middle is in the way. I was going to buy the one that has an open pit with a doggy head they can crawl through and mistakenly bought this thinking it was cheaper. Tag was wrongly priced. If I hadnt spent the time blowing it up and adding extra balls I would have returned it.I recommend anyone that is looking to get one that is open more so they can roll, play and jump in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"My 18 month old son loves this toy. He gets excited just sitting in it. I recommend buying the extra 100 balls to add to the toy. We have had many laughs watching him get in it and he is so happy while he is playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter enjoyed it","review":"I bought this gor my daughter for Christmas. We blew it up the night before, so when she came down the steps it was ready. She had just turned one. As soon as she saw it she toddled over to it and jumped in. We couldn't get her to open her other presents because she didn't want to get out. I definately agree that it is small and too tall for toddlers to put the balls in, but my daughter still enjoyed it. I paid about $15 or $20 for it (on sale) at toys r us, so we weren't too disappointed. As we expected our dog popped it after three months. It was fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"The price was fair. Works fine and arrived on time. I'm happy with it.This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Works great on my moped (although its a little on the big side).

Overall a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot twist","review":"It was a very exciting book because it was a mystery and there were more than one murderers.

I think that a large would fit her just fine, so I'd say you should probably order a size up to get a good fit. It is a good quality shirt and good thick print screening and still looks good having been washed several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"First the pros:It's heavy enough with the suction feet to prevent the slicer moving around the counter.Simple to operate.Now the cons:The blade is so close to the metal surround it actually touches it and dulls the blade. I was not able to adjust this even by loosening the center screw and trying to move the blade.To clean the blade means getting a screwdriver of the right size to undo the blade assembly - I would have thought that a metal 'key' would have made this easier.The inner washers and belt assembly fall out very easily, so be careful not to lose them.The cutting is pretty slow even for home use.The inner gears are plastic - not sure how long this thing would last.The size is really only meant for small cheeses, fruits, and meat, if you wanted to slice a bigger piece of meat, you are out of luck as the sliding holder does not move to the left far enough to do this.Overall, poorly designed and poorly made, am returning for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK So far","review":"So far this Slicer is pretty good. A lot of the slicers in this price range have trouble with plastic gears internally going bad and do not hold up very long. (For Example my Edgecraft 610 got 12 uses out of it over 15 months. I called the company 800 number and got a leave a message.)I have not dismantled this one to see what the gears are made of but it's made in China so I assume plastic.It does a fine enough cut for thin sliced lunch meat and the whole tray slides as one. Cleans easy enough.The only problem I have with it is the top part that sets the cut width will push out if you press too hard. I press too hard because I am a guy and it's in my nature but I just slice with one hand supporting it and the other slicing.Let's hope this holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning Up","review":"You can not disassemble for proper cleaning.The slide does not come apart from the base.You can only remove the blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-wrenching","review":"Urrea employs great writing skills and techniques to tell the story of a group of Mexican immigrants who get lost in a trek from Mexico to the United States in search of a better life. The details of their journey are gruesome and described with terrifying clarity. This book is not for the faint of heart. But it reads like a good novel.Each character is well described; Urrea masterfully paints a human face on the victims we so easily ignore. The victims are not limited to the pollos. Even border patrol agents suffer trying to implement our nation's ill-conceived policies on the front lines of this war. Right and wrong get discarded and all participants are left in an insane struggle for survival.This book should be a wake-up call to those who write immigration policies in this country. And to those who foolishly think we can isolate ourselves from the rest of the world and its problems.We are all in this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The conflict of the story is there are 26 Mexicans from different parts of Mexico that cross the boarder illegally. They cross the boarder into a desert they call hell. The desert is the Sonoran desert and is part of southern Arizona. In this desert there is no water also there are deadly animals and spirits. Some are left behind waiting for the return of others.I liked the book because its real and I could never picture myself going threw the desert with no food or water. I also liked the book because it described the surrounding and face to face things in that Arizona desert. I didn't like it because it made me think about people starving in the desert. I would recommend this book to people that like reading long stories. I also recommend this to people that like the setting of a harsh place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I had to read this at University and it was terrifically entertaining. It makes you think twice about immigration. The beginning of the book is a little slow, but once you hit about page 50, it takes off and it is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"a powerful peek into a very different world told by an objective, yet not unsympathetic writer. The narrative is sympathetic to the conditions of the lives; at home, on the trip, once in the US. There are a vast range of ideas about what to do about illegal immigration, but regardless, no one can deny the adject poverty that compels it. I undertood so much more about this subject, regardless of how I may lean politically."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly written polemic","review":"i had high hopes for this book. unfortunately, what started out so beautifully and lyrically written along the lines of a garcia-marquez quickly deteriorated into a mess. terrible writing style, disjointed, fractured, pointless drivel at times. this story has already been told many times in print and movie (the 3 burials of melquiades estrada)...it was obvious early on that the author is trying to push his agenda on the reader but forgot that to get someones attention you have to drive the point home with lucid, poignant, vivid narrative. the factoids in the end were downright nauseating. that map was pitiful for following the journey and setting. the characters without pictures of some type or tangible connection to their familes fell flat. very disappointing and wonder where the 5 stars come from...???!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real insight to people making their way here from Mexico","review":"We read this book for our book club a few years ago and everyone was deeply moved by it. My son now has to read it for his high school Language Arts class so I am reading it again. The insight that this author has to the challenges, grief, and sadness to make it from Mexico to this country is daunting, to say the least. The book moves along like a novel until you remember, oh wow, this is NONfiction! I highly suggest this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, poorly written","review":"This story of the Yuma 14 had the potential to be one helluva of a story, as it does read as though it is fictitious. The fact that it's true is the driving force behind the story, only to be marred by the author's sloppy and at time irreverent writing style. He uses repetition of words and phrases in extremis, and he for some reason feels compelled to stick one-liners at the close of all his sections. The material is interesting enough without the reader having to be bludgeoned by tongue-in-cheek punchline passages. It really got annoying and detracted from the larger story of struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful account of the most disastrous failed border crossing","review":"Urrea writes a compelling and insightful, account of the disastrous trek across the border ending in the death of 14 Mexican hopefuls. The narrative begins with a brief look into the Border Patrol Agent(s)/Agency and various fragile border dynamics. The meat of the book comes in the second half and it will keep your interest as the detailed fateful journey is unfolded. This is done in part by the authors ability to create and capture the imagery of the Devils Highway landscape and history. I would recommend this book for anyone wanting a look into the shadowy Border Crossing world or just a story capturing a journey of a harsh desert landscape gone wrong in every way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, hard to get in to, poorly written.","review":"I was not fond of the way the first 20-30 pages of the book were written. Not great, dry and hard to get in to. Some of the short stories were good but I felt like I had to just plow through the book to get anywhere with it. Not my kind of read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A National Treasure","review":"I was concerned to hear that this book has been removed from the Texas School System. The negative reviews or comments about The Devil's Highway: A True Story are more gratuitous than comments which move our country's story forward. My Great Grandparents on both sides came here from Germany. I want to thank the Mexican people for allowing me to visit and live in the territory that was part of their country. I am not threatened by recognizing the work and contributions of other cultures. I have written to the Maryland State Board of Education as well as my local school board to consider using this book as part of a larger discussion which includes diverse views but emphasizes critical thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Anybody looking for the untold story of immigrants crossing the border from Mexico should read this book. This book tells all sides of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"Cox & Sheldon take a lot for granted - Their book is great if you're studying for the MCSE or have any kind of networking background but if you're new to group policy, domains and OUs and the like, then it's likely going to be a struggle to read. I gave the book 5 stars because eventually, through hands on, self-taught trial & error on my own system, I was able to master some of the basic security concepts. If you're a lazy n00b and you don't have any kind of initiative or a mentor, then don't waste your time or money with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old hat actioner","review":"Old-fashioned action thriller with one redeeming feature - a character sharing the same name as me! Pure co-incidence, of course. The Nick Warren in this book is a top British drug expert who finds himself on the trail of Iranian smugglers after an entertainment impressario's daughter is found dead in her own apartment after a heroin overdose, and vows revenge for her death. An oft-told tale unfortunately still set in the past with an old fashioned narrative and dialogue(does anyone really say OLD CHAP these days? Maybe in a Colin Forbes book . . .) which does not quite work now in print, but would certainly make a decent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I have known Travail for many years.

This phone doesn't have a \\"microphone opening\\" like other phones, so the only way to expose the mic is not to have a case. I have received complaints from customers and coworkers that I sound horrible. The thickness of the case makes it very difficult to use the thumbwheel. Overall, this case will degrade the functionality of the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED - It's a challenge accessing the Trackwheel","review":"The Krusell Classic Multidatp case for Blackberry 7130e looks good. However, it is seriously lacking in what is the most important feature - access to the trackwheel. The cutout which allows access to the trackwheel is entirely too small - and I am a female with very small fingers. I plan to return this case and instead invest in screen guards and carrying case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvira is back!!!!!","review":"I could give a care for the movie. I remember it as a lame piece of dribble that was made watchable only because Elvira hosted it. All of the movies that were featured on her show were awful and I'm glad. All the better to make fun of.Elvira's Movie Macabre is the draw here. This show was not to be missed weekends here in the Los Angeles area in the eighties.I for one will happily purchase every volume that is released as long as it comes with Elvira's great one liners, hysterical bits and dead on comic timing. Great to see Elvira back in the limelight were she belongs!

I love and I do mean LOVE all the songs except for 2 and those are the ones with the raps on them. This album is a testiment to their writing, producing, and vocal ability. My favorite songs on the album are \\"What do we do with the love\\", \\"Beauty\\", \\"One Good Reason\\", and \\"What Are We Gonna Do.\\" As an aspiring writer and songwriter, I just have to say keep up the good work guys and nothing but greatness will come from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisquo!You are fine!","review":"My friends and I are always fighting over and pretending that we are each married to you.E.g.\\"Amaka,I've got to go.Sisquo's taking me out to dinner in two hours and I'm not ready\\"WE LOVE YOU!!!!I love the way you enjoy your music.I wish my boyfriend could dance like you.He's so stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well they've done it again!!!!","review":"Well the platinum recording artists Dru Hill have usured out yet another mind blowing CD entitled \\"Enter the Dru\\". Each song has it's own personalitity that allows you to get into the song...to \\"enter the dru\\". From their hits \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\", \\"These are the Times\\", and their latest single \\"You are Everything\\" to their not yet released but equally satisfying songs entitled \\"Holding You\\", \\"Beauty\\" and \\"One Good Reason\\" it is evident that dru hill has arrived and have no intentions on backing down now.Dru Hill is said to have produced and written most of the songs on their new album which allowed them to have a creative freedom that they could not quite obtain doing their first album. Whatever the motivation was behind this great album was, it did the job. Needless to say we definitely won't be hearing the last of Dru Hill, Sisqo, Nokio, and Jazz will be amongst those leading the way into the new millenium."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 star cause only 2 or 3 good songs","review":"Man i thought dru hill would make way betta music then what they put out luckly i got the album by a dub cd , 2 maybe 3 good songs tops , they made to much junk and put out weak to many weak songs with no meaning now isint dru hill post to be a r&b group so why they try to take it to a dance pop joint of half there tracks best track on there easily these are the times"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS DA BOMB!!!","review":"I never bought Dru Hill's first album, but their second album is great. I especially like \\"Real Freak\\", \\"I'm Wondering\\", \\"Angel\\", and \\"This Is What We Do\\". However, my favorite song is \\"These Are The Times\\". This song is so beautiful. I think that Dru Hill has done a very good job on their sophomore album and I hope that they have another one on the way. Also, this album has prompted me to buy their first album and any other albums they make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous 2nd album","review":"Dru Hill made a fabulous 2nd album that had more hits than the first. I liked How Deep Is Your Love and the faster numbers, but they are just superb on the ballads. Songs like These Are The Times, We're Not Making Love No More, and The Love We Had Stays on My Mind are nicely done ballads. I saw them in concert last year and they are the real deal--they can be tearing it up on stage with their moves! Sisqo sure is a superb dancer. And Sisqo and Jazz can be sanging it on their leads on this album! One standout ballad on here is Beauty, which I still hear on some quiet storm hours on some R&B stations late at night. The third album is good, but it is no contest to this superbly done 2nd album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite CD's, certainly a good mix of upbeat jams and emotional ballads. My fave songs are \\"You Are Everything\\" (not that wack remix, but the slow version with an opening guitar melody that I just love), \\"Are You A Real Freak?\\" (upbeat, fun, and freaky), \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\" ('nuff said), \\"Holding You\\" (pained, emotional lyrics), and \\"Angel\\" (reminds me of my ex-lady that I'm still in love with). All in all just a great CD that you can pop into the tray and listen to from start to finish, I just hope Sisqo can give his solo act a rest long enough to turn out another Dru Hill album with his boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless...","review":"Dru Hill rocks their music is fantastic with all different soughts of genres. I like it and vocals are excellent... mellow and nice. Great music for any time of the day or any time of the year for sure. These guys know who the sing and their music as you can tell are all about love and human emotions. I guess when putting words into lyrics this must be one of the best cds to have for sure. I found it lovely to listen to... even though I haven't been listening to much R/B lately and I have just been sticking to my Gamelan Music from Bali and traditional Cambodian Music. I guess I tended to switch from one to the other for sure. This music is excellent and I love it for sure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better","review":"Mostly girls like it.

They have done it again. It's really hard for me to pick my favorite song because they all kinda hit home, but if I had to pick one, it would be These Are The Times. I like to break the words of a song down and get the true meaning and the first time I heard that song it brought tears to my eyes. Again, keep making good music and you have a loyal fan forever. And to the reviewer who tried to dog Dru Hill, stop hating and give the brothers a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't that great...","review":"Well, I suppose if you like all the slow songs then go buy this CD.

It turns out, the only good songs happen to be \\"How Deep Is Your Love?\\" \\"Real Freak\\" and \\"Holding You\\". I thought that the song with Method Man would be a tight track. Though it's catchy and is probably the fastest song on the album it just doesn't cut the string. I don't hate the album yet I just don't think it's Dru Hill at their beast. I don't have their first album, but I'm sure it's better than this one.Another thing is the terrible beats. Ginuwine was smart to get Timabaland to help him with his album. The only tracks with tight beats are the ones I talked about earlier plus \\"This Is What We Do\\".Lyrically, they are fine. The best singer of the whole group is Sisqo. I'm glad he tried a solo.If you liked Dru Hill's first album then get this one. If you don't have Dru's first album, forget it.-_-I HOPE THE NEXT ALBUM IS BETTER-_-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline","review":"Borderline second album featuring Sisqo and the boys from Baltimore. Lots of attitude and sass, but the songs never graduate from the predictable. Even the Babyface-penned \\"These Are the Times\\" is a bit of a snooze.

You 'll find yourself humming and whisteling these catchy tunes with their strange angles and turns. Start enjoying everything that they recorded by buying this album.

In a musical landscape as far away from mainstream, one would expect no less than ears that could digest. Mr. Elfman is always flexing his artistic muscles, we can expect more greatness in his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master piece","review":"Serenada Schizophrana is probably the best work Elfman ever made. It is mature, virtuoso, deep and powerful. All his usuals styles are transcends, and the six mouvements are rich in shades and tones. The mouvements are all interesting in their own musical way, and invit us to a long travel inside the genius and strange brain of Danny Elfman. The fifth, \\"I Forget\\", which is probably his most wonderful piece, looks like a tragic fantasy opera with beautiful females choirs. Serenada Schizophrana is a truly amazing orchestral piece, but not easily accessible. Patience and lot of listening are recommanded in order to understand the richness of this work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique blend","review":"This album has broken the traditional Christian musical stereotype with its innovative style and sound. It moves from sultry beats to techno bubblegum, then slides off to electro-pop with hard guitar undertones and digresses into the raw of music with \\"Garbage in the Garden\\". The lead singer always holds her own against the full scenery created by the music, and her voice melts in and out of your brain with soothing crystal clear lyrics you can always understand and never forget. This is an album for the individual not afraid to experience more than just the same plain old thing and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Rock? ...no. R&B ...no? Disco? ...no. CHR? ...yes, if that's where the money is. Ridiculous? ...most definitely.None of these songs fall into a specific genre. It's as if this band wrote with different artists - trying to cover all the categorical bases. The lyrical content lacks integrity.The vocalist is UN-original and a little creepy [if you've ever caught them live]. The live show I saw was almost certainly choreographed. [Note: I think the drummer wore girls' clothes.] This album sounds as if it were based on \\"good intentions\\", nevertheless the end result was a suffocated effort that conforms nicely to the industry of CCM.There are select positives: The album is well produced.

The production is top quality and Mannie Fresh continues to live up to his rep as a hot producer...I'm big on beats and this one not only serves up fresh beats but also defiant, often freestyled lyrical quality. Nowadays you buy a CD with like 20 tracks on it and half of them are skits and only three tracks are good (and then you feel like you would have been better off flushing those sixteen dollars down the nearest toilet). But with Tha Carter, Lil' Wayne's best yet, if you are a true rap fan then you are sure to not be disappointed.And yes, a warning: After buying this album, you WILL experience random moments of walking down the street and the first thought that comes into your head is \\"So hold on to your teenage daughter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil Wayne Str8 Killin, Murdarin These Trackz On Tha Carter","review":"Lil Wayne Is A Killa On Tha Carter, U can't even burn a Mix Wit out putin tha Whole Carter Album On there.

There is no denying the fact that the Lil' Wayne / Mannie Fresh combination is among the best in the industry. Get your shine on Wayne...... 5 Stars*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Block is almost Hot or is it?","review":"Lil Wayne is probably the best rapper down south. He definitely proves that on Tha Carter. I like this album because it doesn't have that many guest appearences and it has a lot of songs where Wayne spit straight fire. I personally think fans of Murda Mook or Papoose would definitely find Wayne's lyrical onslaught second to none. What keep this album from being perfect is certain beats like \\"I miss my dogs\\" which is a good song but the beat is plain as hell. The good thing about Wayne is if his beats is lacking then his raps overshadow. I think Wayne needs to upgrade his sound to like Hi Tek, Kanye, or Just Blaze. I was hoping he'd make that jump with Jay-Z because some Cash Money beats are elementary but other than that, this is a hot album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rapper of live since the best rapper retire.","review":"I have been reading some others reviews and was shock that some people wasn't feeling it.

While his lyrics are more creative, and his rhymes are inventive, his flow is not as good as it used to be. When i say \\"flow\\", i mean that he pauses and changes his voice up way too much, which stops you from bobbing your head. i think he tried to do too much. there is very little rhythm to his flow, except for a few exceptions on tracks 17, 13, and some of the intro."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge rip of from other people","review":"Having read this book, I have come to realise that this is nothing but a direct copy of people such as T.

It CHANGED MY LIFE, written in a way that I 'got' the information I'd heard a 100 other places but never really sunk in on a visceral, tangible level. Want to be your magnificence?

First off the book flows smoothly, Very interesting to read. The ideas are really great, Christopher clearly shows that those who we see as wealthy powerful individuals are not all smart. Some are as smart as anyone walking down the street but they share similaraties in thinking which brought them wealth. Great book for anyone, it talks about so many good ideas that pretty much leave everything but \\"to do it\\", if someone actually gets on the ball after reading this book they may very well be a millionaire in a few years, I guess this book does not provide the determination, but paints the picture nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I loved this book.

It goes so far as to suggest that African American students make certain that the college of their choice include remedial courses to assure that they are allowed to graduate (since ivy league colleges have lowered their standards to attract minorities, but have neglected to include remedial studies). I hoped this book would provide suggestions of the best colleges that would widen the horizons of my academically talented, African American child. It gave a list of schools where an African American might actually graduate! I am appalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a read","review":"Just to add a little more to Bookworm's excellent review, with the passage of time this book is likely to be difficult to obtain but it is worth hunting for.Charriere has been criticized for writing in the first person (perhaps not his fault but rather than that of his agent/translator) but Belbenoit's story is all his own. As a bit of trivia they were both on the same shipment from France (Belbenoit being returned) but I don't know if they knew each other.Another book covering this fascinating era is The Convict by Felix Milani.Dry Guillotine was issued as \\"I escaped from Devil's Island\\" and made into a film of the same name by the Corman Brothers. It was brought out quickly to capitalize on the publicity for Papillion. The movie usually gets a grade Z in reviews but really it is not that bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Live Rick Derringer Document","review":"LIVE AT THE PARADISE THEATER is yet another great CD documenting Rick Derringer's talents as a live performer.

Also her historical section was deviod of reference to many of the true pioneers of the sport. As entertainment it is ok as a giuide to snowboarding and it's cultural history, it falls far short.

Being a life long Trojan fan, this book served justice to not only USC Football but the University itself. From the beginning it had me hooked. I wasn't really willing to read it at first but then my humanities teacher required that we have a Silent Sustained Reading(ssr)book. I forgot to bring a book and it just so happened that I had this book in my backpack. This book includes interviews, quotes and real life stats. My favorite part of the book had to be when USC lost to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl and ever since then Pete Carrol came in and brought change to the program making Trojan football a powerhouse. Unfortunately, it is a little depressing reading the book in 2011 and looking at USC football and the heartbreaking sanctions. The great part about this book is that in the end there are all of the stats and scores of USC's games mentioned in the book. If you are a true USC fan and/or appreciate Trojan football, I recommend that you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond the scope of most restorers.","review":"This book is good for a highly experienced restorer who has a TR4 in very poor condition and needs to do a lot of rust repair. It is not for your average hobby restorer, or anyone doing a restoration on a solid car. It provides absolutely no information on finish work and original TR4 details. I feel the restoration work this book focuses on is beyond the scope everyone except the top 10 percent of those in the hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"When The Days Were Simply Tubular","review":"Known for an outrageous performance art that truly made for a concert experience, lost in the shuffle of that fun is the crafty musicianship of the band.The demos and \\"live\\" studio tracks trace back to the time before the band had to work within the corporate realm of the record industry and could go into overdrive musically with an edgy sound that matches the paradoxical lyrics.These were the days - and sessions - when things were simply tubular."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only own one...","review":"I own the VHS tape version, and must say that it is quite wonderful. I wish one could uniformly find good, solid, traditional productions of all of the standard operas on video, but this has become quite the exception rather than the rule. Later, we can check out the productions from the directors who can't keep their egos in check. I might buy a ticket to see their shenanigans once, but for the long haul, give me this. A relatively young Haitink keeps it moving along, and everyone sings well.If you only know the piece from CDs go for this one.Oh, and the Leonore #3 would have been played after the climax, before the last scene, when we've already heard the trumpet calls. Gustav Mahler may have thought it released the tension, and made the jump to the finale less abrupt. Playing in the opera was his idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Can Death Be So Uninteresting?","review":"Anyone who has read \\"The Battle for Christmas\\" by Stephen Nissenbaum and is looking for a companion book for Halloween...run. This scattered book talks less about the holiday's history than of its contemporary manfestations (both real and imagined). It meanders in all directions indulging more in Skal's peripheral interests like September 11th and gay-pride parades than in uncovered history. Almost as in search for a suitable number of pages, Skal almost endlessly describes the plots of movies we already know and muses so shamelessly about tourist attractions in Salem that it begins to read like an ad for the Visitors Bureau. This is an overwritten introduction for what could have been. Lots of fluff for those of you who don't want too much information muddying up that slick cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I made it through the vapid introduction and most of the way through the first chapter before skipping around and skimming here and there. Skal's writing is rather boring, and by page 40, I still had no grasp on his meandering portrait of Halloween.

I wasn't lucky enough to see them live on the rush of blood tour, and this is probably the next best thing. The concert DVD is the highlights of Parachutes and A Rush, and B-side One I Love, and new one Moses. I fell in love with the songs long ago, and they sound great live (especially A Rush Of Blood To The Head, the guitar at the beginning sounds better than on the album). The best thing is Chris having a go at dancing, in the words of NME, like a \\"rock and roll morris dancer\\". He's gorgeous though, and he's so sweet, you can see he's putting his soul into the performance. I think that's one of the reasons why I love Coldplay, they're so genuine and honest, and it really comes through in the live performance. The CD is OK too, good quality, but some real highlights left off. Still a 5 star effort, just coz it's Coldplay, (love the beginning of Yellow)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word - Magnificent","review":"Just buy it.

It was cheap so I bought it anyway. I turned it on and instantly found I was completely wrong. The visuals were the first things i noticed. Instead of predictable sweeping cameras and profile shots, the cinematics were very original and captivating. The cinematography matched the intensity and setting of the band: When the opening number started, the music pounded and the visuals become so jumpy I just got lost and faded into the music. The audio is in DTS 5.1 and is equaly as good as the visuals. It doesnt sound like your at the concert; it sounds better. The music covers you, but unlike other 5.1 music dvds, the sound is stationary - none of the sounds jump around. This creates a more consistant sound, and is excellent to just sit down, relax and completely fade right into the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it!","review":"First the cd...EXCELLENT! I've been a Coldplay fan from the start but the only thing better than listening to Coldplay is listening to them live. Blasting this cd in my car makes me feel like I'm at a show again. I love it. They included many of their old favorites and added a few new tracks such as \\"Amsterdam\\" and the amazing \\"Moses.\\" Before the cd was released I heard \\"Moses\\" on the radio one day and almost drove my car off the road as it was one of the most amazing things I had ever heard. Chris goes into U2's \\"Pride\\" chorus at one point and it is incredible. The guitars and everything blow me away.The dvd...AWESOME!

This makes for a predictably likable set. With only two CDs it's too early for Coldplay to release a live recording. In the documentary (included on the DVD) you get the feeling that Chris Martin doesn't think his band will last. The U2 influence is undeniable especially considering how far the band has come in America in such a short time. It's also a testament to how bad the music scene is today.The bonus CD is tracks from the same concert as the DVD and offers noting new.For completists only.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Production... not a show","review":"First of all... I really enjoyed this dvd. The special features, tour diary, and the actual show.. GREAT stuff!! I think they mixed the arrangement of the songs up enough to warrant buying this dvd/cd. The video quality is AMAZING and the different really give a great watching and listening experience. Unfortunately.. it's a bit too post-produced. Espescially apparent on the first line of \\"Yellow,\\" there's a vocal overdub which makes me wonder how \\"live\\" this show really is. Some other parts make me wonder what's live and what's not, for example many of the sounds straight from the album, like the swell sound on the verses of \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and strings on Politik and others.So... yes buy this dvd/cd, it's GREAT entertainment.

Chris' voice is so emotional that you find yourself singing along with him, helping him hit those high notes.A few notes:*Yes, Gwyneth is in the DVD. She's in the part where Chris is doing yoga and also at the very end when they are leaving the concert.*The reason Green Eyes is not played live anymore is because it was written for an old girlfriend of Chris' and he is trying to respect Gwyneth.The boys are so down to earth. All of them. They seem shy by their sudden success and that makes them so likeable. The segment about Chris' Spanish shirt was particularly funny.This DVD/CD is a must for a fan of Coldplay's waiting for their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Virtual Concert In Your Living Room.....and it's in 5.1","review":"Coming from a guy who couldn't stand this band a few years back, I now Love the ambient beauty of Rock that Coldplay brings to the stage.

The way each track runs into the next, and being mixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, It can't be replicated from a simple mp3 download.

Everything here is fantastic however, but that's half the problem. There are five tracks on here from Broken English, and rightfully so, but we only get six other tracks scattered from her career, one of which is a cover of Ghost Dance, which is weak and has no right to be put here over anything that was cut from Dangerous Acquantances or Strange Weather. Trouble in Mind is a classic Marianne tune, and She is super slick. The 60s version of As Tears Go By is sweet but feels way too out of place here after hearing the post 70s work. If you truly want a greatest hits collection, get the brilliant Island Anthology. This album feels like Broken English with some bonus tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT a new battery","review":"It was fully charged when it arrived, which told me it wasn't fresh and new.

They were certainly more original if not a bit idiosyncratic. In Philadelphia he chose to rerecord 4,5 & 6 only. (And he did also re-record Romeo & Juliet with the Philadelphians, but it was not reissued in this series.) Likewise, I hope EMI will reissue his 1981 Philadelphia recordings of the 1812 Overture and the Serenade for Strings. Those recordings were stunning! So, considering that Muti could not out-due himself, he gets 4 stars.

Worse than all of that, frankly, is the fact that this author just loves \\"potty talk\\", in bed, out of bed, wherever!! Every bodily orifice is discussed in detail. The heroine(?) vomits on what seems every few pages. After making love she asks whether she farted all night while she slept, saying she had a flatulence problem.

The young man always says \\"I 'm not a mad man\\", but actually he is telling us that he is. The young man can't just kill the old man because of his old eyes. It misleads readers to have those horrible thoughts with the main character in the story. If the main character thinks that he is right, then he must have mental problems.

Vocalist Johnny Edwards, fresh off his fill-in stint with Foreigner shines in Robert Plant-esque wails, dropping us pseudo-Zen lyrical treats. Dan Steigerwald's guitars are tastily more funk than hard rock, and compliment the loop-drenched, laid back grooves of drummer Jeff Klaven and bassist Dave Seaton. Klaven's pocket is undeniable, especially on the slow, sexy \\"House\\" while \\"Man\\" grooves so much it hurts.The compositional hooks are subtle, as Edwards towed the line of the day (90's) and stuck to one-word titles (sometimes when other, more obvious hooks were available for the taking), but the overall effect is uplifting on songs like \\"Generator\\" and \\"Bluebirds\\".A must for fans of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Led Zeppelin or fellow hard rock underdogs Badlands and King's X."},{"rating":"2","title":"oxygen sensor for 1996 VW","review":"good product exactly what i needed to go on my Rialta motor home and about 50 bucks cheeper same item"},{"rating":"1","title":"not My kind of writing","review":"I do not care for this author after reading a couple of her books.My favorite author is Gene Stratton Porter ESP Her bookkeeper of the bees"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is the better than any others out there!","review":"I could not be more excited about this game.

Instead, he spends (too) much of his time complaining about a particular folklorist, one of his ethnographic subjects, and the outside world's perception of \\"the Maya.\\" The latter is an interesting topic but he doesn't really tie it in well with the overall work.

Zukofsky encourages you - no, forces you - to decide for yourself what's great, what's good, and what's not so hot. And why. It is beneficially disorienting to see poems whose titles, authors, and dates are identified only in the index: there's no subtle pressure to like or dislike. Except for Z's limited, lucid commentary, you're on your own!Zukofsky's \\"test\\" is not whether poems live up to some arbitrary set of standards of excellence; it's whether they speak to the reader and how the reader subjectively explains how they do it.The poems are well selected.

An otherwise-routine plot lifted from \\"The Guantlet\\" instead turns into a great suspense flick. The casting was perfect. Mos Def annoyed the hell out of me for the first ten minutes but by the time the first guy gets shot, he had me hooked. Like all well-written suspense movies, the plot moves briskly and the characters are not dumber than the audience.But if this were just a well-written and -directed cop suspense flick, it would get just four stars. What I find most appealing in the movie is its theme of redemption, and how that theme ties the two main characters together and to each other. Redemption does come at a cost, as true redemption must, and for Jack Mosley that cost is high, but not too high to not make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying \\"remake\\" of the GAUNTLET","review":"Bruce Willis unfortunatley wastes his talents on 16 BLOCKS.Basically this movie is a rehash of Clint Eastwood's far superior THE GAUNTLET.Most annoying in this film is Def's character who speaks with such an exaggerated NASAL tone to his voice that you wish he would get shot just so you can stop listening to him and have the film end quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cops, bad cops","review":"This is another great cop movies Willis has pulled.

In what is arguably the most stereotyped minority accent since Mikey Rooney channeled WWII-era anti-Tojo propaganda cartoons in \\"Breakfast At Tiffany\\", Mos Def creates a barely-two-dimensional character which is still a dimension more than Willis' world-weary-cop-living-in-a-bottle.

I love Mos Defs character and I love how great his acting was for it, they complimented each other. Bruce Willis does an awesome job, as does the rest of the cop cast.But I especially liked the directing, and how what seems to be an oridinary movie keeps you entertained and captivated in a way like its a new concept. But, it isn't a new concept, and therefore still not anything too special, but definately one of the best in its genre, and deep in a subtle way."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"There are no lines!\\"","review":"16 Blocks brings to the screen the story of a down-on-his-luck NYPD detective charged with escorting a witness 16 blocks away to testify in court.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In conclusion, 16 Blocks is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for background studies in preaching","review":"This is one of the better books I've read on the parables of Jesus and the sermon on the mount.

Linguistics and religious language are two of the subjects that I am most deeply interested in, and I'm well trained in both; the need for clarity in religious language is a cause that matters greatly to me. I greatly admire the work of Wierzbicka, who is a superb scholar. I should have loved this book. Unfortunately, I didn't. That doesn't mean that it's not a valuable and important book, with all the necessary scholarly bells and whistles. It's all those things; I'm glad I have it on my bookshelf.

The author provides professional advice, along with showing the day to day life of a writer's work. I particularly liked the \\"readings\\" section to give students examples to emulate.

Both are stories of growing up weird, with mothers who are neurotic, to say the least.Unfortunately, having colorful characters does not a movie make. I think actually watching someone run with scissors would be more interesting than this movie.Critics have recommended Annette Bening for her tour de force--but a much better example is in the overlooked \\"Julia\\". Now there's something worth watching.To me, the problem is one of simple unpleasantness. (It's common in movies today that there's no real protagonist--no one to really sympathize with or care about at all.) About 40 minutes into this movie, I was hoping they'd all get carried off in straitjackets. Sadly, that does not happen.I suppose if you've had a really boring, empty life, you might find a story like this engaging. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"not by the book, but captures the spirit of the book","review":"An exceptionally well-done adaptation of the book. Unlike a typical film, where the screenwriter thinks he or she knows better than the original bestselling author, Ryan Murphy (who also directed and produced this film) trusts the original material enough to adapt the majority of it. The casting for this movie is superb too - from the surprising appearance of Joseph Fiennes as the mentally deranged 35-year-old Bookman, who has an affair with the protagonist, to Annette Bening cast as the protagonist's mother, a woman who comes further apart at the seams with each scene we see her in to Rachel Evan Wood and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect fit sisters and daughters of the psychiatrist who adopts the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me!","review":"I checked out this unpleasant little film from the library. You can thank me for that, since now you don't have to watch it. Based on the popular Augusten Burroughs memoir and marketed as a comedy, \\"Running with Scissors\\" is a rambling, grueling portrait of an unlikeable, dysfunctional band of narcissistic crazies who relentlessly and cruelly abuse themselves and each other. It's a catalog of over-the-top stereotypes about mental illness, a waste of good acting talent, a thoroughly exhausting experience, and two hours of my time down the dumper. The original memoir, which I haven't read, may be a good book, but if so, it's been utterly butchered in the process of adaptation.

I was somewhat shocked by the poop, homosexual sex and the rest but the thing is I know people are all different in their own ways in real life. People do crazy, unspeakable things, they just dont usually tell anyone about it or make a movie about it for all to see. That is what I love about the movie. In my opinion it is entirely unpredictable and original and AMAZINGLY HILARIOUS. I didn't read the book but I went to the theater with a bunch of people who did.

Burroughs has sold out to the cheap, scatological laugh, and we are all diminished by it.The story, \\"a memoir\\" is so patently false that it is no wonder that the family portrayed has sued the author, publisher, and Sony, and has collected.I will not read (or watch) anything from Burroughs again. I am surprised that the artists stooped to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running With Safety Scissors...","review":"To any of you interested in this film, I highly recommend reading the book instead. It seems that the movie just couldn't cover any of the erotic detail that add to the book's highly intriguing, eccentricity.

They just played this one way too safe in comparison to the book.

Alec Baldwin does a nice turn as the alky father, while Paltrow, Wood, Cox, et. al. portray the messy and crazy Finch family which adopts Augusten for a while. Joseph Fiennes is also great in his role as Augusten's sometime lover.Sure, it's a great cast, but the year that it covers seems to drag on and on, with pervasive musical interludes, an unbelievable portrait of the Finches and their \\"house,\\" and it is a chore to get through this film. There seems to be no point or purpose, there is very little humor, and it is quite unsatisfying as a memoir.Too bad these actors are wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"I watched this movied after reading the book and the movie was a horrible disapointment. the book was amazing and a great read, i was looking forward to watching the movie. the movie was such a let down. it left out most of the book and i am not sure how someone could follow the movie if they havent read the book. this is definitly a book that shouldnt have been made into a movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"regional code","review":"I like this movie alot ive seen it before I got it so my brother could watch it I have an Xbox 360 it said the reigional code was wrong so I put it in my brothers DVD player and it said the reoginal code was wrong I got to looking at it and it sai it was for like Britan or somthing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wanted to like this one. . . .","review":"We bought this DVD because of the promises on the case, which made it sound like a hilarious comedy with a wonderful cast. Unfortunately, neither my wife nor I were able to find anything funny about it. This is a movie about characters who use and manipulate each other, hurting each other greatly in the process. The script is simply awful, giving us no reason to care for or about any of the characters at all. While the actors seemed to be able to convey their characters' quirks and personalities quite well, almost nothing works together, and the film just gets more and more depressing as it goes. This is definitely one to pass on if you have anything else to choose from at all. There was no feeling of \\"I've just watched something important,\\" not even \\"I've just been entertained well.\\" It's simply a dark and dreary story of dreary characters who arouse no sympathy on the part of the viewer. These were two wasted hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book bad movie","review":"I read the book and thought the movie would be good. I was disappointed. I tried twice to watch the movie.

I rented it thinking how can you go wrong with Annette Bening, Evan Rachel Wood, Alec Baldwin, Joseph Fiennes, Jill Clayburgh, Gwyneth Paltrow? Well, this flick is how. It's awful.The film is disjointed, no plot or character development. The jokes are heavy-handed, un-funny, and repeated and milked ad nauseum. This review is for the first 1/2 hour of the film. That is all I could sit through.Have this DVD in your medicine cabinet in case you ever need an emetic. That's the only use I can think of for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dysfunctional family at it's best","review":"This family that the movie is about is so outlandishly dysfunctional it is funny. It is a movie of poor choices and where they lead one in life. It is also a story of a \\"therapist/psychiatrist\\" and his greed for money. It is also a story of very \\"twisted\\" lives of those people around the family and \\"therapist/psychiatrist\\". This movie takes dysfunctionality to the extreme. Watching this movie I found alot of parts of the movie very funny to watch and I was also sympathetic to those characters involved in the \\"big picture\\". I think it is one of those movies you are either going to \\"love or hate\\". I highly recommend this movie for anyone that thinks that they have a dysfunctional family. Maybe after watching it, you won't think that way after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, disappointing movie","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Running With Scissors\\" and was thrilled to learn that they were going to make a movie of it. Sadly, the movie was a big disappointment. Yes it follows the plot-lines of the book, but Augusten Burroughs's wry, entertaining voice is completely lost in the translation. The movie plods along, and although Annette Benning is terrific, and Evan Rachel Wood good also, they can't save this one. The worst thing about it is actually the soundtrack-- not the music itself, which is a grab-bag of unremarkable 1970s songs-- but it's loud, intrusive, and badly placed. Again and again the characters are talking OVER a song and you can't even hear them.Save your money. Buy Augusten Burroughs's next book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment and waste of a good cast.","review":"I read the book, and for some reason had very high expectations. The book was quirky, sad, eccentric, horrific, and redeeming all at once. But the movie was just horrific from the very start. The character depth was nonesxistent, the plot was dismal, and the script was, for a lack of a better word, atrocious. Even though the adaptation tried to remain faithful to the book, all the scenes seemed to be lacking the spark and charisma that Burroughs had in his writing. I pictured the characters differently, and seeing them on screen as three dimensional figures, I realized they were better off on paper. The book is definitely worth the read, but the movie should be forgotten quickly. When will authors learn?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adapted from book","review":"The movie was a 'toned down' version of the Memoir, which is good because it might have been too heavy, emotionally, for most people. The adaptation focuses more on the humor of what can only be described as a bizarre childhood. We can feel a young boy's pain when his mentally ill mother sends him to live with a whacked out shrink and his quirky family. I must say that the author was very brave and I'm glad he had the courage to share some of his memories with the public.Chrissy K.

It barely resembles the book and really cheats the Borroughs fan who views it expecting the story in dramatization form. The movie gives little of the background circumstances that lead to the events of the premise. The story is oddly weighted to generically display a cast of characters in farce with none of the underlying sadness that the book had to propel the reader through. The characters are simply quirky and odd, not three dimensional and believable. The character of Augusten is played by an actor too old for the story and his naivete is absurd because of it. The sexual awakening in frightening and odd circumstances is watered down in the few minutes that it is even presented in this lackluster flop. Such a ridiculous rendering of what is a funny, sad, and provocative story. Take your scissors and run far far away from this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the book, movie didn't come close to living up to the book","review":"like i said in the title the book was awesome. i loved the dark humor and if you have read the book...I absolutely loved augustens personality in the book. his ideas of doctors and how they should be...the way he describes himself and his love for shiny things...just his whole personality as a child in general was HILARIOUS but I didnt see much of any of that in the movie. also, I HATE how hollywood adds so many scenes that were NOT in the book...that book had more than enough crazy messed up GOOD scenes in it that it by no means needed more that didnt even exist for the movie. overall, i would recommend watching the movie if you HAVE read the book because its cool to see a book come to life on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a valium","review":"no wait, this movie is a demo of what it feels like to take a valium.

Every single character in this film is depressed, mentally ill, and self-absorbed. No one is sane or sympathetic. Therefore, there's no one to identify with or root for.

Not for the light hearted."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing!","review":"I read Running with Scissors recently and was highly anticipating the film adaptation -- I was VERY disappointed in this poorly contructed rendering of Burroughs' book. The film entirely lacks Burroughs' dark wit -- it's as if the director misinterpreted the author's tone. The over-abundant scenes of the characters weeping over their tragic lives left me bored.The movie is certainly well-cast (excluding the roles of Augusten and Nathalie, which bothered me somewhat), but even Gwenyth Paltrow seemed to lack direction in her portrayal of Hope, which was as dull and colorless as a block of wood. However, I do have to admit, Annette Benning and Joseph Fiennes' stellar performances did stand out in this otherwise lacking adaptation. I also thought the script was poorly written -- I can understand the necessity for some creative license, but the script strayed too far from the book in my opinion. I think perhaps that's why the film is such a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book..","review":"Don't watch the movie!! The movie puts the book to shame!

I feel nothing for any of the characters. Visually and performance-wise, it's terrific. Storywise, I guess I prefer more sober approaches to telling a story. I understand that this script is based on fact, however, if that's the case, they are people toward whom I shrug with a \\"so what?\\" I can appreciate off-the-wall humor; I loved \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" for instance but \\"Running With Scissors\\" doesn't work.

Terrible screenplay which lessens the grit that we want to bestow on the heroic dfenders. The \\"Travis-Bowie\\" conflict is tense, but historically misses the fact: they argued over command, not strategy. As for the set itself, I have been there 3 times and it is worth the visit. In some ways it holds the sense of the defenders isolation; the real Alamo in San Antonio has been altered so much that it is hardly recognizable. As for the \\"truth\\" of the Alamo itself?

The film might have been more effective if Wayne had built up the tension during the siege. Instead, his characters are too busy gving windy speaches and otherwise just occupying screen time. And as a villian, Santa Anna is completely colorless rather than being the classic movie bad guy that he should be. Overall, a would be classic that fell well short of the mark. Nice cinematography, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total drivel","review":"You know, you would think that a guy like John Wayne who wanted to make the Alamo movie for 13 years would have at least researched what went on there. But no, he just made up his own reality on the subject. And isn't that, in reality, disrespect to the place and its defenders? Anyway, anybody who has read the history of the Alamo will reject this mess of fantasy nonsense real quick. An example that even those who don't know Alamo history can laugh at--in the movie San Antonio is located on the Rio Grande River, when it is actually 150 miles away. Total drivel, and a waste of time. This movie is horrible. But hey, it has the required number of colorful sidekicks typical of John Wayne's western movies, doesn't that save it? NO. This movie is as phony as John Wayne himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"What???","review":"You have got to be kiding me? Only 2 reviews for this wonderful movie?

Unfortunately, the distributors have short changed all of us here by releasing the short version of the film with 2 Channel Stereo and no Overture, Intermission or Exit Music. Come on guys, look at what the VHS offers in content. Surely the DVD should be just as good or better!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the short version.","review":"I saw the shorter version of this film and felt that it was overlong and boring. But, it is my nature to try to find the longest versions of movies and in widescreen. This is one of those movies, and for some reason, it didn't feel overlong like the shorter version. Also, the final battle is a lot better in widescreen than non widescreen. The movie has brilliantly handled action scenes, and it is a shame John Wayne didn't direct more action movies like this. The final battle and the ending are heartbreaking, especially when the last survivors, a woman her daughter and a black slave, are spared and the little girl, played by one of John Wayne's daughters, asks her mother \\"Where's Daddy, Mommy?\\" It still brings tears to my eyes when I hear that. Forget Gone With The Wind. This is the 200+ minute long movie to get and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"An otherwise very thorough book has been ruined by throwing in opinions.

As has been the case of late, I was disappointed by Black Notice. A very interesting case and intriguing departmental politics all go nowhere. I love Scarpetta and wish that Cornwell would return to old form; writing a true mystery and not a novel worthy of Oprah's book club. I am left with more questions at the very speedy end of this novel than answers (why did the killer's parents hide him? Why does Kay 'not love' her sister? Why is Lucy absurdly angry??

Any interaction between Kay and Marino, or Kay and Lucy or Marino and Lucy or Kay and Agt. Talley etc etc. is simply negative, rude and obnoxious. I don't know why they speak to one another the next day. I certainly had no compassion or concern for any of the characters.

It doesn't appear that Kay Scarpetta will ever be happy and satisfied.The scientific basis for the novel is a little out there, I thought.

My single complaint has been that the author always constructs the story such that the entire world is out to get the protagonist. Understanding the controversial nature of the job, some of that conflict is inevitable, but Cornwell takes it to dizzying heights, and we can only wonder whether this reflects the author's own fears.The paranoia's tiring, the characters are predictable, and the ending's almost a carbon copy of at least two other of Cornwell's novels.

I also have grown to care about the characters and how their lives are progressing. In a series it's important to have a strong foundation within the characters and Kay, Marino, and Lucy are all interesting, complex characters that I enjoy to read about.

The earlier reviewers seemed to grow cold on \\"Black Notice\\", but after the terrible ending to \\"Point of Origin\\", this book was great.I like the \\"edginess\\" of Marino and Lucy, although it is perplexing how Kay and Lucy keep bumping into each others worlds. And if Marino is being asked for by all of these higher power organizations (Interpol, FBI, etc.) why is he still whining in Richmond?

The book drags and the emotional pain -- oh the pain, oh the pining, oh the melodrama, oh the psychological analysis -- pleeeze. Sophomoric. Reeks of being put together hastily for a deadline.

Cronwell spends two-thirds of the book analyzing Scarpetta and her loss of Benton, and allowing Marino to give everyone a lot of lip. By some very tedious twists and turns, she connects the dots in the last fifty pages. Sending Scarpetta on a trip to Paris was nice, and the INTERPOL idea is pretty good; however, these are used in a quick-and-dirty fashion, sort of thrown into the mix for good measure.

Did he actually do anything but clobber Kay's stud (yeah the sex scene... unbelievable, if you can even call it a sex scene... and him declaring his undying feelings after an afternoon romp? Ridiculous!) Scarpetta's holier than thou attitude is getting progressively worse. And did she have a conversation with anyone she didn't get in a fight with or have negative feelings about? The French cab driver... her poor maid who forgot to change the towels... Sheesh. Let's not even get started on Lucy. She's a lunatic.

To pick just one example, Dr. Scarpetta's side-kick, Marino, is a manic, foul-mouthed police officer who always states the obvious for the benefit of readers who are just skimming.

I was hoping that the Scarpetta novels had gotten back to great plots and storytelling, but Black Notice would not pass a sophomore English class. It is the same tiresome characters with incoherent, wandering text that never comes together. There are countless subplots dropped into the story, yet not one makes sense. What is Senator Lord's involvement with Interpol? And what made this morally righteous, genius of a coroner think that a man she barely knows is falling in love with her after a night in the sack? Ick! And why? This book just alternates between whiny (poor Dr. Scarpetta works too hard, everyone is plotting against her, and her bitchy niece Lucy won't call to thank her for the flowers!) and just plain goofy (the online impersonator).

I read from cover to cover almost in one sitting.BLACK NOTICE, and it's predecessor, POINT OF ORIGIN were books that got shuffled to the back of the bookshelf for when I didn't have anything else to read. It appears that Cornwell is moving away from the stand-alone novel and moving into the area of novel-in-serial, where in order to understand one you must read the earlier works. Some of the twists and turns will be explained in the later book, LAST PRECINCT, if you can hang on for that long of a journey.Scarpetta still solves her crimes but she appears to be doing it while whining and complaining.

The main characters do not grow or change at all during the course of the novel, and the rest of the cast is as thin as the pages they are written on.Someone needs to teach the author the difference between foreshadowing and telegraphing. I won't reveal the unsatisfying ending, but any reader will know after the first 25 pages where this one is headed. I believe several other Scarpetta books have ended in the exact same fashion.The only thing remarkable about this book is the lack of any type of suspense. And the only mystery is that Cornwell is paid so much to write so poorly. Let's hope she invests some of that cash in taking courses at the local community college.

I started reading again with the last novel and now this one. The characters have become unrealistic, jet-setting James Bond types, although James Bond doesn't spend so much time whining and complaining. These are really unpleasant people investigating ridiculously complicated crimes. This book's minor characters and sub-plots make no sense (Diane Bray?) and Cornwell's technical writing skills have deteriorated terribly.

Bring back the old, intriguing Kay Scarpetta and gang, not this whiny bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cornwell has ever written","review":"This book holds your interest from page 1--the best scarpetti yet--I recommend this to all--whether Cornwell fans or not(she has never been my favorite--but I am now a convert--the book is spellbinding and really a great read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Worst Cornwell Novel EVER!!!!","review":"Boring, almost depressing - no suspense like other Cornwell novels, kept waiting for the story to devleop. I actually would have put the novel down except for the fact that I was so angry for buying it in hardcover I was determined to finish it so I could give it a fair review. Don't waste your time or your money on this one. Cornwell should kill off this series and start over with a whole new cast of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par.....","review":"I have read all of Patricia's books. This book took me forever to get through. I found it very hard to believe everyone was out to get Kay.

I could not put the book down until I finished reading it. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"The \\"crime\\" got lost in all the \\"psycho-babble\\" about Kay's dead lover, her crazy (for lack of a better word) police friend and her gay niece. It was, \\"Oh, by the way, we did catch the killer\\". Her techinical writing is great and I enjoyed her first three or four books very much.Patricia, please go back to your previous style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"Cornwell seemed to be resting on her laurels with \\"Black Notice\\". I found the story to be disorganized and hard to follow. She introduces several elements, but then goes nowhere with them. I felt the story ended with several threads left hanging, or with forced conclusions. She would have done better to simplify the plot and leave out some of the extraneous story lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Notice","review":"I have never read a Patricia Cornwell book before and was very \\"unimpressed\\" with it. First, she deals more with character interaction than the problem at hand. Second, she portrays men as pot-bellied, t-shirt wearing, foul-mouth men who care more about their social life than their job. All women are \\"olive skin beauties\\", with perfect bodies, and ALWAYS in authority over men. The language was sickening, and way overdone to get the point across. I suffered through the first chapter and ended up throwing the book away. I assume it is now in the landfill where it belongs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not a stand alone book.","review":"You have to read, \\"Point of Origin\\" in order to enjoy this book. The events of Point of Origin.......drive the story line, especially the first half of the book.If you read both books, you will enjoy both. If you read this one separately, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling!!","review":"Ms. Cornwell wrote the latest with a chilling lack of sentimentality. She remained true to her genre and didn't allow herself to become squeamish about eradicating some intergral characters. As usual Cornwell kept my heart in my throat, my pulse racing and my mind energized. Good book, better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK TO HER OLD FORM!","review":"I've been disappointed with her last few books(especially since I mistakenly bought her cookbook) but with this book she brings back all our old friends, and leaves us with some interesting questions for the next book. A very entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftovers","review":"This is the worst of the lot - close to Hornet's Nest. Have been a fan and read all of the books twice, but this one screamed with angry characters and predictable plot. Much of the plot seemed to come from past stories. Maybe this one was just for therapy - Kay's, Pete's, Lucy's & Pat's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine Tingling","review":"Black Notice is yet another outstanding book.Patricia Cornwell is back on track with this one. Bring back her main charchters was the best thing she could have done. I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it. Hope she has another book in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must read this, get it from the library.","review":"Isn't there supposed to be at least one likeable character in a book? Every character in this book was depressing, with no redeeming qualities. Scarpetta spent the entire book feeling sorry for herself. Marino is a drunken bum. Lucy is a walking time bomb. I don't remember Benton being such a great guy. Why has his death destroyed so many lives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"The book started off strong. I was really getting into to it, I didn't want to put the book down, until the end. What a disappointing ending, it's as if Patricia Cornwell didn't know where she was going with the story so she decided to quickly throw an ending together. It didn't do the book justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that...","review":"Imagine escaping death at the hands of a crazed killer, not once, not twice but over and over and over again and still making the same stupid mistakes. Perhaps Dr. Kay Scarpetta has a death wish... Why would someone trained to deal with death not know all the stages of mourning, and not seek counseling?Why is it such a big deal that Lucy is gay and why is she protrayed as such a loose cannon?To say I wasn't at all pleased with this read which was slow going until the halfway point would be an understatement. Unless Dr. Scarpetta and her niece get some psychiatric help, I won't be following her exploits any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell Still Clogging","review":"After I read her last book, Point of Origin, I was hesitant in buying into Ms. Cornwell again. Being optimistic, I bit for this one. And it did not bite back. In fact it gummed me to death. Did anyone else find the dialogue so cluttered a dustbuster couldn't clear it up? I do not like to *dis* any book or any author, they do something I cannot--write. However, in good faith, I cannot recommend Black Notice due to poor plot, dialogue, & frustrating folly.other reading suggestions: \\"Bleeding Out\\" by Baxter Clare, \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" by Tami Hoag, and \\"Manhattan Is My Beat\\" by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest & comment vote--CDS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia's been watching too much X-files.....","review":"Oh, my. What is with this whole conspiracy thing. Let me premise this by saying that I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and was looking forward to this one coming out, but what a disappointment! Why must Lucy somehow be connected to all of Kay's cases. How realistic is that. Oh, how I wish that she would go back to the earlier storylines where there was just some serial killer out there, and Kay and Marino just went out and did their jobs instead of all of this highly implausible international intrigue that Ms. Cornwell makes us plod through. I don't know how many more books that Ms. Cornwell can put out about these characters, because they're apparently all about to have nervous breakdown's! If you're also sick of these crazy plot twists, check out Kathy Reich's books, they're alot like the early Cornwell ones. Pure science and thriller, none of this crazy mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Book should be reclassified as a psych drama","review":"I used to be able to read a Scarpetta book at least twice. Now I have trouble getting through the first read. I guess the author isn't the only one who has lost interest in the series. I'm tired of outlandish and cartoonish killers and I wish Cornwell would learn how to write endings. It's all so old. Kay's mates are killed off, Lucy is nuts and miserable and gun-happy, but always in loving relationships. Kay is always the killer's target. People are always out to get her. There are always a number of amazing coincidences to tie things together in a hasty knot that passes for plot. I'd like more crime and much less of Kay's messy, uncontrolled inner life. Now THAT is a frightening place and I don't want more than glimpses. I don't want to know how unhinged Kay is becoming. I thought I was buying a CRIME novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Notice","review":"I have loved the Scarpetta series from Post-mortem. I was appalled at the foul language used throughout this book and the lack of a plot. I was hoping that this book would be better than \\"Hornet's Nest\\" and \\"Southern Cross\\" but I rate them the same. Point of Origin went back to her original writings but I'm not sure I'll read another. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The details of autopsies on burned bodies","review":"The story was farfetched, drawn out, and the characters improbable. But worst-the details of autopsies on burned bodies revolted me, a surgeon of many years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read most of Patricia Cornwell's books and I have a hard time believing that the characters just seem to stand still and don't grow in any way. Marino seems to be a cartoon character built upon every generalization of middle-aged overweight men you ever heard of, Kay Scarpetta just can't be that unaware (we all knew the suspect was outside the door and who was stealing in the morgue). A book about Lucy could be very interesting at this point, she seems to have growth potential. I was disappointed with the overall story and the complete lack of character growth - no one here seems to have learned anything from their past."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointed Cornwell fan!! Unorganized and dry!!!","review":"I have been a big fan and avid \\"Skarpetta\\" fan since Cornwell's very first book. For a long time I have been to the point of not even reading her reviews, the bookcover panels, etc., I just KNEW her book would be well worth it. I was so disappointed with Black Notice. For starters, it is so unlikely that she would meet the perfect man and even care while her career lays in ruin, her neice is in danger, Moreno's job is on the line, her computer system is being broken into and she has dead bodies all over the place. But she has time to find the \\"second\\" Mr Right and dump him all in one setting??? Very not like Kay Skarpetta. Also, all of the loose ends are just that, loose. And at this point, I could care less if Lucy dies, if Skarpetta loses her job, and I am kinda rooting for \\"Chuckie\\". But, as usual, I will probably calm down just in time for her next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"Lucy is angry. Marino is angry. Kay is angry. I've read and enjoyed every one of the Kay Scarpetta novels up until now, but the characters have become as predictable as taxes. Even those who made their debut in this one -- Diane Bray, Jay Talley, Det. Anderson -- are cardboard. To add insult to injury, the dialogue was often inane and we learned virtually nothing about the killer other than bizarre surface facts. Looks like Patricia Cornwell phoned this one in."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARPETTA DOES HAVE CLAY FEET!!!","review":"I enjoyed this novel, contrary to what other reviewers thought.Scarpetta as a role model - COME ON!! She's a character in a book, whoin this most recent effort, has seemed to have joined the rest of us mere mortals in her ability to grieve, get depressed, relapse smoking, and feel out of control. I was beginning to get sick of the Scarpetta novels - I felt Kay was too much of a machine - a boring know-it-all. I think this book approaches \\"The Body Farm\\" and her other earlier efforts, where the characters were believable, sympathetic, and not-to-perfect. So there's a new love interest, and he's younger - SO WHAT? I'm looking forward to the next Scarpetta book - I feel like my old friends are back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny, disjointed, would not recommend it.","review":"Kay has deteriorated into a poor storyteller, and seems to have become a very unstable person - was Chief Bray on the right track with her dismissal? The story jumps all over, Marino seems to have become a liability rather than a brilliant detective. Kay can't figure out who is leading the seduction, and we did NOT need the kernal about Benton's autopsy. I really used to enjoy the smooth writing of these books, but it seems to degenerated into some disjointed stream of conciousness. Time to search for a new author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm..who's going next?","review":"While I have really enjoyed the first 3 books of the series, I find myself asking with each subsequent book,\\"Who the heck will Cornwell kill off next?\\" Maybe that annoying absentee mother of Lucy's, maybe Kay's long lost uncle, maybe Marino's hairdresser. Patricia! Listen up! You stretch our disbelief to the breaking point with all of these deaths. Mark gets blown up, Benton loses face (groan) and a friend of Kay's is shot mistakenly after her sister is claimed for a serial killer's victim in an earlier book. Other than my overall objections to the series' determination to kill off everyone Kay loves, Black Notice was a fine book. But it didn't scare me like Post-Mortem or engross me like Hannibal. And the prose sometimes gets so dense I feel like I'm launching myself into a brick wall by catapault and sliding right down. I just can't fall into the book in the techical parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth the time","review":"This book compounded the disappointment I felt when reading the last Kay Scarpetta novel. If I wanted to read about love, sex, anger, grief and subsequent angst I wouldn't buy a book touted as a mystery. The real enchantment of the beginning books in these series was Kay Scarpetta as a professional in the fascinating field of forensic pathology. Her character was fleshed out in a realistic way by her relationships with Lucy, Marino and Benton AND there was real mystery to be solved. Now, Lucy is a basket case and so is Kay. Benton is dead and may be lucky at that and poor Marino isn't getting the attention his character deserves. Bray and her sidekick are one dimensional (where in the world did they come from?) and the sub-plots were an annoying distraction. My overall impression is that the author is falling apart. It is my sincere hope that she gets back together. But in the meantime don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Scarpetta gone?","review":"This series has not gone the way I'd hoped. Kay used to be a great medical examiner completely committed to solving crimes. Now she's an emotional basketcase and I'm forced to read about it. Lucy is dangerous as well as an emotional basketcase, and Marino is half the cop he used to be. The plots are unrealistic and closer to melodrama than gritty crime stories.The series is getting stranger and I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring entry to the Dr. Kay Scarpetta saga.","review":"The latest Patricia Cornwell entry is totally boring.What little plot there is concerning a killer, or the werewolf, is secondary to the soap opera antics of dear Kay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start ....... weak finish","review":"A good strong start with 'traditional' attention to detail in both setting and characterisation. However I am unsure how many of the Scarpetta novels have now featured the criminal at Kay's doorstep. Move house, change telephone number, get better security ..... develop an original ending? Do something to save this enjoyable character (and another Southern Cross is most definitely not the answer!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kay's back and she's going strong !","review":"We loved it especially when Kay goes international.We hope that Patricia keeps Kay 'alive' .As a medical person myself I can visualize what is happening .I love the intruge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great characters, good science, but no clue on plot","review":"Scarpetta is a detail freak in her work but has no concept of follow-through in her life. Things happen that are just ignored, it seems like the plots are a pastiche of paragraphs about Scarpetta which are forced into a chronology by her editor. The woman can write; I wish she'd take a story idea, outline it to figure out what she wants to say and where she wants to go, then go there. There's brilliance, and great sentences, solid characters, good science. But what holds them all together? The binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, brooding, and dull.","review":"The majority of the book is spent tangling and untangling relationsips that have little bearing on the plot. And speaking of plot...where was it. The book drags on forever only to have everything wrapped up in less than 20 pages. This book has no relation to the earlier solid writings in the other Scarpetta novels. Though not a total waste of time this is one book better left on the shelf or at least wait for the Cliff notes to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting and Disappointing Read","review":"Cornwell presents a crime and then goes way out into left field with distractions, sub-plots and too much anger. She should have kept with the forensics that she does well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes - Sadly, this was a terrible book","review":"It's pretty easy to describe my feelings about this book:\\"It's terrible - don't bother - I will never buy another book from this book series - the end has come.\\"I used to love reading Patricia Cornwell's books. Oh well, it must be hard to keep the characters and plot lines fresh for such a long time.I'll have to find another author to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK NOTICE blackly noticed","review":"Any book with 275 reviews doesn't need another but--being from Richmond and all (note to author: VA State employees do not have access to AOL. Note to Readers: any comparison between Marino and an actual Richmond police captain is insulting.) Gave this two stars because the first 1/3 is paced briskly; a few new characters are introduced (non-serial killing non-monsters). Things are looking good. Then Kay goes to Paris, and it's all over. Her monster is laughable, it drags, you don't care, and your spirits lift at the end because you know it's almost over.You heard it here first. She's going to kill off the obnoxious Lucy. We'll have to suffer through Kay's spasms & histrionics of grief, but it will be well worth it to never be confronted by that wretched girl again."},{"rating":"1","title":"what hidden evidence? What dangerous mission kay pulls off?","review":"i was reading the inside flaps of the summary of the book, and the words, \\"retreive hidden evidence\\" and \\"carry out a mission\\" made the book sound pretty exciting. but i am so wrong. the book rushed at the ending , was slow, and was pretty bad. although i think unnatural exposures was the worst book, this was pretty bad too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I have read all of the Scarpetta books. Granted, it is hard to come up with new stuff after so many great books. But, this was better than I expected. The characters were developed thoughtfully, althought I agree with reviewers who felt that the story came to a screeching conclusion with many unanswered questions. I am not repulsed by vulgarity, but I did feel that the gratuitous use of profanity went well beyond what was required to establish character identity. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read and will look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story?","review":"This is my first Patricia Cornwell book, and I'm disappointed. The dialog is sharp and not convincing. The book reads more like a made-for-TV mini-series than of a novel. There is an excessive number of subplots, none of which deal with catching the \\"werewolf\\". I'll give her one more shot to impress me."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot got lost in a rushed ending","review":"i thought i had misunderstood previous reviews and that this was going to be one of the better books. what a confusing plot; then to end the book as quickly and as incompletely totally irritated me. i don't think i've ever walked away from a cornwell thinking that it was a waste of time and money but this time, as much as i hate to admit it, i did. for a beter read, plick of james patterson's new: pop goes the weasal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good yarn but too many sub-plots.","review":"Come on, Ms. Cornwell, lighten up! Black Notice was a splendid yarn about a Werewolf but so many sub-plots were thrown in, the character-development and his origins were buried. I have always loved big, brusque, protective Marino but in this one his disgusting behavior was a real turn-off. He typified the \\"ugly American\\" when they were in France. And where was your usual grand and glorious ending tying in all the loose ends? This one seemed to just abruptly stop.From the description of the killer, with his long body hair, ugly face and pointy teeth, it was completely illogical that SOMEONE didn't spot him long before the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"This outshines the other Scarpetta novels. I have had the pleasure of reading all the other Scarpetta novels and have always enjoyed them. I had some reservations about this one with Benton Wesley being killed off in the previous scarpetta novel but this was sheer brilliance. It was a definite improvement over the last Scarpetta novel where the writer seemed to have lost some of her feel for the character and the stories. I can't wait for the other Scarpetta novel. This is a MUST READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Typical!","review":"If you like Kay Scarpetta's adventures, this is more of same. Same Kay, same Lucy, same Merino, only more so. I think some new blood is indicated for this series, the new love interest sounds like he may not last but if Kay ever perks up she may enjoy herself. I wish we could find out more about Marino's mysterious son. Anyway, I enjoyed this book even though it's similar to all the others, though I felt the villain was ludicrous and the ending was so abrupt she may as well have written \\"end of part I\\" for a closing sentence. One thing I didn't like - I know you have to be a tough specimen to be a police woman, not to mention Detective or Chief, but did Bray and Anderson HAVE to be portrayed as such repellent, evil, slimey, perverted SERPENTS? They were one step above the loup garrou, if you ask me. I enjoyed \\"Black Notice\\" but will be disappointed il future stories follow the same ol' same ol' angst of our three heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Character Driven - Lots of Developement ! A Good Read.","review":"This latest \\"edition\\" of Kay Scarpetta's life was one of my favorites. It's a different kind of Scarpetta novel. This one is more about the characters with the \\"mystery\\" taking very much the back seat.Lucy is back and Marino and they're all sharing in the pain regarding Benton's death. Of all the books, this one moves the characters themselves further than any other (as with \\"The Body Farm\\"). It's good to see that Kay is, indeed, capable of depression, that she is NOT a superwoman (no matter what SHE might think). I'd recommend this book to anyone - especially the fan who considers themselves part of Kay's extended family. I only wish Cornwell would publish more Scarepetta mysteries (I'm not thrilled with the \\"Hornet's Nest\\" bunch). Also, I think it'd be great if Lucy got her own book! These are all characters we've come to know and love - this book will further that. Regards to all. TurTleX"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is way below a \\"Patricia Cornwell\\" standard.","review":"Although a somewhat exciting read, this is far lacking the previous polished Kay Scarpetta novels. The characters have ended up depressed and miserable, it's time to start writing something uphill. There wasn't a hint of suspense, and I found myself reading more of a soap opera drama starring the key characters in goofy dire straits. The story didn't flow, and i found many instances of descriptions that contradicted what was just a few lines or a page previous. I feel this was sloppy writing by an otherwise excellent author. We dedicated Cornwell fans could go the extra few months for a book release if it meant a tidier, more believable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of Patricia's Best!","review":"I think that this book was just about the best Kay Scarpetta novel I have ever read. It was a quick read, and I couldn't seem to put it down! The research Patricia Cornwell does for her books amazes me, and she writes with an insight that only she could have. Thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true \\"Scarpetta\\" has stepped forward!","review":"This book reminds me of Cornwell's earlier works in this series which I liked very much. Her last 3 books however have left a bad taste in my mouth. I was delighted to see the end of the \\"Carrie Gretham\\" influence and had much hope for this new book. It was a good book, but I think Patricia Cornwell is sick of the series and wants to move on. Why do writer's get so angry at the characters who made them famous? It's almost as if they are jealous. Obviously it's time to say goodby to Kay Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it a day, Patricia","review":"This is garbage, just like POINT OF ORIGIN. I really liked the first few Scarpettas, but the series has run out of ideas. Yet another conspiracy in the workplace. Yet more scenes chez Kay with Marino and Lucy acting out the same cycle of angst. Please just stop it! If you want crime writing in which the characters keep developing, try Lawrence Block. Or if you want fresh crime writing from the female perspective, go to Minette Walters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently written--could not put down","review":"I disagree with the reviewers who are rather harsh in their opinions about this novel. It has all of the key ingredients to make it an excellent example of the best of its genre. As usual, Cornwell's writing is superb--the suspense is gripping, the action flows throughout the book, her descriptions are vivid, and her characters are real and complex. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find her well-fleshed out characters to be one of the strongest aspects of her writing. I enjoy seeing the continuing story of Kay Scarpetta's world come to life, and I enjoy seeing her interact with the characters that we have come to know through Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels. I say Bravo to Cornwell, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an excellently-written murder/crime mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth an autopsy","review":"Devoted Cornwell fans will hate this, but I don't care much. Patricia Cornwell writes thrillers to a formula and Black Notice reads as though she is writing without thinking. You know, been there done this so many times you don't have to think any more. Her clinical descriptions of a coroner's work are meticulous and for me, the best part of the book. However generally, Cornwell's use of language is thoroughly pedestrian, the descriptions of Dr Kay Scarpetta's grief over her lost lover overwrought, clumsily written and they slow down the action. By the end of the book I couldn't have cared less who the murderer was. My first Patricia Cornwell read - and my last. Not worth an autopsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Notice","review":"I just didn't buy the premise.

I think this is the last. The author has lost her focus and this book was simply boring. Nothing exciting happened and the end was a complete contrived bust. It will take a big sell to get me into another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this latest book.","review":"This book was a disappointment after reading all the other books written by Ms. Cornwell. It was gloom and doom from start to finish. It was extremely depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it until the very end","review":"As a native of Richmond I have always loved reading the tales of Dr. Scarpetta. This one was the best in terms of really getting into her character. I hope Patricia Cornwell can give us more on Lucy and Marino too. But the ending of this book was really disappointing. The Scarpetta we have come to know and love would never open that door and you know it. Don't give up at the end like that next time and I'll keep on reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh...character development... PLEASE!","review":"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta mysteries. She and the rest of the gang started off as creative, interesting characters. They have \\"evolved\\" into just the opposite. What first intrigued me were the clinical details AND the characters. The settings and details are still of interest, but the characters have turned into one-dimensional static charicatures (Marino as overweight blue collar rough cop, Lucy as angry brainiac, etc.) There is no passion or life left in any of them. Alas...I fear I must bid farewell to Kay and Ms. Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Black Notice hints at the talent that Patricia Cornwell once displayed so effortlessly. The loup garou and Bray story lines promised greatness;rivals to Kay's throne from two different angles. I was looking forward to how Kay was going to solve the crime and deal with the professional challenge. Unfortunately, Cornwell revealed a startling lack of depth, and opted for the easy outs. She fell back to her old obsessions with Lucy and Marino; each becoming an increasingly disagreeable caricature of her/himself. And where did this sudden passion for Benton come from? That relationship always lacked warmth and compassion, nevermind passion. His death was just another convenient ending for her last Scarpetta book. This might be a good time for Cornwell to consider collaborating with another author who is a strong closer. She's petering out at third base and is unable to bring it home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, written in an absent minded way.","review":"As a fan of Patricia Cornwel, Black Notice was a great disppointment.It was an ordeal to continue reading this book, hoping it would get better. The dialogue is disjointed and the plot momentum is non-existent. The character development relies on heavy knowledge of Cornwell's past books and her characters do not grow in any meaningful way,they actually de-volve instead of evolve. The author's previous Scarpetta book and her most recent are so absent mindedly written that I assume she has lost interest in this character and is ready to move on. The book ends abruptly and leaves the reader hanging and dissatisfied. The international flavor and romantic interest is forced and comes into the book as an after thought.Cornwell's best Scarpetta novels are the early ones and end with \\"From Potters Field\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop me before I finish this book","review":"I was about half way through the book before I realized I had never read a book where each character was more unhappy than the previous one.

I've read my share of mysteries and psychological thrillers to know, when I'm reading an exiciting, can't put this book down, book. This book was anything, but exciting. It was slow, tedious and it kept putting me to sleep. I couldn't read more than four or five pages, before I had to put the book down, because my mind wasn't on it. If this book is so boring, it makes me wonder about the beggining of the series. It didn't bother me that she is a Medical Examiner. I'm used to watching a British mystery series on A&E about a pathologist. I've watched an autopsy, so none of that stuff mattered. There was little plot and no character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Mysteries that I have read.","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. This is the first time I have read a novel written by this author, and it will not be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ!!","review":"Living in Australia, we're lucky because Black Notice was released here only a week ago, unlike in the US where it'll be release later! It took me 2 days to finish the book - reading it at work, at lunch and even in the bath!! Just one word to describe the book; its fantastic!!! A great read and denfinately a must for all crime fiction readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Even more unbelievable than the last. How has the earth managed to continue life as we know it before Kay and Lucy? PLEEEZ! Lucy is way too smart and pretty and computer-whizzed, blah blah blah. Oh and by the way, a lesbian. What is that about? I swore I wouldn't read another one of her books. She should have quit after the third - first three were very good. But they just get so outlandish and silly. Inane. Who cares? No more Cornwall for me - I swear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us an worthy ending PLEASE !!!","review":"For the past couple of novels, Cornwell has left me disappointed on how she ends her books, no buildup at all, just the killer popping up out of nowhere to try and kill our heroine, Kay Scarpetta. This book has been the worst yet. With 10 pages to go I'm wondering, where is this going??? I was very disappointed with Black Notice and hope that Cornwell becomes a little more creative on how to wrap up her stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Book","review":"This book was an overall good book. There were a few \\"harsh\\" moments. I don't think this outweighed the good of the book. The investigation of the murder was exciting and suspenseful. I do think that reading these books in order will better help with understanding the characters and their actions. I would definitely recommend reading the series of books, Point of Origin being the one written before this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Notice","review":"I WAS a big fan but I am not anymore. What happened to the ending? Did the publisher say you couldn't go over 470 pages? You could've left out the sex-that was totally unnessasary and you got alittle too technical on the medical-we're not reading a JAMA artical here. I wanted Loup-Garou to pick up Lucy's gun and end all their misery! I'm tried of the bickering, the overprotective aunt, the unwarrented sex, the omnipotent Dr Scarpetta. I hope in the \\"Last Precinct\\" it is the end and Kay either retires or gets killed. Patricia Cornwell needs to move on-she's pushed this character too far and me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in on past glory.","review":"A write must learn to end a series if they cannot keep up with strong and original plots. As a former admirer of Ms Cornwell, I am very disappointed in this book. The plot is so bizarre that it is difficult to take it seriously. There are too many references to a previous story-line (Benton) that is tiresome for those of us who have not read the Scarpetta series in chronological order, assuming that it was a recap of a previous book. The characters' flaws are so exaggerated that one wonders how sophisticated Scarpetta can even put up with a klutz like Marino, and why? Too many weird scenarios to count! Don't bother with this unless you are a die-hard fan of Scarpetta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Okay","review":"Having worked with pathologists and ME's in my life. I find them interesting people. I also like to read fiction starring their profession, regardless as to how far out from reality they may be. It's fiction, right?But this offering from Cornwell isn't her best work. The whole book felt like a rehash of old sections of previous work. Was it worth the read? I suppose. I read most of it on a plane when my expectations were pretty low when it came to entertainment so it was fine for me. But the murderer wasn't very compelling and the regualr characters from the series seemed warmed over and predictable.I like Cornwell's work, but this felt more mailed in than well-thought. Don't run out to get this one, but if you find it in the used paperback bin, it's worth picking up for a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating Amount of Detail","review":"I am normally a fan of Cornwell but this one is over the top. There is a LARGE amount of unnecessary detail in this book that makes you want to scream or at least keep turning the page until you get to a part that matters. The various plots jerk you around many times. The characters seem to say the same thing over and over again. I found the whole book frustrating to read and finished it in the hope that it would get better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kay at her worst?","review":"This one definitely wets your appetite for \\"the Last Precinct.\\" It was hard to put it down. Dr. Kay will always be my favorite Cornwell character and when Kay is at her worst, Cornwell's writing seems to be at it's introspective best."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough is enough","review":"I devoured the first Scarpetta books, but ever since Cause of Death, reading her books is continually disappointing. I mean come on a killer with excessive body hair, a warewolf? This is more like an X-File episode, and don't misunderstand me I love the X-Files. However, Scarpetta and Marino aren't Scully and Mulder! Also, like other reviewers have written I am little sick of the Lucy storyline.Quite honestly I think the best of Scarpetta is in the past. I am now on a new series by Dennis Lehane and it is absolutely fantastic! Try him instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Steady Decline in Quality","review":"As a faithful Cornwell reader, I cannot help but be discouraged by this most recent literary nosedive. The book is poorly executed, characters not fully developed, and the story line lacks Cornwell's usual spine-tingling twists and turns -- and ultimately a satisfactory conclusion. Can this reader be saved? Yes...if Cornwell's upcoming book is worth my time...but guaranteed I'll wait for paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last couple","review":"In general, I enjoyed this book. I think its story line was much better than the last couple Scarpetta stories, though I, like many others, am sick of the Lucy storyline. The main thing that disappointed me was the ending, how the wolfman gets to Scarpetta. Am I the only one who noticed the similarity between this ending and the one where someone is delivering her bags to her house?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too much space expended on Kay's personal problems.","review":"Kay is obsessed with the loss of Benton, acting as if it was just yesterday instead of a year ago, in fact, that pretty well is the main story. Cornwell needs to return to her action packed scenarios of previous titles and shy away from the psychological aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work and perhaps her worst","review":"Having read all of her books I must write to say how disapointed I was in her latest offering. The subplots are poor, the perp not believeable, and the ending awful. However, her writing about forensic medicine and the world of law enforcement is as good as ever but I think I have read it before. Maybe she has run out of fresh ideas and should take a break instead of tossing her readers a lean meatless bone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope this novel is not indicative...","review":"I'm a first time reader of Ms. Cornwell and this novel was very disapointing. The plot was fairly plausable, but there is were all reality stopped. Moreno appears in this book to be a stupid, blundering ass who's affiliation with anyone over an 80 IQ is totally unblieveable. I can't believe Kay's relationship with this dunderhead would last over five minutes in real life. Both her and Moreno's character wouldn't last over a day if their inputs to their supervisors were what went down in this novel. Example; Moreno's presence at a crime scene while on suspension. The police wouldn't let him anywhere near it.Since this is the first novel I've read by this author, I'm going to try one more to see if this one was just a fluke. Hope so, because the writing in this one is amateurish, with dumb dialog from every charater except the French doctor and the ATF Interpol liason agent.Well...we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book almost flat compared with previous books.","review":"The underlying feeling when reading this book was pull yourself to together and stick to a story, not the harping on Scarpetta's innermost feelings. Most of all I wish she would drop the character of her niece. Lucy is an unlikeable, petulant nothing. I have no interest in her at all and her constant moodiness. Cut away from her and the story line is okay. Winds up too fast and I ended the book feeling like the author suddenly tired of the whole thing - as did I.Think Cornwell is churning them out too fast and not lavishing the attention on the plot as she used to. I would advise others to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too introspective and lacking in mystery/suspense.","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and have truely enjoyed them...until this one. Kay Scarpetta spends fully two-thirds of the book in some kind of depression, absorbed with \\"personal\\" problems, and in a generally weakly written personal battle with another strong female character. This novel does neither woman any favors (nor does it do any favors to Patricia Cornwell). I would, frankly, guess that, unfortunately, production speed and \\"reaping the rewards\\" outweighed a substantial, well thought-out story."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of her characters have any redeaming qualities.","review":"Not up to her early novels, I found it very hard to get into.Her key characters have too many distracting problems that stray from the story line. Glad got the book from the local library, not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Cornwell tried but it doesn't work.","review":"Scarpetta was a truly fascinating character in the first book, but in \\"Black Notice\\", I believe she has become a self-absorbed excuse for a medical examiner-detective. And poor Marino! We knew he had problems and he was a sloppy dresser, etc., but Ms. Cornwell has completely stripped him of any likable traits. Lucy is a niece from Hell. And the storyline - unbelievable! If you don't know what to do with a character, kill her off! Please, Patricia, fire Scarpetta and end it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to read nor the money spent","review":"I urge Cornwell to take a break from writing and come back to us w/ a new, fresh story line. Unfortunately, this novel continues the downhill slide of Cornwell's characters. Convince us Cornwell that you still have a story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"I typically enjoy Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta character, but for some reason this book was a far cry from the usual enjoyable read. Perhaps it was the complete nonsense masquerading as a story, or the unbelievably boring details that constituted the alleged plot. Whatever the reason, upon finally finishing this painful waste of time, I literally tossed the book into the garbage. I not only wish I had my $5+ back, but also the 5+ hours of my life, wasted on this joke of a book. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simile and Metaphor Dramatized","review":"For readers who want a well-crafted suspense story, skip this immature, feeble attempt at mystery. In this particular selection, Kay Scarpetta is an emotional cripple as testified to by the rampant adjectives that describe her delicate condition post her lover's death. This novel was grossly disappointing because of its consistent use of similes that test the patience of any well-read reader. Similes are sprinkled everywhere as if someone wrote a prescription for this novel that ordered a certain amount making the work silly, almost laughable. For a professional cornoner, the main character is both unprofessional, consistently a blithering woman and hangs onto a detective, in Marino, who was grabbed out of the 1950's with his wisecracking, emotional outbursts, and immature and unprofessional behavior of a New York City dectective. Sorry, but this novel is just plain a waste of any intelligent reader's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in plot cliches","review":"I confess to having not read any earlier examples of the Kay S. series, but after this novel I am disinclined to try. The plot is so predictable it makes an epsode of the A-team look like Dickens, and the CME herself is a woeful example of author wish-fulfillment. There is no element of mystery in the entire book, except perhaps to wonder why anyone bothered to cut down the required trees. The characters frequent boozy flights of self-examination verge on humorous, other than that watch the worst TV detective show you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Notice","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books up to this point and have enjoyed them all. I did not, however, enjoy Black Notice. Rather than focusing on Dr. Scarpetta's work, there was WAY too much focus on who was out to get her. I want to read about the cases she solves, not all the black stuff that's going on in her own life. Some is OK, but not half the book. All of Cornwell's previous books were full of excitement, but Black Notice dragged on and on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps getting darker","review":"Black Notice is the beginning of the dark period for Patricia Cornwell. Don't get me wrong, I love serial killer books, but her books keep getting darker and darker - depressing to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"This book is so awful, I don't even know where to start. If I could give it no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort","review":"This is a really poor effort by Patricial Cornwell. If this had been the first book of Cornwell's that I had read, I would have been likely to not read any more books of hers. Instead of a good mystery, we are offered extreme details of office politics and a slow moving plot, with a B-movie climax. The characters are extremely caricaturized here, and there also is a lot of self-righteousness and self-declared vulnerability on the part of Scarpetta. Overall, this one can be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING-NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HER FORMER BOOKS!","review":"Patricia Cornwall has managed to turn this reader from one who could not wait for her next book to be released to one who is finished reading them. It may suprise her to learn that the sexual orientation of a person only clutters up a good story unless it has DIRECT bearing on the story being told. Lucy needs to get a life and grow up. I really miss the excitement of the her earlier books. I have found this nagging issue true of her last 3 novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's Well has run dry","review":"I've read all Cornwell's books - but, man, this is the last one. I thought the other series she does was boring, but Black Notice is not only poorly written it is as dull as a desk job.Maybe Cornwell could take her foot off the pedal for a couple of years - despite lost earnings (and judging from her alter ego Scarpetta, Cornwell now has Dollar Signs in her eyes). She is definitely in need of some new ideas.Harping on about Benton is pointless: Benton was boring. Giving the reader details about Lucy's sex life is pointless: Lucy is boring. The only two interesting characters, Scarpetta and Marino she has now reduced to caricatures. Cornwell wants the reader to see Scarpetta as a brilliant, incisive investigator - but she comes off as a paranoid harpy - a bit the way her creator comes off in interviews.And Scarpetta as dominatrix with her suddenly irresistible appeal to younger (but apparently gay) men? Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get some new ideas","review":"I was very excited when the new Scarpetta novel was released. I was very disappointed to find it the worst parts of all the previous books. In Southern Cross the Richmond PD was just cleaned up. How did a Diane Bray character arrive? If you don't know what to do with a character-just kill it off. Why is every killer personally after Scarpetta? When is Lucy going to grow up and start treating people with something more than hostility? The icing on the cake of this book was the \\"experienced\\" Scarpetta romancing. In the 14 years these books have covered she has only dated two people. A thirty year old is just too young for her-making him forty would have made the romance more plausible. Marino was treated so badly it was ridiculous. I won't be looking forward to a next book as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did she write it and why did I read it?","review":"Sadly, Cornwell continues the careless writing of what was once an absorbing series with good characters. In this book, Scarpetta has enemies at work ... again. A killer appears in her house ... again. Marino eats too much, smokes too much and is jealous ... again. Lucy is the world's unhappiest lesbian ... again. Kaye has almost the same fight with her sister as she did two or three books ago. This book has finally allowed me to break the habit of reading every book in a series and every book to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there's no zero-star rating......","review":"The skinny on Patricia Cornwell is that her first three Scarpetta novels were first rate and the rest aren't worth reading. Black Notice does nothing to alter this with it's poor plotting and characterization and emphasis on the characters' weepy angst. It's a shame, really. PC has so many loyal fans that anything she writes goes straight to the best-seller list and makes her another five million dollars, so why spend a lot of time on suspense, believable characters and tight plotting ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but a shoddy ending","review":"I loved this book up until the last 30 pages. I was totally sucked in, and then she had to go and blow it by writing a rotten ending. It was almost as if Ms. Cornwell was being forced into the ending. This book is a definate read, but if someone knows Ms. Cornwell tell her to let something bad happen to Kay once in a while, she is only human after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"This is one of the best books Cornwell has written. It focuses a lot more on Kay as a person than Kay the Medical Examiner. Although she is trying to solve a case it seems to be kind of the back story and the grief and pain she still feels over Benton's death seems to take center stage. I think it is one of her better books. You will have to pace yourself to keep from finishing it in one night."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the original Scarpetta - stay well clear.","review":"Kay Scarpetta was one of the most interesting characters to enter the crime fiction genre. Intelligent, strong, independent and complex - she found herself in superbly written and engaging plots. Not any more. The Scarpetta series has been losing quality over the last few books - this is definitely a continuation of that trend. The characters that inhabit this book are cardboard cut outs of their former selves. There is no snappy dialog, no witty exchanges or brilliant, inspired detective work. Everything happens by the numbers - the only surprise this book delivers is whether you can bear to finish it. The characters, plots and climaxes are getting tired - do yourself a favour - steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book Review","review":"Disappointing. This was the first of the series that I read. I couldn't figure out the background so I never got into the story. The end wrapped up too quickly and then just dropped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleckkkkk!","review":"EEE GADZ! What happened? Anyone speak non-sequitur-ese here? This was an angry novel which depicts Kay Scarpetta as an unhappy, nasty, witch with a B. This patchwork does not work. I am disappointed, I truly love this author and the stock characters. Kay Scarpetta needs a vacay."},{"rating":"1","title":"AOL?","review":"Cornwell writes light books that are best read \\"books on tape\\" style. I like them, they are what they are. She seems to know a lot about forensic medicine, but not much else. Only in her books would Smith and Wesson make a seven shot revolver or an educated person (let alone an entire self respecting health department) use AOL. Outside of these little flights of fancy, it's a cool little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful book until the ending","review":"I was extremely disapointed with the ending of this book. I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and this one was.... oh, I don't know. I enjoyed the book until the end. There was all this talk about the killer and horrible they were... yadda yadda... And then when they do catch him it's like \\"Oh well, here he is and don't we feel sorry for him and please don't shoot him\\". It just seemed to be a MAJOR letdown. I'm not sure if I plan to read more Scarpetta books or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"puzzled","review":"Could not figure out the opening letter from roasted lover. How did he know his future?

All of the emotions become real as you read them. After reading the Black Notice I am waiting breathlessly for the release of THE FINAL PRESINCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not up to her previous books","review":"Cornwell's earlier books were much better written than this one. I wish she would go back to the days when her books were based on real crimes committed in VA. Those were her best books. Also, her work needs better editing. There are typos throughout, and somebody from Richmond (i.e., Cornwell) should know how to spell Shockoe (NOT Shockhoe). Plot seemed contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, less whining, more suspense","review":"I read Black Notice yesterday, and was pretty frustrated. Thebook jacket talks about a transatlantic mystery, but why does it take3/4 of the book to get to France? Because we need to hear about how everyone is out to get Kay (again). I keep reading this series hoping that it will return to form (see Postmorten), but it's just getting more sloppy. At one point, Cornwell tells about how bacteria are breaking down the Container man's cell walls. Cell walls? Didn't she learn in high school that only plants have cell walls? One example of how she doesn't care enough to put enough thought and effort into a medical mystery plot. Doesn't she know that most serial killers are not freaks of nature, and the fact that they are generally perceived as just like you and me is much more scary than anything she has conjured up in a while?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please!!!","review":"\\"Oh, Please!\\" is what you'll say when the identity of the serial killer is revealed in the end.

But, I recommend that you do not read this one even if someone gives it to you, free. The book is very disjointed and predictable. Pass this one up -- trust me, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a rest before writing the next Scarpetta installment","review":"After reading \\"Black Notice,\\" I felt I should call the NYPD to see if Cornwell is holding a gun to her editor's head to force publication of yet another whiny, confused, poorly edited and ultimately infuriating Scarpetta novel. Readers of series do enjoy growing with continuing characters, but just as in the one preceding this volume, \\"old\\" characters are plopped in without adequate introduction, thus mystifying new and less-devoted readers as to the details of previous actions and hence the effect on present motivations. Cornwell needs to take a long rest before tackling any more Scarpetta volumes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, dreadful and sophomoric dribble","review":"I've read all of the Kay Scarpetta novels.

Really is too bad, can't think of an author who's books I have always looked forward to reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Has All the Mystery Gone?","review":"Predictable if you read her last 3 novels! We are first introducted to the sexual orientation of each character which really clutters up the plot. Was the plot of this novel to lead to a new life for Kay as a New Yorker who will be free to be herself! Notice how all the men in her books get killed off? It is ashame as her previous books were so good and she needs to learn to let Lucy grow up and that we do not care what the character's sexual orientation is as long as it's not necessary to the plot. Definately my last Patricia Cornwell book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this isn't writing, it's typing.","review":"This is as maudlin a book as can be. Most of the time the characters are weeping: Kay cries when she gets a love note from the grave, Marino cries when Kay abuses him, Lucy cries when Kay cries which makes Jo cry over Lucy which makes Jo's parents cry over sin. Kay's stud muffin cries when Kay tells him not to love her, which makes her misty, which enrages Marino to tears. Benton doesn't cry because he's dead. And the werewolf doesn't cry or speak, which is too bad because he's the only interesting figure in the book. Other than that the coincidences are cukoo, Ms. Cornwell promoted a nice expense-paid trip for herself to Paris on the Concorde out of this and we have the usual Tom Clancy imitation of arcania covering up that which is really dreary detail. As her last book suggested, Ms. Cornwell is out of gas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens in Most of Book","review":"This book just follows the life of Kay Scarpetta round and round, all her usual cronies and loves but I haven't heard about the murders since the very beginning. I've forgotten what the book is about. And some say there is 'blue' language. I'd call it 'black', and you must tolerate M___F__ing on every single page, times 3, the whole book, plus extra G-D-ing, blasphemy,etc, and the only thing I haven't had to endure is a sex scene--thank goodness. Not done yet, though. Am close to the end, and this book is so boring, it's hard to get there. I don't believe Cornwell even wrote this book. It doesn't have her flow because of the constant profanities, like jarring bumps in the road, and sounds as if it is written by a younger person who is used to including constant profanities in their own language. If she has a good story, why can't she just put it together and make it a relaxing read? It makes me wonder, 'Who wrote this?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coroner, my life in print.","review":"Very disappointing, unlike her other books, we spend the whole book in Kay's mind, who is the Diva here?

Plus, several unanswered questions, Why was the body put in the container? among others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought this in the airport..should've stuck with USA Today","review":"The willing suspension of disbelief is something with which I'm fairly generous when it comes to recreational reading. But not here. Irrational dialogue and behavior. Scarpetta and Marino take turns acting as if they in need of a serious medication regimen. The plot lacks credibility. When will this series have a strong male character? The ending....well, was there really an ending or did the author get as tired writing this stuff as I did reading it? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly done repeat of earlier work.","review":"There was little original in this book. The subplot of a power struggle that involves the sabotage of Kay's career by computer- was straight out of Postmortem. Kay's identifying a genetic disorder in the villian by a description of how he smells, straight out of Postmortem again. The final showdown as the killer invades Kay's home aftr she stupidly opens the door- straight out of Body of Evidence. And pretty close to the final scene in Postmortem. Frankly, its an insult to the readers memories- the only new thing here is the younger man/older woman romance and thats a pretty minor part of the book since the character development of the man is so shallow. Don't waste your time reading this, Postmortem tells the same story but does an infinitely better job. In that book the characers are fairly well developed and likable, here all the characters are just pale shadows of their incarnations in previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Patricia Cornwell thinking?","review":"I am still trying to figure this whole thing out. Was this book supposed to be about a crime-solving mystery or whiny soap opera with a mixture of Days of Our Lives and Melrose Place mixed in together? There was so much WHINING and relationship problems in this book that it drove me crazy! This book does not live up to all of the other Scarpetta novels at all. Here are my suggestions to Mrs. Cornwell- Kill that little annoying niece Lucy, have Mrs. Scarpetta stop whining and blabbering about poor Benton and stop making Marino look like a stupid drunk. I certainly hope \\"The Last Precinct\\" is better than this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a story!","review":"The reader reviews are more entertaining and sometimes better written than the book.I got hung up on details like the license plate number on pp 132-133, and the proofreading was bad. But the book read like a cartoon, reminding me of A Man in Full. Southern cartoon characters. Plot? What plot? She got a free ride to France to have the villain handed to her? \\"Oh yeah, we knew all about him?\\" I was kind of hoping that Loveable Lucy would just empty her Glock at everyone during the hurry-up conclusion.I also think Talley went after Kay because he was attracted to Lucy and got nowhere. Sloppily written and hopefully not a window into the author's experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly awful","review":"I have been a big fan of this series, but this book reads like a high school student trying to write a term paper due the next day. The backbiting and soap opera behavior of the characters and the plodding plots make this book extrememly tedious. The only enjoyable parts of the book were the ones dealing with the technical aspects of forensic work. Other descriptive words that come to mind are: depressing, sophmoric, lurching, disjointed and melodramatic. I do hope that this book was just a temporary lapse on the part of Ms. Cornwell and that she will produce something more palatable next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new nadir for the Scarpetta series","review":"Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books have been slipping for quite a while, and this one's reached a new nadir.

Unfit even for airplane consumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta's sorry life makes for a sorry novel","review":"Get a life, Dr. Scarpetta! This book takes place a good year after the death of her lover and significant other and she is still moaping around feeling sorry for herself. The story is bad. The plot is poor. The ending not soon enough. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen??","review":"I have read every one on Ms. Cornwell's books and I have to say that she has always kept me enthralled. Not this time! Other then the characters being the same I would have to say that this novel was written by someone else. It is possible that she needs to find another cast of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"After reading 250 pages or so I was thinking to myself, \\"this is really slow. Everything I've read so far could be summed up in a paragraph or two.\\" I was expecting something really exciting to happen but as I got to within a few pages of the end I realized I had been let down. It seemed P.C. wanted to end the book in a hurry and just let it go. I prefer Jeffrey Deaver's books. You know with his books you're in for a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the First is the Worst","review":"This is the first time a have read a Cornwell novel. I hope my first time reading her is my worst experience with her novels because I will soon embark on reading three more of her novels.The sub-plots in this work, if they can even be considered sub-plots, add virtually nothing to the story line. And the addition of segments about Ms Scarpettas dead former lover, also add absolutely nothing more than adding pages. In reality these are all put in to thicken the book. If Ms Cornwell were to be honest with us, she woud admit that this \\"novel\\" could have been easily reduced to a short story.The ending is extremely disappointing. We learn nothing of what makes the killer tick. I would suggest that you selct any other novel to read. Don't waste your time on this one. Come to think of it, I should have rated this book as one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bad language!","review":"I had heard that this book was much better so I took a chance and read it and was totally repulsed by the constant bad language. It is totally not needed and distracted from the story. It just shows that the author has a limited language to pull from when the same words are continually used. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Promises","review":"Hi, this is my first review ever and I felt I need to write one to do justice on spending my time reading the Black Notice - to make something fruitful outta it. This is also my first Patricia Cornwell book read.Overall, I felt that more suspense can be built into catching this \\"werewolf\\" than to circle around sub-plots which seems to make the book tiresome. When I was onto page 255, I almost gave up as our Dr Kay wasn't making much progess in identifying this \\"werewolf\\". The remaining of the pages happened in such a split second, that does not gives me the pleasure of anticipation and excitment (if any, was worn up at page 255). The climax of the book. that is, when the werewolf was capture - 2 to 3 pages? - didn't build up enough suspense to make my money worth..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up!","review":"I have been a fan of the Scarpetta novels for years and have read every one.

It's time to do something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Scarpetta to Retire","review":"In this new--and tired--Kay Scarpetta thriller, Kay's on a case that could ruin her career, or end her life (we could only hope). The story is given a shot of Romance/Horror drivel with a love letter from beyond the grave. Pleeaazzzeee. It's time for Ms. Cornwell to move on to other characters--this series has become stale reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality it was advertised as","review":"As I said before, this book was so yellowed around the edges of every page.

Maybe this is a warning of what happens when you're successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her usual","review":"I have read almost all of Cornwall's book's and found this one to not be very exciting. The depressing mood and the lack of any exciting events made me want to stop reading it several times. However, I finished it only to be extremely irritated by the ending. Maybe the next one will be back to Cornwall's usual standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A closer look at the real Dr. Kay Scarpetta.","review":"This book was not as graphic as some of the others, but, no situations are the same. We need to know that Dr. Scarpetta is a real person dealing with real grief. Sometimes job situations tend to be forgotten about in our grief, just as Kay's did. The \\"werewolf\\" explanation was a little out there, but, maybe it was useful in the coming out of one's shell and bringing everything to the surface. Patrica Cornwell is an excellent author, who's brilliance shines through intrigue and suspense.I look forward to reading the next Kay Scarpetta novel. Keep up the good work, Patricia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable, unstimulating.","review":"I was glad to see the return of the Kay Scarpetta character, but the story never really grabbed me at all and I knew the guy was at the door way before she did. I stuck it out to the end hoping there would be some twist, but nothing. I have read all of her books and sorry to say, I am ready to move on. I felt like Patricia Cornwell wrote the story without her heart and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring......","review":"Scarpetta fans alert! This is one to avoid at all costs. This is a scattered plot that is all over the map. I feel Cornwall must have been under a contract deadline with this one. Never cared for the Lucy/Aunt Kay filler and this time its really at its worst. The romance interest falls flat too. A lot of descriptive gore that really goes nowhere. Thumbs way down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"Unfortunately for Patricia Cornwell fans, she appears to have run out of fresh ideas for plots involving Kay Scarpetta. This time it seems plausible that Cornwell's publisher wanted a book by a certain date so she delivered. Too bad, because the plot is poor, geographic details are inaccurate, character development is non-existant, and the dialogue is frenetic. For anyone who has grown to care about Kay, Lucy and Marino and who cried at Benton's demise, do yourself a favor: pass on Black Notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was very excited to start reading Black Notice, but as once I started I was very disappointed with it. I usually love all of Patricia Cornwell's books. This book had potential to be a great book but it went down hill with the more you read. The ended was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired material","review":"It seems as if the author has gotten lazy over the last few Scarpetta books. The characters have become really annoying. This book was not enjoyable. Disappointing since the early books were so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It appears that Cornwell has lost a fine editor.","review":"This book is so loosely written, so disjointed, so poorly edited for both grammar and flow, with conversational lines that start nowhere and end in exactly the same place, one has to wonder if Cornwell owes the higher quality of her previous work to an outstanding editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another perfunctory effort from Patricia Cornwell.","review":"This is the last Cornwell book that I will buy. Her last few Scarpetta novels have been heavy on the personal angst of her continuing characters, and VERY light on the mystery and suspense. If I want to read about lost loves, dysfunctional family relationships and May/December romances I will buy a Jackie Collins or Danielle Steele novel. Out of 315 pages, about 200 plus are devoted to Kay and all her troubled relationships, and less than 100 to the \\"loup garou\\". The ending is so predictable and perfunctory, I had to force myself to read the last 15 pages. For those of you who like to read suspense novels featuring a continuous character, I recommend John Sandford or Dennis Lehayne. They both are still putting the suspense aspect of their novels first, instead of dwelling on the histrionics of annoying characters, like Ms. Cornwell. I'm sorry Kay, but this is it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not her best","review":"This much awaited edition of the Kay Scarpetta series was a little farfetched but still worth the time & energy to read. I couldn't put it down like all of her other books. The ending was a bit forced and leaves you wishing for a more developed and more plausible ending. Hopefully the characters will all get it together after this novel. They are all still grieving over Benton. It's time to move on. Obviously Kay did! Now it's time for Marino & Lucy to do the same. Hopefully the next book will find the three doing less bickering and more crime fighting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Amen to reviewer D. Miller! Disappointing. I can believe that Captain Marino remains emotionally stuck in the mud, but I can't believe the improbable villains, or that the Scarpetta character becomes increasingly emotionally fragile, rather than more mature. This growing immaturity seems the chief driving force of the plot, and just doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing a Favorite Series Author","review":"When the author of a favorite series dies, favorite characters also die, leaving a void that's not easy to fill. But one can always reread the old books and enjoy the stories and the characters again.What has happened to the Kay Scarpetta series is worse than the author ceasing to write. With each recent novel, and especially with Black Notice, the main characters (Kay, Lucy, Marino) have become so loathsome and the plots so unengaging that I can't imagine wanting to revisit the earlier novels. These are unpleasant people and I will not miss them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of too many story lines","review":"As an avid Scarpetta reader, I was disappointed with Black Notice. There were too many subplots with the characters, and I found that the main plot of the book (i.e., trailing the \\"werewolf\\") was virtually put aside until the midpoint of the book. The climax of the book was anticlimatic, and ill-contrived. Please bring back the strong, tough Scarpetta that we all love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this novel especially since it was so anticipated. I felt that Kay was very whiney, Lucy is going out of control and Marino is just unbelievable. I also did not get even a tiny thrill of fear throughout the entire book. I hope her next book is more along the lines of the classic Kay Scarpetta that I have come to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be worse","review":"What starts out as a reasonably intriguing mystery spins out of control over the final hundred pages or so, into a ridiculous ending. Lucy (AKA supergirl) & her new gal G.I. Jo are trying to shut down a gun-smuggling operation down in Florida & somehow it's all connected to the case back in VA. Isn't that amazing... Then we have Scarpetta and Marino flying off to Paris to meet w/ an Interpol agent & only Scarpetta can help Interpol solve their case. Naturally the VA case is related to these cases in France. Oh I particularly love the afternoon randevú w/ a man almost 1/2 her age while in Paris (NOT).Glad I got the book from the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Writer?","review":"Another disappointment from Cornwell, I am wondering if she has employed a ghost writer to whom she gives the plot and nothing else. I will not be wasting my money on any more of her books. 2 bad ones in a row is 2 too many"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Notice Worst Book of the Year","review":"Black Notice had to be one of the most unpleasant books that I have ever read. I enjoyed the earlier books in this series - they were well written and researched, and Kay Scarpetta was edgy in an interesting sort of way. Unfortunately, she has devolved into a narcisistic, paranoid shrew with delusions of grandeur, and her sidekicks, especially Marino, are equally self-involved and obnoxious. The books are not particularly well written anymore - Cornwell seems to be grinding them out with no editorial guidance. At least she seems to have gotten over her gun fetish, but these books have become nasty and meanspirited, with little to recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, A Disappointment","review":"I've always enjoyed the Cornwell/Scarpetta books. Unfortunately, Black Notice disappoints on many levels. One other review noted the abundance of angry, bitter characters. I couldn't agree more. There was no relief from the anger. Perhaps this would have been bearable, however, this book simply is not well-written. The plot lines are disjointed, the flow is bad, buildup to certain scenes barely existed. Let's hope the next outing brings back some of the suspense as well as making the reader actually care about the characters again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've always loved the Scarpetta books, but if this had been the first one I wouldn't have read more. It's not just that the personal interaction seems to take precedence over the actual crime, or that the mood is horribly dark. It's that none of the plots in this are very well developed. Although there's a lot of time spent on the plot against Kay and her friend Marino, the motivation behind the plot wasn't very believable, at least to me. The introduction of Kay's new boyfriend gave that part of the book the tone of a bodice-ripper starring Fabio. And even the crime itself was easily solved with tips from the Kay's French counterpart - almost a deus ex machina solution. I will try to avoid reading Cornwell's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves stars minus","review":"What a big stink. Definitely give this a miss. Patricia what happened to you?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for one of my favorite authors.","review":"I have read everything Patricia Cornwell has written. This starts out very intriguing and leads up to a wonderful climax and then falls \\"flat\\". More of a wham-bam-no-thank-you ending. In comparison with her previous writings, this books falls very shot of her wonderful skill. It does not show here. Kay Scarpetta is mean and cold. Lucy has turned into some hard-core maniac and the reasoning is NOT believeable. It is time to let go of personal anger and bring back the characters that she is capable of writing about. Very disappointed, but will keep trying her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on track","review":"Patsy Cornwall is back on track in the latest Scarpetta novel. Once again, she does a great job of delving into the psyche of her characters. I was worried after her last book, because it was \\"thinly\\" written. I hope she is working on development of the next Scarpetta relationship and forensic case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown","review":"Rarely have I found a book utterly distasteful, but this one is the exception. I've read all of Cornwell's novels and have generally enjoyed them--up to this one. I was looking forward to a good read, and all I got was this.Enough mewling about the niece and the dead lover! Get back to basics, Ms. Cornwell. And lay off all the meaningless details. If a good editor had taken about 100-150 pages of padding out of this, it might have been okay, although the plot is just a wee bit far-fetched. Maybe more than a wee bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I just finished its 320 pages in under 24 hours. Her stories are always all-consuming.While a few critics seems to be dissappointed in the emotions of her characters, it seems to make them more real to me. Of course, Kay Scarpetta and all of Benton's friends would grieve. I would have been shocked if Patricia Cornwell had not addressed his death in this way and everyone went on with business and lives as usual.As for the \\"crime du jour\\", I loved all the twists, turns and sub-plots and the manner in which Cornwell knits everything together. The ending was brief and somewhat predictible, but hey, how many ways are there really to catch a criminal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reads like a body blow to the stomach!","review":"This is a great read! First, it's nice to read about someone who isn't blond, in great shape, and under 30! Scarpetta is more \\"real\\" here than in any previous works. So what if there are some untidy loose ends? After reading the reviews, all I can conclude is that this book provokes intense feelings. After reading the book, I conclude that it was \\"worth the candle.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-rated author has competition! Leah Ruth Robinson!!!","review":"If you liked this book by Patricia Cornwell, a brilliant author and a magnificent wordsmith, then you'll like Leah Ruth Robinson as well. You've probably read all there is to read by Cornwell. If so, then give Robinson a try. A chiller of a thriller, she's just as right-on, sharp, and gutsy. Cornwell had better watch out. Robinson is right behind her! Whenever a book by either one of these top-notch authors comes out, I'm up all night reading! You should be too. Give Robinson a shot. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell. I've written in to loudly and clearly praise her Winter Table book when everyone else hated it. However, this book was terrible. I was so enthusiastic when I got it and couldn't wait to read it. But, it had no point...it just seemed to fly around from place to place and the so-called feelings were just dumb. She was up, she was down, she was all over the place and I was throughly disapointed. Please, Patricia, get back to your usual books. The great ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very disappointing.","review":"I was quite disappointed. This book doesn't come close to her earlier efforts. It was disjointed and there were sections that didn't make any sense at all. Perhaps she should start a new series with new characters. Enough of the old gang, especially LUCY."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Scarpetta followers won't be disappointed...","review":"Cornwell satisfies me again with another addition to the Scarpetta series. I thoroughly enjoy her writing, detail, and characters, and was not let down with her latest. She leaves me yearning for the next Scarpetta novel. As far as Cornwell's non-Scarpetta books, I could do without them...to me they are a waste of her time...she could be writing another Scarpetta, not an off 'subject' I will not read.(after making the mistake of reading one). Overall, Black Notice sits you down and keeps you reading. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Stay away from this one. It's hard to be specific about thisbook's many deficiencies without giving away plot twists, but: Can'tCornwell invent a believable criminal any longer? Motivation and forensic-pathology procedures are given short shrift; Scarpetta herself goes two-dimensional. This is most manifest in the pallid, watery descriptions of Kay's heterosexual activity. Coded and overt lesbianism, however, luridly and lovingly takes center stage. Put it this way: If this were the first Kay Scarpetta mystery you picked up, you'd never pick up another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"I am a great fan of Patricia Cornwell and have read all her books to date. The latest Black Notice was disturbing to me due to the depressiveness of the characters and the amount of foul and vile language on the part of the main characters. I purchased the book unabridged in audio format and was driving to Richmond with my teenage daughter and both of us were excited about listening to the book. I was shocked by the language coming over the speakers in the car, and embarrassed in front of my daughter. The language was so disgusting, vile, and foul on the part of Dr. Scarpetta, and Capt. Marino that I will no longer purchase any new works of Cornwell. Furthermore, I will tell everyone I come in contact with how disappointed I am with the new book. It truly is a shame that a great storyteller such as Ms. Cornwell would have employ such language to get across the painful emotional state of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corpses Aren't the Only Folks Who Need to Chill","review":"Apparently Patricia Cornwell has never met a character she actually liked. Even her protagonists are irrasible and paranoid to the point that they can't get along with each other for more than five minutes without blowing up, storming out or otherwise behaving like emotionally stunted two-year-olds. It's unusual to enjoy a mystery and its solution without experiencing the slightest affinity for the people involved, but that's the way I feel reading Cornwell's books. Given the choice of hanging out with the good doctor, Superniece, and their friends or the unfortunate victims in the morgue, I'd choose the latter; at least they know how to stay calm and cool under pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, depressing, bitter and below par","review":"I've enjoyed nearly all of the Scarpetta books since Body Farm, which was the first I read. But what a letdown this book was! It is dark, brooding, angry, bitter and -- just in case you still think you'll like it -- boring. After Cornwell became disillusioned with the FBI (in Point of Origin) she lost her focus. Worse, she seems to have lost the enjoyment of writing, and passes that mood on to her readers. None of the characters seems true to form. Marino is angry, Lucy is spoiled and selfish, and even Scarpetta's colleagues seem to be tiring of the good doctor. Never mind the plot ... you know you're in trouble when Cornwell has to resolve the mystery by having the prime suspect literally walk up to Scarpetta's front door. (Don't worry, I haven't given anything away -- you'll see this coming from 50 pages away). If you're a dedicated Scarpetta fan, you may find this book too gloomy. If you're new to the series, start with one of the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaching for storylines","review":"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels, and have read all of them. The last few (this one included) seem to be reaching for storylines. There's always a \\"bad guy\\", other than the murderer the heroine is after. Someone within Scarpetta's office or within the police department who's out to get her. And all of these \\"bad guys\\" are so jealous of the world-famous Dr. Scarpetta. Come on! These story lines have little or nothing to do with the main theme of the book and really detract from the story. I, for one, preferred the earlier Scarpetta novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta getting unbelievable...","review":"Unfortunately I didn't happen to read the reviews of this book before reading it, otherwise I might have thought twice about it. This was my first disappointment with one of Patricia Cornwell's books. I probably would have read the book regardless, since I like the character. Unfortunately, however, I will now wait and read the reviews of the next book before I spend my time on it. Most of the book was as an enjoyable read, however I was extremely disappointed in the ending of the book. The end seemed completely out of character for Dr. Scarpetta and totally unbelievable. My first thought was that it was a rush job in order to get it to press. Actually, I'm hoping that is the case as there didn't seem to be much thought or originality in the finale. If this is a sign of things to come, then I'll regretfully have to pass on the future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black notice and betes noires","review":"Once again Kay Scarpetta is pitched against the hidden monster with some arcane disorder; once again she is flung between law enforcement agencies both compelling and corrupt; once again she is threatened and vulnerable. But will she once again triumph? Here is Patricia Cornwell at her political best: she has matured as a writer and brings to the reader a consideration of the investigative process more developed than the early days of a few cobbled together FBI profiles. In Black Notice, Scarpetta has become smarter than her mentors and tutors: but is she smarter than the beasts, both real and remembered, that pursue her? Readers should not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have Cornwell and Scarpetta Gone?","review":"Patricia Cornwell has been one of my favorite authors in recent years, so when a friend praised Black Notice as vintage Cornwell, I bought it immediately. However, I struggled to get through it - not vintage Cornwell at all. The characters we have come to know so well seemed to have no redeeming qualities and that includes Kay! There was an overall negativity about this whole book with heavy focus on Benton's death. The average reader does not want to wade through technical medical terms, gore and very angry and filthy dialogue. A grieving Kay would not jump into bed having known the guy for a day! Lucy just can't be trigger happpy and out for revenge. And Marino just can't have deteriorated to the degree she has painted him. He, however, was the only one with any common sense and foresight. The plot was a stretch - is she running out of content material? So, no more Cornwell for me! I see there's are new one out in July but it won't land on my bookshelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"paranoid....tired characters....too much worn out angst","review":"I was a huge fan at the beginning of this series. I have now gotten weary of Kay's grief over a man she never seemed to have time for when he was alive and which seems entirely insincere and shallow now. Lucy's continued angst over her sexuality and inability to be anything but a neurotic, violent brat has also gotten tiresome and boring. Marino is the only character I still have any sympathy for but how much blustering and overeating can one character do and continue to be believable. The trend for these folks to be put in more and more untenable political situations in their work has also been overdone. Are we to believe that the state of Virginia only hires unscrupulous, self-serving criminals in everyone of their senior positions, except for the righteous Kay of course. I am sorry to say this is the end of the line for me....I will not buy or read any more in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful,far fetched,dull and boring","review":"Ms. Cornwell needs to put her Dr. Scarpetta books to rest. They have become so predictable. Could anyone not figure out the ending? Her new love is so hard to believe that it's ridiculous,and we are constantly being assaulted by Marino's foul mouth and stupid behaviour.When will Ms. Cornwell come up with an origional story? She's rehashing the same old thing over and over. Thankfully I got this book out of the library and didn't waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Kay Scarpetta?","review":"I am an avid Patricia Cornwell reader but my interest dims with each new book. True fans will be very disappointed by this latest Kay Scarpetta installment. This book is poorly written, the dialogue is wooden and trite, the characters don't have nearly the depth she usually provides, and the new love interest is a total fraud, not Kay's type at all (what the heck was wrong with Benton? That was a great storyline!). I also could have done without the romance novel scenes, and Ms. Cornwell shouldn't try to write them - not her forte! Even her villains are boring and predictable now, and her forensic pathology research and descriptions are weak. \\"Black Notice\\" was clearly written to satisfy a book contract and doesn't even come close to the quality of her early work. Ms. Cornwell should re-read \\"Postmortem\\" and revisit the writer she used to be before she attempts the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jacket blurb seduced me, but the novel betrayed me.","review":"Teh jacket's description of the plot sounded as if this novel was going to be more of a murder mystery than the last few books about Scarpetta have been. If I wanted to read about characters' emotional problems, I would go read a work of general fiction. When I buy a mystery, I expect that the main point of the story is solving the mystery -- not having to wade through characters' angst and personal problems. Now, yes, those can be written so as to be key to the plot. But they weren't in this novel. I WON'T be sucked in again by a misleading jacket description. And I won't be buying any more books by Patricia Cornwell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All of Cornwell's plots read the same","review":"I think I've read all of her books, but I am not sure. When I read this one I was struck by an overwhelming sense of deja vu -- I've read this before. Then I pulled up a list of Cornwell's books and realized that in spite of the fact that I've read them all, I couldn't tell them apart. The plot are entirely indistinguishable."},{"rating":"1","title":"formulaic, disappointing, mean-spirited and joyless","review":"Unfortunately, one can see Cornwell straining to continue the Scarpetta series, when she should be performing a post mortem on the characters involved. There is no sense of urgency, only a sense of overwhelming doom and gloom as Scarpetta becomes more bitter, Lucy becomes more of a \\"girls with guns\\" stereotype and Marino -- well at least he hasn't changed. The plot is beyond farfetched. I am not pleased and sadly I was rather bored"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, this is a 'no star'","review":"Senile dementia vulgaris continues at Putnam's with a new Cornwell Scarpetta. Not their fault I guess, as people seem willing to pay for this. A series in its midlife that was excellent, has turned into an angry ( the primary theme for the first 90 pages is comic book angst) poorly researched (a morgue attendant has recently died of smallpox) potboiler of only the lukest of warm water.

I can't read another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Benton Wesley!!!","review":"I've just recently become a fan of this series about Kay Scarpetta and I have read in just the last two months all the previous books with her as the central character. I felt the interaction between Scarpetta and Pete Marino and Benton Wesley was the key to why I so enjoyed reading this series. I read fiction to be entertained and, hopefully, feel good after I've finished the book, but that's not the case with Point of Origin and Black Notice. If I want to be depressed, I can read the newspaper! I don't care what has to be done in the way of plot contrivance -- just bring back Benton Wesley and make Scarpetta the decent woman she once was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but well worth reading","review":"I received this book in the mail and finished it the same evening. I loved how Cornwell portrayed Kay's feelings and thoughts about Benton. I felt myself wishing that her hopes were correct, that he was still out there. I wasn't a big fan of the romantic liasion, but in the story, it fit. The story was very interesting, but I feel there were some loose ends that Cornwell failed to tie up.

Between sets, Jane's drummer sat next to me in the small venue and I told him, \\"You guys have a nice sound.\\" And that's certainly the case. \\"Tapping the Wheel\\" is a delightful album all the way through, from the optimistic \\"Horizons\\" to the weary and wistful \\"Carry Him.\\" Jane's lilting voice and down-to-earth lyrics set up an interesting counterbalance to one another.

(Listen to Jugulator, you'll see why) White was very good on this, which is stronger than Attack, the previous cd. \\"The Bogeyman\\" is classic Rising Force, as is the title track.

Yngwie was right on track through this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old crap, only difference is the album cover","review":"Why on earth this Neo-classical \`play as fast as I can' stuff is still ever popular beggars belief. Yngwie Malmsteen seems to be stuck in a time zone, were it is okay to play the same solos, the same riffs and rhythms over and over and over again, album after album. Surely he must be getting bored with his own playing by now? You could imagine the outcry if Eddie Van Halen re-leased eruption over and over again, or if even Vinnie Moore, Steve Vai of Greg Howe played the same solos over and over again, but this is the difference with these guitarists in that they experiment and move with the times. As for the songs on this album, they are once again weaker than weak. I think it is time Yngwie either learnt some new scales and changed his playing or quit, because I personally think his music nowadays is duller than dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I totally agree with the reviews that state this album is duller than dull. YJM is one of the most repetitive and boring guitarists out there.

When is this man going to realise that the Public are bored sh**less of this stuff. People use to say that Malmsteen was one of the best guitarists in the world, but after his fourth album they started to realise that all this man can do is play heartless speed runs in the same friggin key all the time, and only in his tiny mind will he ever be regarded as one of the greats. Neo-classical rock is dead and as for the lyrics on this album they are just pathetic. All I can say is that this album demonstrates for the umpteenth time that YGM is unable to progress out of the Eighties, or write anything of commercial original quality. So the only Nerds that will like this album are the really simple ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Rock","review":"The same music pattern, the same tunes, the same melodies, the same beat - nothing new. Yngwie is exhausted. He reuses the same music over and over again. This is frustrating and annoying. He is such a great talanted musician but now he's stuck at the dead end of the street and cannot find the way out.Nobody in the rock music can match up with Ritchie Blackmore. All his albums are perfect of some degree and always contains new conceptual music ideas, new tunes, new melodies, new vocals - he is never the same not a bit. He is open to changes and is always searching for new ways in the music path. He is indeed genius and great in the music art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malmsteen once again unleashes bordom","review":"Malmsteen has once again released the same record 23 years in succession.

Yngwie just gets so tiresome. I respect his speed, but man, USE A DIFFERENT IDEA ONCE IN A WHILE!! Same arpeggiated choruses, same harmonic minor solos, same beats. And I haven't even heard this album, I'm just assuming that's what it sounds like based on the last 20 years of his material. I guess you can't teach an old dog (with a big a** gut) new tricks.

It's hard to put my finger on exactly what I don't like: there is a freewheeling energy derived from a mix of rock, blue grass, and Zydeco. The songs are generally up-tempo and the band, if not always tight, is spirited.But after one last listen, the more I realize I'll never play this CD again. I don't have a high tolerance for fiddle or zydeco to begin with, so what others might dub infectious, I find irritating, especially when the fiddle is sawing away and the band seems to be going through the motions.Something seems wrong here,like drinking stout in the sun.

Of special importance is the refuting of the social darwinistic doctrine of temporal retribution (which is the belief that people are rewarded or punished during their lives based on their sins). The theological arguments are rather complex, but are explained so clearly that they are easy to understand. While Gutierrez makes a connection between the message of the Book of Job and poverty in Latin America, this theme could have been expanded upon more in the book. All in all, this book is a very interesting read and is a must for those who wish to understand the Book of Job."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulky","review":"small opening in the eyepiece makes the use of this counterproductive, as your eye needs to actually get closer to the piece.

Ultimately I don't use it anymore, you lose a small percentage of the view finder with the adapter on it, and considering that most dSLRs (i use d200) are 95% of the actual sensor/image area to begin with, losing another 5% is not how I want to be shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful focus aid","review":"A little magnification of the ocular aids precise focusing.

No cut off edge.also disadvantageThe sharpness slighly decrese. I see a very little overlaping image in the middle across from top to bottom. My eye must close to the viewfinder to see the whole frame. (If I wearing glasses, I won't see all)For this price, if you have money and a little magnification is fine for you, it's OK to have it.

Or borrow your friend to see what it looks like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well w/ Canon Rebel Xti","review":"Bought this for my Canon Rebel Xti. Slides on and fits perfectly. Good eyepiece, works well. There is a trade-off for the magnification as with any magnifying eyepiece -- there is a small portion of the outermost area of the view-finder which is no longer visible, but this has not presented a problem at all.Noticeable improvement when manually focusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike","review":"This product itself works fine as expected from the product overview. This produces the larger figure in the view finer and that made me feel like I am taking pics with D600 while using D7000 (i.e. My DX format D7000 pretends as if it is FX format D600. Of course it is not the same though. :) ). Simply I like it.However, the user should bear in mind that the range that is seen in the view finder is bigger than the one actually shows up on the picture. So you get smaller result than you saw in the view finder. This gives me some struggle on framing.Another point that I wanted to be improved was that this eyepiece only has a thin small square shaped rubber, and this rubber is not replaceable. It would be great if this could be changed to other bigger eye cup. The original eye piece fits and looks better on my D7000. Also it is not confortable to use when rotating the camera to take the pics vertically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I bought this initially with for my D40 and recently tried on my D300.

Contrary to what others have said -- the eyepiece does not fit correctly on the XTi - it sits slightly too low and obscures view with an almost unnoticeable magnification.

Several of the chapters had actually been published first as short stories - later the author built the rest of the novel around them, which may account for the criticism of inconsistent writing by one reviewer. On the whole, I lkied this book very much and would recommend it as an insightful book that compels the reader to consider the impact good art has on our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like someone's senior English project","review":"Very disappointing book. The story never resolves with the introductory chapter, which seemed to be the most logical and interesting step to take. It's nothing but a collection of flat short stories, each predictable and hurried. Only one or twice did I care what happened to anyone, as the writing style rushed along -- I understood that the painting was supposed to be the \\"main character,\\" but I found myself not empathizing with why the human characters would risk so much for this object. I suspect that the movie \\"The Red Violin\\" did a better job accomplishing what this author set out to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps I wanted to find some of the delight I feel when I look at a Vermeer painting or reproduction of one. But instead I found a technically accomplished work which overall relentlessly focussed on the 'brutal facts of life', which has so little to do with the qualities of love, beauty, light and mysterious intimacy which I find in Vermeer's work.

Basically the author sets out to show the journey of a paitnign from boring and cliched owner to boring and cliched owner... and tell you the exact meaning of life while she's at it. The only problem is this profound and deep understanding of the meaning of life which Ms. Vreeland is trying to convey to us seems to be something along the lines of \\"Stop and smell the roses.\\" Oh yeah, and \\"Love one another\\" is a big theme too. Anyway, the writing is didactic and sentimental. The fruits of research seem to be to pepper the writing with weird words that you have to research to understand. All in all, it's not worth the time it takes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about the end of the painting?","review":"I can't believe that noone (in 47 reviews) has commented on the fact that \\"after all it's been through\\" the painting gets destroyed! To me that is the most intriguing issue. Cornelius, who supposedly loves the painting, is willing to destroy it in order to avoid the shame over his father's actions. The knowledge from the beginning of the novel of the painting's \\"end\\" really colored my reactions to the other stories of it's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uneven","review":"This book has all the feeling of a book of essays cobbled together into a book so the essayist can get paid for the same work a second time. The thin thread of the painting fails to provide a way to sustain the reader's interest from episode to episode, and the device of working backward in time leaves the uncomfortable feeling of knowing in advance what will happen to this painting that some have loved and some just possessed. I would rate the book even lower but for the wonderful description of Vermeer's technique in the first chapter! The book's small redeeming grace is that it can be read so quickly that not a lot of time is wasted on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow read","review":"The first hundred pages of this book were fairly monotonous.

But the book is so terrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not a Vermeer","review":"Though built upon a promising premise, this collection of short tales woven around a single \\"lost\\" Vermeer painting gets off to an objectionable start that I found difficult to get over. The suggestion hinted at by the ending of the first story, that somehow the painting itself should be destroyed because it had once been stolen by a Nazi, is unconscionable. A work of art acquires no inherent guilt through the actions of those who handle it; the suggestion is all the more inappropriate given the Nazis' own penchant for destroying art.Otherwise, most of the stories in the book were originally written and published separately, and this perhaps accounts for their somewhat uneven execution. I found the two middle stories, \\"Morningshine\\" and \\"From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers\\" to be the most compelling tales in the book, each more for the personal stories they tell than any protagonism of the painting itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely novel","review":"A lovely novel which traces a painting believed to be a lost masterpiece by Vermeer from its present day owner all the way back to the painting's inception and creation. Vreeland sets the novel up as a series of short stories, each about the painting's respective owners and the spiritual/emotional impact it has on each of their lives. She succeeds in letting each story flow naturally, with imagination and gentle creativity, plucking out a moment in time in the life of each owner and allowing the reader to experience fully the circumstances of their lives, the circumstances within which the painting has comes into their possession, and the direct impact the painting has within that context. It's a daring piece of writing for a relatively inexperienced author (I believe this is her second book) and, to her credit, she handles it quite well, even if some of the vignettes are stronger and more passionate than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique concept","review":"This tale of a painting is a charming concept, beginning from the present and following its history back to the artist's - Vermeer - original inspiration.

I had high hopes because some coworkers raved, and I enjoy Vermeer and art and all that. But please...this overwraught, oversentimental thing made me yawn two pages in. The language is cheesy and even the interesting premise--following the painting's life from end to beginning--couldn't save it. The love scenes are laughable and the sad parts made me cringe. I suffered two weeks worth of bus commutes trying to wade through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely written, captures the spirit of life and love","review":"Vreeland takes you in the world of life and love with multiple related stories thru the fictional Vermeer painting, Girl in Hyacinth Blue.

The most appealing aspect of this book to me is the unique manner in which it is presented. The author tells the story of the painting by giving us as an account of each owner, leading us back to its creation. The question in the back of the reader's mind is always whether the artist was actually Vermeer. Intelligently written with a clever use of language and a vast array of interesting characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Vreeland will be an author I add to my list of favorites.

Each story transported me to a world of struggling people and how a work of art affects or transforms their lives. The final story in \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" is narrated by the daughter of Vermeer. Although fictitious, her dreams,desires, and longings are so natural for a young person, and I was so moved with it that I was in tears by the end. If you want to be transported to a faraway time and place...and yet feel your can identify with each character, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing writing","review":"This is not a book or genre I would normally have picked to read, but a good friend recommended it to me and I was amazed myself by simply loving it. What made the book so interesting and special is the way Vreeland structured the whole story. It is very innovative and refreshing to read such a well written story.They story revolves around a possible 36th Vermeer painting - there are only 35 in known existence. Vreeland makes the painting, in a sense, the main character and whole book revolves around the people that have been touched by it. I don't want to give too much away, because I read it without knowing anything about the book and that makes the unfolding of the story extra special.I like the compactness of the story, but was amazed by the writing. It's one of those books you don't want to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of little stories, but very hit-or-miss","review":"The book follows a Vermeer back through history, with little stories about how it touches the lives of the people who see it, own it, or love it. Vreeland does a great job creating a history of the painting, \\"tracking\\" it from the present-day owner back to Vermeer. In every instance, someone's obsession with the painting changes their life, sometimes for the better, and sometimes not. While of the stories are gripping,others just fail to engage you. It's a neat idea for a book, but the realization was a little spotty in places. Definitely worth reading, but be prepared to stick out a couple of chapters that may sag a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Worth While Read!!!","review":"This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Vreeland and I found her topic and storytelling to be very entertaining and very descriptive. This story tracks the path of a painting thought to have been created by Vermeer and we follow it from present day to back to the day it was created. This is really a story that is made up of several short stories each standing on it's own and the different effects this one painting had on each owner. I found this to be a very entertaing read and look forward to reading my by this very talented author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tale of a Painting","review":"This is an excellent and unusual novel which chapter by chapter and layer by layer exposes the history of a fictional Vermeer. Each layer of the story is unique and interesting and keeps the reader guessing as to both the authenticity and origin of the painting as it is passed from owner to owner. The languge of the book is fluid and the concept a refreshing change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wayward Child","review":"This book is an excellent example of life in Australia during and after World War 11. I was born in rural Australia and could identify with the author's memoir.

And I'll tell you what bothered me the most was the chapter that was probably the most developed -- when the mother killed the deformed baby. Do a little RESEARCH would ya? Mothers didn't get hung for killing babies back then. Especially not a baby that would've starved to death in a few days. The whole thing just annoyed me.

It is attractively packaged and the premise of the story seemed promising. Reading the book's words brought only a two dimensional vision, and an unoriginal vision at that. There is nothing new here for anyone who has heard the word \\"nazi\\", and mediocre prose to convey a listless and painfully forced story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vermeer through time...","review":"A collection of short stories told in reverse chronological order and held together by the presence of one painting. The earlier vignettes, or the later chapters of the book, are captivating as the Dutch lowlands and windmills take center stage in Vreeland's narratives. Characters have short-lived moments in the book, but that is okay once it becomes clear that the central character is the painting. The book is not long and it is easy to complete in a short time. An enjoyable result from reading the book, is that I found myself constantly looking at objects that have been around for a while, old coins, old buildings, and reflecting about the connections and stories these objects could tell about earlier times and people that have long departed. I found the book worthy of recommending to my middle school age kid, so it is fine for young teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey in Time","review":"What does a college art professor from the modern age and an 18th century witch have in common? Susan Vreeland weaves a truly wonderful story backwards in time, exploring the history of one picture as it passes from hand to hand and century to century.This is a beautifully written book that tells the story of a single painting by Dutch Master Vermeer. Tracing it's movement from hand to hand, the author brings to life each individual story surrounding the owners of the painting. As a reader I was immediately drawn into each individual story.A wonderful book and one I would highly recommend. I look forward to reading more of Susan Vreeland's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound and fury signifying: Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"A choice for my Book Club this month (Sep 2011), I too found it - frankly - boring. The only part of the book that I liked was the opening chapter. Thereafter, it was a chore and I did not finish it. Although I tried skipping ahead, skipping back again - no amount of skipping made it any more interesting or appealing. I just skipped reading the rest and closed it (mercifully). Fortunately, I lost no money on this book but simply returned it to the library.Girl With A Pearl Earring was far more interesting and imaginative IMHO.If I am the odd (wo)man out at our Book Club meeting, might be time for a new Book Club.

(real or imagined). Like most of Vermeer's paintings, it was painted in his home with the usual window and table. The painting is presumed to have been sold at auction in Amsterdam in 1696. We could see a similar painting in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, \\"Woman in Blue Reading a Letter\\". In this painting the woman is pregnant, perhaps Catherina, Vermeer's wife. The Girl in Hyacinth Blue may be wearing the same smock. Susan Vreeland brings 17th century Delft to life for us. The book reminds me of \\"The Red Violin\\" following the theme of ownership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the \\"Girl With The Pearl\\"...","review":"With eight short stories or perhaps vignettes, Ms. Vreeman traces an unknown Vermeer from its inception, to a locked room of a Professor with a dark family past. Central to that past is the manner his Father acquired the painting and the same past that so haunts the son. This book cannot escape comparison with \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\", and while it does not compare poorly, it certainly finishes second.Some of the eight stories are good, and some are very good, but they remain just that, pieces of eight, not a unified tale. I would have liked to have read this as a single work, one that was not broken apart, shuffled, and left for the reader to thread a non-sequential storyline together.I enjoyed the book, and the read is certainly worthwhile. It does not make great demands upon the reader, but unfortunately it does linger either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I really liked this book.

The songwriting is amazing, combining similarities between simon and garfunkle, early smashing pumkins, and other lesser well-known emo-rock bands.

Each cartoon teaches kids about sharing and how to deal with disappointments by looking at problems in a different way.Although the animation is relatively simple, the mixed media used to create the graphics is very clever and leads to interesting visuals.The voice actors are wonderful as the characters \\"Charlie\\" and his younger sister \\"Lola,\\" and their friends \\"Marv\\" and \\"Lotta,\\" along with other kids either at school or in the neighborhood.The DVD menus are interactive and you can choose either \\"play-all\\" or \\"episode selection.\\"Nice treat for kids, and adults who enjoy cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice product but not as described","review":"These valve cover bolts are a really nice design but I bought this set to match a 5 inch set that I have and these are advertised to be 5 inches long when in fact they are only 4 inches long and do not match my 5 inch bolts.

There is nothing good about this movie except for a few songs. The direction is very bad. How can someone dance with a fractured leg? Some people may find the romance and drama very entertaining, however, I like movies that are more realistic. Shahrukh Khan is not as good an actor as people feel about him.

Honestly, my only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that the first half of the movie almost seems to be written by another person. There's some extremely juvenile behavior -- you know the kind where SRK acts really silly and obnoxious -- like a 12-year-old boy rather than the 20 something man he is supposed to be playing. I can only imagine he was directed to act this way, but it's strange to me, and isn't at all believable.

I would like to see less of Maduri Dixit and more of Shahrukh, but I guess there are those who are more interested in Maduri, right? This was a fun song & dance movie, built around the theme of a dance troupe (something like Riverdance, probably) and the main idea is that the \\"new girl\\" is taking the place of the current female dance lead, who is the best friend and secretly in love with the artistic director and lead male dancer played by Shahrukh Khan. Meanwhile, the new dancer is also falling in love with Shahrukh's character, but life seems to have other marriage plans for her.

My Dearest Daisy, by Jo Ann Ferguson, might possibly earn the one star I am forced to give here, but the plot is not only worn out but has been done so much better - niece (complete with limp) of actress falls in love with young lord but is afraid to tell him who she really is. He, of course, returns her regard, for reasons which remain wholly inexplicable. Maria Greene gives us the story of two thoroughly disagreeable people who behave like immature brats. I could barely read it, it was so bad. And last of all Kate Huntington gives us what may just possibly be the most unlikeable 'hero' ever created in a regency romance. The 'other' man was so much better, I kept waiting for the heroine to realize it, but she was no great prize either, so I guess they were well suited. I really resent having spent money on this book! Awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking. . . .An Unforgettable Film","review":"Very few movie images stay with you for a few hours, let alone years or even decades.DOCTOR ZHIVAGO is one of those unforgettable films, both for its spectacular visuals as well as the compelling story. With strong performances by one of the greatest casts of all time -- Omar Shariff, Rod Steiger, Alec Guiness, Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, to name just a few -- and the most breathtaking images ever filmed, the movie takes into a world as familiar and alien as Russia ever was.Despite (or perhaps because) of its length, one is taken into a place and time so real that -- even watching it in summertime, you will swear that it is the depth of winter.The DVD presents DOCTOR ZHIVAGO. It is the only way to see this movie. The restoration is pristine and the additional features are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama Par Excellence","review":"Having viewed this movie several times in the cinema over the years and countless times (albeit the dreaded Pan and Scan)it was a pleasure to view it again on DVD on my Widescreen TV. Yes, it may have aged,might be considered by others as pure romantic dribble,but be assured this is movie making at its best. Hollywood was already jealous of Lean at this stage,they knew that this was another masterpiece after\\"Lawrence\\" and they proved it by giving that years best picture oscar to the \\"Sound of Music\\"instead. The DVD version is stunning,depicting all the Widescreen splendour and as for that theme tune,what else can one say. If there is a flaw it is in the casting of Sharif as Yuri and Chaplain as his wife who just weren't \\"Russian\\" enough.

For some ungodly reason, the movie is spread out over both sides of Disc 1, rather than being spread out over 2 discs (ala GWTW, etc.). Since I've never had a double-sided disc that didn't arrive damaged, you're wasting your money if you buy this one.

Although technically brilliant, the story is a romantic muddle full of coincidence and unexplained changes in character. Sharif and Christie generate little chemistry on the screen. Sharif's portrayal is bland and the character of Zhivago is unsympathetic; his treatment of his unbelievably saintly first wife (Geraldine Chaplin) is unforgivable. Rod Steiger's Komarovsky goes from villainous cretin to would-be benefactor with little rationale.As I mentioned above, the production values are excellent and director David Lean certainly knows how to frame a shot. If the film were shorter, these merits would elevate it to three stars in my eyes.

Omar Sharif, Julie Christie and Rod Steiger, especially, are just wonderful in David Lean's adaptation of Pasternak's epic love story. The script was beautiful and lacked nothing; the actors couldn't have done a better job at delivering their lines. It was extremely well paced and never lagged or felt rushed. Maurice Jarre's haunting score is just beautiful and weaves throughout the movie like a tapestry. The cinematography is beyond compare.

All of these movies have in common many of the same themes that are part of our lives: love, hate, loyalty, fear, our fate. These themes are part of our lives, whether you are a man or a woman.

Russia pulled out of World War I when it went Communist. Omar Sharif is Zhivago, an idealistic doctor torn between his wife and Julie Christie. Zhivago's ambiguity is mirrored in his poetry, judged too personal by the new order. We see the paradox of art and science.

Zhivago just wants to live his life in peace with his family, use his Doctoring to help people, and stay out of politics. But the revolution sweeps him up, as it did all Russians.

Zhivago is stunning visually, but acting wise, it's not great. Omar Shariff is always great in supporting roles (watch his Ali in LOA!) but not in leading roles.

The characters have little relation to Paternak's descriptions or his insights into the inner lives of Lara and Yuri. Sharif is very poor as a Russian poet, and his sparkling eyes are bad substitutes for good acting. Jukie Christie is woinderful, she can muster through, but she is too British, and there is also Ralph Richradson and Tom Courtney and G. Chaplin and Siobahn McKenna...too western by far. And that script by Bolt is atrocious! Read P{asternak and pray the Russians re film it as it should be filmed.The score is pleasant, but stereotypical and syrupy. Not Lean's best. His best and greatest is Lawrence of Arabia. See this and know how hampered hje was by Ponti and Metro Goldwyn Mayer and Bolt's total lack of understanding of the novel!!Avoid this campy movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dateline Europe aka Foreign Intrigue","review":"The first dvd I tried to watch in this series was not clear enough to watch.

Although this movie is so slow that you could probably slither on your belly and still escape it.If you are a woman you may be able to sit through this seemingly unending saga of Soviet slush. But you better have plenty of patience. A good test might be to see \\"Dances with Wolves\\" first. If you can watch that without wishing that 90 minutes had been left on the cutting room floor, you MIGHT have the grit for Zhivago.I gave it 2 stars on the assumption that somewhere out there exists a movie which is even more torturous than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant? Hardly!","review":"David Lean was in over his head with this film adaptation of the historic book by Pasternak. There is absolutely no justification for this movie to be so long since it hardly touches the complexities of its source. When I saw the film during its original release, I wondered why it was taking so long to get to the point. I never did get the \\"point\\". Then again I don't understand all the fuss around \\"Gone With the Wind\\" either.The performances by Shariff and Christie were amazing. By that I mean that it appeared that they were filmed separately performing their roles, then the results were edited together. Talk about no chemistry!Yes the cinematography is grand, however, the music score is minimalistic.If you enjoy daytime soap operas, then you might enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Doctor Zhivago sometimes feels like a soap opera, but it's just about the most epic soap opera you can imagine--much like Gone With the Wind, it sets the fairly minor struggles of a small group of characters against a dramatic historical tableau and is all the better for it--compulsively watchable even at 3+ hours, it's a movie I doubt you'll forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic mix of history and romance","review":"A classic.

Omar Sharif & Julie Christie gave good performances. But it was Rod Steiger who steals the show with his great portrayal. The love story was somewhat flat, but was enough to sustain me to watch the full 3 hour epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Romantic Movie","review":"Omar Sharif stars as Zhivago, a young Russian doctor and poet, at the time of the Bolshevik revolution. Geraldine Chapman plays the girl he grew up with, married, and cheats on. The woman of his dreams is Lara, played by Julie Christie. She is passionate, sensual, and the mother of his child. There is a lot of action as we view the war through the lives of these people. If you're looking for an epic love story, this is it. Dr. Zhivago has it all--beautiful stars, exquisite music, and a sentimental story line that is riveting. See it with someone you love, and \\"Lara's Theme\\" will become \\"your song.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually brilliant!!","review":"This is the greatest love story ever told. Who would have done it better than director David Lean? NO ONE! I urge you to see this immediately! Keep in mind that the film is a fair length, seeing as how there is so much story to tell. The DVD has a pretty good amount of features on both discs for a forty year old movie and I'm glad to see this on a much deserving film other than most of the new stuff that is put into 2-disc sets. Much like Lawrence Of Arabia, this film features some great imagery and my favorite was how everything looked in the winter. Other recommendations: Lawrence Of Arabia, Spartacus."},{"rating":"1","title":"45th Special Edition NOT special","review":"The reason this version of this wonderful film only merits two stars from me is due to the multiple jumps and freezes on the discs. Yes, that's plural. The second DVD I ordered to replace the first one also had the same problems but in different places on the disc. Don't know what's going on here, but the quality control for this edition is horrible. David Lean would be scandalized that his epic film is being so shoddily reproduced. I've now had to return this second DVD and am asking for a refund this time. I mean, what are the odds that the third one I'd get would also be defective? I'm going to try the two-disc set, see if it's got the same problems.

Never got to see it on free TV and wish I had now, so I'd save the money I spent on the video. This film is a bore, to say the least. It seems to be more a tale of sexual license, rather than a expansive drama of a few characters against the backdrop of a revolution. The characters you care little about, \\"Lara's Theme\\" gets to be grating after a while, the city of Moscow seems to be one street with bleak looking buildings around it and the train ride is tedious. I like Julie Christie, but if you want to see her in a long, romantic drama that has a better score and is much more involving, see \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\", from just a few years later after this. If you want to see a better David Lean film, watch \\"Ryan's Daughter\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctor Zhivago","review":"I am writing this review for my film appreciation class at Lowry High School in Winnemucca Nevada.Doctor Zhivago was a very long an boring movie (3 hours-17 minutes)! I just kept on going without having any exciting parts to it. At times it was hard to understand what was going on. I don't even know what the point of it was.The only good part about this movie was some of the scenery. The snow, trees and mountains looked pretty good. The photography was exceptional The movie needs to have a better plot to it.The only part i really understood about the movie was that Lara (Julie Christie) was Doctor Zhivago's(Omar Sharif) mistress.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Rent or buy some other movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Zhivago","review":"I just watched Dr.Zhivago, and found the review from ID-ea is most close to my thought.

Next time someone gets the idea communism would be a great political/social structure to live under, they should be forced to watch this movie. Forget all the anti-communist propaganda I heard growing up, this movie is enough to make me drop to my knees and give thanks that I don't live under communism.I give this movie four stars instead of five because I think it drags alittle in the middle on the train ride, and because it is so depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I love salt, but these are way to salty.Bite carefully, many Pitts are left in.A lot of the 3.5 # is salt water"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool","review":"I bought this CD on a whim, knowing nothing about the band, and really like it.

It is certainly not a great movie, but if you are up late or bored, it might be enjoyable. However, if you are a fan of the show, as I am, then this movie provides little drug for your \\"Buffy\\" fix and fails to provide any significant history to a fan of the show. Also, don't watch the movie and expect to see the same level of drama/comedy/romance and depth of the characters as you see on television each week. If you are a fan of the tv show, watch/buy the series premiere \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest\\" as a starting point. Finally, while I like Kristy Swanson, she is no Sarah Michelle Geller who is the \\"real\\" Buffy (despite not being the original)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I have had this movie for years and just watched it again last Sunday. I think its funny and campy the way it is supposed to be. Sure it doesn't compare to the TV show but its still fun. I love Kristy Swanson. She was the perfect answer to the 80's backlash. She wouldn't have worked in the more serious TV show (besides I could never live without Sarah Michelle's portrayal) but I adore her none the less. And surprisngly, Buffy and Pike (Luke Perry) were wonderful together. I want to see more Buffy stuff. BUFFY FOREVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than they say","review":"I remember being about 5 years old watching this movie and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time. But then about 5 years later I was driving down the street and say a poster for the Buffy TV Show. I ran home and looked up when It premired and it was that night. I watched the first episode and never looked back til about a year ago. The film was still funny, but after seening the TV which is an outstanding show, it was kind-of cheesy. If you like comedy-horror films this is for you, if you like serious horror with a touch of comedy stick to the show. But it is nice to see how greaty improved Joss Whedon has come (Thank God). If your a fan - perfect, if your not - stay clear away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp Buffy is not what Josh Whedon intended","review":"Joss Whedon's script is played for camp in this original version of Buffy. Just watch Paul Reubens mug his way through the film to know that this is the way the director decided to go in this film. However, everyone who watches the television version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer knows that there is a much better way of doing it. The movie is certainly not important to the mythos of the television series; there is very little reference to the events and the only flashback is in Part I of \\"Becoming.\\" However, if you enjoy the Buffy series then you should check this movie out if only to catch the wrong path not taken. If listen carefully to the dialogue you will recognize Whedon vision is in there but that style had-for the moment-over come substance. You have to pity anyone who thinks the movie is superior to the television show."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I thought this was a really bad movie!

For everyone else who is just looking to laugh this movie is perfect. I have watched this so many times I can recite the script in my sleep. Whenever I need to laugh this is great. Kristy Swanson does an excellent job portraying the valley girl, and Paul Ruebens is much more entertaining as a half witted vampire than he ever was as Pee-Wee. If you don't try to take this movie seriously, I think you can really learn to appreciate it. To be honest I have completely avoided the tv version, because I am not a fan of Gellar, and Kristy in my eyes will always be the original Buffy.She created the character, and I don't think anyone can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the tv show","review":"this film is nothing compaired to the tv show sarah mischelle gellar is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun","review":"You will have forgotten all the famous, or once famous people that are in this flick.

This movie is TERRIBLE. The tv series is excellent, one of the best shows I've seen. In this movie Buffy is a shallow annoying person, and its all played up for laughs.

It's just not good compared to the TV show (or anything else for that matter). Josh Whedon has come a long way in his writing ability...a really long way. I find it hard to believe he wrote Buffy: Season One and the movie. I'm just glad I never saw this when it was released or else I never would have watched the TV show for any reason. I'll be honest, this stunk. I turned it off in the middle of the movie and started Buffy: Season Three instead. Not bother here. Believe me. You'll thank me for it later. Kristy Swanson is not Buffy, and is nowhere near Geller in acting ability. If you want the back-story, see Buffy: Season Two, Episode 21. That'll give you enough.

Sadly, he did not get to do that with this movie, and it ended up sucking. The script is lame and fluffy, the acting not all that...tune into UPN every Tuesday at 8 and watch the show instead of this. When I went to Blockbuster, the guy at the counter had obviously seen it. He told me it wasn't from the show, and I said I knew that. He then tried talking me out of it...I was stupid enough to be stubborn. Maybe rent it if you've got a free rental on your Rewards Membership thing....but don't spend the money to actually buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, baby!!!","review":"Aside from occasional mumbling of lines, this movie ROCKS. Even if you get offended on behalf of the Anne Rice-concept vampires, this movie still has its merit. Merit is cool. This is possibly the ONLY decent acting Luke Perry has ever done as Pike, Buffy's unlikely delinquent side-kick/love interest. Paul Rubens is great as the lackey vampire...but I had to watch the movie 20 times and THEN have a friend tell me to figure out it was him. This movie, stuck firmly in-between Lost Boys and Clueless is well worth any purchase...unless you cant let yourself loose enough to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE!!!!","review":"I thought this was a great movie.It is an origanl movie with the slayer and the vampiers mixed into one hit movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Buffy Movie: Campy and cool","review":"I think the 1992 Buffy Movie starring Kristy Swanson was far more up-beat and campy than the show, which has darker comedy and tone.

It helped me understand parts of the show, like Buffy's past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too campy, too silly, no drama...the TV show is much better","review":"Anyone who is a fan of Buffy the show, knows that it's superior to the movie in all aspects. Poor Joss Whedon probably wrote a great script about a young blonde highschool cheerleader who would ready to kick the butt of any vampire who cornered her in a dark ally. Because of this gift, the responsibility of saving the world would be overwhelming and she would long for a normal life and realize what can really be important. Unfortunatly, even though glimpes of Joss's intentions can be seen in the script, the intention was butchered like an Enron document through a shredder. Still, if you like campy vampire movies, you may love this. But watch the show and you will see the astounding difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is alright, but the show is ALOT better!","review":"I thought that the movie was alright, but i think that the show is a whole lot better because it has popular stars, good plots, and it involves more creatures other than vampires!

I have no idea why the TV series is such a commercial success and the movie was a flop. Sarah Michelle Gellar has NOTHING on Kristy Swanson. All physical attributes aside, Swanson is much more convincing as a valley girl than SMG is, and the movie puts the TV series to shame, as far as I'm concerned. Believe it or not, the TV show takes on a much more somber tone and serious atmosphere than it should. This movie is so light hearted and ridiculous that it's just a riot. Even Pee-Wee Herman has a small part in this (no pun intended) and he made me laugh out loud--hands down the funniest death scene on film. To sum up, Kristy Swanson is great, the dialogue is hilarious (MUCH more funny than the TV show), and this stands to date as the only good thing Luke Perry has ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time. I 'm not sure it's worth one star.","review":"The movie version of Buffy is NOTHING and I mean nothing like the tv series. Joss Whedon..Buffy's creator had little to do with the end product of the movie version. In an interview a few years back, he basically said he walked away from it. Apparently, Donald Sutherland was insufferable to work with and went about changing the movie and many of his lines. Joss Whedon does not have many nice things to say about Donald Sutherland after that experience. So, what you see in the movie was not Joss' vision for what Buffy was supposed to be like. The TV show however, is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like the vampires sucked the juice out of this one!","review":"A few days ago, I watched this movie. When I first watched it, I was so bored I was about to jump in the pictures and slay Kristy Swanson myself with a stake. Whatever happened to this movie? It had a good beginning, but it dozed off... Sarah does A LOT, A LOT, A LOT, A LOT, A LOT better than this movie.

After all its what started the show. And I think that even thow Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job playing Buffy, that Kristy Swanson does a perfect job of playing the bubbly air head valley girl character to the extreme! And one of Luke Perry's best performs yet. Because we all know he does a pretty good job of playing Dlyan McKay on Beverly Hills 90210! But it also has lots of other great stars like: Donald Sutherland, Hillary Swank, Ben Affleck, and David Arquitte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I first saw this movie when I was 10 or so at a birthday party and loved it! Now 5 years later I went out and bought it, since it was on sale (I would find out why later) and sat down with a couple of friends and got ready for some fun. Well the first thing we both saw was how horrible the dialouge was, the teenage 'slang' is exaggerated as our their actions. Even worse were the jokes, due in part to Kristy Swansons acting. The filming didn't do much justice to it either and the vampires were the most humorous villans I've ever seen.It only gets 2 stars because of the awesome show that would be made out of it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bite Me","review":"The 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' movie starring Kristy Swanson isn't nearly as good as the T.V. series starring Sarah Michelle Geller as Buffy. The only really good thing about the movie is that the T.V. show came out of it. The make-up is only standard, really, compared to the series and I hated Buffy's mom.I am so happy they got Kristine Sutherland to be Joyce in the show. I say, only watch the movie if you really feel like you have to. Otherwise, just stick with the T.V. series."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, no, no, and no. Joss didn't like it. Ok?

If you're not then don't bother. This is the movie that started the greatest series on tv. And the creator of that show made this movie. However, being a huge disappointment to me, a huge buffy show fan, i only recommend buying this movie if you are totally devoted to the series. none of the actors in the movie are in the show. there is a whole new cast, but not creator and director, which is excellent, since the idea and direction were good, the acting and writing however, needs a little work. Pee Wee Herman stars and so does Luke Perry, which anyone can see is why the acting is bad. David Arquette also stars, also bad actor. Despite is badness, it is a great way to learn pre-series trivia and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"not to compare to tv","review":"okay even thou i love the tv show I will try not to compare thenm to much.the movies was supposed to be silly and light. swason is all right as buffy all she is not the right age to play a 16 year old girl.i liked the donald sutherland as her watcher all he no giles. it was sad when he died. i cnat stand luke perry he is what keeps the from getting a higher review."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Buffy is just a normal girl, likes shopping, is a cheerleader and is quite popular.

Jill Nagle's anthology of essays across the sex worker theme did nothing short of smash every stereotype I had ever held about prostitutes, exotic dancers and other sex workers. These stereotypes have undoubtedly been created by the alternate over-glamorous and sub-realist portrayals from Hollywood. While any critically thinking reader will understand that Nagle doesn't cover the seedy underbelly of child prostitution and harmful sex services, what she shows is voluntary sex work on an equal par with any other skilled profession, though with a healthy dose of self-reflection, feminism and personal growth on the part of the workers themselves. I probably bought five additional copies to send to friends. It's an eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"So true!!!","review":"For years I've considered myself to be a freak of sorts: I consider myself to be a feminist and a strong, secure woman who has a positive self and body image, yet, at the same time, I've wanted to strip. Not for money, but for my own enjoyment. In this book, it's explained that there is room for all of us in the feminist movement. It's about time that we as women stop demonizing men and begin to understand that women can be whores or porn stars, or stripers an not be an automatic victim. I found this book to be VERY refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trick's in the title","review":"The oxymoronic title of Nagle's book, \\"Whores and Other Feminists\\" signals from the start that this is just another entry in the disingenuous genre of books about prostitution that redefine feminism as what it is not. Feminism doesn't sugar coat sexism, or try to make women comfy with it. Feminism analyzes what John Adams smugly termed \\"our masculine systems\\" - of which prostitution is a primary example - and fights back because sexist systems pay off for men at women's expense. And telling the hard truth about the political meaning and lived realities of prostitution is not \\"blaming prostitutes\\" - it is holding men responsible for what they do to women, something that handmaidens to misogyny like Nagle et al. are afraid to do. Nagle strategically ignores a key fact - women don't write the script for whores - men do, and if calling misogyny feminism broadens the market for prostitution, hey give the customer what he wants. That's what prostitution is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Christain just kids","review":"not so goodI bought it with the other one \\"beware of Christain\\" and is not a movie I would watch with me kids or teenagers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"If they would have done a lot less flip-flopping, and had been a little mature it could have been a great movie, but with all their antics I soon lost intrest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic Island","review":"The best books I have read are the ones where I forgot there are words. Jan Evan Whitford's, Mystic Island, put me in that place where the \\"words\\" on the pages disappeared. Instead I engaged in what I saw, heard, touched, and felt. I not only \\"watched\\" the action, drama, and comedic scenes of this down and dirty, yet heartfelt mystery, I became a part of its life. Mystic Island is the kind of \\"Who done it?\\" that makes noise, because you get to interact with the characters, - and there are certainly some shady, as well as laugh out loud (LOL) characters on \\"Mystic Island\\". The author's knack for this type of storytelling is salient, - I will be looking for more by Mr. Whitford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not World War II, But Stolen Lobster Mystery","review":"This mystery is very weak, with historical misinformation thrown in to make the premise blievable. Though about where to find a long lost Rooselvelt-Hitler letter at the begging, it quickly turns into who is stealing lobsters from ocean traps. The majority of the novel revolves around this lobster mystery. To bolster hisory, the author shows his ignorance by incorrectly bringing in two (2) historical inaccuracies: Radio Free Europe was founded in 1949 with a first broadcast on 4 July 1950 to Czechoslovakia, not 1945 as he says; Joseph Goebbels was never in the military because of his club foot, therefore he was not a General as the author says. He was the Propagamda Minister for the Third Reich (and a very good one.) My biggest complaint is the very short chapters (mostly 2--3 pages, which comes out to 80 chapters for 229 pages!) I believe this author needs to take college creative writing courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but Almost Impossible Not to Break","review":"I bought this to make a few necklaces with.

He was on the vitamins for a week - that's a long time for a dog to not go!

Well known are his fine recordings with Jim Hall and the album he made with Toots Tiellemans - Affinity.Far less so is this session with Jeremy Steig, son of the more famous cartoonist William Steig. Jeremy's main efforts were in the Jazz Fusion field which was in vogue in the late sixties and early seventies. This recording attests to his astonishing ability in the straight ahead jazz genre. More importantly, the level of his emotional expression at least puts him in Evan's musical ball park, and Evans,in turn, seems to be inspired by Steig's breathy and adventurous solos.The original album was tough to find, so this reissue is very welcome, particularly with so few jazz flautists currently active. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two sides of the master.","review":"A rare, rare import is this one, pairing two Bill Evans albums of classic flute-and-piano jazz collaborations supported by Chuck Israels on bass and Paul Motian on drums. Evans, the master of understated piano, provides both complementary and contrasting relief, depending on the flutist in the spotlight. Steig is aggressive. Frequent overblowing, double-tonguing, and even singing into the flute give his style a harder edge than one normally encounters on this pastoral instrument. Coupling of these techniques with altered tempos (e.g., \\"Autumn Leaves\\" as a fast swing) puts Evans in Stein's crosshairs; Evans' inherent placid style is often challenged and even disturbed. Mann, on the other hand, is an impressionist through and through, as he blends rather than batters. Listen to his takes on \\"Nirvana,\\" \\"Gymnopedie,\\" or \\"Wllow Weep for Me\\" to hear how intuition, anticipation, and empathetic listening all contribute to an unparalleled creative synergy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's New - Hard to Find Gem","review":"This collaboration between Bill Evans and Jeremy Steig is nearly impossible to find in the US. It is a shame that it's so rare, as the music is so \\"on\\" and in the \\"zone\\". The energy between these two musicians is nothing less than magical, and has been captured so well in this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bill Evans CD","review":"I have been listening to What's New for the last 25 years.

I found the plot boring, the characters uninteresting and no ingenious ideas whatever. It was not unconvincing; there simply wasn't anything to grab your attention. Moreover, I thought the style a bit similar to the unfeelingness of cyberpunk -- and since I take great delight in fantasy, cyberpunk is the last thing I'd like a fantasy book to remind me of. The problem is that I read \\"Lords of the Sky\\" immediately after Zelazny's Amber series -- how is it possible to rate these two works equally? (Also, if it is REALLY better than the rest of Wells' books, you'll have to introduce negative values on your rating scale.)Anyway, you should try it (as well as any other book) yourself.

The novel follows a group of families as they make their way to the promised land, fighting attacks from animals, illness, obstacles in their path, but like all good stories the ending is a happy one.

The band is:Oscar Peterson - PianoMilt Jackson - VibesJoe Pass - GuitarToots Thielmans - HarmonicaNiels Pederson - BassLouis Bellson - drumsThe unusual element to this is the Harmonica, but as soon as you hear the opening solo on the album you realise that Thielmans is a virtuoso player. He's not playing a diatonic harp but the chromatic, and it sounds great. Goes without saying that the rest of the band swing like crazy and you wont be disappointed by this.The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the sound is a bit dodgy in places (not unlistenable though), but don't let that put you off its well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best there is","review":"I have been a classical jazz buff since 1950, when the first 331/3 (Benny Goodman's '38 jazz concert) was released.

And after watching the new version I have to say I'm very satisfied. The transfer was done well, and the original Cantonese soundtrack also holds up.What can I say about the movie? John Woo and Chow-Yun Fat's early work together signalled the start of something greater, and the coming of age of Chow-Yun Fat as an action star and a great actor.Still awaiting delivery of \\"A Better Tomorrow Part II\\".

Can't see the movie for the words! The same holds true for the sequels.I'd buy another copy if only they'd fix this aweful production flaw.DON'T BUY IT! Wait for an improved edition!

I love John Woo, and this is an incredible movie, but please do not buy this DVD. Buying this DVD will tell Anchorbay that what they did was forgivable, and it (I am referring to their God-awful remix of the soundtrack) is a travesty, a crime against mankind, and hell-worthy trespass. Words cannot express the anger I have towards whoever thought that it would be a good idea to remix (if this is indeed a remix or just a gross oversight) this film's soundtrack with music from Forrest Gump, Speed, and several other cute movies. Apparently they for saw this situation and planned for it by not including the credits on this DVD!... Be warned, and wait for a rerelease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anchor Bay DVD is defective - DO NOT BUY!","review":"BE ADVISED! This DVD includes the improperly remixed soundtrack that replaces the music from the film with music from SPEED, FORREST GUMP, T2, ALIENS and other films.

The subtitles are so bad as to make certain scenes incomprehensible; the audio transfer is terrible (the characters sound like they're in a tin box, the vocal track is out of sync, etc.); and the print is faded and it looks like no attempt was made to clean it up in digital transfer. Nevertheless, the film is a blast, and you don't really need to understand the dialogue to follow the plot.

Excellent performance by Chow Yun-Fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Version Available.","review":"I bought this when it first came out. Up till then, it was only available as A: Horrible Boot-leg or B: Horribly Translated English-Dubbed VHS. So I bought thinking I hit the motherlode. It did have a pretty decent transfer & was letterboxed in it's 1.85:1 ratio instead of it's usual boot-leg 1.77:1. However, the first thing I noticed was that all the original score had been replaced! I don't know if this was corrected later or what, but I was very disappointed. Not only was the original good music gone, but it was replaced with sound-alike versions of the score from \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Forrest Gump.\\" AHHHH, the agony.

Lewis is a grade A, for sure. His strength, to my mind is analysis. He shows me aspects of a song I thought I knew (like Cherokee) which I never have seen before. But it is a solo album and taking the performance as a whole,my thought is, he's not Keith Jarrett, he's not Marcus Roberts. The performance seems sometimes almost too analytical and because of that, a bit self-conscious.

The characters were not particularly deep or engaging and I was not sure why Beatrix Potter was in the plot.

When it arrived, we fortunately made the decision to test it as it was for Christmas and he wanted it so badly. The tank would not respond to the controller other than the lights coming on. We would have liked to have talked to a person at either Amazon or the company. The only contact we could make was to the company by email. They did have a number on the box to call, but after trying to call several times on several different days and no one ever answered-we left voice messages that were never answered. We did finally contact them by email. The response was at best in broken English which at one point led us to believe we were getting a $30 discount. It turns out that we would have to pay $30. It was only a $43 tank and the shipping was on us. So we just took the loss and are out the price of the tank.SO, BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for the money","review":"I purchased this tank 4 days ago and so far, I am having so much fun with it.The tank functions just the way it says on the box/pictures.

This book allowed me to learn some of the trappings or Oracle' ANSI SQL DML. But, it also made me understand some concepts that I wasn't fully clear on in MSSQL T-SQL. Good read. Its several years old, but still relevant. This stays on my desk now. Theres alot of stuff covered in here thats on some of the OCA SQL exams like 1Z0-047 and 1Z0-051.I also bought it as an ebook from the Android Market. That was great as well - especially for office toilet time.Note that this doesn't really go into PL\\\\SQL...

I must confess that I enjoy a good B-grade horror movie, but this just does not deliver on any level. This one leaves me wishing for the horror movies of the 70s, where they took risks and were prepared to show something.

The (BAD) actors are killed one by one and the final survivors even if all their friends have been sliced few minutes before,they still smile and make bad jokes at the end.Avoid this movie ! Just re-watch one of the old flicks,they are funnier or at least a bit creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scream on Friday the 13th, Part 1000","review":"One of the most boring horrorflicks ever. All the actors are much too old and much too untalented. The plot is just a joke, the entire film is completely redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unsatisfied customer","review":"This video was so scratched it wouldnt even play in my dvd players I tried all 4 of them. I buy used videos all ther time and was very unhappy with the condition of this dvd. I ordered the pool from another vender. I did not return this dvd because the shipping was more than the dvd is worth a very unsatisfied customer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bra","review":"Muat Have !! This give me great support and a great look, I would recommend this to a friend.My husband loves it as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet Me Review","review":"Jennifer Crusie always creates great characters and this book has them too. I didn't find the theme as exciting as some of her other books but it is a good read. Still has twists and turns to keep you reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, enjoyable","review":"A good, interesting read. Not my favorite of JC's, but definitely worth the read. Can't go wrong with JC books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet Me is a spunky and charming novel","review":"Bet Me is a fabulous book. Though it had a rough start, it really picked up towards the end. The main plot of the book is about Minerva Dobbs, a practical, sworn off of men, carb counter, who is being swooned by Cal. Cal is a serial dater that always wins his bets. When Cal recieves a bet to try to make Min fall in love with him, his world goes crazy. To make it worse, Min knows about the bet. First, they argue over everything and decide not to see each other, but fate has other plans. Where ever they go, they accidently bump into each other. They each finally realize that they love one another. Min tells Cal that she knows about the bet and he decides to throw it, but Min decides the prize is to great to risk. Ten thousand dollars and true love is too precious to let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet on this book for laughs","review":"This was a very funny book. Move over Janet Evanovich whose books lately have gone downhill. JC's humor in this one is excellent. Repartee excellent. No so svelt Min meets gorgeous Cal and puts him in his place. His thoughts are sooo funny and the whole book is not mean spirited. Thought all the characters were very good especially the Mothers. Very entertaining and worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"When is the next Jennifer Crusie book coming out? She is one of my favorite authors and I was sorry to see Bet Me come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum and a rant","review":"After I read Bet Me, I thought 'been there, done that. ' It seems like the author combined 'Fast Women' and 'Welcome to Temptation,' and threw in some new music (Elvis) and fairy tale stuff. There's the little kid and the baseball game, the three tight women friends, someone gets hit with something, the frozen mother and so on. And speaking of the frozen mother, it would be so nice to see this author portray a woman in her fifties as something other than an ice matron or manipulative or frozen or unfulfilled or incomplete or dead below the waist. When you think about some of her older female characters (Gwen, Liz, Nanette, Cal's mother, Maddie's mother) Crusie seems to perpetuate these stereotypes of the woman over fifty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never met a Crusie book I didn't like - until now","review":"I found BET ME to be a big disappointment. Populated by cardboard characters, it lacks charm and wit. I hope she's getting paid by Krispy Kreme because it's mainly a glorified ad for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"After looking over the other reviews, much to my surprise, I realize that the vast majority of reviews of this book thought it was great. I found it to be childish, ridiculous, and a predictable waste of time. I found the characters to all be caricatures of unlikeable personalities. I felt like I was watching a bad skit on Saturday Night Live as Jennifer Crusie tried to add what was supposed to be humor, but read like slapstick shlock (e.g. one character repeatedly whacked the male lead with her purse; there was one scene where all the characters unexpectedly showed up at the same time at the female lead's apartment). I'm sorry I didn't follow my first (and continuous) impulse to stop reading. The end didn't justify having to endure all the cliches, caricatures, and ridiculous scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bet Me","review":"This was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The story line is/could be cute but the writing is horrible. Too many he said / she saids and details that don't help to develop the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have waited for the paperback","review":"If I had friends and family like Min, I would have told them where to go long ago. I found it hard to believe that a 33 yr. old female put up with so much from them.I usually love most of Crusie's books but this was not a favorite. I didn't like most of the characters and thought they were nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly predictable","review":"I started the book thinking it would be a great escape from reality. Well, it was and it wasn't. It seemed as though the author was trying to write both Bridget Jones's Diary and Sex and the City...but she didn't quite pull off either. Don't get me wrong, it was a somewhat enjoyable fantasy book, however, I am not going to suggest it to any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Fresh!","review":"This book will always make me think of Krispy Kremes and fun shoes. It is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Many books have Big Misunderstandings, but none of them tackle it quite like Jennifer Crusie! Min mistakenly thinks Cal has made a $10,000 bet that he can get her into bed within one month. She's wrong, of course, but it makes for some hilarious twists and turns as she stings him along long enough to have a date for her sister's wedding but makes sure he loses the bet.All humor aside, one of the things I love about this book is how body image is handled. Min's family tries to keep her on a diet and tells her she's overweight, so she believes she is fat. Cal adores her just the way she is and works to get her to see herself through his eyes as he feeds her real food. It is beautifully done and truly refreshing to read a book about a heroine that isn't a size 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hooked!","review":"I'm not a big fan of romance novels. However, I couldn't put this book down and I lost a few hours of sleep trying to find out how Cal and Min were going to end up. Because Crusie writes from both characters' POV, you really root for them because you know what's REALLY going on. Some of the events were a little far fetched, but it just added to the fairy tale part of the story.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story. Be prepared to lose some sleep because you just can't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet Me","review":"Great read. Excellent banter, you grow to love the main character and the relationship stuff is what a great romance is made of. I highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet you'll love Crusie!","review":"This book is a pleasure to read, especially for fans of romance. And for fans of Chic Lit. And for fans of funny, witty dialogue full of a surprising amount of social commentary and wisdom for the modern woman. This wonderfully original slant on the old fairy tale examines the barriers we erect for ourselves to stop us from really falling in love. The genius of this book is that it comes back to touch you when you're least expecting it, and you realize how true-to-life Crusie's recipe for love can be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!!!","review":"I downloaded this book for my Kindle. It was my first Jennifer Crusie novel and I was not disappointed. Like others I could not put this book down. I related with the characters, I laughed, and I cheered. This book will not disappoint it is up in my Top 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite!","review":"What a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon! I could not put it down. My old favorite was \\"Crazy For You\\" but the characters in \\"Bet Me\\" were so colorful and found myself sympathizing with Min. Is this going to be made into a movie, as the credits in the front of the book suggest?? I sure hope so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does she get the guy? Does she? Just guess!","review":"[spoiler alert!]of course, of course. All the characters are paper cutouts and you know it all in chapter one. Way too predictable. Though this does have the spin of fat girl gets the cute guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a tribute to women bigger than a size 8","review":"A great hilarious read. Again, Crusie nailed the characters. It's different from the typical romance novels where the heroine has a perfect body. This one is bigger than a size 8, and is funny and warm. The hero is hot. You won't be able to put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"This book was so ridiculous I couldn't finish it. The bar scenes the pick-up lines the author described were so trite and phony I felt like it must have been a flash-back to Studio 54. I honestly don't think the author has ever experienced the bar/pick-up/dating scene. It felt as though she was writing about what she thought it would be like and certainly not from any personal experience. I found the situations so unbelievable I laughed out loud. Do some research next time, Ms. Cruise because believe me you are way off base here. I gave it one star because I liked the cover. Read The Devil Wears Prada or the Nanny Diaries instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable fairy tale","review":"I always thought that people tended to stay in their own social econonmic level? Not in this fantasy! Cal happens to be partner in his own business, recieved a Porche for graduating high school, parents are loaded, get the idea? Min is overweight, Cal is perfect ~ yeah right. The story is Predictable. Pretty much it's dialog between Min and Cal. I purchased this book because of the reviews, which were positive, boy was I wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give this a Negative Star?","review":"This could possibly be one of the most poorly written books I've read! I knew it would be fluff before I read it (perfect for an airplane), but this book hit a new low. It is poorly written, with difficult to follow characters and it's boring, boring, BORING. Save yourself a few hours and find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Bets Off","review":"Maybe it's me, but I do not like men who bet, even jokingly, as to whether they'll get a woman in bed. That pretty much blew it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a avid reader, but in opening this book, the story is so confusing and you can't keepup with all the changes and down right boring. Worst book I ever bought. I flat coundn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time, predictable, painfully boring and slow","review":"I can't believe I even lasted to page 218 before giving up and tossing this book into the recycle bin. It was predictable, unrealistic and painfully boring. I won't be trying another Jennifer Criuse book anytime soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick lit with aspirations to feminism","review":"As such, \\"Bet Me\\" makes occasional leaps from the inane to the bizarre. For example, when the protagonist sees her sister in her wedding dress, she thinks she looks like a \\"sex-crazed princess on heroin.\\"I'm not sure what exactly a sex-crazed princess on heroin would look like, but a bride isn't what comes to mind.The author would do well to rethink the dismissal of Hawthorne et. al. that appears on her website."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for beginning and middle, 0 stars for ending","review":"This book started out so good! I was interested in the characters and what they'd get themselves into next. The ending was so contrived and silly - I just kept shaking my head in amazement - it was SO BAD!!! There are no adults ANYWHERE who would do what these characters did in the last couple of pages! How can someone write such interesting and funny characters and then pffffffft in the ending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Chance!!!!!!!!!","review":"Jennifer Crusie is the Jane Austen of Contemporary romance. This is her best book ever. It is a rollercoaster ride of fun, romance, humor, and insight.Calvin is a player, who hasn't got any idea of the kind of woman he wants, as a matter of fact, he's pretty sure he doesn't want one for keeps.Min is a today woman, her mother worries about her weight more than she does. She is independent, has close friends, and is not looking for a permenant relationship.This book has a large cast of quirky secondary characters. Every one is a jewel. I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair.There is not a boring, slow minute in the book.IF you are looking for an excellent way to spend some time, this is it.I loved every character, and the ending was absolutely GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Can't Put it Down","review":"I have read Bet Me several times, I have lost count. I have it in hardcover and paperback. And every time I read it, I want to read it all the way through to the end without stopping for anything. This book would definitely be on my desert island list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I love, love, love this book. I have read it repeatedly and laugh through the whole story each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet Me","review":"This is chick lit at it's best.Cal Morrisey asks Minerva Dobbs to dinner to win a date. While they clash at first, they soon discover they're perfect for each other (not that either will admit it). Add to that infuriating parents on both sides, exes plotting to get them back, Min's sister's wedding, an eight year old nephew who throws-up a lot, a slightly deranged looking cat and some great friends and it's the perfect love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky delightful fun!","review":"This is my favorite Jennifer Crusie book so far. I listened to the audio book and loved every minute of it. The cast of characters are a riot and you can't help but root for Min and Cal to get their act together. Alot of \\"laugh out loud\\" moments and my favorite books are the ones that I never know what is coming in the dialog & it takes me by surprise and makes me laugh at the same time. Charming story!I always listen to audio books on my commute and there are several Jennifer Crusie books available. I wish more authors would follow suit. Makes for a terrific and uplifting drive to and from work.Fun! Fun! Fun! (You'll have strong cravings for Krispie Kreme donuts so have some on hand.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet you you can't put this one down!","review":"This book goes at it from the very beginning and although we can guess what is going to happen for the most part, it will hit a funny bone and make you wanting more!Our characters will step out of the book and won't go back in! I read this book in one sitting!I love Min. She is without a doubt wonderful normal character. I love shoes so I couldn't help but like her! This book is full of laughs and will make you hungry also!You won't regret picking this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bet for a great read","review":"Romantic, funny and sweet -- the perfect weekend read. I was a little disappointed with Jennifer Crusie's last book, but this was a delight from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book is so lame. I bought the Kindle version out of the rave review and the cheap price, but I couldn't believe I was reading a crap like this. It's full of cliche and unrealistic plots and characters. I love reading romance and enjoy watching romantic comedy movie, so I understand it can sometimes consist some coincidences and events just to add that romantic spice. And I think this book has a good potential to go on a movie if it were not so ridiculous and stupid. The characters are one dimensional and the entire story is surrounded with a silly bet, which is alright if the author can develop more depth on her story. The lines just keep jumping from Cal and Min and their silly friends, with coincidences and trashy comments. I gave it two stars for its sometimes funny lines, but other than that this book is totally waste of time. I would have gone for Sophia Kinsella over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fattest","review":"I know I am a very small minority here, but I did not like this book. I found the characters to be flat and boring.Min's food fetish was annoying and, I must say, somewhat offensive. Why is it that the character without the perfect body is obsessed with food and has low self esteem? Is it not possible for a chubby woman to have interests that do not involve taste.Other than the job, which was purely background, Min did nt have a whole lot going for her. Did she travel? What kind of books did she read? Did she have any interests at all? I think her friend was right in saying that she brought nothing to the relationship with Cal.Cal was o.k., though he suffered a similar lack of character development. We know that he is gorgeous and likes to hit and run, but what else has he got?The writer did not show enough of either character to get me truly invested.I do not regret reading this book, but it was my first and last by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, one-dimensional, unlikeable characters - brainless plot","review":"Wow, is this bad! What a waste time! You can't care about the characters because they are so brainless and in-humane you can't make a human connection. Jennifer, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor ebook transcription","review":"Although I am enjoying this story, the transcription errors that riddle this ebook version are driving me crazy. \\"I'm\\" routinely comes through as \\"F'm\\" or \\"T'm\\". There are many other typos that appear to be the result of scanning the book and then failing to check the spellings that resulted. This indicates lousy quality control. The publisher should be ashamed, and Ms. Crusie should demand better treatment of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second timer","review":"I read this book years ago and as soon as I got my kindle I hunted it down. It's just as good the second time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I really liked this book, the characters especially drew me in, and the romance was a really nice, funny, sweet (but a bit long) to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't flow","review":"The story started off ok but it didn't take long for me to wish it would hurry up and be over. Just could not get committed to the story or the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect read <3","review":"'Bet Me' is insanely good!I could read it over & over again.Cal Morrissey = The Perfect Man :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A chubby girl gets a chance!","review":"Minerva Dobbs has self-image issues, which is not shocking considering the grief her mother gives her over every carb she puts in her mouth. Min's a sensible girl with cheeky taste in shoes, and she's met her match in Cal Morrisey, who's hot enough to melt the cherries on her shoes.After being dumped, Min's in a man-hating state of mind the night she overhears her ex bet Cal that Cal won't be able to get \\"frigid\\" chubby Min into bed within a month, and is too furious to hang around and listen to the outcome. So when Cal approaches her a few minutes later, she can only assume the worst.Horrible families, ten-dollar bets, and over-protective friends aren't enough to fight the fates that seem to want Cal and Min together. Bet Me is a wonderfully light and enjoyable read. If I had a rating system, this one would get top marks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I loved this book! It was funny and sweet and hot! I could not put it down! Cal and Min were so cute, determined not to be attracted to each other and constantly assuring the other that they weren't!A definite keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite book-I've read it twice!","review":"I am an avid reader. I read at least one novel per week, usually romance. My favorites are Nora Roberts, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Janet Evanovich, etc. I have read Jennifer Cruise in the past and thought the books were cute reads. When I read this book, I laughed out loud. I loved the characters, they were so real and the dialogue and thoughts were exactly right. This really is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Argh... Chicken Marsala!!!","review":"I like this Jennifer Crusie book. Her main characters weren't perfect and yet still found their prince charmings. I felt that she did a good job connecting Min's weight issues to the insecurities in all of us. I was sick of Chicken Marsala by the end of the book. I agree with other write-ups that this book was not her very best. From the inside cover, I got the feeling that it wasn't Ms. Crusie's favorite either. Even still, she never dissappoints me. She is an outstanding writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This was my first Jennifer Cruise novel and selected because of the large number of positive reviews. Writing was smooth but I didn't really enjoy the storyline. Fat girl gets hot-hunky guy who enjoys watching her eat?? I consider myself a 'fat' girl (I'm about 40# overweight) and I wouldn't consider dating a guy who was smaller than me or kept offering me doughnuts!! The heroine tried on the hero's shirt and couldn't even button it because it was too small on her.I enjoy other author's 'fat' girl romances, such as 'Wishes' by Jude D. and 'Night Play' by Sherrilyn K. because the heros were BIG hot hunky guys and weren't determined to watch the heroine eat. I plan to try to another of Ms. Cruize books and hope for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first and still favorite Crusie book","review":"\\"Bet Me\\" was the first Jennifer Crusie book I ever read. Now, after reading them all, it's still my favorite.I adore Min Dobbs. It's rare to find a main character in chick lit who's overweight and doesn't end up having to lose pounds to get the guy. Plus, Min is funny, sarcastic, and a solid woman. The guy in this (Cal Morissey) is a bit of a cad at first, but he gets to your heart and manages to win you over. And the plot is great- their friends and family remind me much too much of my own sometimes.My only complaint would be that the major sex scene comes fairly late in the novel, but it's worth the wait, and Crusie keeps you laughing and reading until the last page. A great read anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new-to-me winner!","review":"Until recently I haven't had much interest in \\"chick lit\\" or romance novels. A friend recommended that I read Bet Me because I reminded her of the main character, so I took a leap and loved this book. The main character, Min, was a feisty, fun character with a biting wit. I also enjoyed the cast of peripheral characters...Min's friends and those of her unlikely love interest, Cal. Outlandish happenings abound in this book, but that was part of the fun. Above all, Crusie writes great sexual tension that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. I will definitely pick up more Crusie in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"One I can read again and again","review":"I love this book. I have read all of her books, even re-read most, but this one I pick up again and again just so that I can smile while I read it. I read very fast.I enjoy the fact that Min, is a normal, average sized woman who stands up for who she is and doesnt take any crap from Cal, no matter how handsome he is. The conversations/arguments are witty, honest and sometimes make you laugh out loud.Her characters are realistic, the situations they find them selves in are as well. Really, how many times do you find youself with a group of you closest friends and talk about what if. I think that all close groups of friends should have weekly \\"if-dinners\\". The melding of the groups, male and female very honest.I always recommend Crusie, to all my fellow readers, whether it is this book or another of hers. Her stories are witty and heartfelt. They, especially \\"BET ME\\" will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read","review":"Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie is a fairy tale come to life.Minerva Dobbs gets dumped and overhears a bet that sexy Calvin Morrisey makes about her going to dinner with him. The dinner doesn't go very well but they keep getting thrown together.Bet me is a delightful read form beginning to end. Love is never easy but Min and Call show us it's worth it.Bet me is a keeper and a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ebook Translation Not Worth the Money","review":"I bought this book as an ebook for my Kindle, and could have not been more disappointed. It's such an excellent book, but whomever put it into ebook format did not even bother editing it before putting it up for sale. The paragraph formatting is messed up, words like \\"I'm\\" and \\"I've\\", frequently are messed up as \\"Fm\\" and \\"Fv\\", and there is missing punctuation, spaces, and on occasion, entire words were somehow translated into numbers. Don't even bother wasting your money if you want this as an ebook, because it's nowhere near worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I had read all of Crusie's previous books when Bet Me was released and knew I was in for a treat when I bought it. I've since returned to the novel over and over again - I love it and have read it a million times. The storyline is almost fairytale-esqe, with rich descriptions and snappy dialogue. I love reading how Cal falls in love with Min and how they create a relationship against their will. It gives me hope and definitely will have you believing in fate when you finish the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute story","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie's books and loved this one too.

This being his final contribution, is outstading, nothing short of fantastic. The \\"Final Sessions\\" selections only cover about 2% of the songs written by J.D., but each selection is special in its on way. Once again, J.D. brings us nothing but the very best in male quartet four part harmony. The Grammy folks really missed the boat by not awarding this work as \\"best of\\" in the Southern Gospel category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found this jem by accident","review":"I was looking through amazon and found this series by accident. Loved it and have several seasons. Funny and thought provoking. The rememberances of the old guys are really for those who lived in England and were up on current affairs in the 80's, although you can pretty well follow along if you are an Americna like me. A decent series, that we have enjoyed and look forward tot he next seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stress_Judo","review":"I am a huge fan of this show. I love shows that are character driven. This show's characters are so well defined that the stories just flow naturally. The acting and writing are superb.

With New Tricks you must get past the pilot, and probably the first two episodes to see the characters emerge. The writing is superb, subtle, biting at times, and always on spot. The actors' delivery is never contrived, but rather natural and definitely in keeping with the character... this is why you must let the characters imprint you on the first couple episodes. It's wonderful stuff. Wish they had made 10 years worth.

It never came to continental Europe, so I bought this one on spec - and was immediately hooked. Nobody can make this sort of odd premise work like the British can.

The #1 season cost a fortune through an outside vendor and on Amazon Prime. I am an older lady who is hard of hearing. The last two discs said there were subtitles but they wouldn't work and I couldn't hear the dialog. I sent it back and hope to someday get the #1 season without the price gouging. I am surprised Amazon does business with a company that charges so outrageously. I should have ordered from one of the other vendors and now probably will. Amazon is my most favorite place to purchase almost everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acting Carries the Day","review":"Whomever is writing these stories is like a Twinkie manufacturer that produces a lot of nutritional fluff that is slightly filling to start out with but just as you get to the heart of the confectionary you find they left out the filling - it's just air. So these stories start out seemingly to fill you but when you get to the end, it just deflates like an empty Twinkie balloon. The writers do not know how to create a drama with a memorable, rather than forgettable finish. Each episode had a predictable, bland uncreative closure to it's plot.Two stars only because the acting and character portrayal, even though unrealistically off-the-wall, ends up holding the stories together. In particular, the dialogue portion of the script was typical British sarcastically spot on. As an aside, I miss the secretary officer, PC Clark after this first year because he portrayed the only rational, sensible police official."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show !","review":"\\"New Tricks\\" is a great show full of laughs and touching story lines - they are a terrific group This is only the first season and i plan to get the other seasons as well.I received this dvd set in great time and condition and for a great price.

I was honestly looking forward to it, and it was truly lacking in anything worthy of praise. The acting was awful. The writing was worse. The music consisted of one song, and it was a bad song. I watched this with several people and we were all left with the same impression that this was a poorly constructed movie. The only thing that is even slightly worthy of praise would be the premise. It does have an interesting premise, but unfortunately the story was not told in such a way that would make me recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Cover Art...","review":"unfortuneately, that's the best thing about this movie. The special effects are lame. The acting is subpar, some of which can be blamed on the director (very poor camera angles). How people gave it a 5-star is beyond me. Must be friends and relatives of the cast. For a low-budget film, I might consider it a 2-star. But, I just had, had to bring down that 3 1/2 overall rating. Movies rated that highly should offer much, much more regardless of budget constraints. I'm spending good money and want to be assured that when a film gets a decent review that it offers good entertainment in return. This one did not. Sometimes it's best to listen to those 1 & 2 star reviewers. That was the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie EVER","review":"Like with this review, don't waste your time. I give this a Negative 10 (-10) on a scale of 1 to 10, It must have taken a week to shoot the movie and about a thousand dollar budget.

I wish I could think of any redeeming qualities but I can't.There was only one sympathetic character and his whiney attitude soon made me want to punch him in the face.

I wish I would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good low budget movie","review":"This is one of those rare \\"teen\\" thriller titles that is actually quite original and well put together. The story deals with a lot of sci-fi elements, somewhat like those films Charles Band put out a few years back on the defunct \\"Pulse Pounders\\" label.I rented this thinking it was probably an average (at best) film, but the story draws you in and doesn't let go. The acting is above average for a low-budget film, and the characters are well written. The CGI special effects are numerous and quite realistic, especially when you consider this did not have a budget anywhere near what the latest 'Lord Of The Rings' or 'Star Wars' movies had.I liked this movie enough to buy it for my collection, after previously renting it.

To all who rated this a great movie... Grrrrr! I can't even begin to express the suckworthiness of this movie. The plot is used up and old. The characters are way out of synch, come on, mild mannered hippie chick finds some mindtoys to play with and next thing you know she transforms into an alpha personality with an Austin Powers wardrobe!?! What? Special effects budget was $19.99 and that got them three flashlights and a free copy of photoshop. Acting was actually pretty good... nah, it sucked. But there was an unexpected twist to the end and that would have been that I turned it off before the end. Ok, so this is my opinion and I reserve my right to it. All those who oppose my opinion are completely right as they have the freedom to there own. So don't go trying to trash me cuz I think that this movie is better seen while asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Mighty Mouse","review":"I've had three Mighty Mouses for my iMac, and after this last one, I decided no more. They all work just fine until they get dirty and quit working. Apple, in their infinite wisdom and greed, made these so that they can't be cleaned without breaking into them and dealing with the incredibly intricate interior components, and then putting them back together with Super Glue. So when it happened this last time, I just went out to OfficeMax and bought a wired Logitech m110 for $17.11 (incl tax). It works just fine, plus is hugely cost effective, considering what Apple charges for their Mighty Mouse. This is the first time since 1984 that I've encountered an Apple product that sucks--I hope this isn't a trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped on \\"the slow boat from China\\"!","review":"Although 321 Express (where this item was ordered) told they are located in Oregon, this item took 3 weeks and one day to arrive in Michigan BECAUSE it arrived directly from Beijeng China in a mailing envelope with no paper work, and no manufacturer's number on the item. The roller ball on the Mighty Mouse does not move the scroll bar to the left as it should. I would never have ordered from this 321 Express [ironic name] had I known ahead of time how long it would take. Who would have dreamed it was going to be shipped directly from China? The shipping was only $4.99, but we did not know that would put our item on \\"the slow boat from China\\". The shipping time was not known until AFTER the order was placed.

Although I got a pretty great price for such technology, it was VERY used and dirty, and I find now after using it that it it obviously slightly broken. I've worked with many mighty mouses before and this one was defective. It makes the cursor jump around on the screen, and does not do anything very smoothly. Good thing I kept my magic mouse, I will be more careful in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I've used various multi-button mouses over the years and would hardly call any one \\"perfect.\\" The best feature of the Mighty Mouse is the tiny scroll-ball. It is much more intuitive than a track wheel, and gives the user unparalled control. Not crazy about the side buttons, but this has been an issue on every multi-button mouse I have used. The Mighty Mouse is definitely the best-looking mouse I have ever seen. Overall, a solid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mouse","review":"It was the most horrible mouse I ever bought.It has of course wonderful design, nut disgusting functionality. As it is designed actuallt as one button mouse it keeps mistaking which button you are actually pressing. The roller is too small so it frequently miss your rotating, and you have to use more power, so you get some of the mouse buttons mistakely pressed. The cord is too short, so you can put it just near your mac. I got rid of it, and using my old mouse, and really amazed who convinient it was... It always gives me the correct button i am pressing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an awful product","review":"This is simply an awful product. Even the reviews on the MAC website concur with this opinion.The problems are numerous: the cord is too short, the right-click button is difficult to consistently find/use, the scroll button broke after two months, and the two side buttons have NO USE whatsoever. In fact, the two side buttons take so much effort to press, I only used them a couple days because my wrist was becoming sore.This is a product that should be avoided at all costs. The scroll button breaking issue has been reported by numerous users on reviews here and on MAC - this is not a fluke. I have nothing good to say about this product except that it looks nice.... but I'd take an ugly functional mouse over a pretty poorly-designed mouse any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to use, and the scroller gets stuck.","review":"This is hands down the worst mouse I've ever used. I'm a programmer at a design agency, so we all use Macs, including this mouse. Repeatedly using this mouse over many hours cramps my hand, wrist, and shoulder on my right side. I recently worked overtime on a Flash website, and at the end of the deadline my hand was so cramped it was painful to extend my first finger.Aside from the less than optimal mouse shape, the biggest problem is the scroll dot. The more use your mouse gets, the more likely it is to stick so you can't scroll at all. You can unstick it by holding the mouse upside down and vigorously rolling the ball in all directions. However, despite doing that regularly, I still have problems scrolling up with it. It takes more force to scroll up now, which cramps your hand and stresses your wrist.I do not recommend this mouse for anybody who uses a computer more than a few hours a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighty Lame","review":"The scroll ball is a good idea, and I enjoyed it while it lasted, but mine isn't working anymore after just 1 month. Otherwise, the mouse is ergonomically awkward, feeling more like a plastic potato rather than a computer device. The side buttons are touchy and can be accidentally triggered when moving the mouse. The mouse lacks a defined left and right button too, leaving you to control-click to get contextual menus.Here's a tip -- get a better designed, 2 button mouse with a scroll-wheel. If you need to scroll horizontally, press SHIFT on the keyboard, then use the scroll wheel. If it's all configured correctly, you can scroll horozontally through the window. Apple markets this mouse as the only one that lets you scroll horizontally, but this is not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to use this mouse without an extension USB cord","review":"The cord on this mouse is so short that I am unable to use it with my Apple lap top. I am right handed and all of the USB ports are on the left side. The cord isn't long enough to go around my computer to the other side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"Buy this product once, regret it for the rest of the time you own it. Yet another example from Apple of a beautiful piece of design with no regard for functionality. Scroll ball frequently fails, making using this $50 piece of garbage a blistering frustration. I'm using one right now and can't scroll at all, up or down. Right-clicks are often not recognized. You'll end up wanting to throw this thing out the window. Save yourself, your money, and your blood pressure. Avoid all Apple peripherals. They are famous for failing. IMO, this is yet another monumental abdication of responsibility to a loyal customer base. Strongly recommend boycotting this company until it acquires a conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"Wherever Apple's brand is connected with quality and good design, it won't hold here. A mouse is hardly -what you would call- the product of advanced engineering, yet Apple managed to produce something so useless, it resides on my desk with a scrollwheel, that was never meant to give you good grip, and that's now jammed. I won't even go into the details of randomly swapping clicks. Yes, i know Macs have no need for a right-click button. Should it not work properly then for only that reason?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"1. it doesn't differentiate very well between right and left clicks2. the scroll thingy gets clogged and won't scroll down any moreother wise it's great, it would be great I mean, if it weren't a defective design, apple seems to always want to sell stuff before it's ready, maybe in a year or 2 you'll be able to buy a functional mighty mouse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple should admit defeat for this attempt!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Apple stuff; and part of my passion stems from having something more unique. Unfortunately when it comes to this \\"mighty\\" mouse, Apple failed miserably. It's hard to imagine how bad it can be, given all the versions and trial data available since the original 2-button Microsoft serial mouse. Lets face it, an input device behaves the same regardless of whether it's plugged into a PC or Mac. You certainly didn't Apple make an attempt to change the layout of a QWERTY keyboard. So how come Apple did not take all the lessons learned from the likes of Microsoft (HW division) and Logitech and come up with something better? Instead, you get this piece of junk that's neither ergonomic or convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Wait!","review":"Hey, I feel this is like a BIG step back.

THEN I'll buy one! Meanwhile I'll continue to use my old Microsoft Intelli Mouse.Now I'm a little dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so mighty about this?","review":"Finally someone at Apple realized that a single button mouse was not enough for the complex tasks so they decided to put a bunch of designers to create something completely new. Something no one has ever seen. A mouse with two buttons and a 'special' button that allows you to go multi directions. At a bargain for just a bit under $50.For $50 you get a super duper high tech mouse that has so much precision that you can get a whopping gazillion dpi for dead on accuracy. But don't go looking for that spec in their website. It's super secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"World\\"s Worst Mouse","review":"This mouse is without a doubt the worst mouse I've owned in the past 20 years, and I've used a lot. I've used it on an iMac for the past four years, and it constantly presents problems, such as:1. The side buttons are very difficult to squeeze and have no clear function anyway.2. The rollerball becomes dirty and freezes after short periods of use. Even when I get it working again after a thorough cleaning, it works erratically in controlling the scrolling.3. The mouse uses up batteries at an alarming rate.4. The mouse is grossly overpriced. I can get a reliable USB wireless mouse for half as much.With this mouse, Apple appears to have indulged its cleverness in design without paying any attention to usability, reliability, and functionality. This one belongs in the iApple Hall of Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a two button mouse","review":"The product review claims, \\"...detect where you're clicking, transforming your sleek, one-button mouse into a two-button wonder.\\" To use the right hand click on this mouse, one must remove the left part of your hand from the mouse or it will register as a normal click. This is extremely inconvenient. Next time Apple should try to make a true two button mouse or change the logic of their software. I shouldn't have to change how I use my mouse to accommodate a product with a UI flaw.-Opinion from a new mac user"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to the Apple Family.","review":"I have nothing but good things to say about this product. It is excellent at scrolling, the buttons are placed nicely, and it is the same size as the standard mouse that ships with all new macs.

Come on!!!!","review":"One thing apple lacks is the ability to design a mouse that is easy to control. At first I thought it was cool, apple came out with a mouse that had 2 buttons with the scroll plus the squeezable sides. First thing I did was turn off the sides, I could just grab the mouse and it would activate the sides. I also have a problem with the scroll ball it's way too sensitive!Now I wish I would have spent have the money and bought a Logitech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also an apple fan, also disappointed.","review":"The scroll ball, is horribly designed.If your finger is even slightly damp, it will stop working.Finally one day it just refused to scroll down anymore.

I like the programmable scroll button and the feel and size of the mouse. I like the quiet whirring the scroll ball makes when I spin it.Ultimate downside:So why 2 stars? Well, maybe mine's a fluke, but after two weeks of standard business use, my scroll ball has stopped working. I consider that unacceptable and it makes me think seriously about returning (not exchanging!) the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this thing","review":"i'll keep this short:i hate this mouse....im using it right now. ive cleaned the ball twice this morning, and it still won't scroll. it worked fine for about two months, then the problems started. the two side buttons are useless and difficult to push in. it is overpriced and has never functioned right after those first two months."},{"rating":"2","title":"mice.....","review":"works pretty well, not as well as I would expect a mighty mouse to work but it gets the job done.

However, I use one every single day at school. The scroll ball never jams or stalls. It works perfectly.I simply do not see what is the complaint with it. These mice are used in a public computer lab for hours upon hours every day, but even they keyboards fare worse than the mighty mouse. The scroll is natural and effortless. These are well over a year old and they do not give us any trouble.The reason I only gave it 4 stars (though 4.5 is more accurate) is that the squeeze is a bit stiff generally, and the right click is somewhat awkward as you cannot have your finger resting on the left side as you click. It's easy enough to adjust to however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But, has some flaws","review":"I absolutely love this mouse. As I didn't get it from the store, my dad gave it to me, I only have a few complaints. I have noticed that if you push hard on it sometimes, it will trigger the mouse to activate the dashboard for some odd reason. The scroll wheel is also great cause you can easily navigate pages that have both horizontal and vertical scroll bars, however, sometimes after a lot of use, it won't scroll down. I have just wiped it with my sleeve and it works fine again. Besides these 2 complains, this is a great mouse to use and will use it till I get enough money to get a magic mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks alot","review":"I use this item at work. So far in the span of about 2 months, 2 of them have broken, meaning the middle ball stopped scrolling downward.Another complaint I have is that the left and right mouse click isn't reliable because they actually aren't separate buttons.

I am now on my third mouse (replaced free from Apple) because the scroll ball quits scrolling one direction (the current one which i've only had for one week no refuses to scroll up). It also periodically quits working all the time. And because of the fabulous design, I can't take the mouse apart to do any cleaning.Because of the single button design, I have a hard time getting the right click to work half of the time.Lastly, for some reason, if I turn the mouse on while the computer is already up and running, the Bluetooth won't recognize the mouse (it has no problem recognizing the keyboard).

Not only is this thing overpriced, it is also terribly designed. The Design. Be careful, after 2 months of using it, its pretty much injured my wrist. I've never had this problem with even the cheapest 2 dollar USB mouse out there. The Tracking. Absolutely horrible. There are times when you don't know why there's tracking delay, even though the battery is full. You make adjustments on the setting and it pretty much mess up the tracking even more. Its extremely frustrating because you can't fix this problem even by replacing the battery.. I now have two generations of Macs and the only reason why I have them on both occasions is because this thing comes with the box, and the same problems goes with both.

Apple should be thoroughly ashamed of producing such a defective design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple really messed up with this mouse.","review":"I dont know if they have something against real two button mice or what, but please, this one is just horrible. Its tricky to get the right click to work. You have to press in just the right place or it doesnt work. The little microscopic ball thats suppose to be the scroll wheel isnt doing much for me either. I work a lot with my hands so they are pretty rough. A lot of time when I roll my finger across the ball to scroll, my finger rolls across it but the ball doesnt move. Just buy a good two button mouse and you will be better off. Please try again apple, I hope the second attempt is the charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all very nice - but...","review":"Apple finally did, though there's been a bit speculation about this for a couple of months now. Got mine today, and yes its much better that my old one. Not only the buttons and trackball, but the mouse seems to track better. The right click works great, no issues with touching the left side. The trackball makes a subtle sound when moving it, which add to the effect, very cool. Ok, now not so good, which has to do with the software, hopefully this will improve, but the button assign options are to few and not too useful, you can assign to Expose, Dashboard...

This album was recorded in Willie Nelson's studio, and you can definitely detect a bit of folk/country flavor on this album. The song Rock Bottom Riser is a complete standout. I would say that if you are new to Smog this as good as any point to jump in, as all of his works are pretty consistent.

His Vegas show is a glorified lounge act that's okay, not spectacular. While his imitations of Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole, and Rod Stewart were very good, they were only 3 in a litany of more than 25 voices he attempted to do - most sounded the same, and nothing like the original.

Is there a movie that is better than all the rest? In my opinion, BEN-HUR is the Best. It is the story of how a man learns that to live by love is much more beneficial than trying to do so filled with hate. It shows how God's love overcomes all. Ben-Hur,s faith gets him through many tough trials, although there are times when he almost looses it. One thing in the movie that really impressed me was: whenever they portrayed Jesus, His face was not shown. They showed His kindness, generosity, and love by what He did and by the reactions of others and the looks on their faces. There is some romance involved and some history and much Bible; and the famous horse race; one good line I appreciated was \\"don't treat my horses like animals!\\" This movie will arise most of your emotions:Love, hate, comedy, fear; also include loyalty and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Widescreen and Panoramic Views","review":"I was happy to get a copy of this DVD movie that I have seen so many times on VHS video in the past.

Wondefully produced and acted, the chariot race has never been surpassed. Even though it is a long film, it's never dull due to the fact that the stars themselves gave such good performances throughout. The final twenty minutes are very emotional, and the final scene when Ben-Hur sees his mother and sister cured must rank as one of the finest. It deserved its oscars and will never be beaten for style and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype","review":"This epic masterpiece certainly deserves the lavish four-disc treatment.

Unfortunately, it doesn't translate well into this latest DVD release. Most of these issues are purely technical, but are profound enough to disappoint this reviewer. First the movie was set in the original movie screen format. Although sure to please most purists, it appears disturbingly tiny even on a widescreen TV. Second, several scene changes are rough and it seems as though the film master from which they recorded this version had some bad cuts in it.A film of this magnitude deserved to be released on two discs rather than the dual-sided single disc it presently appears on. Apart form these \\"minor\\" issues, Ben-Hur appears in all of its glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rememberance","review":"I saw this movie when I was 6 or 7 years of age.

Louis B Mayer was named vice president of the new company and a 25 year old \\"boy wonder\\" Irving Thalberg was named head of production. The studio chose for its mascot a roaring lion and the phrase \\"Ars Gratia Artis\\": \\"Art for Art's Sake\\". The studio was called Metro Goldwyn Mayer. A year later the studio and Thalberg scored their first triumph with Ben Hur. The film set the standard for exelence on which MGM made its reputation.With fine acting from Ramon Navvaro, Technicolor sequences, and the great chariot race, this silent classic is still impressive today and is included in this set. As a bonus, you also get the crappy 1959 remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sundayschool with gay tendencies?","review":"This movie is one Big mistake. It's at least twice as long as it should be (You just spend ten minutes listening two the opening music, before anything happens. I first thought it was some sort of mistake. When the story finally gets started you just wish you were back with the music.) The sentimentalism and the corny-ness of the plot defie all imagination. It reminds me of the Christmas tales my teachers used two read for a bunch of five-year olads and even then I was bored out of my skull. To enliven it the hero-villain relationship borders n the homsexual, but even that goes precisely nowhere.In the whole movie there are only two parts that bear watching: The sea-battle and the chariot-race. For the rest, forget about it. There are a lot of actors, who try, but there just is no way to make this movie interesting. If they scale it down to 100 minutes that would be an improvement. It shouldn't be too difficult. After all, the rest isn't worth watching anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"ancient tripe","review":"this movie is a pathetic attempt at a film. true films contain drunken revelers wondering where their money went when it is ridiculously obvious that no one has left the table the money was sitting on. apparently, during the cutaway, the scenes that are not currently onscreen are frozen. welcome to spring break has this scene, and i hope you will support it instead of this charleton heston garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture, not perfect","review":"There are several scenes that are not super clear - seems reasonable for a 50+ year old movie.

By more authentic I mean that in one scene in the '25 version a lady is romancing a man and she has a ridiculously 1920's hairstyle (probably to appeal to contemporary audiences). This is all that takes away from an otherwise brilliantly done silent film starring Ramon Navarro as Judah Ben-Hur. The scenes where Judah is taken away from his mother and sister by the evil Messala (Francis X. Bushman) are poignant and memeorable. I understand part of this movie was shot in Italy. Very good use of Christ as a (supremeley important) supporting character in this film and nice scenes early on of the lady playing the Virgin Mary as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynics beware!","review":"In an age where mass-produced cynicism casts a suspicious eye on virtually all aspects of life, Ben-Hur is still a masterpiece of cinema that, after all these years , has at it's center a thoughtful human drama that is still capable of resonating within the collective of human experience.Thankfully, the film doesn't allow itself to become weighted down by it's religious themes. These serve mostly as a backdrop for the film's more character-oriented narrative in which the entire range of human emotions is encapsulated.Surely this is one of the greatest movies ever made as it's longevity has bourne out over the harshest test of all: time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated? No, timeless.","review":"Is the movie completely realistic? No. But neither are movies made today. Remember that it's storytelling -- and in the case of Ben-Hur, grand storytelling.One more point: Although I enjoy the computer graphics of modern blockbuster movies, I must say that I'm far more impressed by the logistics, direction, stunt-work, and sheer scale of the chariot race scene than by anything I've seen in the Matrix or Terminator films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully restored to a cult","review":"A picture very bright, very detailed and beautifully decorated.

But the payoff was equally grand: Heston's Oscar-winning performance and a hefty box-office gross validated the costs of operating on such a vast canvas. It is also epic filmmaking at its best, featuring a mesmerizing escape at sea and the most thrilling, heart-poundingly authentic chariot race ever seen on film--at 20 minutes, no less! Majestic in scale, yet sensitive in its portrayal of a vengeful man touched by his encounters with Christ, \\"Ben-Hur\\" is a monumental entertainment directed with unwavering commitment and faultless taste by old pro William Wyler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben-Hur","review":"IMO. Arguably the best movie of all time. Aside form the obvious merits of the movie itself, this Ultimate Collector's Edition is a steal at this price. It comes in a very handsome box(serial numbered).

The other larger hard cover book has absolutely gorgeous artwork and alone is worth the price of this kit. The Blu-Rays look spectacular and have great sound.

BEN-HUR is a wide-screen extravaganza that saves all its serious paint for the action scenes. The plot may be thin, the characters shallow and the acting majestically wooden, but director William Wyler really knew how to paint in the wide screen corners. The famous chariot race is one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed.How big? Consider this - of the eleven Academy Awards won by this one, the Supporting Actor winner Hugh Griffith didn't even first appear until an hour and forty minutes into the movie, a time when most good movies have gone to bed.This movie really needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can put it on. The actors' nostril should be as big as hubcaps when they're shot in close-up.

If anything, Ben Hur surpasses expectations. Charlton Heston is brilliant and Jack Hawkins also stands out. This is a superb character study of a man tormented who struggles between the desire for revenge and the need to do what is right. Look for a terrific scene in the galley of a Roman ship where a military commander (Hawkins)drives Ben Hur to new levels of brutal achievement, while the two characters communicate solely by eye contact.

The pictures of Hestons family on the set showed his family ties."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Film to measure all other \\"Bible\\" films","review":"Yes I know that its really a great big and grand soap opera. With Mr. Heston being the constant witness to the trial and tributions of the early years of the Roman Empire and the Birth of Christainity.

The technical quality (color, sound, etc.) was outstanding Recommend for the entire family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I must start out that I have only been alive for some 20 years and have not have been privy to the evolution of movies. As an example, I wasn't all that impressed with Citizen Kane when compared to modern day movies. However, I can see how it was a pivotal piece of work that laid the foundation for other movies. This is exactly the same way that I feel about Ben-Hur. While the cinematography and acting are spectacular, the over drama becomes heavy handed when it doesn't advance the story. The whole romantic interest was thrown in to draw more people into the theaters. I feel that more time should have been focused on the actual plot. The movie ponders along and eventually comes back to the story in a lazy manner. If this movie were brought out today, then it would be seen as a valiant effort, but overproduced and bland. Overall, not bad, but not too good."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Help, All the Answers","review":"Edith Beer gives all the answers in clear writing.

It has lived up to all of my expectations, and numbers among my favorite records, not just for Joe Henderson, but for my entire jazz collection, which numbers somewhere around 300 or so items. This definitely falls into the 'late fusion' category, but like other of Joe's work of this period, it capitalizes on funk and spanish rhythms, as opposed to electronic obscuritanism or plain jazz iconoclasm. As a casual student of '70's blaxploitation films, I'll even swear that I heard some of this music in a Fred Williamson film, or something of that ilk. But it is by no means 'sell-out' film music - it is both studied, and accomplished, especially for such a large ensemble.

It is interesting to note that \\"erotica\\" is derived from the name of the Greek god of love, Eros, while \\"pornography\\" is derived from a Greek word \\"pornos\\" that means \\"on the slave market\\" or \\"sold on the slave market.\\" Hence, the higher quality, more artistic, more noble works of titillation are described as erotic. This book, Delta of Venus, defines erotic. There are some passgaes in it that read like music, others that are so subtle, and yet they all arouse the senses and cast an erotic veil around the reader. This book is a feast for the senses. If you want to be turned on, buy this book. If you are seeking the blow-by-blow of Penthouse Letters, go somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I own a copy of a second/third edition of this book...I inherited it from my mother years ago and it is a well written, stunning book of stories covering a wide range of eroticism. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading and rereading this book over the years. I have even read it to some of my guy friends and they are just amazed at the writing that this book contains. They have all gone out and purchased their own copy. Nothing in this book offended me as it is made to convey synopsis in time and what rivets us as human \\"beings\\"...we all think things but this book tells of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Erotica","review":"At the time this erotica was written, it must have been TRULY original, because I do not know of anything like this existing before it, or after. These stories are told so passionately, and I found interest in even the smallest details. These stories stand on their own in many areas, and not just as something to get the reader off. I only wish Anais Nin was still alive! The only modern erotica I've found that I like has been Rescue Me by Megan Clark and The Arch of Desire by Vicente Puelles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual Erotica","review":"If you enjoy slow sweet soft sexuality then this is the book for you. I enjoyed the style of narration used in the third person. Women and Men will find this collection of short stories to be arousing in many ways. The sexual descriptions are bold but not what modern readers would call hard core pornography. A new or used copy of this book will make a welcome addition to your erotic bookshelf. Enjoy.Master Jeaux"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully sensual","review":"I loved this book. It was written in a time when sensual was sexual and it definitely shows through. I prefer Anais Nin's writtings over a lot of more modern authors becauses she focuses on the whole issue. She doesn't just concentrate on sex, she writes about feelings, longings, relationships, fidelity and infidelity making the stories jump out at you and become so much more than just an erotic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and truthful view on sex.","review":"This book was so exciting. Parts of this book were however very sadistic. I think to truly enjoy this book the reader has to be open to the ideas Anais Nin portrays in her book. Two stories were especially provocative. The story of a female body being pulled from a river and being sexually manipulated by a young man was the first. The second was a story of a man being aroused by two very young girls, and how the three of them play together. Otherwise I thought that most of the stories could be anyone's fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly boring","review":"Anais Nin may have pushed back some boundaries in her day, but in the 21st century her writing holds little of value. Reading through the stories in Delta of Venus, I was bored by the repetitiveness, and the undeveloping one-dimensionality of her storylines and characters; her language is powerful and descriptive, but dishonest. It seemed a little sad that the stories' characters were so bound by the limitations of their sexuality. As a writer, she should have brought her characters more to life. The fact that these stories arose out of commissioned porn - if what Nin claims is true - is apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic erotica","review":"After reading Anne Rice's horrible Sleeping Beauty series, I looked around for true erotica, and based on reviews and recommendations, tried out Anais Nin. This is the first (and so far) only book of hers I've ever read. Some of the writing might be a bit dated due to the time period this book was written in, but it's still a classic, with tasteful and exciting stories and descriptions that don't leave one feeling all depressed/disturbed/squicked out. A definite must for anyone who wants a nice piece of erotica reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing text","review":"This is one of Nin's poorer texts. She leaves out her feminine style. In its place, she offers a crude and simplistic story line. I would encourage readers to try some of her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"Anais has got a gift. she knows how to capture your attention, and arouse all of your senses. All of her works are great, but Delta is the one that got me started reading anais' work. this is a great book to read to your lover when you cannot be right there with them, or even when you are right there with them. *wink, wink* Fearless. Bold. Daring. Intrepid. Plucky. all these words are a perfect description of Anais. if you have never read any of Anais' works, i suggest you start with this, or Henrey and June."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Anais Nin is like reaping the field of wild oats","review":"Savory, intense, and pleasantly naughty by many conservative standards, Delta of Venus was given to me as a gift by a very unique and worldly friend. It engaged and entertained me immensely. I was reading this as I flew across the ocean, and felt a bit of a prickling on the back of my neck in the sort of \\"what would the person next to you think if they saw what you were reading\\" vein. Most enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasion, Poetry, Period, and Iconography","review":"Allegorically overwhelming, this work incited literary jealousy in me. I had long avoided her works based on the snobbish assumption that her's was mere lustful, romantic slough. I am an idiot. She puts Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Fitzgerald to shame. So much for ancient white guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like celery you have to develop a taste for the author","review":"Granted Anais Nin is a great author of erotic lit but the author writes to a specific kind of reader.I found the writing to be rather disjointed and if you love digging for truffles, or reading Jane Austen's 'Pride and Predjudice' type of books, you'll probably like this one ...For me, like celery, I can take it or leave it, in this case Ill leave it thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope all erotic fiction is not like this","review":"So, I am not well versed in the world of erotic fiction. Because of the success of a certain Twi-hard bestseller that is several shades of garbage, I have decided to delve into the world of erotica. Well-written erotica that is. So, I have recently been reading the first chapter of some erotic novels to try and find a good one. (The Kindle allows users to read the first chapter of many books for free.) Delta of Venus was on an Amazon list of \\"The Top 25 best erotic fiction\\" so I gave it a go. Two little girls are molested by some Hungarian \\"Baron\\" in the first 25 pages. I mean, come on. Please, can someone suggest an erotic novel that is 1.) written by an author with command of the English language and 2.)not full of deviant sex (rape, child molestation, necrophilia etc.) Can't a novel be well written, sexy and graphic without including whips, chains, inscest and violence? I haven't found one yet. Delta of Venus is certainly not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Ok I got it. I got it after the first 3 stories. Unless you are studying the difference between male and female fantasy, I found the book boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Erotica","review":"As a blogger who writes quirky and unconventional perspectives on LOVE, I am compelled to read what is moving the public. Anais Nin's Delta of Venus was definitely an improvement over Fifty Shades of Grey. However for me, erotica is not personally moving sans the romance. Nin herself writes that sex without love lacks color. Delta of Venus is a series of short sex stories. I stayed with it anticipating that one of the essays would capture my attention. Instead I was once again disappointed in reading about atypical sexual perversions void of emotion. More interesting is to consider how scandalous Delta of Venus was in the context of the tImes. Howard Roarke in the Fountainhead got me going more than the characters in 50 Shades of Grey and Delta of Venus. Back to writing on ILoveYouOften.com, an optimistic reality check on love and relationships and other good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lushly erotic and provocative.","review":"Looking for erotica that is not too far over the edge into bizarre? Although the language in the book is quaint due to the era in which it was written, it is still lushly erotic and perfect for reading to your significant other. Nin's writing style draws the reader into a private world of erotic pleasures, with detailed yet tasteful descriptions of wonderfully sensual scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luscious Anas strikes again","review":"\\"He did not know that when the erotic and the tender aremixed in a woman, they form a powerful bond, almost a fixation,\\"and contrary to Pierre, one of her characters, Anas Nin can write a full doctoral dissertation on the matter. Teeming superlative eroticism and sensuality, Delta of Venus is the pre-eminent anthology of luxury from a feminine panorama, wherein each and every one of the rich though not-necessarily-explicit details are contemplated to the extreme. Prolific with lascivious, quixotic imagination, the fanciful and mystical substance of Nin's writings prove unfailing to delight the most passionless of readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A celebration of love, life & lust!","review":"A truly brilliant and breath-taking fusion of the art of writing and the art of love making. I have read and re-read this book countless times and each time discovered something new about it - like a precious gem when held in the sun, gives out a different shine with every turn and twist, each distinct from the previous yet equally dazzling! A note of caution, this book is not for the devout conventionalists! Everyone else, read it! you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nasty and languid","review":"_Delta of Venus_ is one of the few books in my smut library that I reread. If you're attracted to the world she writes in (Paris in the early 40s, everyone smokes opium and lounges about wearing silk chiffon), it is a voluptuous dream and a serious turn on. If you're not, then you will be bored by the long descriptions of lips and thighs and smells and head trips. Some of the sex is scary-freaky, but you're so stoned by the prose you can't get too worried. I love making a little gift of this to lovers, with a sexy, nasty note in the flyleaf. Which is entirely in the spirit of the book. Spray it with some of your perfume first."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"Apparently these pornographic novels was a commissioned work for an unknown book lover in Paris. Anas Nin seems to have an inclination towards describing sexual scenes bordering on tabu areas like violence and incest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is the second of her books I have read. I will not purchase anymore. I found it rather boring as I did her first book. Unfortunately I purchased both books at the same time. I would not recommend. There are so many more ... books out there that are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 50 cents I've ever spent","review":"I found a beautiful red hardcover copy of DELTA OF VENUS in a Red Cross Op-Shop.I paid 50 cents for it.It is now my favourite book.Seriously beautiful, poetic, intellectualised erotica.Overflowing with rich and sensuous imagery.It takes you away to another time and place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected something deeper","review":"I guess I was expecting better writing from Nin. I have heard so many good things about her writing and I have read a few books by one of her \\"good friends\\", Henry Miller, that I decided to pick up Delta of Venus and was a bit disappointed. In the introduction Anais Nin describes the conditions under which she wrote much of what is contained in this book. Some wealthy \\"collector\\" had commissioned erotica at the rate of $1/page and he was not interested in anything but the physical act of sex. Well, Nin delivered. Much of the content is the description of various sexual situations and lacks what I would consider art. Reading Delta of Venus I felt like I was reading a more tasteful version of Letters to Penthouse. I must admit, this is my first exposure to Nin so I am not saying she is not a gifted author. I understand she was commissioned to write stories of this nature, I'm just saying I expected something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated Erotica","review":"Delta of Venus represents a new approach to an old literary form. Erotica has occupied the minds of women and men since the human race was created. Anais Nin has taken the telling of this style of entertainment to a new level. Unlike some recent releases about the sexual relationships between men and women, the writing does follow the rules of grammar without losing any of the excitment and intensity of the images the words create.This is a book for those of us who like erotica but are sick of the poor execution of the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woderful","review":"This is truly one of the best in erotic literature if not THE best. She casts a spell over the reader and creates a world in which the most erotic and forbidden is plausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nin knows how to write erotica","review":"This book is quite special. THe stories are sublte and poetic and not hard to take at all. I liked this volume of erotica better than the next. Nin got paid a dollar a word for these stories, she should have gotten more. Also read, Story of O, Vox by Baker and Lip Service by Rose"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is a great book. I first discovered this book, when I was young, in my mothers dresser. Anis Nin had such a style that has always distinguished her work from just porn. She has an erotic beauty in her work. Who needs pictures?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of Feminist Writers","review":"I totally disagree with the reviewer who says that Ms. Nin doesn't vye for female rights. The stories in DoV show women as empowered. In those tales where they let go of their \\"empowerment\\" it is only, as you will notice, for a short time. The natural state of females in this text is sexually subversive, creative and soulful beings. Words like wanton harlot are hurled by threatened males on the make...Ms. nin will last for all time...because she summons the essence and sublime beauty of Venusian power like no other woman writer has before or since. Thanks God for Ms. Nin especially in this day and age when the desexualization of our entire culture by the cyber age has made sensuality and true erotica like DoV a thing of the past..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, Dsiturbing with some rape of young children.","review":"I have read this book twice now. Trying to understand why anyone would think it to be wonderful, beautiful, sensual or erotic. It is just the opposite. I don't care what time period it was writing in! I am open minded but there is just some stuff that is JUST PLAIN SICK! She writes beautifully but i don't think genital mutilation, raping kids or necrophilia is OK! Not to mention incest or both sexes. IF YOU ARE A SICK HUMAN BEING THAT LIKES HAVING SEX WITH YOUR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS, CHILDREN OR DEAD BODIES THAN HAVE AT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand why this book is so boring","review":"Hmm - why is this book such a bore? Surely the appeal of erotica is in reading about things that cannot normally be discussed; ideas that would not normally be thinkable, behaviour that would not normally be permissable. So what does it say when none of the sad packs appearing in these short stories manage to bring forth any concepts which are novel, surprising or confronting? Incest, necrophilia, exhibitionism all get a look in, but in a way which is unappealing - the book seems to assume an audience with the traditional Western attributes of repressed sexuality, a belief that sex in sinful, and hatred of the human body. To answer my own question, the implicit assumptions that pleasure is evil, sexuality is sinful and that people are ugly, is what makes it a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS BOOK!","review":"I tore this book to shreds after I read it. Though the book is charming at times and intelligent once or twice, it is built on the premise that only the unfamiliar is erotic. Nin has written the same basic story over and over here: woman encounters stranger, has sex with stranger, experiences epiphany. I wanted nothing more than to stop reading, or to discover something truly erotic within the stories -- trust me. It isn't there. DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Book Ever","review":"This was the worse book I ever read!!! Nothing but a bunch of bizard sexual stories that go no where.

It requires a thoughtful read to absorb its details and mindset that stresses the myriad dangers arising from old, sloppy installations. The book's thoroughness teaches the novice to recognize limits. It is worth many times its price for making the homeowner intelligible on electrical concepts and terms, a useful skill to have when consulting with professionals. I've been reading it on and off for years, and always gain new insights.

If I like it doesn't depend on the songs but on the general sound of the album. And this album sounds great, the songs are great and the spirit is great. The only thing I didn't like was the playlenghth of the album = much too short. I'm not a rich man so I've been in doubt for some time if I would buy it. But the temptation was too great.

I would recommend this to any beginners or advanced players, cause its a great all around weapon, especially for indoor warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful!","review":"Since day one of hearing The Lucy Nation's song \\"Alright\\", I have been in love with their music. I have searched and searched for their album until now and I am so VERY happy that it has finally come out.

Will replace the rest with this model as they fail (which reviews indicate they will)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product..","review":"This was a great product easy to install.

I bought a six pack of the same model number and two of these because I needed eight total. The six pack works great and are fine. These, however, didn't even have any wire hooking the 9v battery up to the alarm AND the 9v battery area was too small to even hold the battery. Totally ridiculous!!!But the same model in the six pack were all wired correctly and housed the battery correctly. Must be a diff manufacturer for the singles. Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It BEEPS all the time!","review":"After reading all of the positive reviews, I bought 6 of these smoke alarms for my home. Installation was very quick and easy. My husband installed all 6 (according to the instructions) within an hour. It has been two weeks now, and EVERY DAY at random times during the day (3am, 4pm, 9am) for no reason at all, each smoke alarm BEEPS. The sound is piercing and has woken us up in the middle of the night on several occasions. We've read the instructions and even contacted the company about the erratic beeping and were told that it \\"may happen from time to time.\\" Unfortunately, we threw out the boxes, so we cannot return the alarms to amazon. If anyone has sleeping children, I suggest you buy a different alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to install needs no battery.","review":"My house came wired with about 12 of these with the battery back-up. Since the 9 volt battery is supposed to power the entire system when electricity is lost they must be replaced fairly frequently. They test at about 8.25 volts when required to be replaced. I have purchased a couple of these non-battery units to replace the ones in the cathedral ceiling that requires a ladder to replace and will invariably start chirping at 2am on a cold winters morning. I have also replace the one in our unheated attic which suffers the same fate.As long as I can get to the unit I'll stick with the battery back-ups but for those hard to reach places these electric models as a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, landlord didn't even notice I changed smoke detectors","review":"I bought one of these because it was easier than getting the landlord in to replace a defective smoke detector. It plugged directly into the old wiring, but the mounting ring was a slightly different size than the old smoke detector. Not a big deal, it still only took me five minutes to install. This communicates with the others in the house, just like the old one (i.e., when one signals smoke, they all do).Note that this one does not have a battery, so you must have house power to it. I'm not saying that's bad or good, it just depends on what you need (in my case, I was happy to not have to worry about a battery)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no back up","review":"i was very disappointed to realize there was no battery back up! what happens when the power is out before the fire starts or during the fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far they're good","review":"My 10 year old BRKs started false alarming (naturally at 3 A.M.) Time to replace them. I read lots of bad reviews about BRK - lots of bad reviews about the other brand; so I went with BRK due to ease of replacement. The new ones have a latching feature so that I can determine which one of the five detectors caused the alarm. So far they are just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than those with a battery!","review":"I had the other model with a battery in all of our rooms.

Don't waste your money on this movie like I did! The soft porn scenes are horrible not hot! There is like 1 or 2 hot girls but they can't act to save their life! It's more of a comedy, because you laugh at the horrible acting. I was highly dissapointed especially that I had wasted my money on something so corney!

I don't even think guys would get off to this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Erotica","review":"This is excellent lesbian erotica.

Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful.","review":"This movie is awful. The sex scenes need a ton of help, as the women are awful \\"lovers\\". In one scene, the girl who is receiving just lays on the bed and doesn't move. You would see more movement from a blow up doll. It's also pathetic how they tried to make some of these girls butch. It just doesn't work. And, the most attractive girl in the entire movie is Shelby. If you want some real action, check out [...] Don't waste your money on this movie.

They stumbled badly when the decade of the 90s rolled around. In my mind, their last classic album was Beyond Belief, and though every album since has had its high points, none has been consistently great. Now comes Double Take, an album that tries to change their big arena rock sound into an acoustic, 90's vibe. For the most part, it doesn't work, and, at times, is even painful to listen to. Unfortunately, it sounds like Petra is determined to reinvent itself for each subsequent generation. After two decades of success, their chameleon act has run out of magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, Petra's lost it","review":"After hearing this CD I've decided I'm probably not going to be in a hurry to buy any more music from them.

They haven't been on WOW for a few years either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD!","review":"I am amazed at reading the other reviews trashing this CD or Petra in general. I wonder if they forget that Petra is a _Christian Rock_ band, and wonder about their attitudes towards Petra - they're not acting very Christian in their vile reviews of this CD, but acting just like some worldly spoiled brats.That said! I enjoy this CD. My favorite track is \\"This Means War\\", and I like the way things flow.I would recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"the downward spiral continues","review":"Since No Doubt (our music wimped out), Praise 2, God Fixation, and now Double Take, this band gets worse and worse every new release and sounds more like teeny-bop rock (i.e. Christianized Hanson) than the creative powerhouse they were in the eighties.

It's time to hang it up and let Burlap to Cashmere and Jennifer Knapp usher in the new CCM revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Schlitt = AntiChrist","review":"I'd like to thank Schlitt for proving Greg X.Volz took all the talent with him when he left the band. 'Petra' if you can even still call them that, have been reduced to a money-grabbing, commercial machine that would sing Marilyn Manson songs if they thought the public would buy it.

NEWS FLASH JOHN: You can't compete with GREG VOLZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"It's one thing to go back and remake a song to improve it. But why take out a bunch of really awesome songs and try to see how far you can mutate them just for the fun of it, while destroying several good songs in the process (thank goodness I have the good versions on other albums). This album makes me wonder if the band has come to the end of their creative road and are simply fishing the bottom of the barrel to try to come up with something they can release just to get the label off their backs or to make a buck. I have loved Petra for two decades, but this, as far as I'm concerned, is not Petra."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS?","review":"I signed up for a music club and unfortunately did not get to review this album before I purchased it. I just assumed it was a type of greatest hits album. It is FAR from \\"greatest\\" and I am so disappointed, we don't even listen to it.

I love petra, and I've been tryting to find a copy of war & remembrance (not easy to find) But when I bought this one I was horribly dissapointed. \\"This means War\\" sounded horrible. It just wasn't the same without the heady beat. Come on, this is a classic ROCK band. Not some sissy ballad composers. Where's those awesome beats that made me want to dance? It just didn't cut it, you're better of with Petra Praise 2 or \\"Petraphonics\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Could of sworn the word Petra means \\"the rock\\" and that 10 years ago Petra actually played \\"rock\\" guitars. This band's ministry has been around for like 27 years, so its time for them to become a legend and give it up. Putting out crappy albums like this one and refreshing old fossils with new fresh band members is not going to make Petra a legend. Ten years from now people will say \\"oh Petra, they were an excellent rock band\\" if they quit now. They'll say \\"Oh, Petra, that annoying pathetic string-driven band that doesn't know when to give it up and let people enjoy their past albums\\" if they don't quit. 5 stars=classic. 4 stars=very good 3=good 2=fair 1=poorSome of you need to check this album again.

This new album is a step in the wrong direction in my opinion. I want so bad to find something to like in it,but there's nothing there. \\"Dance\\" was the only song that I found even somewhat acceptable, but it still pales in comparison to the hard-rocking original. This one goes to the very bottom of my Petra collection, maybe if I ignore it, it will go away. Go with \\"God Fixation,\\" if you want an example of the Petra that I still love."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Petra Lover's Wife\\"","review":"My husband of nearly 11 years has loved Petra since before I knew him - collecting albums, going to concerts, playing his cassettes until they were worn out, etc. This album he THREW IN THE TRASH!!! The songs chosen for this album are Petra classics, yet they ruined them in our opinion. The remade versions change the style of the music so you can hardly tell it is Petra. If you love the original songs, you will likely not like these versions. My suggestion: listen to the excerpts and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not great, not normal Petra.","review":"Ok, I've listened to a lot of the old petra albums and really enjoyed them. So when I saw Double Take I decided to buy it. I was very surprised to find that petra removed the electric guitar from this album and substituted a classical guitar.

Consequently, most people who loved the old Petra sound won't appreciate this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ........... ?","review":"ok, so I'm not 13, sue me.I can't believe what they've done to these songs! Beyond Belief sounds horrible, and Dance is far too contemporary!Ugh, I'm glad I didn't buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"This album astounds me. What possible motivation could Petra (or maybe just Bob?) have had to record this? Here's a message to the guys in the band from a long (and I mean long) time fan: If you want to write NEW songs, write new songs. Don't completely rebuild old songs. There is a reason that people liked the originals. For instance, the tune \\"Beat The System\\" bears only a passing resemblence to the original. The hooks are all gone, stripping the song down to a disjointed mess. If Petra's goal was to make some old classics less \\"catchy,\\" mission accomplished. Put it this way, this disk is enough to make me think twice about buying the next one (and I've been a pretty hard-core fan for almost twenty years)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this by?","review":"The trouble with recent Petra albums is trying to decide who they are by. Is it John Schlitt or is it Peta, and if the latter then who is in the band this week. Mr Schlitt seems to have taken on the mantle of destroying whatever was left of the intergrity of this once great band. This album is dire. No more, no less. With insipid and lifeless versions of previous Peta classics, it is an example of down far downhill they have gone wince the glory days of Unseen Power et al.With the recent 'firing' of their long serving drummer for no aparant reason, I'm afraid that the writing is on the wall. A sad epitaph. This album says it all really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"HE CAME, HE SAW (HE CONQUERED)'s new chorus is terrible.

It was well-acted and well-made and accurate. It traces the history of Queen Elizabeth's younger sister, whose sad private life was played out publicly on the world stage. It chronicles her behavior, the drugs, wild parties, free sex etc. that always landed Princess Margaret in the headlines and as the major source for embarassing the British Royal Family in the generation preceding Princess Diana.The DVD has a fascinating movie about a prior Royal scandal that involved Princess Caroline of Brunswick and her unhappy union with George, one of Margaret's ancestors. This was almost even better than the Queen's Sister. Don't miss it on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Thank goodness I got this as a gift and didn't waste any of my own money. I got about 20 minutes into it before I turned it off. Sorry to cast aspersions, but Princess Margaret was a beautiful woman when she was young, and Lucy Cohu is not... IMHO...easy on the eyes. She portrayed Margaret as shrill and sleazy with no redeeming qualities. I know Margaret was no saint, but it was so over the top. It almost changed my high opinion of Toby Stephens (who played Antony Armstrong-Jones), who was so good in the BBC version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" for being involved in this train wreck. This just does not seem worthy of the BBC. Do yourself a favor, buy \\"Jane Eyre\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Scandal","review":"I got this DVD for the \\"special feature\\" - the entire 60 minute version of \\"A Royal Scandal\\" about the very rocky marriage of George IV, son of George the 3rd and dissolute Prince Regent, starring Richard E. Grant and Susan Lynch. This is excellent and worthy of 5 stars on its own. Very well acted and well written. The Queen's Sister is good, but not great. Very good acting, but the script was a bit over-the-top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly appalling!","review":"If I were able to do so, I would not award this DVD any stars at all. Whether or not Princess Margaret was a spoilt termagant with an overly inflated view of her own importance, only her contemporaries would know for a fact but, she's depicted as an absolute harpy in this DVD, a bossy, arrogant woman with a voracious sexual appetite who made the lives of those around her, miserable. Even if all of this is pure fiction, which I seriously doubt, the costuming for this movie was appalling! Margaret was a frumpy, dowdy dresser but her clothes were made by top dressmakers and these costumes were so badly made, ill fitting and puckered at the seams, so that at times, the sheer awfulness of her clothes distracted me from the story...but perhaps that was a blessing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad.........","review":"Full-frontal nudity, awful dialogue, just so terrible words won't come to adequately describe the \\"awfulness\\" of this mess and then it just......ends.........no \\"ending\\"...it just ......ends, but sadly not soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story badly told","review":"Nothing is more sad than to see a good story ruined. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Incoherent and naive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widely acknowledged classic, I hated it","review":"The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies. Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express. So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie. I was extremely disappointed. The cinematography is boring and poorly done. The plot is juvenile. It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys. I hated the movie. However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly awful","review":"As a fan of HK and mainland Chinese film, both serious and otherwise, I was really looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, it's really quite bad. Overacted at every turn, with a truly horrible synth soundtrack, it feels like someone tried to make a \\"C\\" movie better by spending a ton of money on the production. It has all the class of \\"The Scorpion King\\" or the like -- shrieking cackles from the villains, soap-opera drama from the heroes, and an uneven, sloppy script. The fight scenes are good, but they're overwhelmed by the melodramatic direction, as are the actors. This could have been so much better, but it's really not worth the time out of your life to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold new frontier for chinese cinema","review":"I rented this DVD as a last minute choice from my local video store and was exceptionally glad that I did. This movie is leaps and bounds above the typical kung-fu flair from china. The production and cinematography are excellent and believe it or not an excellent plot.Typically, chinese films film love scenes by implied action rather than overt or graphic depiction. This movie goes beyond their traditional approach, but the love scenes are tastfully and artfully done and portray the two main characters in love, in the Romeo and Juliet style. The kung-fu action is very good and keeps the story action packed.This is a very good choice for rental and better for purchase if you love collecting movies of this genre, the DVD extras are good and well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brigitte Lin winner","review":"Simply one of the best Hong Kong movies I have ever seen. It is a wonderful mix of fantasy, swordplay, wire-fu, a great musical score, Brigitte Lin never more gorgeous, all of which is the overlay of what is a very touching romance. This combination makes for an immensely entertaining film. The DVD version delivers a very good picture, excellent sound, and a Cantonese or Mandarin soundtrack, with adequate subtitles, so you don't have to listen to the awful dubbing job. A perfect introduction, along with Peking Opera Blues, to the cinema of Hong Kong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower your expectations","review":"The story is good and the screenplay has the right idea, but the low-grade technical aspects are terrible. The considerations one must make for this is too much. The movie on this DVD is primitive stuff! (too bad for South City) If Ronny Yu did it today with access to all the technical devices and support it would be worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung fu with a hint of an erotic flavor to it","review":"The story is a little different from your standard kung fu films. The minimally erotic content was kind of a nice change too, as you don't see that in most kung fu films. My only complaint about the film is that some of the battle sequences, they reduced the frame rate, which lessens the intensity of the combat.(Brigitte) Lin Ching Hsia is a great action actress as usual. If you like her films, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, lousy transfer","review":"First, the movie: I saw this film in the mid 90s at a film festival in Houston. I had no information or expectations before-hand. I just sat in a dark room and it showed up in front of me. It immediately went on my top 10 list and I dragged all of my friends to see it a few days later. It's way over the top in every dimension. Visually stunning and unapologetically emotional. Brigitte Lin kicks ass so hard you can actually believe that a goth-fu loner like Leslie Cheung would turn the world upside down just for her.Second, the DVD: Blech. A soft, non-anamorphic transfer of an ugly print. Gargantuan subtitles fill a big chunk of the image. Not a significant improvement over the Tai Seng US release laserdisc.5 star movie, 2 star DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Roses Do It Again","review":"The fourth album in the Desert Roses series is as entertaining and as useful (for those who collect modern Arabic music) as the previous albums.

This is the only CD out of all the ones I lost that I've even bothered to re-purchase; that's how good it is. Everything always vibes together with Steel Pulse-the harmony between the lead and back up singers, the instruments. It seems like there are no breaks between the songs, it's just one continuous perfect jam. They are excellent live, nothing short of perfection. I've seen them a few times and listening to this CD takes me right back to those shows.

As a resident of the state, he captures the nuance of life here with precise brush strokes, while managing to examine larger themes of friendship, growing up, gossip in small communities, and a host of other issues. This book is very layered and a huge accomplishment for a first time author.

I have never read a Gilchrist book before, but am a huge fan of Stephen Pressfield's books and was inspired to read Green's and Kagin's accounts of the Greco-Persian and Peloponesian wars. I stumbled on this book by accident and found it to be tremendously entertaining. Yes, the characters might be developed more but I did not find this a serious distraction.

Then I started reading the introduction and felt this was the most amazing book about baseball ever written. It's poetic, gripping, and full of juicy information and so knowledgable and detailed at the same time. The two of us fought over it at night - and neither of us would have expected to read it (or enjoy it!) when we started. Some of the statistical information will seem common sense to fans (like explaining batting average) and some will seem obscure (like talking about \\"defensive metrics\\") but that's a tiny thing in a majestic book. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I burned through this book, as I do believe it's a great read for true Sox fans. To disagree with a few reviews: 1) I don't think you can get this sort of behind the scense glimpse at the management level info from reading the Globe/Herald. You can't believe 1/2 of what they print. 2) It doesn't focus on the clubhouse/players, as someone pointed out, but that's not the goal.It's a review of what got the Sox to the '04 title. At the same time, it shows the greed of the Sox owners and the stubborness of Lucchino that made them fall down in '05 and now '06, and I fear will probably prevent them from getting another title soon. It's true that the Sox brass treat the team too much like a business (yes, I know it's a business) on the baseball operations side than they should. There is plenty of money to be made elsewhere.So it definitely focuses more on the management than the players (which was it's goal, no less) so if you're looking for that kind of detail, this is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to give it two stars because I paid good money for the book","review":"...otherwise I'd look like a fool.

I looked <everywhere> for something that made Ted's .406 irrelevant to the comparison, but couldn't find it.

BBs are intended for short range, moderate power, as the ballistics of it being round cause it to be affected by air drag.In short, this is a multi-purpose, possibly indoor, air pistol with only 200 FPS, barely enough to go 15 feet with a BB, but 25 with a pellet or dart."},{"rating":"1","title":"horible","review":"dont buy this gun. honestly your better off with a sling shot. if you really want an air pistol i would save up 10 more dollars and get a smith and wesson m&p 40 co2 bb pistol. this gun barly goes in cans if you can even hit them. the gun shoots so far off to the left and down its not even funny. and that is if it even feeds. you probably have a 40% chance its gonna feed. and cocking it is such a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.","review":"THIS GUN IS ALMOST A GLORIFIED KID'S TOY.

It's hard to load BBs down the BB sized hole though, unless like someone said you have three hands, and preferably one of those is the size of a gecko's. I love the heft of the gun and the sound it makes when cocking it. However the visible arcing of the exiting shot quickly disipates any illusion that you've blasted anything. When firing, the recoil of the spring jolts the gun - enough so that you'll likely use two hands on it if you're aiming at a small target. As for the lack of power, I hit a rabbit in the butt using this gun from about 12 feet away. It turned around and looked at me, still chewing a mouthful of my hostas. \\"Hosta\\" la vista baby - NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't shoot straight","review":"We saw some negative reviews but decided to buy this product anyway.

Got the darts with it and I put up a human dart target as well that I got for knife throwing practice. Overall its a great gun to practice with at 10-15 feet. It really helps with my accuracy without spending too much money on ammo. I also got the quick loader bbs for it and it came out pretty descent as well. The only difficulty that I have is the cocking mechanism was so hard.

When all the neighborhood children are suffering from the What will I do syndrome, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle invites them to her house to look for the pirate's treasure.The reason the book was ranked a four instead of five is that the book is out of date.

Smith had a quintet for these sessions. Besides the piano-bass-drums rhythm section, he works with either Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, or Paul Quinichette. The breezy mood of the uptempo songs reminds me of \\"The Swinging Guitar Of Tal Farlow\\". Smith's guitar style is more chordal than Farlow's. While Smith is no Wes Montgomery, you could almost draw a line from Smith to Montgomery. The saxophones all play with a lot of style and discretion - they're not there to show up the leader. The CD is a blend of ballads and fast ones. Smith shows a little more fire on his originals, it's a shame he didn't do more. The album closes on a strong version of \\"My Funny Valentine\\". So this is a very good, CD, highly recommended to jazz guitar fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Brass","review":"Interesting only because it was made by Europe's premier exploitation director, \\"Kitty\\" is tedious and has pretensions to being an expose of the Nazis.

You'll find more (...) readily available elsewhere and the horror of the Nazis is presented much more graphically and forcefully in movies by Speilberg and Polanski to name but two.

While not as outrageous, \\"Salon Kitty\\" certainly doesn't have much in mind except to titillate the viewer.There is plenty of nudity but very little in the way of plot. From what I gathered, Helmut Berger plays a German officer. He concocts a plan to place recording devices in the rooms of a brothel. He plans to use the information he gathers to blackmail other members of the Nazi regime.At two hours, this movie really drags. As to be expected, none of the characters are people that you would care about. There are several musical numbers interspersed with numerous brothel scenes.

No, this isn't Purple or Core and its nowhere near heavy as any of the albums. I think they concentrated on this record a little more than the seemingly rushed 4. \\"Days of the Weak\\" is a pretty catchy kind of pop song that was their radio so called hit. \\"Coma\\" seems that the band and Scott were doing two different things. The vocals don't quite match up with the instrumentation. \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Hello Its Late\\" are by far the best songs on the record.

STP has never made a bad album in my opinion. These albums are really amazing that everyone seemed to ignore and it's too bad.The Deleo's are so underrated. Army of Anyone was awesome and they just make amazing music and Scott is one of the best singers in Rock n Roll. He can be angry, aggressive and in your face, or sing beautifully without being sappy (which is hard to do). And Kretz drums always sound awesome, with a ton of weight and heaviness. This band is so versatile and original it's insane. Hopefully now they are back together they can make a new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to CORE","review":"I have just listened to SHANGRI-LA DEE DA and after the first listen I am very disappointed.

Of the the 3 \\"rockers\\" Dumb Love is the only one that even begins to come close to the STP of old.

The tunes are blues-driven and okay, but rarely (except in Coma) are they inspired. So Stp make up for this the delivery right? Well, yes, the instrumentation is generally of a high quality, but there are still some awkward moments. I was cringeing as guitarwork at the end of the not-so-great Transmission from a loneely Room slowly faded out (and I hate fade-outs), only to hear it fade back in seconds later and finish later even more lamely. Geez. I like long metal songs, but Stp's bonking songs are just repetitive and exhausting, even if they are working with good material. Lyrically shangri is often excellent, sometimes even quotable (you know, \\"looking California, feeling Minnesota\\"). The change of pace towards the end of WOnderful is brilliant, Too Cool Queenie is epic and monstrous, Holywood and Days of the Week are great too.

I found out that the music came from this album so I gave it a listen and I'm none to happy to report that Stone Temple Pilots fans won't like this album.\\"Days of the Week\\" is alright. It's a catchy song and it gets you pumped for another album by them but the rest of the album is terrible. The music clips which I refered to are just the introductions to the songs which change after the first seven seconds into empty, yet overblown songs which don't have any replay value.Then, there's a syrupy ballad in the mix too which makes me lose a bit of respect for Scott Weiland and co. seeing as how it doesn't belong at all. I know Scott Weiland was going through a lot of stuff but c'mon, nobody wants to hear a ballad at that level.I definitely learned my lesson and that's simply that Stone Temple Pilots fans should avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 thumbs down!","review":"I listened to this one after i have listened to no.4I was extremely dissapointed.....this album gives you the sense of taking you somewhere but never does....it falls flat!This album is the complete opposite of no.4It sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad -- go for the first four","review":"Save your cash.

I pulled this CD from a friend to see if it was worth it or not. Despite it does have the rock edge I do love, I feel the CD is very ecletic from the grinding guitars in \\"Dumb Love\\" to the passion in \\"Wonderful\\" to the gloom of \\"Long way Home\\". However, sometimes too much ecleticism can be a bad thing and it seems to plague this album. \\"Black Again\\" seems too prissy for Stone temple Pilots and \\"Too Cool Queenie\\" seems to follow a similar drifting path as well. A major disappointment to me was that some of the songs had excellent lyrics while the others just whined along and seemed thrown together just to fill the album. For a 5th album, it's a scandalously questionable start but I'm anxious to see where they go from here...hopefully, the next album gives a little more depth but it's a fearsome listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"stone temple who?","review":"As a diehard stp fan, I must admit that this album should have never been released, or even recorded. This is the worst music that stp could have written, though one and the only bright spot on the cd is the opener Dumd Love. And no they will never make another Core or Purple but they have the talent to write songs that are not a disgrace to the fans such as Shangri-La."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless cd","review":"While it is a solid debut, ladeeda is not as engaging as Core. S.T.P. plays solid, album metal cuts here. However, there are some memorable moments. The Deleo-penned \\"Coma,\\" which is one of S.T.P.'s greatest songs, and Scott's \\"Regeneration.\\" The most prominent feature of this album is a young guitarist named Rob, whose arena-sized guitar punch owes much to Backstreet Boys, Evanesence, and others. There is less about drugs and gloom on this album, except for the closing track, the collectively-penned \\"Long Way Home,\\" which chronicles (in a somewhat humorous/pathetic way) the life story of a heroin addict (Weiland.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best attempt at anything..........................","review":"I am so sick of you 12 year olds writing about how much this kind of music rocks.

When I first purchased this album I was in complete confidence that this would provide many hours of enjoyment and in this confidence my friend was also excited about this find. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life was marriage, but this, this is a close second. As soon as we bought the album it went straight into the cd player. 30 seconds was all it took. 30 seconds per song, and it was done. There is no rocking on this album. My friend is still shell shocked from this horrid, grotesque, disgusting, hell I don't know, whatever this garbage is, don't buy it.

I was quite amazed. This CD was almost nothing like the Old STP. Personally, I like the old STP better. But I do like \\"Hollywood B*tch and Days of the Week\\" a lot. It's a kind of different tone for an older band.

The bubblegum era.Lost is the edge that STP has always seemed to maintain in their music. Be it glam, opiated, or just straight up rock n roll, STP has always kept it real. The music has always magically complemented the voice of Scott Weiland, where, of course, lies the explanation of why this release is a dud.I, like all other fans, am happy that Scott is off the smack. I'm happy that he is married with a new kid. Unfortunately, this isn't the same Scott Weiland that was a part of the previous four releases. His pain is gone for the time being. Perhaps his artistic edge has gone with it as well.True STP fans, or should I say, fans of the old STP, we have seen an era come and go. Let's just hope Scott and Co. don't ruin it too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed, misjudged, desperate attempt at profoundness","review":"I don't believe stp will ever live up to the standard core fanatics demand, but on this CD they barely manage a coherent standard at all. 'Hello, its late' takes what I can only call an 'orchestral riff' and repeats it for 11 minutes. 'days of the week' is catchy and genuinely swings, but is undercut by offensively dull 2-minute long drum solos. Half of these tunes make no impact whatsoever, except to suggest weiland wants to be a singer in a garage punk band. stp, we don't want you to be Johnny Rotten, we want frilly multi-instrument emotionally direct concise tunes. (Like what you did before this mess') I'm always a fan, but this CD is a career-killer. Only 'Long way Home' works well, and you can get that on the far better 'internet'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their first was bad, their last was bad.","review":"Core (Stone Temple Pilots) first album is a terrible album and so is their last \\"Sheeran Laa dee Da\\"What a lame effort, their are about 2 or 3 decent tracks on this albumthe rest is throw away filler.\\"Too Cool Queenie\\" and \\"Dumb Love\\" (the first track) are the only stand out tracks.As for \\"Days of the week\\" being the well known single of the album, all I can sday is that is the worst song I have heard by the Stone Temple Pilots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotically pleasing","review":"Well, I consider myself to be a pretty \\"with-it\\" kind of dude, and that's why I was surprised when this humdinger of a rock & roll album passed me by like a ship in the night.

I especially like the \\"hypnotic\\" sounds I hear on some of these songs, be they slow or fast. And, it's hard to deny the sheer melody these dudes churn out with each album, on almost every song. Weiland's versatile vocals, and Dean Deleos' superb fretwork, add to the growing of this band.Definitely check it out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just keep getting better!","review":"Well I've been an STP fan since the beginning. Seen them in concert a few times too. I have to say that this new album Shangri-La-Dee-Da is one of their best!! This album has some of the hard core rock songs that you'd expect from these guys, but yet they are able to incorporate some soothing \\"ballads\\" if you will. It's a great mix for them and it shows how they've matured and grown as people. If they keep this up they will be remembered as one of the great rock bands of our time. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never the Same","review":"Name another rock band better than STP in the last 10 years, every album is different, they stay fresh and provide fans what they want while pleasing themselves. Get the big picture hear people, this band is the most underrated band ever, Guns&Roses saved rock for awhile, then we got Pearl Jam and Metallica, one is non-existent and the other plays the same stuff over & over. This album is again different from any other, \\"Wonderful\\", \\"Days of the Week\\" etc... they are all good, buy it and keep on supporting them. I only wish I could see them live, it will happen!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Creative than ever","review":"What is this with people saying that this album is \\"commercial\\" and \\"pop\\"? To me this is one of their more artisitc albums to date. Frankily, although it's a good album, I think \\"Core\\" was more selling out that SLDD. This album is very personal, Ithink, and that's why I like it. I admire Scott so much for writing \\"A song for sleeping\\". I think it is so much more hardcore to write a loving song like that than to write a song about how many people you've slept with and how much of a hardass you are. I think the best song is \\"Hello It's late\\" I just can't get over how haunting this song is. This is a beautiful album, and a true jem amidst the britney spears and nsync's of the world.

Oh, and if you ever get the chance to see STP live do it-they are masters of the stage :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"STP'S ADORE!","review":"STP have tracked away from hardcore grunge and taken a foot in the right direction. When you listen to this album, you can tell that this band has travelled miles and know how to write a good record.

It seems there's a split among many STP fans...those that like it hard, those that like the \\"jazzy melodies\\" and those that are sick of Core. I like them hard, I like them jazzy, and I still love Core (!##!#). Shangri-LADEEDA includes two songs \\"Dumb Love\\" and \\"Coma\\" to \\"rock out\\" to. There are several short & catchy melodies. Though, there's one thing lacking, no extraordinary ballet(s). There's no comparing \\"A Song for Sleeping\\" to \\"Creep.\\" No goose-bumps for me, but maybe Scott's son will find it as amazing. As a complete piece it's definitely worth the listen. I just want to see them live again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall of Fame Worthy Album","review":"Fans of STP's debut album Core might be a bit disappointed with Shangri-La Dee Da, but for anyone who likes laid-back 70's rock this album's a classic. This is Stone Temple Pilots least grungy album to date, so don't expect any songs like \\"Dead & Bloated\\", \\"Down\\", or \\"Plush\\", because this is STP pop. Listeners probably haven't heard these kind of jazzy melodies since Tiny Music, STP's third album, which in my opinion is probably their second best, behind Shangri-La Dee Da of course. This is probably the best rock album in the last 20 years. You can tell that these guys are really starting to mature as musicians, and I can only wonder how good their next album will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion, this is STP's best","review":"Shangri-La-Dee-Da is a perfect combination of grunge and pop, a formula STP had been working with since 1996's Tiny Music. However, there's just something about this CD that stands out, it's really too bad it never got the exposure it deserves. From start to finish this CD is a great ride, starting off heavy, then falling into the light pop tunes, and then getting heavy again for the finale that is \\"Long Way Home\\". Other highlights include \\"Wonderful\\", which is mainly acoustic and builds up into a beautiful finish, \\"Too Cool Queenie\\", a pop/rock song about Kurt and Courtney, and the psychadelic \\"Hello It's Late\\". STP really found their niche here, it's a shame they broke up shortly afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost better than Purple","review":"I would like to start off by saying that this album is sooo underapreciated. It has some of STP's best recordings to date like the hard pounding \\"Coma\\" and the beutiful acoustic ballad \\"Wonderful\\". I can't believe that someone accualy said that STP \\"sold out\\" with this album. It angers me to see that some people are naive enough to think that just by making some soft tracks that the band is \\"selling out\\". Tell me, which is selling out? Forcing yourself into making radio hits in order to sell albums and not expanding your musical verizons, like Creed, or making the music that you want to make and not caring what anyone else thinks. Some people might think that I'm only defending STP because I've been a fan for years before SLDD came out. Accualy this is the first STP album that I bought and is the cd that really got me into rock. And after dicovering STP and listening to everything they've done, I can honestly tell you this is a rock classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"sTp's best work since Purple","review":"I absolutely adore every album sTp has made. Tiny Music wasn't something I was into initially, and I've only recently appreciated it's quality. I do, however, only really like the hits off of that album (trippin, big bang baby, lady picture show, etc.). Every song on No.4 is good, and a few are great, but it still didn't reach the level of greatness that Core and Purple did. Thank God, Shangri-la Dee Da does. And thank God Weiland's Core/Purple voice is back. The album rocks, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"STP comes out strong with another great album","review":"In Shangri-La Dee Da STP continues to mix fast hard rock songs with beautiful deep ballads. they went with a new style with this album like they have done in the past, and it worked. This album mixes STP's hard grunge music from core with some hard rock like No. 4 to create a new type of music. But with songs like Bi-Polar Bear you get a deep view into lead singer Scott Weilands emotional problems, then songs like A Song for Sleeping (written for his new son) show you all his joys. Overall a great album up to all of STP's high standards, buy it as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid as a Rock","review":"How many bands do we have to chose from today that produce a sound that as fans we can come to expect and enjoy each time out? In so many cases we buy a CD from a group and get lucky if 60% is worth a second or third listen. STP has a sound that is both original and geniune. If STP hooked you with \\"Core\\" or \\"Purple\\" I think you'll also enjoy this album. Scott's vocal range spans the range we've come to expect while the musical arangements are the typical \\"little off center\\" we also expect from STP. The production is sharp and clean, nothing like \\"Tiny Music\\". The band did a great job considering all of the turmoil and personal issues they've overcome. I appreciate the effort, it's nice to have band you can depend on. p.s.: and don't give me a hard time for writing a late review - I've been busy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STP does it again!","review":"When STP put out Core many years ago I was interested and bought the album. Now that is a hard album for me to listen to. With Shangri-La Dee Da STP has continued the right path to glam rock. There are some jems on this album that will stick in your head for a while after listening to them. \\"Days of the Week\\" cools it down a bit after the hard opening track \\"Dumb Love.\\" I was singing along with the chorus of \\"Days of the Week\\" on my second time through and it is still in the back of my mind a week later. The other great song I recommend on this album is \\"Too Cool Queenie.\\" I have liked STP from day one and Shangri-La Dee Da just shows they keep getting better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst album!","review":"There are a few good songs at the beginning, but it falls short of being a good cd.

After watching it though I am very happy that I ended up with it and it's one of my most watched DVDs.Strictly for music/recording nerds and Def Leppard fans, this is a well done documentary piece on what the band went through when recording Hysteria as well as the touring they did after Rick's accident. Musically it points out some of the nuances that one might miss through casual listening and some great bits which (thankfully, in some cases) never made it onto the album.The DVD has a whole lot of Phil and Joe but Rick really shines on this too and special attention is given to Steve's contributions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know why it took so long","review":"This is one of the better \\"classic albums\\" dvds because not only does it give away a lot of little details about how the record was made, but it gives you some great extras, a couple acoustic performances and a lot of bonus material. I always wanted to hear about how Rick Allen got back on the drums, great inspirational story. If you're a Lep fan, check this out. I saw the Hysteria tour in two cities and this dvd brought back a lot of the feelings from that time period. A lot of people think this is a sell-out album, but whatever.

I bought the CD immediately after listening to a small portion and how glad am I that I did! Apparently, she's been around for ten or more years, but she's a new comer to me. Her voice is incredibly emotional (\\"Hart\\" felt), rich, vibrant, rough, fragile, musical, & I could go on & on. She puts a lot of the other female singers making records out there to shame. The songs are filled with depth right along with her voice, and the production is just about perfect.

If that other guy thinks Beth is repetitious, he might want to check out the words again. I found she had a story to tell and told it well! You'll get many good songs on this one for your money.

A touching ballad that also has a biting edge. However, after that song I found the rest of the album to be pretty thin. I am not a fan of angst-ridden screaming being passed off as music as I feel so much of this album is. If you like LA Song, I would suggest buying the single. It really is not an accurate reflection of the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven albums","review":"Beth Hart has a great voice for soul , blues and country but for every 3 or 4 great songs per album there are 7 0r 8 slow, melancholy stinkers. I like an occasional ballad but Beth needs to get with a producer who won't allow her to record songs which bring down and detract from her up tempo numbers. The record company should issue a collection of all her faster, blusier and rockier songs on one cd and I guarantee sales will triple. It would bring some much needed attention to her career and really showcase her strength as an heir to Janis Joplin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware...","review":"[...]. I wish I had waited and listened to a few of the sound samples and read a few of the more critical reviews as well. This CD is a disappointment. Mediocre songwriting, Top 40 production and oversinging that would be an embarrassment for a true master of blues, soul or R&B. I can't believe someone compared her to a combination of Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin & Melissa Ethridge. She doesn't come close to any, and I'm no fan of Ms Ethridge. Mabe some of her other titles are better bets, but I went to U-Tube and sampled a few videos of her live performances, and they were not impressive either.

Beth's soulful and passionate singing make this CD as great as it is. Jimmy Khoury's guitar playing resembles some of the greatest guitarists of all time, i.e. Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Slash, etc. Benmont Tench, the organist of Tom Petty fame adds a classic touch to the album. Also, Tal's bass playing is really powerful. The album is perfect for anybody who likes Rock, Pop, Blues, and Country. Be sure to buy this album. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Screamin For My Supper leaves fans bellowing for more.","review":"It took three years for beth to put this album out and in this fans opioin its worth the wait.

Success is hers for the taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beth Hart Is Worth \\"My Supper\\"","review":"Why Beth has not received more mainstream recognition is a mystery to me.

Her truly unique voice will pull you into every song she sings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate and Sexy","review":"I first heard Beth Hart on VH1's Hard Rock Live, and \\"LA Song\\" lured me to buy the CD. Never have I heard a voice like hers...edgy, razor-sharp, and passionate. Every time I listen to this album, it grows on me like a tenacious vine...awesome...\\"Get Your Sh-t Together\\", \\"Is That Too Much To Ask\\", and \\"Skin\\" must be heard and absorbed... Move over Janis, because Beth Hart has arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop playing this CD!","review":"Like Courtney from Indiana, I happened to be up late and saw Beth on HBO. Did not remember ever seeing/hearing of her before, but was immediately hooked by her power, her soul--and her obvious talent! Went right to Amazon and ordered the CD. It came a few days later, and I haven't taken it off the player since. Been trying to get all my friends to listen--she is a huge talent, the album is great (surprisingly, the only \\"low\\" point for me was the radio hit, \\"L.A.

It was a delicious surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"words don't even do this girl justice","review":"Ok, let me begin by stating that a friend let me borrow this cd, \\"screamin' for my supper\\" a few months ago and it has not left my cd player in 6 months. YES, it's THAT good!! Without a doubt THE most incredible cd I have ever owned. If you're new to Beth's music... brace yourself, because you'll never go back! I definatley reccomend this CD to any rock fan. Her soulful yet edgy lyrics and AMAZING voice will truly blow you away. You can't pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Britney, Mariah Or Jessica Fans!","review":"This is one female who can sing.LA Song was popular when it came out a few years ago in NZ.She actually recorded a song 'I'll Stay With You' from her next cd 'Leave The Light On' with some of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.This is the cd that earned her radio time.Wake up America, this is a voice that should not be overlooked.NZ, Netherlands and Denmark have taken Beth to heart(no pun intended).It is a shame all it takes in America to have a hit is a Barbie face and bitsy voice.Buy this and start listening to real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Chick Rocks!","review":"What ever happened to singers who feel what they're singing? Beth Hart is one in a million nowadays. Although this album came out in the late 90s, I finally got a listen. I was familiar with the song \\"L.A. Song\\", but I have to say that they missed the boat with releasing it as the single. It's not even close to being the best song on the album. The best ones are \\"Get Your Sh*t Together\\", \\"Delicious Surprise\\" (which has been covered by Jo Dee Messina, but this is much better), and \\"Is That Too Much To Ask\\". I also like the song \\"Mama\\" which reminds me a bit of Amanda Marshall.Do yourself a favor and get this album. Like another reviewer said, it may be a case of the artist being better than the material, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the songs are just ok. But the ones that are great are completely worth buying the entire cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"kICK a$$","review":"\\"Just a little hole\\".. can relate...as well as all the songs on this album.

Insane. It could have 200 component video-out ports but if only one of them is capable of audio then what is the point? I have never seen engineering this poor fron a brand known for quality.

Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but not an A/V receiver","review":"As an audio receiver it is decent, but if you are looking for an A/V receiver, don't buy this product. It advertises as a 2 hdmi passthru, but you only get 1 optical with video, and at 1080i and no audio thru hdmi. You will end up buying an hdmi switcher that can handle 1080p and audio thru hdmi to minimize cost/clutter in all the cables. (ie. might as well bought more expensive product.) In all the confusion consumers have on trying to buy a quality receiver, I wish Sony would stop making inferior products, and sell just 3 models that better fit an audiophiles profile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a very bad experiance","review":"Bought this on the Black Friday from BestBuy as there was a great deal... had to return it as the left surround speaker connection was not working when hooked up.. also Front A speaker connections were not working...I went to exchange it.. but the other Receiver had the same issues when tested in the store... so returned this item and bought a Yamaha 5.1 Channel Receiver... it is working just great...I am not sure if the receiver itself is too bad or my luck :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not true HDMI","review":"HDMI is supposed to carry both video AND audio signals.

The set up is very confusing and the biggest con is you have to use a TOS link cable to get sound. I eventually found this out after searching on line. The volume is not earth shattering but that can actually be a good thing as there does not seem to be any distortion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 4 months","review":"After less than 4 months, I've had to return the unit. The front display indicates \\"Protect\\" and the receiver does not work. This is NOT an isolated problem, as there are numerous blogs on the internet regarding this issue.

I've mailed my receiver to SONY's service center in Texas and awaiting its repair, and in the meantime, I'm without an amplifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony STR-DG510","review":"Nice receiver with hdmi hookups. Video to tv hookup is straight forward and easy. Audio is a different story. Does not decode the hdmi sound signal to the speaker system, only to the tv set.

Sometimes a slight delay causes a small echo if not turned down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Purchase","review":"Bought the Sony STR-DG510 as a home theater receiver for a media room. Added good speakers. With a new plasma 1080 TV, the sound in the room is incredible. For the money, this Sony is a bargain.

The built in speakers were horrible. A few months ago, they also got a great deal at a garage sale on some old Bose speakers not realizing they needed a receiver to have surround sound, so they sent me shopping for one to fit their budget. I purchased the DG510 for them and it sounds amazing. They are using it primarily for an HD cable box and their son's PS3.They are also using it as an HDMI switch. Really the only negative about this with their setup is that the optical audio inputs are not assignable for different channels. Therefore, they have the HD cable box hooked up on the \\"DVD\\" channel with a digital coax audio cable while the PS3 is hooked up on \\"Video 2\\" with the digital optical audio cable. The receivers from other brands I looked at on which you could assign the optical audio inputs to any channel were about $100 out of their budget. This is only a minor nitpick since it still sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for 5.1 home theater","review":"I built a home theater with all Sony products and it's great.

Pluss the fact it is drawn by one of the worst artist in the business. Forget everything you know about the human anatomy, because it no longer matters. Everyone is this book is also Asian. Superman, Batman, WonderWoman, and every body else is Asian. Also SuperGirl has an eating disorder, you don't get the skinny by not puking up your meals. The story itself is awful, and all over the place. Pass this one up if you can. Espeicaly if you have heart problems, cause rhis will surely have suffering a heart attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supergirl's Back In A Super Fun Story With Super Cool Art!","review":"First of all, this is not one for the \\"graphic novel\\" snobs. This is just a great comic book collection featuring a story and artwork that make for some wonderful fun.Jeph Loeb once again manages to put enough heart and emotion into these characters to elevate this above mere fluff. That depth, along with a fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of an adventure, makes for a thrilling read.Supergirl appears, Supes and Bats disagree on how to handle this development, and Wonder Woman gets in on the action too. Along the way, we get to see some awesome scenes on Apokolips, and a very cool showdown between Superman and Darkseid.Michael Turner's art is beautiful. I especially love the way he draws the most gorgeous Wonder Woman that I've ever seen. Everything else here looks outstanding as well..., but, man, his Wonder Woman is exceptional.If you like comics that are just downright fun to read, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame","review":"This was a shame. I think supergirl is a cool character and can be done well, but this just makes clear that DC has no idea what to do with her. There is no characterization, no back up characters and the story can only loosely be called a \\"story.\\" The art is cool and it seems that is all this book has to offer. It's a real disappointment, especially after Peter David's run on the previous Supergirl (linda danvers) which was excellent. Stick with Many Happy Returns, possibly the best supergirl story ever (along with Crisis on Infinite Earths)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Loeb?","review":"Superman Batman started out AMAZING. A thought provoking arc filled with great art, great dialogue. Then came this complete 180. Jeph Loeb completely fell off the tracks, not to mention the Michael Turner art. Once you realize that ALL of Turner's figures look the same, the book loses something. Not to mention that the story on the whole is nonsensical and uncharacteristic. A stain on the DCU. Do not buy! Go look up \\"Alan Moore\\" or \\"Jim Lee\\" if you want some good story and art respectively. Not this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supergirl Round 2","review":"I just love this book. I wish I could find some witty and insightful comment to make...but words fail me! The presentation is stunning, with the added preface by Mr. Loeb and the bonus sketch book material in the back of the book, I can't think of a more fitting tribute to the re-introduction of Kara Zor-El. Admittedly the teleporation bit at the end was a bit too much for me, but the story is still strong and works well for bringing Kara back into the fold. I love the addition of Wonder Woman and her interest in Kara was well executed. As for Mr. Turner's work...love it. He can not only draw some hot ladies...but his men aren't too shabby either. Hands down...this book is fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"There are high stakes here, and high power on top of that.

The story picks up from the end of the first Volume and creates a story that is ultimately one of the best I have read in the recent publishing of DC comics. The relationships between the characters and the plot all lead to a well-rounded interesting story. Along with the tale comes the graphics that complete the greatness of this graphic novel. This is a mind-bogglingly awesome book and should be read by fans of comic books and superheroes. It should even be read by people who aren't fans of comic books and superheroes because the story can still relate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a cookbook","review":"I was disappointed with the contents of the book. I was hoping it would also serve as a field guide for finding the ingredients. The descriptions of the wild foods are not descriptive enough to help you actually find them. Also, there are no pictures of any of the plants. I found most of the recipes to be very complex in flavors. (Mostly Asian and Indian) Not that I mind complex flavors. My fear is the spices would cover up the taste of the wild ingredient to much. The first time I try a new food, I want a simple recipe so I better understand its taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid-90's southern garage rock","review":"The Quadrajets' first offering showcases their style that has been born out of years of touring and living in a stagnant southern music scene. Cars, beers, babes and a former member of their neighbor space surf band Man or Astroman? make this album worth checking out. Their next release, Alabama Hip Shake, follows in the same vein as When I Lay My Burden Down, so either one is a good starting point for someone interested in southern garage rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Kenton Album","review":"I have this selection on vinyl, and is one of my favorite Kenton albums. I immediately ordered the CD when it came out, not expecting much quality since it was recorded in the 50's. However, I must say the fidelity is truly amazing. What a wonderful job the Blue Note engineering staff has done. I'll say it again--truly amazing. Liner notes are excellent, and tell that the sessions were also recorded in stereo, however the mix was off, so therefore the original LP and the CD likewise were released in mono. Every Kenton fan must add this CD to their collection along with Kenton in HiFi, Cuban Fire, and the Standards albums. Most of these are mono, but never mind--the quality of the musicianship is there, and the fidelity is great.Frank in Tennessee"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"Buyer beware! This Cd release by EMI/Capitol is a MONO issue. According to the liner notes and I quote \\" Many of the solosists are completely off-mike....etc\\". This from Michael Cascuna, a man who I admire for what he's done for Jazz. I acquired a mint Lp copy to replace my battered Cap Lp and the solosists are not off-mike in my opinion. My bet is they couldn't find the original stereo tapes or didn't want to bother to \\"correct\\" them. That's why they put knobs on equipment. So do as I did and get yourself a mint Lp and make your own Cd. And while your at it you had also better get a copy of \\"Rendezvous With Kenton\\" in stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to much pleasure","review":"I still have the original Lp in my collection.

This disc collects ten performances from four of the pianist's six sessions for the Prestige label. It's a nice set for someone who is not a big fan of Mose's singing (like me), but still appreciates his artistry on the ivories. The pianist is accompanied on all tracks by bassist Addison Farmer, and by either Ronnie Free or Nick Stabulus on the drums. While Mose Allison is often credited with a truly unique style, I found these compositions and performances pretty standard for the late 1950s, but enjoyable nonetheless. I'm glad I took the opportunity to check out Mose \\"Down Home\\" before it went down and out."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sorry movie","review":"I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version. They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie. AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married. Enter the Bride. She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions. Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me. The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung. Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress. So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf. It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time. Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this","review":"Bride with the white hair had hardly any action and really disappointed me.

Unlike what most people seem to think, this is one of the best sequels ever. Don't expect the same emotion and mystic throughout the film, but the end is just beautifull. So many Hollywood movies SHOULD NOT end with a happy ending(typical Hollywood) but I can't imagine this ending any other way. Watch it if you loved the first one. This is more for action fans but as I said, it lives up to The Bride With White Hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Left Alone","review":"The Bride with White Hair is a cool, strange, violent trip with lots of memorable moments that stay with you.The Bride with White Hair 2 is none of these things. This sequel barely shows the cast from the first movie, choosing instead to focus on a motley bunch of junior \\"masters\\" that use lame humor and laughable martial techniques to make their way through the silly plot.The sharp social commentary of the first film is non-existent here. There is some bizarre lesbian separatist warrior enclave that -- surprise, surprise -- hates men. There is a bunch of star-crossed and confusing romantic angles. There are very dated special effects.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you're a fan of the series and Bridgette Lin","review":"The story line is direction is okay.

The fact that Ronny Yu didn't direct it should have tipped me off, but with the main stars of the first one starring in it I thought I'd give it a chance. First off I made the mistake of renting the dubbed version. I don't know if they took liberties with the dialogue in the translation but the lines spoken are pure drivel. The action sequences and the cinematography are like a bland made-for-tv knock off of the original and the story is boring. Leslie Cheung only makes a brief appearance at the end and I began fastforwarding towards the end before I was even half way through it. If you've seen the first one, don't rent or even consider buying this one, you won't be just dissapointed, you'll be mad! Watch Ronny Yu's original masterpiece again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad attempt at a sequel","review":"I rented this film immediatley after seeing the first Bride with White Hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story. There was a perfect setup for a sequel and I couldn't wait to watch it unfold. After the first half an hour I knew that director Ronnie Yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn't really give a damn about how interesting the story was. Poor dialogue, inadequate story, there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film. If you enjoyed the first BWWH you'll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book of philosophy","review":"This book is a must have, lose the idea of a Samurai as a killer and find out how the teachers of the shogun looked at his job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canby's Legion takes a back seat to a seemier universe","review":"Baldwin has created a steamy universe with a debauched Emperor and crass commercial Empire. Though the hero, Canby, fights for right, the dark and debauched scenes of sexual orgies -- and in one case pedophilia, make this a book unsuitable for younger readers. Baldwin writes as if he was unhappy with the straightforward good versus evil in the Helmsman series and needed to make a universe reflective of everything that is bad.This is a step down in Baldwin's otherwise finely crafted space operas that are suitable for younger and adventurous teens.Canby's Legion is NOT Suitable for younger readers"},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising story, but a poor ending.","review":"Mr. Baldwin has the makings of an excellent series in \\"Canby's Legion\\".

His own perspectives on his life, Istanbul, the hamam, and the family with whom he is staying are highlighted by his aunt's words which we hear throughout the movie as he reads her returned letters.Istanbul is somewhat romanticized, with old and new customs side by side, sometimes competing and other times in harmony.

As a Turk who lives in Istanbul, movie reminded me what we are losing as time passes by. Relations, values and beautiful Istanbul. It is totally a nostalgie movie which can bore most of the people who are get used to see action movies since it is a so relaxing movie. Scenario just reflects the Turkish life and the diverse cultural heritage of Istanbul. The locations that are seen in the movie are not movie sets but the districts of the old city where you can still feel the past with its architecture and religous places."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either get it or you don't. . . I got it.","review":"This was one of my favorite films of last year, about an impatient yuppie with all the modern conveniences in Rome that becomes intoxicated by timeless Istanbul, Turkey. This is a very subtle, magical film that was a fairly mainstream success in Italy. If you are looking for the american gay-styled \\"porn with great locations\\" you will be very disappointed. Ancient sexuality, wafting from young women to young men in their sexual prime, is too complex for our very modern, narrow perceptions of gay and straight. It is more about feeling overwhelmed in the modern world and wanting to be taken away. The acting is sexy in a very sophisticated way that will be completely lost on all but the most seasoned American film viewer. Treat yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Multi-Faceted Cinematic Gem","review":"It is almost impossible to tell a lot of stories at the same time without presenting an excess-baggage image, cinematographically speaking. \\"Steam\\" makes this happen, and actually it never gets overdosed. The film is about missing and finding identities, cross-culture exchanges, finding love and affection as part of a cultural expedition. It will be too much underestimation if we talk only about the gay part of it, because it presents way too much more than we can possibly bargain for. This is a social tale of individual lives. Hearthwarming and truely sincere cinematic gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this book","review":"The second half the book is missing, and what is there has so many printing glitches that it is hard to read.

It's perfect for both. Although it's not the best book written by Twain it is his first full length book and very interesting from that prospective as well. I'll also add that it's not an easy book to read due to the style and language.What is interesting is the story which with some alterations could be written today. The story line explores the dreaming and scheaming of those who want to get rich quick, politicans who are less than honest and those too lazy to work or to have a desire for improvement. It could describe people and situations that we've all encountered (perhaps we can even find ourselves).I'd recommend this book to those who are interested in the age following the American Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different edition","review":"*** This review is for the cream colored paperback edition with the black lettering.***This edition of the book is extremely cheap.

The higher voices are clear and upfront enough, the orchestra - which thankfully is interesting and expressive - is VERY loud, the bass and baritone leads sound like they are singing as loudly as they can from back stage. I think Francesco Ellero d'Artegna (bass) and Nicolas Rivenq (baritone) might have voices too small for the parts anyway, but really it's hard to tell. I might recommend this only if you like Massenet and are not acquainted with mighty soprano Iano Tamar. Her diction is not clear but she is a sensual and fearless singer and I've come to like her very much. A better vehicle for her is I think the Pacini opera \\"L'ultimo Giorno di Pompei\\", another live recording from Martina Franca that is lovely in every regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name Cuisinart will never mean a quality product, but junk and advertising that is deceiving","review":"I have owned a Cuisinart Food Processor for years.

I purchased from Sam's and after opening the work bowl was damaged with a small crack. I asked their customer service line to send me a new one. They would only do this if I sent my cracked one back to them and paid for shipping of the replacement work bowl. WHICH ALL TOTAL WAS MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR THE FOOD PROCESSOR. Also in big letters on the front package it stated a 5 year warranty and USA ID, yet the extremely small print states made in China. I will never ever buy a Cuisinart product again.

One has a marriage that is failing and he doesn't know how to fix it.

The Full Monty also has something that is hardly seen in films of recent past and that is a comraderie among a group of men that is not brought on by a war or a team sporting event, but by another type urgency; unemployment and lack of self esteem. The male bonding does not go as far as hating women, but only the need of respect from women and from people in general.

They can be strippers, too. It doesn't matter if neither is that attractive or can dance, they can learn. Of course, Gaz has to up the ante by declaring the act will be 'the full monty.'

What is really nice about this film, is we get to know these men and their problems---the things that have brought them to this point.

Burnt By The Sun is more like Lamb Of God and Pig Destroyer than any of those I mentioned above. The songs do have crazy titles (Dow Jones And The Temple Of Doom). The best tune is probably \\"Don Knotts\\". Oh, and say what you want about \\"Rebecca\\". I like when metal bands throw curveballs and this fits in well; the first 9 songs of the album are like fighting a war and then the last song is like all the sadness after the war, if you know what I mean.

The only way to really appreciate the intricately constructed meter and rhyme is to read the originals.I know this is probably a matter of taste in translation, but reading the English translations in this volume really brings me down sometimes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No cost but no value","review":"Text is continuous which makes poems reading very unpleasant.I ordered an other version, against payment, which I now enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"creep close until you lie upon my heart","review":"Howard's translation of Baudelaire's masterpiece is not to be missed. This is the poetic decadence that began the belle epoque and influenced so much of what was to come in literature and the arts. Anyone seen reading this in public could be mobbed by attractive and intelligent members of the opposite and/or same sex: it has a libido boost that exceeds the music of Barry White. Go ahead, read \\"Lethe\\" to your sexy significant other while drinking absinthe and champagne; they'll be yours forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite translation, for sure.","review":"Nice to have a bi-lingual edition, but the translation lacks Baudelaire's musicality, which is too bad; because I mostly enjoy reading these out loud.I have found better translations online. There must be a better translation in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry makes your heart leap","review":"I could hardly put this down. I hadn't read these in awhile and had forgotten how tranportive they are. These poems take you on a wild ride of emotions, which is so beautiful that at times I could cry. I love to know that love like thta was felt, and you can even feel how much he love he felt even in the angry or murnful poems, that's how deeply he loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice help","review":"This is exactly what I said in the title: a nice help, if you know something about the romance languages and are a beginner at French. For, as far as I can see the translation doesn't preserve rhyme or the rhythm of the original, yet it's not literal. It does provide semantic help if you're interested in reading the original, but by itself, no...Also, I would like to add, I am used to bilingual editions with the original put on one page, and the translation parallel with it on the other. Here you have to look for it, and mark both pages where reading. It's a bit tiresome and certainly unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entire Collection?","review":"I am just wondering if this is the ENTIRE Fleurs du Mal or just the \\"appropriate\\" ones?

I just want to add that the original score and songs used are terrific and fully the capture the emotions and spirit of the scenes. Wish there was a soundtrack available. I recently saw this on cable and found it a highly original film. Maybe the Hollywood suits failed to release it since it was original and didn't follow the typical \\"Hollywood formula\\". Support independent films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap meals but they taste cheap too","review":"The meals in this book are in deed inexpensive but they are very basic and somewhat bland. We've tried at least half the recipes. The recipes are also not diet conscience. Most of the recipes are pretty high in carbs, fat and salt and thus this book was given away. If you are a pretty heavily active, thin family who is pretty much steak and potatoes then you'd love this book. However, if you like variety, new and exciting things to try, this book will leave you hungry for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our family LOVED IT!","review":"At a time when we need to save money, esp in the area of food, this book came in quite handy. We have tried around 7 and only one wasn't delicious!

I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that it is very basic - I think it might be helpful to someone who doesn't have much cooking experience, but if you do it won't help you much. I doubt I will make anything from this book, and I have to say nothing really sounded that great. One of my main problems with this book it that every chicken recipe called for boneless, skinless breasts - how un-frugal can you get?? That is absolutly the most expensive way to buy chicken, and don't tell me it is the only healthy option - it won't kill your family to eat chicken legs once it a while. Give me a break! If you are new to both cooking and frugality, you might get something out of it, but otherwise, take my word for it - you already know everything the author has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"USEFUL!","review":"Food tasty overall - being from TX did have to add some spice but didn't blow our budget.

Recipes could be found online for free from most any recipe site. the recipe for SUN TEA is actually included! Most chicken recipes include boneless skinless chicken breasts. 12 days of turkey page is no help at all...mostly substitutions for the mayo on a sandwich.This book could have been much better.

Although I finished it, the story began to lose me (I'll try and do this without giving anything away) when Beatrice responds as she does to Warrren. Nothing given to us about his character up to that point would seem to cause her doubts. Not to mention that what finally happens between them seems to evolve not out of the normal flow of their lives but more in the way of an author's attempt to write a potential movie. It had so many possibilities in the beginning but dwindled, at least for me, to hokey contrivances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what was expected","review":"It may have all the songs from the air gear anime but, it doesn't have the full version of the opening credits. The music is very techno. The picture on front it good. In the booklet there seems to be the lyrics for the opening song but there in japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"Like the rest of the books in the Dummies series, this book takes a light-hearted approach to a heavy topic such as gardening. By focusing on vegetables the content remains helpful and informative. The book was divided into sensible sections--the basics, what to plant, how to plant, and so forth. I appreciated the instruction on gardening beginnings such as constructing a bean pole and what tools a novice needs. The last half of the book talks about specific vegetables, and has handy information on what grows best where. I believe this makes a good first-time gardener book or a companion to a book with more pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"gardening for dummies","review":"If you are a first time gardener you will love this book it haslots of details and helpful hints"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This book is an autobiography of Jack London.

This is an excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"A wonderful book! I read it for a thesis paper, and couldn't believe the quality of the writing. The imagery London uses is captivating, as is the whole plot line.

I guess its better than selling out. This novel is about class in America, ambition and the inevitability of selling out when success is achieved. It is also a classic study of the adage, \\"be careful what you wish for because you just might get it\\". The main character's discovery that upper class values are not what he imagined is chilling. As a Gen-Xer this book appealed to me on many levels proving that it is truly a timeless classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidewinder and Beyond","review":"If you're a fan of the Lee Morgan \\"Sidewinder\\" and \\"Rumproller\\" sessions, you should give this disc some serious consideration. The pairing of Virgil Jones on trumpet and Foster on tenor strikes a similar note, though there are clearly differences between Foster's and early Joe Henderson's sounds. In addition to several tunes that evoke the classic Morgan/Henderson pairing, you may quickly become a fan of the extended version of Fats Waller's \\"Jitterbug Waltz\\" featured on this set. Definitely worthwhile if you are starting to explore the playing of some solid musicians whose names don't feature so prominently in the popular history of jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN\\"T TRUST THESE REVIEWS","review":"Once again it seems the HOGARTH clan wrote the other reviews.....can't think of any other reason why anyone would write a good review for this cringeworthy offering......after the first vocals on track one my wife gave me a withering look and demanded that I stop that noise.....we don't always agree on music, but in this case she was dead right.....HOGARTH must be tone deaf....his singing is horrid and sends shivers down your spine for all the wrong reasons.....the songs are totaly cliche and his guitar playing is almost inaudible.....the mix takes the guitar into a far corner of another studio....taking the quality of the playing, this is not a bad thing......I've also travelled in elevators that provided far more interesting soundtracks than this insipid mix of pseudo soulfull tunes....this washes over you in a most unpleasant way and it is not an experience I ever want to repeat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For those of you out there considering buying this cd. My word of advice..DON'T! Coco has a good voice but all her songs sound the same. Even the titles are the same. She does not represent the asian race, there are many asian singers out there far better than she will ever be. She doesn't even compose her own music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is she thinking!","review":"This album that coco just released is really disappointing. Yeah, she can sing but there are a lot of singers in asia that can sing much better then her. It just seem that the record company just wanted to stick someone with an asian face in the market to attract the asian buyers. The album sounded the same from the beginning to the end and did you guys noticed the words! They were horrible! I like her asian cds so much better then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop the hype","review":"This album is no more than ordinary. I prefer her chinese albums.And please people stop the hype. Coco will not be the first asian to sing in Oscar, it's Lea Salonga.

And, this indonesian contemporary ethnic artist named Anggun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Try...","review":"Okay, I admit that Coco Lee can sing a bit better than Britney Spears... But I think that her voice is rather thin although she can sing all the \\"Ah\\"s and \\"Ee\\"s in R&BThe songs in this album seems to be repeating itself... However, there are some nice numbers like \\"Do You Want My Love\\", \\"Just No Other Way\\", \\"Before I Fall In Love\\" and \\"All Tied Up\\"... Other than that, the songs are just like variations of this or that tracks. Further more, most the songs in this album are in slow numbers except for the 1st track which is more exciting... The others can put you slowly to dreamland... As simple as that :-)People in Asia should not buy this album because it is not as good as her Chinese albums. Further more, since Coco Lee hit the U.S. market, she has become more cocky than ever. People in U.S. should buy this album because you would be able to hear a bit more better singing than Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hohum....","review":"Another one of those pop albums.... not bad, nothing fantastic either, in my opinion that is!

All I can say is that there is absolutely nothing special about this album. Besides the fact that she's asian, she sounds like every other bubblegum pop singer out there. She has no niche in the market, and her singing isn't great. You know the phrase \\"I've seen better, but not many?\\" Well this doesn't fit! I've heard better AND many! There's nothing special about the songs either. They sound like every other R&B song out there. If she thinks she can make it with an album like that, she should guess again! This one blows chunks.All I can say in a nutshell about this album is, SONY MADE A BIG BOO-BOO promoting THIS one to compete with today's pop market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmmmm.........","review":"No one should support her just because she is Asian. That is being biased. Only thing I can say is that she needs to bringing in something new...as Jennifer Lopez introduced Latin/Pop/R&B, etc. She should have put some \\"Asian\\" flavor to her music. I don't know why everyone from all different race is trying to be more \\"black\\" than black people. What she's doing is everything that was done in 1998-1999. Plus, Kelly Price's song sounds just like Chuckie Booker's song...I mean \\"Just Like It.\\" She can definitely use some new song writers. Her title track \\"Do You Want My Love\\" features an un-known rapper who is a cheap copy of Kid Capri...Anyways, for all of you interested in this album, just download it via MP3..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+","review":"maybe its just me but lately american music seems so boring and monotonous. even british pop has more soul and meaning than american r&b these days . coco lees CD is a combination of rock r&b jazz an pop . her voice sounds like a cross between christina aguilera and teena marie , remember her from the 80's ? my favorite on the album is the west side story meets west coast music \\" crazy ridiculous\\" it sounds like a hip hop latin salsa theatrical frenzy ! she may not be plastered all over mtv but n e one who appreciates classic r&b should dig it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge Her By The Way She Is","review":"It is unfortunate to see so many people are making comparisons with no ground. Many reviews are suggesting that CoCo Lee is either trying to be or not as good as Mariah Carey, Lauryn Hill, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, even Celion Dion and so on. But the fact is that she's just starting, there's no way she could be totally different because most of us don't like to hear anything other than mainstream. Yes, at times she does sound a little like Mariah or all of the above. But who could deny that at one point, Mariah sounded like Whitney; Christina sounded like Britney; Celion sounded like Barbara Streisand ? I personally don't know and don't care how good she is in Asia, all I know is people are pumping up their expectations when it comes to the time to judge her, while lowering their expectations for people like Christina and Britney. Be fair, give CoCo some credits !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coco's up there with the best","review":"Come on you gotta admit that she's got it. She's got the grove to her songs. If you listened to some of her Manderin songs it hits you like 'Wow'. This CD is one of the best that I've heard from her. I wish tht she would translate some of her asian songs into english though. But this CD is a pretty good CD for the states. Buy it if you want something to jam to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Chinese Star in America?","review":"Yes, COCO is not the first Asian, but hey, she is the first Chinese right? one out of many BILLIONS to make it to perform in the Oscars and be heard by Americans should be fair, right? White Americans never had any biases towards any entertainers, right?. Don't get me wrong, music should be entertaining. COCO is good...and she is asian...let her give the asian community a shout out to the world that, yes, we asians/chinese can also sing and entertain...Bruce Lee rocks!!! now, he was a man who got ripped off by the entertainment industry!!! hopefully it wouldn't happen to COCO."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl can sing!","review":"I am a big fan of her music since the release of \\"DI DA DI\\" and have almost every song she has ever released. Granted some of it is a bit bubblegum-pop sounding, but that seems to be the trend lately. I mean why else would Britney Spears be famous? This english album is good, although not as emotional as her Cantonese and Mandarin releases. But it is definitly worth the time and effort. Personally my fav track is \\"Wherever You Go\\", it is very catchy and even if its the first time listening to it you find yourself singing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep an open mind...","review":"Hi everyone! I am not really reviewing this CD, but more opinion about one reviewer's bias, and to let you know he is wrong. Matador3, one of the reviewers, made inaccurate statements about Asian and Asian-American music. I agree, there are some musicians in Asia who are all about hype and imitation, but not all of them are...hey, there are American musicians who act and sing the same, take those bubble-gum pop stars for instance. His claims of imitation are not entirely true, most pop stars have someone who they model themselves after. So, everyone, keep an open mind about artists, regardless of who they are and where they come from. Coco Lee should be judged fairly, and all artists should, she's a reasonably good artist.

OR less. i dont kno about ppl these days. anyway, i like the song ALL TIED UP IN YOU.. it shows her real vocals.

This is just boring pop music. If you're looking for an Asian singer who's trying to break into the U.S. market by singing English, try Hikaru Utada.Coco has the voice for Mandarin ballads/pop. Even people who don't understand Chinese rather listen to her Chinese songs. Her English songs are boring and lame....reminds me of Jessica Simpson's first album with those lame upbeat tracks (with the exception of \\"I wanna love you forever,\\" \\"your faith in me,\\" \\"heart of innocence,\\" and \\"where you are.\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING BUT SOMEWHAT A GOOD EFFORT","review":"After I listened the CD for few times I find it tiring. Lack of decent lyrics and the melody is pretty much copy of others. There was nothing special in her album.

Besides, she is not the best singer that I have heard. Try Shanza, Sandy Lam, Sally Yeh and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"No effort","review":"Coco Lee may have talent, and her voice is incredible. Too bad it's not once put to good use. The CD is laced with recycled and boring R&B tracks. She may have a reputation, but it's meaningless unless the CD is quality. It's not. Sadly, she tries too hard to conform to American pop culture. Instead of introducing an Asian sound, she brings nothing new. While she has the talent, her lack of effort places her with the Britney and Christina wannabes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not known here in Holland, but certainly worth buying!","review":"I've come across Coco when I was looking for music by Julio Iglesias on the net. Listened to a duet of them and was astonished by her voice. I did not know who she was so I searched the net and found some Chinese songs of her. A realy great voice (and a nice looking girl too :) ) Now I came across her first English CD and I bought it imediatly. I must say that she can do mutch better then this because althoug I do not understand Chinese, I like some of her Chinese songs more (Stay with me tonight etc.) but this is her first English CD and I think we will here more of her soon.

The only good comment can be attributed to this CD is that her English is native quality, and that's it. It's hard to describe how sad this sorry affair really is. This is karaoke bar quality material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Nothing special. I couldn't see anything with creativity in this album.

Originality here comes first, and of course good music. one instance, Macy Gray, good music and creativity. not just by copying others craft. Shes not pretty but American loved her songs. She has an interesting voice may not be compared to Mariah, Whitney or Celine but you will know that she owns it. Its her trademark. And, one thing why asians will never make it here in US? coz they always compare theirselves to foreign artists.

Other than the standout track and first single, \\"Do You Want My Love\\" (produced by one of my favorite house remixers, Frankie Knuckles), the rest of the songs are really filler. And a guest appearance by Kelly Price on this album isn't going to help make this album any better.I don't think Sony really marketed this album well enough before it was released. They should have at least allowed \\"Do You Want My Love\\" some major radio airplay and maybe some heavy video rotation on MTV. They could've even released \\"Do You Want My Love\\" as a commercial single before releasing the album.

However, I don't understand how we're supposed to figure that out on this sugar-coated, overly-synthesized, horribly-written album. You'd think that Sony would have had the savvy to realize that this cheesy pop stuff (it's NOT R&B! ) would not be recevied well in the US. I wish Ms. Lee the best of luck and I hope that Sony will give her another chance at the US market -- maybe next time she'll be able to work on material that doesn't make me want to curl under my bed and scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds the same like all the others!","review":"This is not bad, but not too good either.

Try Faye Wong."},{"rating":"2","title":"COCO PAVING THE WAY FOR OTHER CHINESE SINGERS","review":"Lemme tell you guys the truth. I only bought the CD to support CoCo, since I luv all of Chinese CDs, and I bought it to still give sum faith for CoCo. I'm only 12, and lemme tell you, this CD is reely worth buying! Not only does it have beautiful lyrics, catch melodies, but CoCo has put a lot of effort into the singing, and it has certainly showed! I'm Chinese, and I think CoCo is paving a way for other Chinese singers to become famous not only in the US, but worldwide. People such as Jacky Cheung, VaLen Hsu, yuki hsu, and David Tao will guaranteed become reely famous here. In JUST NO OTHER WAY, I realy liked all the songs. They all had their individual specialty and were all good listening to. The only song I didn;t reely like was #9, Don't You Want Mah Love. Maybe the song titles could have differed a little, I admit, but overall it really is a good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is wonderful","review":"Coco is great! I played it in my car and people actually ASKED who the singer was. They couldn't believe that she is an Asian, and one of them actually made a turn to the CD store down the road and bought it (I guess). Go figure.Her voice is wonderful, the songs can be better. Give her any song from Christina (she is good) or Jessica's (hate her voice) albums, Coco will do better. She has the essence of a mature woman that neither of the other so-called 'teen divas' have. If you are talking about sexy: Coco IS sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is a good debut for her. I think that this will give the american public a chance to see what she is like. As with all Albums there are a few \\"bad\\" songs. Buts its a taste and there are more good than bad so thats good. There is a mix of different styles of music so it appeals to most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Sure, it's good to see an Asian artist trying to break into the U.S. barrier, but this album won't do it. I have nothing against Coco, she has a nice voice, and while this cd somewhat demonstrated that with interesting voice ranges, it's not something to cling on. Coco's style is not very eccentric to be noticed really. Her music is R&B/POP, a dying and yet overrated market. If you want to listen to some backed washed familiar forgetful pop, this isn't a bad choice. It won't leave much affect though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting musical experience","review":"This album has joined the ranks as a top favorite in my collection. Bill Sims takes his listeners through an authentic musical journey. Like aged wine, his voice and excellent musical arrangements evokes your every emotion. I am really blown away by this album - Bill Sims, the bluesman has got a lot of soul to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I'm afraid the performance is neither interesting nor passionate. The story is contrived and incredible.

However, I thought I could use a little challenge so bought Basic Series 2 which in theory is just one step up from Basic Series 1. Perhaps Series 2 should have been named Basic series 2 1/2 as the poses were quite a bit more complicated and many really challenge the knee (a big problem area for me). Unlike Series 1, I did not find it that easy to follow the directions and had to keep looking up out of my bend or whatever to see what the pose was supposed to look like. Series 2 is more of a workout than Series 1 and though the running time is listed as 58 minutes, only about 50 of those are spent doing active poses. The last 8 minutes the students are lying on their mats in corpse pose and breathing deeply while Ms. Ward sits and looks solemnly at the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin plot but great characters","review":"I have read several of Ms Leon's Venice based mysteries. I have never visited Venice, but find her descriptions of life there to be very satisfying! Her Inspector Brunetti is also satisfyingly drawn with a typical family and interesting perspectives on Italian government and society.I am a big fan of David Hewson's Nic Costa mysteries which also based in Italy and several in Venice. Hewson's work is somewhat richer, but a little bizarre.Both provide in-depth perspectives on Italian life that I find fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniform Justice: A Commissario Guido Brunetti Mystery","review":"Via Amazon - Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is where Leon starts losing it","review":"I bought all the Brunetti books through The Girl of His Dreams at one time (having just discovered the novels) and from Uniform Justice on, they get progressively worse. Leon has become wildly anti-American to the point of absurdity, pulling out every sterotype imaginable. Plus she focuses on the environment to the extent of forgetting what sort of book she is writing. Once, for a theme, is fine; time after time is just distracting. But most of all, from this novel on, she forgets that books must have an ending. From Uniform Justice through the next six books I read, she has no sense of justice and the books essentially end with the rich and powerful literally getting away with murder. Once, like in Uniform Justice, okay, but enough is enough. No matter how much Brunetti is a compelling character, his wife has turned into a nutter and the books are depressing. Read the series through Wilful Behavior, then stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"This is the third and last of her books I will read. The other two were not all that intriguing and the endings were disappointing. At the end the question in you mind was: 'That's it? That's all there is to this?'This one was different. It is one of those books that keeps you up at night because you want to read a few more pages before turning out the lights. But then you reach the end and you are appalled. I won't give away the ending but it will offend your sense of justice.Donna Leon's books have two parts. One part is the mystery. That is fiction. The second part is about Italy. Because of her extensive experience there, that is fact. The picture of the venality and corruption she paints in her books has taken some of the shine off the impression I got from a three-week tour in 2012.I wanted to go back but now I'm not so sure I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfiorm Justice","review":"Intelligent, warm, family, \\"great food and wine\\" crime solving, great characters.

Always interesting, just have to make myself read something else when I have just finished one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Donna Leon book","review":"I've happily read all the Donna Leon mysteries, and enjoyed them from the beginning, although less and less lately. I recognize the author's right, to a point, to push her views through her characters, but the books have become so \\"anti-\\" that I have trouble enjoying them. Death of Faith was little more than a bitter anti-Catholic rant. And Uniform Justice does the same for the military, painting all military members of all countries as ultra conservative, brainless, immoral, borderline (or worse) facists. The many anti-American and anti-tourist comments (a true but over used cliche) are also harder and harder to get past pleasantly.The series has degenerated into little more than bitter ranting, and left character development and intricate plot twists behind. Donna Leon seems to have had five or six good stories to tell, and is now just filling paper and lining her pockets with her reputation.I'll miss these books, the first five or six were so pleasant, witty, and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"a political platform","review":"I was rather disappointed by this book. The mystery starts off as rather interesting, but one sees the solution quite early on. What gets very tiresome is the continuous political preaching. Ms Leon is entitled to her opinions, and I do not mind their being mentioned occasionally under the guise of a character's beliefs. But this was really too much: it is supposed to be a mystery, not a political platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I did not feel this book was as good as others. However, this is still one of the best series I've read in a long time. The writing has reminded consistently good, unlike the Anne Perry series in which the writing deminished to such a level that I can no longer read her booksAlso, has anyone noticed that the books seem to get more and more cynical as the series moves forward -- Patta gets dumber and Venice and Italy more corrupt?S"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was so disappointing. Leon writes fairly well but she yearns to write a political commentary more then a murder mystery. In her anti-american/anti-military bias she makes her chararcters look ignorant and provencial. Look elsewhere for a compelling mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"In all, this is at best a mediocre afternoon TV movie or a straigt to DVD release. How did the film ever win the awards indicated on the cover? The latter by the way, unlike the flick, looks promising. The film has an innane plot that is banal to the max, pretentious even. The acting is flaky (yes, even Dee Wallace Stone and Udo Kier). There is a russian scientist/doctor who has such an unnatural russian accent, the unwitting may have thought they are watching a monty-python moment, really the segment was a hoot! Note - this film intends to be serious and gripping, not farsical. The special effects are creature of the black lagoon standard and the overall pace is erratic. Why waste resources and make a film like this? Actually, the discerning would have gotten a bad vibe right from the start when the credits appeared.

He goes to friends and doctors searching for answers to what is happening to him.The box made Head Space sound interesting but it wasn't.

The high thread count is nice, although a bit useless, since to maintain the warranty, you're required to have a cover on.

As a MC, Def is not to be messed with, kid is beyond nice but on this album he suffers by trying to do a Andre 3000 type of joint and falls flat on his face. Mc's should stick to rapping if I wanna hear a MC sing, I would have bought Nelly's new joint:) The most disappointing is the version of close to the edge which doesnt sound beat wise anything like the beat from the chappelle show. Mos is without a doubt the nicest MC out but he should get with someone who makes hot beats and just flow, this hybrid concept album BS is garbage it is in no way even worthy of being mentioned with Dre 3000's joint which was fire.

In light of that theme, let me just state that Mos Def's trash is most definately not my treasure. If I could give this album negative stars I would but alas, Amazon won't allow for that. Just because Mos is trying to break through and/or meld different genres of music together doesn't mean that it works. Just because it's something that hasn't been heard before doesn't mean that it deserves to be heard, and while I appreciate his ambition, I don't appreciate this nonsense from an artist I have loved, respected, and admired since Black Star hit the scene. These words can't even express how disappointed I am that I spent my hard-earned $15 on this mind-numbingly ridiculous collection of notes that tries to pass off as music.

Then there are songs like \\"Modern Marvel\\" and \\"War\\", which don't really fall into any categories.

I have made the mistake several times and bought or not bought CD's based on these descriptions. In this case...the last few reviews are right on. This showing from Mos Def is very different than Black on Both Sides. So don't expect an all out hip hop album. Mos Def brings a different element to his fans and I can appreciate him for that. However, I would be lying if I said that I didn't miss his old style. Also, I was a little disappointed with the track \\"CLOSE EDGE\\". I first heard this track on the Dave Chappelle show. It actually sounded better live than it does in the recording studio.In summary...this disc should defffffinatly be in your collection. If not...you are missing out on the evolution of Hip Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let an artist create!","review":"I am tired of reading reviews from so-called \\"die-hard\\" fans of artists who, when the new album doesn't sound exactly like the last one, are quick to dis what the artist has done. I commend Mos Def for making this album because it does tread on some risky ground for a \\"rapper.\\" It is obvious that Mos is growing as a musician and a lyricist. If you are looking for another \\"Black on Both Sides,\\" or \\"Black Star,\\" I suggest buying those albums again. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the growth shown on this album and allow yourself to experience something that bends genres, expectations, and all labels. Sort of like Mos himself.

For all of those who expected that, didn't get it, and complained about it, pop the disc back in the deck and just listen over and over until you get the message. Mos Def is an artist and this is his artistic outbreak. He is telling the world that hip hop needs to move, not just forward, but outward, into real music, into creative impossibility, into art. The day of the B-boy is over and Mos Def is one of the most daring moving us into a whole new era. Creative and thought-provoking.

Play it loud, play it from start to finnish. It looks like hip-hop dun grown up. I think it's about time.PS. The guitar, if you old school boys can remember, founded the sound of hip-hop. Back to the essence yet right on top of thingsremember RUNDMC?

The guy has got mad talent. New Danger has more emotion than any other album I've heard in a while.

When i purchased this album i wanted REAL HIP HOP not this mix of rock/hip-hop style that mos def has choosen to use. To me this was just a marketing gimic used to expand fan base.

However, this New Danger is a colossal failure.Half of the songs are not even songs at all. Most of the album is just Mos Def talking/ trying to sing over a good beat.

I thought this album would be great, sh** was I wrong! I wasn't even close, this album was so weak. Every track seemed to be rock-ish, I wan't sure if I was listening to Mos Def or AC/DC. Talib Kweli's album was far FAR better than Mos Def's. I think i was being kind giving this album 2 stars... i think it was out of respect of what he's done in the past.

This is no rap cd. so if u are looking for him to rap, do not buy this .again to make clear I am a fan of his earlier stuff, I have seen him and kweli in concert.but this album is a pile of dog doo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im Sorry I Bought This","review":"This Is Mos Def's Worst album to date, I don't know what the mission of this album was to fulfill. It had songs where sometiems mos def sung over a rock song, songs where he was singing, and songs where he was trying to accomplish reggae. This album was most likely experimental and it blows, mos raps on about 7 tracks which are the only good songs on the cd, he doesn't go back to the basic soul hip-hop like on Black On Both Sides Which is a great album. I don't know what mos was smoking when he made this and i hope it never happens again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"I like Mos Def's \\"Black on Both Sides\\" and the Black Star album, as well as some of his collabs with The Roots, Common, High & Mighty, ect...but this album is worthless. It's all pop slow jams that are boring and mundane. If you liked \\"UMI SAYS\\" from B.O.B.S. the most off that album, then this may be for you. But for Hip Hop fans and Mos' fans this will most likely dissapoint. The Rap-Rock doesn't fit his style, the love ballads get boring after the first 8 bars and everything else is just boring to me. As a HIP HOP fan I can't recommend this album, but I do give him credit for having the cahonies to experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity Crisis","review":"There are a few tracks on this Cd that are pretty tight - but there are some where it's not at all classic Mos Def. I have his black on both sides as well as the 4 CD pack made by Sattan (not available worldwide) and this new CD is totally off, with a lot of rock incorporated for no reason - where Mos is screaming throughout the songs. Just meaningless yelling. And there's even a song that he produced that is all music - rock music - and he doesn't even rap at all. It just seems like he's trying to be too creative and not holding on to his roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far safer than the name implies","review":"Mos Def can flow like no other as tracks like Close Edge demonstrate. Unfortunately, that track is a gem surrounded by tired, rap-rock garbage. I guess for some that's a good thing, but for me, blaaaah."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that Dangerous","review":"\\"When i purchased this album i wanted REAL HIP HOP not this mix of rock/hip-hop style that mos def has choosen to use. To me this was just a marketing gimic used to expand fan base. To me Mos def is one of the most talanted men in HIP HOP .... I wish he showed his skillz on this album.\\" -- Originally posted by KevinI TOTALLY AGREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Mos forget how to rap?","review":"I really don't know what he was thinking. I was a huge fan of the blackstar album, and black on both sides, but this was totally ridiculous. If I wanted minute-long intros to every track, I would have bought the Yanni CD. Mos should be sticking to his strong point (hip-hop) and not this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"People are being dishonest if they say this album is dope","review":"I'm a SUPA DUPA Mos Def fan (I even like Mos Def BETTER than Talib Kweli!!!)...but you gotta be an official d*** rider to like \\"this\\" album. This album is HORRIBLE!!! Don't get me wrong...there are a \\"FEW\\" hot joints on this album (not enough to \\"save\\" the album though), but if you don't like to waste money...I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend that you give this album a listen BEFORE buying it. If you don't know much about Mos Def, then DONT buy this album...get the \\"Black Star\\" album and/or the \\"Black On Both Sides\\" album instead. Those are SURE shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY IS EVERYONE BITING THEIR TONGUE???","review":"This was a disappointment Sophomore solo CD for Mos Def and at times very annoying. Everyone knows that Mos can go with the best of em and is probably one of the top ten MC's in the game today, however you wouldn't know this by listening to this CD. Let me just ask all of the people that gave this CD a 4 or 5 star rating, If you had never heard of Mos Def and you brought this as his first release, would you honestly give it a 4 or 5 start rating... I THINK NOT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the new rubbish","review":"its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message to Ziggy","review":"Your feelings seem to be hurt that this album was not enjoyed. Everyone has the right to their own opinion. You must be a girl or want to be a girl. Stop crying like a little hctib.!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOS bOO-bOO","review":"I used to be a big fan of Mos. He does good features on other peoples' songs, but his albums are horrible. I'm sorry. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"one of the gayest cds ive ever heard.. this aint even rap, its some punk rock ish... dont waste your money0 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's look at this record from another angle.","review":"I believe those who were so let down by this album might be missing the point. You probably, like me, expected another bullseye from Mos Def, and expected it to hit all the same buttons inside you as his first one did. Black On Both Sides is one of my favorite records, but if you're an artist, you're allowed to switch it up. This album shows an artist who is moving forward, and spreading his wings. This album, on many fronts, is richer than the first one. Some of the grooves are deeper, more complex. Yes, he goes off the path here and there, but that's how you grow.I'm with Mos Def on this album, and I want to follow him to where he's going. I think this album is worth getting to know, just like the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!!","review":"This album is definitely worth the wait if you're a Mos Def fan. If you have been following his work before this album, then you'll know Mos has been working with his band Black Jack Johnson. There is a lot of live work done on this album. This is more than a basic \\"hip hop\\" album (Sample based production and rhymes about nothing), this album is an eclectic mix of Mos Def's musical influences up to now. It has a mix of Blues, Soul (Marvin Gaye joint is tight!), Rock, Jazz, and of course good old deeper level hip hop. If you are expecting Black on Both Sides, this is not it, listen to that album...open your mind and appreciate that we have artists like Mos Def that release music that isn't tainted."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE WORK","review":"WHEN I FIRST HERD THE MOS DEF CD I WAS BLOWN AWAY BECUASE I COULD'T BELIEVE THAT HE PUT ON THOSE DIFFERNT ELEMENTS INTO IT HE AS SOME BLUES, ROCK AND ROLL SOME POETRY HIP HOP AND HE SINGS ON SOME TRACK AND THINK THIS CD IS GOOD, IT'S A MORE MUTRE SOUND, SO KIDS IF YOU JUST NOW GETTING TURNED ON TO MOS, YOU MAY HAVE TO GO BACK TO BLACK ON BOTH SIDE, BECUASE THIS ALBUM IS REAL CREATIVE, BUT HE IS A TRUE ARTIST. THANK YOU MOS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talib, please help him out!!!!!!!!!","review":"Look this is supposed to be hiphop, not rock n roll not country not nothing else. I bought this album because I knew this was gonna have that underground original hiphop sound that I could listen to at night but the only song on there that I could dig was a sample from 3 years ago, the takeover, lyrics changed up and all. Look Mos Def I want my money back or I am going to bootleg 4 copies of this bull!@#$ 5 dollars a piece and get my money 4 that. This album is a disgrace 4 any true hiphop heads I wish people would stop saying things are hot just because a certain person made it or is in the song look people I have been listening to hiphop 4 over 20 years and this is the first and probably will be the last cd that I have ever turned in this is garbage and for all ya'll that say that this is hot just put the blunts and the 40's down because you are either drunk or high!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graham crackers good enough for Mommy to eat too!","review":"I LOVE these graham sticks. They dissolve well and are super yummy (yes, I have eaten quite a few of them:). I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot. As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best. For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey. They don't have anything \\"scary\\" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners. Just vitamins and natural, organic products."},{"rating":"2","title":"organic graham crackers","review":"Bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. I love them because they are organic. Only the best for my little guys. My big guys even snack on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well","review":"I really didn't notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advice to the Serious Seeker","review":"A wonderful introduction to Schuon's teachings. It is a fourfold lesson on the divine attributes of Truth, Virtue, Beauty and Prayer. Recommended as a launching point for those wishing to study the Perennialist School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting even to a nonhistorian","review":"I caught this on PBS, intending to tape it for someone else, and ended up watching it myself and enjoying it! I am not a history/politics person, and I still found it good. At times the Churchill actor sitting at his desk and smoking annoyed me, but there was still lots of original footage to keep it visually interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and annoying sounds & broke first day","review":"Bought this backhoe at Target last night. This morning, my son found it and was so excited. Very difficult to unpack. Had to use my electric screwdriver to take off 8 screws from bottom of packaging. The noises that the toy made irritated my son, and he asked me to remove the batteries (4 AA batteries). We have many battery operated toys that make noises, but this one is particularly obnoxious.Took the toy out to the sandbox today at the park, and son played with it about 5 minutes, then went on to other activities. It still had a tag on the lever reading \\"pull to activate.\\" I pulled and the small plastic lever cracked. I noticed the whole toy was stiff and the buckets hardly moved at all, perhaps because of the plastic plates on sides that appear to have been added for finger protection. In any case, this toy was a major disappointment, and am returning to store tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"My boy dropped this off of a small kid table, about 14\\" off the floor, and broke one of the hydraulic cylinder rams. No problem, everything else works fine. Then, a few weeks later, the bucket won't lift/lower. Nice.It was fun while it lasted, but it didn't last long. My three-year-old got a total of about 3 play hours with this. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought this front end loader and backhoe for my 2 yr old grandson for Christmas 2009. He played with it very often, learned what the 8 different buttons were for.The batteries lasted one year; but they still work for a few of the features.I shall replace them so every feature works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat informative, but not the best","review":"I've been spending the past few weeks studying for the GRE. I've read the majority of the books out there that tell how to study for the exam. And I've found that the Arco book is not very good. While it may have numerous practice problems, it does not contain very much information about how to solve the problems. For example, when it comes to antonyms, the book suggests that if you don't know the meaning of a word, click (C) and move on. I advise reading the Kaplan book. It was by far the most informative of the lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just to practice","review":"This is not a study guide by any stretch of the imagination. Go through the practice exams and discard. CD-ROM is a nice addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY HAVENT I HEARD OF THIS SOONER?","review":"let me say i have never heard of this band until two weeks ago, and let me say i have been pleasantly surprised. theyhave the charm and wit of jonathan richman, and a playful way of music much like the elephant 6 bands. the songs here are a whole lot of fun and charming.... i heard that they had another album in the can after this one that showed a progression in their music, too bad alex had to skip town and leave it in record limbo, i hope someday their follow-up will be ressurected and pianosaurus can be realized for the ididot savant genius. find this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Book","review":"Wrox books are always a disappointment. This book does not include any decent example. On top of that does not include any source code. The author say's you can download the source from wrox website but its not there. Do not buy this book or any wrox book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enigma","review":"Tired of those ordinary Hollywood films? Then Enigma is for you. Superb casting, direction, screenplay, and music will take you through a great dramatic film. It was well worth a trip of nearly 100 miles each way to view during its limited release. This small film was hugely entertaining!!!! Two Thumbs Up and Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers Mr Turing","review":"A sort of tribute to the genius Alan Turing who should have a statue bigger than Nelson's Column in the UK.

I bought both a new copy of the \\"Enigma\\" DVD and a used copy of the DVD. Neither DVD will load in my Toshiba SD-1700 DVD player. Please pay attention to the fine print that says, \\"Some Region 1 DVDs may contain Regional Coding Enhancement (RCE). Some, but not all, of our international customers have had problems playing these enhanced discs on what are called \\"region-free\\" DVD players.\\" My experience suggests that the problem is more pervasive than that. My DVD player is a Region 1 player, and both copies of the DVD are Region 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A rather tepid thriller that wastes a quietly interesting performance by Kate Winslet, Enigma follows a bored Dougray Scott through a pedestrian series of events--look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"A film trying to emulate the best of Hitchcock, doesn't quite succeed. The plot doesn't make 100 percent sense. A reasonbly ordinary man is caught up in great events. He is charged with solving two mysteries: what happened to Clair and breaking a new German code. Somehow he manages to solve both mysteries at the same time. The best parts of the film are the police interrogations. Those scenes are crisp and dramatic. Wait for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Video","review":"As noted in other reviews, the video quality of this dvd is horrible. Not to mention, the movie is a bit slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Doesn't Gel","review":"Any movie in which the star spends his penultimate scene explaining what's been happening, is in trouble. Humphrey Bogart managed it in \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" but Dougray Scott is no Bogart. As a leading man he lacks just about everything. I caught this film on TV after the opening credits had rolled and didn't recognize Kate Winslet until her name showed up at the end. The plot comes at you from every point on the compass: Britain, Russia, Germany, Poland, America; but basically it's about a German spy working inside the code-breaking team in the UK during WW2. You're left at the end with more or less a big \\"Huh?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I am suprised this movie is not being released until 2002, Saffron Burrows plays an amazing supporting role & Kate Winslet is unrecognisable (looks like Ab Fab's Saffron)Watch this movie, it's a good old fashioned movie & shows a key point in WW2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie!","review":"This is a great movie encompassing intrigue, action, and romance.
