(especially considering the stories potential) She worked and was friends with fellow rockawaites, but was so convinced she was better than everyone else that rather than see the individuality and intrigue of each of her characters, she wrote page after page about how culturally and mentally linear each was. She introducted wacky characters who could have been fun and the reader, if they wanted, could have deduced were drunks. However, by Jill telling us that there was nothing we could possibly gain from these close-minded, local \\"drunks\\", the reader is forced to ask, \\"why bother reading about them?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Locals Only","review":"As someone who personally knows all the characters in the book, I was disappointed that Jill missed such a wonderful opportunity to explore the quirkiness of the people and the neighborhood.

At first, I was intrigued because I live in Rockaway. However, as I began reading the author's narratives, I began to realize that the author herself cannot be from Rockaway. All her characters, whether imagined or based on her \\"friends\\", are quite depressing and truly have no hope. If that was her intention, to analyze why such depression exists in those who live in a non-connected, sub-intellectual location, she truly made her point.

An hour later, I have one pure white spot on the back of my head and the rest of the color has dried up already without the least bit of lightening.

Though a Christian Scientist himself, he is no apologist but a clear eyed, sympathetic scholar who has the intellectual wherewithal to place her in a historical context (see his explanation of her Puritan background or the section on Mark Twain for example) and to do justice to her religious ideas. He does this while keeping in view her humanity and the steep price she paid for holding true to her own conscience-driven mission. Not a quick read but well worth the time spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliantly written, inspiring to read","review":"Stephen Gottchalk's writing is articulate and illuminating.

Scott Fitzgerald or Ernest Hemingway, to be sure. More like an extended take by Flannery O'Connor from a Native American perspective.To read (and re-read) \\"The Almanac of the Dead,\\" \\"Under the Volcano,\\" (Malcolm Lowry) \\"Wise Blood,\\" (O'Connor) and \\"Moby Dick\\" (guess who) is to obtain a comprehensive view of America from the underside.

It is time to take our lives back from those that destroy and plunder our Earth Mother, and seek nothing more then greed for comfort.I hope a revolution develops, like the one in Almanac of the Dead.

Certainly the book may be too \\"strange\\" or \\"bizaare\\" for some readers. Those who think that reality is television, shopping malls, and suburbia may find the insights into how the rest of humanity lives to be disturbing.

I'd read some high praise for it, and I am interested in Native American culture and authors, and I've lived in Arizona all my life. But it was boring. I had to force myself to finish it. I also found it hostile to white people. I understand that there are reasons for such hostility, but as a person who is primarily white, but who has some Native American ancestry and much respect for Native American culture, it offended me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I found Silko's book too disturbing to keep on reading. I understand that the disturbing nature of the work is the point of the book, but it was too depressing (and,as another reviewer noted, gratuitously so), that, rather than become engrossed, I became turned off and disappointed.

For me, it was a powerful reminder of how strong and tight-knit the Jersey City community is. But it is also an amazing testament to what Hurley has done at St Anthony. What strikes me most is the ferocity with which he drives his players, and his sons, but the gentlemen he becomes outside the practice or game. Amazing. It provides a vivid display of the dedication required to play at the Division I level, particularly in Bobby's case (which isn't for everyone by the way).

The guys visit a fringe town and get into fights with the cops and uncover an evil plot to destroy the country while Kyle gets manipulated into launching a dangerous satellite. The whole thing is a mess, frankly, and it felt like DC was compelled to run a story that tried to help kids who'd never known their parents deal with some of those emotions.

They held up through an 11,000 mile US road trip, keeping a soft roof bag strapped tightly to my car. The hooks fit well under the lip of the wheel well in the back. Attaching them in other places wasn't quite as easy, and though the hooks are fairly versatile, they can slip even though they're rubberized. A textured surface on the hooks might have been better. Still it's a small negative. The only other issue was that one of them began to fray a bit after lots and lots of tighten/loosen cycles (60 or so days worth). This was mostly because the tension angle was not fully parallel to the tightening mechanism, so the strap would get caught in the edge of it. Not exactly a bad design, just something to watch out for. Overall they performed very well in a demanding and high use situation, and I expect to get lots more good use out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improper design for a campbuckle","review":"These straps are decent as in they hold small stuff.

For anyone with more than an inch or two of hair, or thick hair, it's not very useful. Also very tightly connected and difficult to open. The quality is high, so I'll probably buy a larger comb from the same company, but skip on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comb","review":"I've kept combs in my pocket for ages and they always get gunked up with fuzz and whatever happens to be in my pocket at the time. Now I can keep it in my pocket without worrying about fuzz and what not getting stuck in the bristles of the brush. It won't pop open in your pocket either, it takes a reasonable amount of force to get it to open. It also has a clip on the side, which is handy because who wants a comb to be in the same pocket as dirty change/money? Clip it on your belt or pocket and you're good to go. Kind of hard to remove from a belt or pocket though, which is both good and bad. Sure it wont get knocked off and lost, but it takes some effort to get it to come off and I worry that i may break it. That's about the only real downfall to this comb, from now on I'll stick with these rather than cheap-o dollar store combs. It has a nice, classy look to it as well instead of cheap plastic like most combs.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does it's job phenomenally!","review":"The 20T was a bit stiff at first but after about a week it opened fairly easily. The comb does not cause static; this was my only reason for ordering this product. It goes beyond simply not causing static though. The teeth glide through your facial hairs so smoothly without any tugging or scratching your skin. The clip is a little loose but I imagine when it inevitable falls off I will put a tiny nut and bolt through with some loctite so it can stay clipped in my front pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Comb","review":"This comb is perfect. It doesn't break when its in my pocket, it folds, and it impresses the ladies. Seriously, I whip this thing out and all the ladies start to swoon. Also, I like that it combs really smooth. Way better feel than those cheap Ace combs (which are also not bad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure as Art","review":"Bill McCauley has taken the time to craft an adventure with details that goose the senses. His approach to humidity, lust, conscience and morale had me pausing every few pages to wonder what I would do in such situations. By taking the moral high ground as an expatriate willing to donate everything to a greater cause, his narrator leaves the door open to personal gratification with no consequence. Or so he thinks. This is a great tale and a great insight to one of the most controversial African nations of our time. McCauley knows Sierra Leone, and, moreover, his love for the place and the time he spent there is apparent. The Turning Over is a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great reminder","review":"This book came at just the right time for me. Steve Brown points out how easy it is for Christians to felt trapped by guilt (since we understand that holiness of God), but not free to live in his love (because we haven't really accepted the grace of God).I look forward to reviewing this book again and again to remind myself that God loves and accepts me, and sets me free, free, free.I would recommend this book to anyone who struggles with guilt, shame, doubt, anxiety, or self-criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous alright","review":"The beginning of the book goes in the right direction - towards freedom (Christians really aren't free), and I was smiling as I read it. Then my smile turned to concern, and a definite frown by the time I got to the end. He sets you free, then very deftly wraps the chains back around you - tighter than before - it becomes the same old fundamentalist rhetoric. Once a fundamentalist, always a fundamentalist. A very disappointing read. Book went in the trash - didn't have it in me to give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scandalous Freedom, Steve Brown","review":"wonderful read!!!

Unfortunately this watch turned out to be far less than what I expected. The watch did not work when it was delivered.

In this book, an interest in outsiders and a willingness to share often meager resources characterize the people.There are plenty of stunning photographs and descriptions of the trials endured by the travelers.

This is just the one that has the official seal of approval. Although quirky, all over the map, and extremely anecdotal, this guide manages to accomplish the very same thing that the show does. It's like a literary report done on the Jerry Springer show. It leaves you gawking in disbelief while you're subconsciously thanking God that your own dating experiences are nowhere near as crazy as these folks! A very guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like the bible","review":"This book reads like the old testament - name after name after name of people I don't care about with few interesting notes or pictures between.

You'll find everything thats useful to you in this book online. Then take what you learned and ask your trainer about it and he'll help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, sweet, understated","review":"Colin Davis deserves his current reputation as a great conductor, but of all those with that title, he must be the most understated and reserved. Starting with his departure to bavaria in middle age, and a subsequent tenure in Dresden, it seemed as if Davis wanted to morph into a true Kapellmeister. Why this should be so is a mystery, but these Mendelssohn readings could easily be the work of Wolfgang Sawallisch or Kurt Masur, both born Kapellmeisters.The overall tone is genteel and sweet, highly repsectful, and a touch dowdy. But the orchestra plays gorgeously and the engineering is first-rate. I took pleausre in those virtues (the mercurial Scherzo of the Scottish Sym. is a special delight) without getting carried away by anything Davis wanted to say. The Reformation Sym. is cautious to a fault. This CD will especially appeal to listeners who think of Mendelssohn as a classicist with more Haydn in his blood than Weber or Beethoven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 'get started' guide...","review":"Eden and Rory have provided us beginners with an excellent introduction into learning to use our Macs to keep those home movies and vacation videos from rotting on the shelf. The dialogue is clear with just enough technical information to give the 'newbie' a comprehensive picture of how to edit video on the computer with confidence. Most notable are their tutorials, which unlike most books of this nature, go beyond covering the use of the computer and provide excellent pointers on movie-making in general. After reading the book, not only have I been able to make entertaining videos through the editing techniques they describe, but my original footage has improved as well through their guidance on how to use my DV camera to get the best results.

Granted a lot of the advice is old fashioned and by today's standards harsh, but if you look at the \\"cause and effect\\" reasoning behind the methods they are mostly sound. Throughout the book the author does acknowledge how times have changed, and does not expect people to accept everything. Mostly he is telling horse stories from his life. The advice for handling horses that buck and rear was invaluable. Simple methods for correcting and fixing behavior is much more valuable than the cliche \\"a horse never misbehaves on purpose\\" which most authors hang on.

Been using it for months with great dissapointment. You have to go over any area repetedly to get just mediocre results ~ it just doesn't shave well for whatever reason. I finally took out one of my old 2 AA battery shavers, put batteries in it and shaved for about 5 mins before the batteries went dead ~ but what a great job it did!! I then tore appart this useless model, took the motor out and electrical connections and put it in my $5 AA model and 1/2 hour later ~ wallah ~ I now have the best custom electric, batteryless shaver out there, and my couch looks like brand ne again.

The packaging is cheap, with no real musical relevant notes (ie. list of musicians or instruments) and worst of all the music itself seems to be recorded directly off the movie. The other soundtrack sounds such as the \\"Flying Beast\\" sounds to characters walking is incredibly distracting. I expected more of a \\"soundtrack\\" of just the music. There are only a few tracks that are just music, but not enough to make it truly worth it. Even though the music is definitely important and interesting, in terms of it's composition and deployment it is very hard to tell because of the other sounds.

All of my other printers (HP, Samsung, Lexmark) will print B&W; even if the color ink runs out.And because there's 5 color inks, I frequently have 1 of them run out, and the printer will not use just the black ink cartridge to print B&W.;Because of this, I have vowed never to buy an EPSON product again, and will write similar review on Epinions and other websites. EPSON - you should be ashamed of yourselves for this terrible product. I have never felt this cheated in any electronic purchase I have ever made, and I almost never complain.Read the other 1 star reviews - This printer is GARBAGEP.S.

I wanted a printer that printed on DVD's. It worked alright for one month and then jammed and never worked again. Other people have complained about this same problem so it's some type of defect in the design. I've had to go back to my old 890.

The prints were fine but I found out the hard way that the printer disables itself when it determines one of the cartidges is low. So even if I wanted to just print B@W it won't do it. Unfortunately I found out about the class action lawsuit after the deadline and so can't even get the chintzy $40 \\"coupon\\".

The nozzles were getting clogged almost every time I used it and I had to go through numerous cleaning cycles. On the third set of cartridges I kept getting an error message saying there was a paper jam when there was not. I did some research on the internet and found this was a common problem. I kept rcycling the printer on and off about a dozen times, doing a page eject each time and the paper jam error disappeared only to be replaced by the infamous 2 flashing lights problem.

Yes, it can print, but the printer is high maintenance. You tell it to print and it's fashionably late. It will take 5 minutes just for the dang thing to warm up. Then, if one ink cartridge is low/out, it won't print at all, even if you are not using the color! Of course, when I take the cartridge that is \\"out of ink\\" I can still hear ink slushing around in there. The ink cartridges are on the more expensive end. $70 for a pack with all the colors.

The author hammers on certain points repeatedly (Reagan was great for poor blacks, gets 'proven' three times in the first half of the book alone). Reader is assumed not to know much history (we're reminded a couple of times about when World War II was). Piece as a whole is unclever, though it gets fun in places. It seems clear the author is connected to the DLC, and therefore has an interest in throwing the Liberalism of the 60s and 70s under the bus. While that is a valid topic for a book, it is important to note that this is not an attempt at academic history. It is an attempt to glorify some and blame others, by telling a story a certain way.With that said, this book is better than nothing; you will learn some key names, places, events, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The editor was sleeping","review":"The content of this book was very informative. It brought up points that, at the time, I hadn't even noticed. However, it appears that the editor was sleeping on the job.

I cannot believe that the publisher allowed this book to hit the market in its current state.

It is one of the very few books out there which does a detailed analysis of communicative practices in four different cultures - Russia, Finland, U.S.A., and Blackfeet American Indian. The author draws on numerous examples of naturally occurring speech gathered from his many fine ethnographic studies. Carbaugh demonstrates how the premises which guide communication can be discovered, described, and interpreted in such a way as to reveal how people create a sense of shared cultural identity. No other author has so clearly articulated the intersection of communication and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is STICK!! do not buy","review":"I am so dissapointed with this piece.

However, it got peeled off in spots on the very first use, and that is with using only a wooden spatula to cook and a soft sponge to clean. Also the center of the wok is flat and very small, and the side slope up at a high angle from the center, so really food only gets cooked in the 5\\"-diameter center area. It is not really a hemisphere like traditional woks are, which acts to spread out the heat in a gradient from the center and allows for easier stirring as you fry.

Thus, while it is true that Ms. Scott spent some years as a member of the Mormon Church, she probably isn't the most objective of sources. (It's curious that she gives the obligatory first-person account of the Mormon temple endowment ceremony, even though one must assume she never actually witnessed it herself, inasmuch as single women who didn't have missionary calls rarely received their endowments in her day.)The irony of it all is that the boyfriend later became a general authority in the church, which points up the fine line that can exist between being the wife of a honcho in the Mormon Church and a bitter author of anti-Mormon literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Honest For Most","review":"This is the sort of story which stops Mormon missionaries in their tracks.

While I am far from being a diehard backstreet boys fan, I was an avid listener to their two previous cds. Their sophomore album, in my opinion, showed a lot of growth from their first effort. The lyrics were deeper, the vocals were smoother, and the topics were more \\"mature.\\" Because of this growth, I was really looking forward to their third album. Unfortunatly, I must say I found it rather disapointing. The album, to me, seemed to go backwards. The vocals are definately crisper and smoother, but the songs and lyrics lacked appeal in my opinion. As important as vocals are, good lyrics can cause an album to have huge success, and bad ones can definately hurt the album.

I Promise You is also one of my favorite love songs it is greatly aranged and has so much meaning. I think that with the backstreet Boys themselves writing and co-writing 6 of their new songs this album has a lot more meaning and is a lot more creative then the last 4. I am looking foward to their tour in the new year because if this cd is better than the last then this tour will definatly be the best show anyone has ever seen.The Backstreet Boys have been around for 7 or 8 years and they are definatly not going anywhere any time soon, espically if their fans continue to grow with them and every album tops the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cd","review":"BSB's new cd Black and Blue is awesome!

If you are a BSB fan, (but not a die-hard) and you are considering buying this CD think twice.

I not only wish I could get my money back for the CD, but also the time I spent finding a store that wasn't sold out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"Compared to Millenium, this album is downright horrible. Bland tunes and lyrics make a less than enjoyable sound. Catchy songs from their older albums are instantly replaced by songs that are at two opposite ends, either too rough-sounding (the march-like rhythm of \\"The Call\\") or so draggingly slow and overly dramatic that it makes you sick(\\"I Promise You\\", \\"It's True\\"). No standout tracks on this album, except for maybe \\"shape of my heart\\". \\"Yes, I Will\\" had a potentially good sound and was enjoyable until the lyrics \\"...and someday start a family with you\\" BLECH. I can't help from shaking my head in despair or wincing. you can't get more superficial than that. Sounds like they all got drunk for this. Even their debut album, however lacking in maturity, was far better than this. At least it had some slick tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed when I bought this cd. To me it sounded just like Millinium.

THE ADAGE OF'STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW'COULDN'T BE MORE APT WHEN APPLIED TO 'THE BOYS' TALENTS AS SONGWRITERS. A TOKEN ONE OR TWO TO TREAD THE WATERS IS O.K BUT THE ALBUM HAS WAY TOO MAY TRACKS PENNED BY THE BAND WHICH JUST DONT PASS THE GRADE FOR SUCH A HIGH PROFILE BAND.I ASSUME THAT THE WRITERS WHO USUALLY PEN THEIR MATERIAL HAVE SPREAD THEMSELVES TOO THIN BY WRITING FOR OTHER ARTISTS AS WELL AND THE BAND HAS BEEN LEFT SHORT OF MATERIAL FOR THE ALBUM AND NOW THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

That just goes to show they care more about the hype and popularity more than the musical quality. Sure they began writing their own songs on this CD but it still sounds all the same as their other songs though Shape of My Heart is a catchy ballad and The Call shows a little bit of artistic growth though something about it sounds like I heard it in the 80's. Black and blue? Interesting album name but by then they were black and blue from being overhyped and the girls growing up and getting sick of them, I knew THAT would roll around"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"How was this CD ever #1 on the charts? Its boring,the music just isn't good, its not gripping and it doesn't make you think. Its not true music its not music that comes from the soul, the 5 \\"boys\\" didn't even write it themselves. 30 years from now we won't remember the Backstreet Boys music, we won't remember \\"Shape Of My Heart\\", 30 years from now we'll remember real muscians like Kurt Cobain... don't let these no talent fools be in your cd player. Go buy a Led Zeppelin CD and let them show you what music truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"if they had 0 stars on there that would be it","review":"this cd was not worth the 10 dollars i spent on it. It's not even worth 2 dollars of that. You can't even tell what the guys are saying in half the songs. The only two good songs are \\"Shape Of My Heart\\" and \\"It's True\\". Worst cd i have heard in 20 years tops. And I'm not justing saying this cause I'm anti BSB, I like their last 2 albums. But I don't know what they were trying to pull off with this one, but it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"im sorry- they are horrible","review":"ok please- be smart and spend your money elsewhere! its not worth the time... just listening to this literally made me sick! how can kids relate to this? they have never been in love! neither have these boys from what i can gatheri can save you some time here: every single song is about being in love, and the BSB are always the right guys for you! please, dont be fooled"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK AND BLUE ALL OVER","review":"The only standout song on this CD is \\"The Call\\" where the Backstreet Boys finally had some guts to do a edgier song.The rest of the album like \\"Shape of My Heart\\" is the same re-trashed factory ballad 5 boy band cookie cutter songs.I am sure all the teenage girls will just beat me up on this one, but come on girls!, how many times can you hear the same version of the same ballad with a different title?!I think this group will have a couple of more albums in them popularity wise with the girls, but when watching MTV and girls are already saying they are OLD, is not a good sign.Backstreet Boys welcome to Debbie Gibson-Tiffany-Rick Astley Land where you will one day be a has been.Of course you are running all the way to the bank....lucky you. It is always the people with no talent that get all the glory.The Beatles YOU ARE NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"it truly does not get much worse than this","review":"ok, i'll say this. as a fan of underground punk rock, i'll say the backstreet boys are talented. i know that some of them can play instruments, and that they can sing pretty well. but this band and their music is a poor attempt a good manufactured band. my sister is really into this stuff, so i gave it a chance and all it is is 5 or 6 guys singing with some studio beat in the background. if they where ugly, they would have never made it this far. try listening to punk like nofx, sum 41, pennywise, blink 182, or rancid. if that's too \\"rough\\" for you, try fuel or oleander.....just not this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I am a big BSB fan and always liked them because there fans were more important to them than music reviews unlike N'sync they were more down to earth but this album sounds like something N'Sync would do ot The Backstreet Boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"black and blue","review":"Although I am usually more into grunge music and jazz-I have to say that I like the new Backstreet Boys record. I even liked it so much so I bought Millennium a couple of days later. They put alot of feeling into their performance, which you can totally tell when listening. The music makes me feel happy and is approximately of the kind and quality that I expected it to be. It is nice to see that they co-produce and write the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, But alright . . .","review":"My first reaction to this new album was disappointment. Nothing like their 'Millennium' album, which was a great success. A LOT of the songs on this album sound alike. When you listen to half the songs, the instrumentals overpower their vocals and you can't tell what they are singing. A couple of the songs on their new album sound a lot like N'Syncs' music. Not my favorite album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Buy It!","review":"This is a good album! I think if you want your collection complete buy \\"Hangin' Tough\\" by New Kids On the Block, believe me you will love that album. Also buy the original Backstreet Boys album it's their best album. Also buy Paula Abdul's album \\"Forever Your Girl\\" That is a great album. This Backstreet Boys album is really good! Buy It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet serves up another GREAT album!","review":"I went out and bought the CD with the bonus track the day itcame out, while I was vacationing in Hawaii. .... I absolutely love this CD, because the songs have actual lyrical content! They write about themselves, their wives, their lives, and meaningful subjects for everyone. The boys wrote songs this time, and it shows that they are heartfelt. The world tour will be amazing, and I love this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait.","review":"After Millenium we were all very exited about the release of black and blue, and after a long wait we were not disappointed. Its kind of different to Millenium and i like it. Dont be mistaken by thinking its just for teenage girls because my dad listens to it more than me! All the songs are sung realy well, the only one that i dont like is 'shining star' but others like 'the call' and 'shape of my heart' are exellant. 'get another boyfriend' is also another of my favorites, although it does sound like a song the more recent Britney Spears would sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Chance","review":"I wasn't too thrilled about another BB boy release, but bought it anyway. The first time I listened to it I thought it was junk and put it away. Then for some reason I gave it another chance and it was okay! Not as good as \\"Millennium\\" but okay. Now I like it and listen to it all the time. The sound is different, more synth and heavier, not like the harmonious pop sound of previous releases. Some of the slow songs are kind of a drag, but the fast songs have a cool beat. Some of the songs seem like tributes to where they've been and they got there(\\"Everybody,\\" \\"Time\\") but even if you just like \\"Shape of My Heart\\" you should purchase this album. Once one is accustomed to the difference in sound, it sounds good. Sick of boy bands? Give it a second chance-it may be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB ARE THE BEST","review":"Great to see BSB back with another album. Already onto my second listening. Think it is great and well worth buying. Keep up the good work guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 Trash Of the Year","review":"This CD is absolute garbage--Disgrace to Music. This product does not deserve to be listed in the Music section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This album was very good. Millennium was, in my opinion, a little better, but still--it was enjoyable. There are a lot of slow songs but quite a few good upbeat ones to dance to. Their new image is quite different from the other \\"boy bands\\". OK, sure they ARE still to some extent the same image--ok well a lot like that image. But they seem more mature and grown up and now their songs have a more clear point and the lyrics are really thoughtful and powerful. It was a very good album--I got it for Christmas not even really wanting it, but I'm glad I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS REAL MUSIC ???","review":"SIMPLY PUT,I FIND THE CANDY COATED NONSENSE THESE BOYBANDS TURN OUT RIDICULOUS. AMONG THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY AND OTHERS WHO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC, THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MONEY MAKING BUSINESS AIMED AT THE VERY YOUNG WHO LITERALLY FALL HEAD OVER HEELS AND EAT THIS UP. MEMBERS OF THESE BANDS SHOW ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE TALENTS THAT REAL SINGER/SONGWRITERS POSSESS AND THEREFORE DONT, RIGHTFULLY SO, RECIEVE THE RESPECT OF THIER CONTEMPORARIES COME GRAMMY TIME. ONE COULD SAY THIS MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT FUN AND GOOD TIMES BUT SHOULD THAT NOT DESERVE QUALITY AS WELL? ITS A SHAME WE HAVE LOWERED OUR STANDARDS TO SUCH AN EXTENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"This music is for saps","review":"People... if you want any REAL music go buy a METALLICA album or a NIRVANA album. This stuff is just boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new and nothing gained!","review":"Poor Backstreet! Where have they gone? Though \\"Black & Blue\\" still sold well on the market, it was definitely a failure. They don't seem to progress or grow up through the years, and even make retreat. This is pathetic.Yeah, the album's very BSB style, and easy to get accustomed to when playing. But it should be sufficient if you already have \\"Millennium.\\" Or betterstill, get their \\"Greatest Hits\\" instead of this one.The only reason I bought this album was due to Brian's vocal. Nevertheless, he seemed to have shared his singing parts with AJ, so the temptations had gone. It pleased me that Nick didn't sing too much on the CD, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD ON EARTH!","review":"I think all the people who are giving this CD bad reviews don't know what good music is! I mean no offence guys, but this CD rocks! I would like to say that if you don't have this CD it might be a good idea to go out and get it! It is great music....from R&B to pop! It's a really great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK, BLUE, HORRIBLE","review":"Before I heard this CD I thought the bsb were the only boy band with the slightest amount of talent. They sure proved me wrong. All the songs sound so manufactured it gives you a headache. Maybe its because the backstreet boys actually wrote some of these songs, only proving that they do not deserve the stardome they now have. People will finaly realize the that the writers of their previous songs have more talent then they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review.....","review":"This album is wonderful. MYself being a fan of POP music, am not afraid to tell everyone that I indeed love the BSB. They have reached a level with this album that both adults and younger people can easily enjoy. You are swept off your feet and onto the dance floor with \\"The Call\\" and can't help but hum along to tracks such as \\"Shape Of My Heart\\" and \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\". More mature ballads like \\"Its True\\" And \\"I Promise you\\" show the Boys at their best with their harmonies and vocal stengths. All in all, this album is definately proving everyone that the BSB are indeed TALENTED and are going to stay around longer than their expected life-span. I am sure you are familiar with the \\"2-year life cycle of a boy band\\". Well, ATTENTION ALL BOYBANDS! YOU ARE NOT THE BACKSTREET BOYS! YOU CAN NOT SING LIKE THEM! YOURE HARMONIES WILL NEVER BE AS SOLID AND AS BEAUTIFUL! YOU WILL NEVER CAPTURE THE HEARTS OF BOTH OLD AND YOUNG! And so this ends my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it..AGAIN!!!!","review":"Excellent. Astounding. Wonderful. That's only a few of the million words that I can use to describe the third American release from the sexy Orlando men..it is evident that they have made a comeback with many soon to be hit songs such as 'Shape Of My Heart', which has already made its mark on the charts, catchy tracks such as 'The Call', 'Get Another Boyfriend', and 'Not For Me'. They also make an outstanding vocal display of perfect harmonization on the ballads, especially one in particular, 'I Promise You (With Everything I Am)'. The guys have proven to us that they are very capable of sprinkling the world with their own written material. This album has a 'in your face' type of feeling. Black and Blue keeps you on your toes the whole time, dancing to the uptempos and singing along to the soft beautiful ballads..I believe everyone should own this album, this is the best one yet. Backstreet's back and they are number one!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Blue? Not so good, after all...","review":"I was quite anxious to hear what the Backstreet Boys could come up with on this album. I was expecting a great follow up album from \\"Millennium\\". What I got, however, was digitally altered noise and velveeta cheese in the form of music. Now, I love boy bands and pop music like I love air, but there is a fine line between sweet lyrics and pure corn. The Backstreet Boys crossed that line by the second track, possibly even the first. Too busy trying to boot rivals *NSYNC from the top and reclaim the title of fastest selling album, the guys seem more focused on sales figures than quality music. If it's humor you're looking for, listen to \\"The Call\\". This song will NOT bring them respect in the musical community. (I gave this album one star just for the laugh that track gave me) Predictable rhymes run rampant on this album, which make the songs yawn worthy. While trying to \\"take it to the next level\\" the boys have lost their roots, and at least one fan: me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your money","review":"Black and Blue compared to Millenium is more soulful. It may not have many upbeat, danceable tracks but I think it has really soothing music for the ears. Whenever I'm down I play this cd and enjoy myself. My favourite songs are 'yes I will' and 'i promise you (with everthing that i am)' Listening to these songs really turn me on. Everyone aged from 10 to 20 will love it, boys and girls alike. Spend a stress-free weekend with BSB and Black and Blue now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Blue is the Backstreet Boys' best album.","review":"Black and Blue is definitely the best Backstreet Boys album. You see a more mature side of them with \\"Shape of My Heart\\" and a different variety of songs with great ballads such as \\"Yes I Will\\" and great dance songs like \\"Everyone\\" plus a different type of song \\"The Call\\" which, i think, is the best song on the album. If you love the Backstreet Boys or just love pop music, definitely get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the same","review":"I loved both of their other CDs but Black & Blue's songs all sound the same. They are either slow or fast but that's the only difference. I do like a few of the songs though but I regret buying the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?","review":"This will be remembered as the CD where the Backstreet Boys sold out to the masses. Gone is the exciting thrash and speed metal of their previous albums. They have turned into a pop group. I loved them back in the day when they were opening up for bands like Slayer and Coal Chamber. I loved them when lead singer Nick Carter had that vicious growly voice everyone tried to copy. I loved them because of Howie's brutal rhythm guitar and Brian's frenetic soloing and the great double bass drums of Kevin. They don't even play guitar on this album. This is by far the most astonishing career turnaround I have ever seen. I am disappointed, shocked, and pissed as hell. At least I still have their old stuff to bang my head to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks!","review":"Great sound effects and awesome new songs. Sorry jealous NSYNC fans, but it was really BSB that made this CD. And they actually write some of their songs in this CD.

Maybe if Kevin and Howie cut their hair, I would like it better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bust","review":"I am a 15 year-old devout BSB fan, but I am sorry to say that I found this album to be terrible!! I woke up early this morning and missed my first period class just to buy and boy, I was like, so disappointed. All the songs sound exactly the same as Millenium! I am so ticked off that I paid $15.00 for a cd that I already have!!

WAIT, don't rush off on me now, because when I say that , everybody thinks I'm crazy. For example, the first song on this cd talks about these guys cheating on their girlfriends. Why would you love these guys when they see this beautiful girl and drop their old one on the turn of a dime??? Another thing, the second song, it's about a guy who has \\"kept you in the dark\\". Now he wants to \\"show you the shape of his heart\\". I think you already know his shape, broken because he thinks the relationship is all about him. One last thing, I wonder why they didn't put the lyrics inside the pamplet on the cd... These are just my opinions. Don't get me wrong, these people have beautiful voices and they have great talent. They just don't show it through the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Is This?","review":"This is nothing like the usual dance music I've come to expect from the Backstreet Boys & N'Sync. This album is a 180 degree turn for them. There are only 4 upbeat songs, all the rest are love ballets. It's just not what I lookforward to hearing form them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Heard such an awful cd","review":"This cd is the worst i have ever heard. Every song sounds the same, and the only song that acutally sounds decent is \\"Shape of mY heart\\". THey tried a little to hard to beat *NSYNC's record. But ya know what, ya can't. Hopefully they have a better chance next time or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck-blech-pooey","review":"oh please could this album be any worse, all you music fans out there do yourself a favor and go buy (if you dont already have it) No Strings Attached by *NSYNC, because it is A WHOLE LOT BETTER and much more fun to listen to.

The music was just some computer recreation of Britney's songs. I thought the days of synthesizing music was over, apparently not! I can't believe people buy this garbage, they don't play instruments, I don't even know if there is a band. The lyrics are laughable (not that they even write them) and their voices are poor at best. To call these guy musicians or even artists should offend anyone with a brain. I'm sorry, but they're awful, and the fact that they used a title the Stones used makes it that much worse...Don't buy this CD, please for your mind's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this and then read SIGHTS.","review":"This was the best. I kept thinking all the way through that this would be like the music played by Baby Girl's band in the awesome book SIGHTS by Susanna Vance.

You Go SIGHTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissappointment for some BSB fans","review":"I think that this album really bombed. Although the guys sounded good (they didn't sound like they were singing from inside a box, like with their first album) I didn't like the lyrical content, which I found really really cheezy. the only songs that I really like are Shape of my heart, and More Than That. Millenium was their best album, and I don't think that they can top it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I loved the Backstreet Boys' first two albums and was excited to listen to \\"Black and Blue.\\" I expected for it to be their best album yet...I was wrong. This is one of the worst CDs I've listened to, not just from the Backstreet Boys, but ever. I tried my hardest to make myself like it, but try as I did, there are only about 3 good songs on the whole thing. \\"Shape of My Heart,\\" \\"The Call,\\" and \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\" are great, but the other 10 songs just fall short. And \\"Everyone\\" is just sickening. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the Backstreet Boys' music in the past, but this terrible album has made me lose so much respect for them. Please save your time and money and DO NOT but this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Consitent Group","review":"Backstreet Boys have done it again.

I don't know how they come to even compete with the pop legend, BSB. So what, NSA and Celebrity are their two biggest-selling albums, they didn't do anything, it's their producers who should get the credit. Yeah right, JC produced the songs, well anyone can do that. They can't even sing. BSB sing good and they write good. NSYNC's music is for childish teenyboppers and obsessed NSYNC fans and no one else.Oh well, enough about competition, on with the songs:The first five songs, More than that and The Answer to our life deserve 5/5. The rest deserve 4 to 4.5/5. That's all what I had to say. BSB forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They've completely lost it!","review":"The boys were on a roll, but it appears time is starting to catch up with these so called \\"artists\\".

I was disappointed with the Boys' latest venture. I give them credit for breaking whatever record they broke by releasing this album, ooh ! BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT !! when you have little teenie-boppers begging their parents to fork up the allowance in advance. I give it two stars for the two hits 'Shape of my Heart' and 'It's True'. The hype was overrated and their work didn't live up to it. It seemed rushed because all the other boy bands were releasing their albums, so they had to get it to the people. Don't think that I'm a 'boy band hater.' I love their other work and all the other work from the other boy bands. But for my hard earned money, go get the new 98 degrees album, Revelation; it will be more worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really really bad...","review":"I don't understand why pop music has to be so annoying these days.Backstreet Boys don't have the melodious feeling of Ronan Keating's singles . They don't have the cheer-vibe of canadian duo Sky either.And if \\"Shape Of My Heart\\" is somehow cute , \\"The Call\\" is almost irritating. And there are eleven other mediocre songs to follow.The thing is there are much better pop records out there to purchase.Sade's new release is one.As for Black And Blue , even though it is slightly better than Millenium , it's simply not satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!","review":"...I'm a big backstreet fan, but this CD was disappointing. All the fast songs sound the same and have so many superfluous digital sounds that it makes your head hurt. Most of them even sound like carbon copies of Britney Spears' songs. Some of the topics are so cheesy (ie The Call) that 2+gether could've recorded them. The ballads are surprisingly bland. I was hoping to hear a lot of great vocals on this CD.... By reading the reviews already posted here, it seems like it's all about breaking N'Sync's record, not the music. And the music is definitely what BSB should've focused on- not rushing out another album to gain back some light. But to end on a positive note, I like the songs \\"Time\\" and \\"Shining Star\\"(which is what the one star is for). I know I'm supposed to be a supportive fan, but in writing this review, I have to be honest- this CD's not at all great."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Christmas Present","review":"This BSB album is bought from my maid as a Christmas gift.

The BSB have not grown into men yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, little more adult and slower than before","review":"The Backstreet Boys are growing up and it shows. The songs on this disc are all strong, but they seem to have mellowed some, and I am not saying that is a bad thing. This album is more hevily loaded with ballads and in that I think they are playing to their strengths.All in all it appears that they are moving beyond their rivals in *NSync and getting out of the light pop somewhat and that is good. As always their vocals are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Is Here What's In your Ear","review":"Black and Blue by the Backstreet Boys is a great c.d. I love how they don't just use slow songs. They also use some R&B and not just pop. Some songs to me have meaning like \\"I Promise You\\". It is saying that you will always love and care for the person and you are promising this to the one you love. Another song that has meaning is \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\" it is saying that the one you love like sister or cousin. That their boyfriend isn't loyal to them and he will just ruin their life. Although I can't relate to all the songs I would still recommend this c.d. to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Boys Groove","review":"I admit I had to listen to the CD a few times to get a feel for the new songs. I am now addicted to it!! I love all of the fast songs...so many potential hits! Their voices sound better than ever. I am a full fan of this new CD. Definitely buy it and get into the groove!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD!","review":"Even though I like Millenium better, this is still a great CD to buy. THe song that I liked the best would definately have to be \\"How did I fall in love wiht you\\" because I can relate exactly to it. It's a soft song about how he used to be friends with this girl when they were younger and now he's in love with her and can't go on any longer without her. It is the sweetest song I've ever heard! Another song I love is \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\" Overall, it's a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet's Back!!! And better than ever...","review":"This is the best CD ever! All of the songs are incredibly great and well put together. There are slow songs and fast songs. You can dance to them, you can sing to them. Songs like \\"More than that\\" and \\"I pormise you\\" are so deep. I almost started crying the first time I heard these two. And then there's \\"Get another boyfriend\\" and \\" Shining Star\\" It's that kind of song that get people jumping at concerts and parties. I highly recommend buying this cd. You will not regret it. If you're skeptical about this, go to [the internet] to listen to clips. I promise you that you will be satisfied. plus, Five out of the thirteen songs on the cd were either written or co-written by the Backstreet Boys themselves. It is a completely wonderful cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was impressed","review":"Not that I thought the album would suck...but I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I have been. My favorite song so far is \\"The Call\\" with \\"The Answer to Our Life\\" a close second...and then there is \\"Everyone\\"...and how about \\"Time\\"...that's it...I have to admit it....I really love this album. Not because they are cute...but because they have talent. I was really impressed that they took a more active role in the album by writing many of the songs. Also, there seem to be more of a variety of lead vocals. Now, I do have a favorite...but only because he is closer to my age...and that is Kevin...but I love all the boys...because I think that as a vocal group...they have the skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than No String Attached(NSYNC)","review":"Needless to say, this BSB \\"BLACK AND BLUE\\" CD is pretty good. It shows the boys' voices from the ballads to the fast-beat songs.This cd has proven a lot for them...they wrote or co-wrote half of the cd. This yet proves that this CD is the best out of all the boy bands (compared to Nsync No string Attached)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album that Beats the rest","review":"When I first heard the BSB were making a new album I thought \\"WHOA!! so soon \\" beause they normally take two years between albums , and trying to top off \\"Millenium\\" plus top off N Stynks record it comes off as a handful but when \\"Black & Blue\\" was released I immediately went out and bought it played and \\"wow!!\\" was i amazed ! I thought \\"the Call\\" was a song to start the album with it has great beats and melodies plus an added bons A.J.'s & Nick's Voice ! really bring the song to life. I love this album because it's an interweaving of different songs ranging from up tempo to ballads and pick you back up wih a Mid- tempo. If you have small children that'll dance to anything and you need something to keep them busy this is the album. Plus, I had the oppurtunity to see them live and WOW!! these songs really make for a good time . Buy this album the money you spend is worth it !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!!!!","review":"Well, I listened to this album and I totally fell in love with it. It has all kinds of tempos and you can dance to it all night long. I have been a fan of theirs even before they were big. I have always followed them through the good and the bad times and I'll always follow them until they are through with making music. They'll still be in my heart even after they are gone. They were the first real boyband. They weren't put together like other people think. Three of them kept running into each other at talent shows so they decided to become a group. But they didn't feel whole so they got Kevin and Brian to join them. So, other boybands out there, be careful what you say. You could affend any of these guys fans. Nick(my fav), Brian, A.J., Kevin, and Howie, I wish you all the best with your career. I love your new album \\"Chapter 1: The Hits\\".

The more and more I heard it, the more I got sick of it. Now when I hear it on the radio, I immediately turn it off. Then, when \\"The Call\\" came out, it happened the same way. What I'm trying to say is that the songs on this CD may sound good at first, but you'll soon get sick of them. Sick enough to barf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed with this newest CD.

The BSB keep talking about how much they've changed.. nope, sorry. Every song sounds the same. It sucks. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bestest C.D Ever Made In This World","review":"I think this c.d is better than *NSYNC or any other boy bands,because those other boy bands doesn't have the chemistry that bsb has,and the chemistry of bsb is what makes this album the bestest! I read one opinion by one reviewer,and that reviewer's name is \\"Name Goes Here\\". I just don't agree with that person,because this album show how bsb grow from young teens to matured adults! That person says that they can't beat *NSYNC's record,well that person is wrong,and I can write many things to prove that person wrong,but what I'm here for is to tell all of you to go get their album,because it is fantastic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I will say that after \\"Millenium\\", i expected a good album from the group. I was sadly dissappointed. The album is trite, immature, and seems to be a de-evolution from the aforementioned CD. I will say that the first single, \\"Shape of my heart\\" deserves the lone star that i gave the cd.It sucks that this cd is going to get about a 4.5 star average because of all the girls that just couldn't wait for another BSB CD. it's too bad.Buy Millenium."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old","review":"I was hoping that the BSB were going to do more songs like \\"I want it that way\\". Nope, all of these songs are just like the other songs and the boys are still boys. I Used to be their big fan, not anymore. They are just like N'Sync who have no artistic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"BSB Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First off, boy bands are not bands, they don't even write there own songs. The songs that are writen for them are just cheesy love songs writen only because the writers know that teeny-boper girls will think the songs are \\"sweet\\" or \\"cute.\\" This is not art. There is no emotion put into this crap. The only reason that this \\"band\\" is so popular is because teen girls think the guys are hot. Maybe it's just me but I don't think that is a good reason for buying a CD. I'm sure some people might actually like the music and if you are one of these people, I pitty you. Also, what is with the name \\"Backstreet Boys,\\" there obviously trying to sound \\"getto\\" even though they arn't at all. Please don't suport these \\"artists\\" and hopfuly pop will die."},{"rating":"1","title":"jUST THE SAME AND JUST AS BAD!","review":"tHIS IS JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEIR MUSIC AND IT IS JUST AS HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody just kill them please","review":"Do not buy this go buy a metallica cd or a KoRn cd or a marilyn manson cd maybe some nirvana but please if you have already bought it take a baeball bat to it or put it in the midell of the road and watch cars run it over."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bites","review":"I loved the millenium CD and I also enjoyed the self titled one too. This CD, however, I can not even pretend to enjoy. It seemed their only motivation for this disc was to sell more than NSYNC because it sounds totally like they were trying to copy the NSYNC sound. I wouldn't buy this CD as it is a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to Backstreet Boys of Millenium","review":"Yikes! I can't say this album impressed me. I think the Boys rushed this album in order to try and top *NSYNC. I like The Call and Get Another Boyfriend, but other than that , the album is boring and repetitive to the point of exhaustion. Save your money and go buy Celebrity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the same old, tired stuff","review":"I listened to this CD all the way through once. And once was enough. Because it sounds almost identical to the last backstreet boys CD I bought. I like their music as a rule--but until these guys can come up with something new, it's not necessary to own all of their CDs. One will suffice. Spend your money on somebody else, for some variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Bye Bye to BSB","review":"I've listen to this album.. and I will never listen to it again! IT's horrid! All the songs sound the same. They tried to make their music a little faster and added a techno beat to it! The on decent song on here is Shape of my Heart and that's it! It sounds as if they just put this album together in a week or something! They were too busy trying to compete with *NSYNC and didn't even hear your own album! You should not waste money on this kind of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet...","review":"The BackStreet Boys are back andbetter than ever. The harmonies, beats, and collaborations are the best yet. They have matured and from the sound of this cd will be here for decades to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot Of Hype For Nothing","review":"Here I was thinking that BSB wouldn't follow in the steps on N Sync and Britney Spears, and here I come out disappointed. There was alot of hype to this c.d, and basically it sounded like a rip off of N Sync's latest c.d.And alot of the songs sounded similar.. I don't know I was just expecting something with more substance, some flavour and maybe some more maturity. Maybe it is because Iam not into this fad of eletronic sounds and alot of dance beats,but then all those beats just hide their voices. All in all this c.d wasn't as good as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've been looking forward to this CD for a long time - at least ever since *NSYNC came out with NSA - and what a waste of time. With all their talk about how this album is going to be diffently I expected something else. It sounds exactly the same! I've been trying to let it grow on me, but I'm just starting to get annoyed. The only half-way decent song was \\"The Shape of My Heart\\" and that you can just record off of the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"BSB needed more effort","review":"Yeah, so I give them credit for \\"Shape of My Heart,\\" it's pretty obvious why they chose the best song on the CD for their first single. And \\"The Call\\" is a good song too. But from here on down the CD goes bad. \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\" sounds just like \\"The Call\\" and every song after that is a slow one. Another thing...\\"Everyone\\" and \\"Everybody\\"...come on guys let's move on here!! Overall the CD isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Life","review":"Go listen to some real music with bands that play their own music. Backstreet Boys suck and if I see them I'll make them black and blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Blue ; A prove for everyone","review":"Black and Blue proved to the world that Bsb is the greatest boyband in the world. This is the 4th album in their 8th year. They wrote some songs and they tried to share their feelings into the songs. The answer of our life and time show their struggle to be a world stars.Get another boyfriend, shining star, everyone, not for me and the call, can make you boogy all night. I promise you, it's true, more than that, yes I will, what makes you different and how did I fall in love with you, sweet ballad songs that can fly you up to heaven. Bravo to Aj for his \\"yes I will\\". This album really beats celebrity with their lyrics and their mature. Bravo BSB. Viva BSB. I'll keep your pride alive forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just luv Backstreet Boys!","review":"I may be the biggest fan of BSB in this world and simply love all their albums. The vocals, lyrics and music from this album is really good. My favourite songs are Shape of my heart, More than that and What makes you different (Makes you beautiful). Words are not enough to express my feelings that how much I truly love these songs. They are hauntingly beautiful, pure and very decent. Even if you don't like all the songs in Black and blue. Those three enchantingly lovely songs will definately make up for it. A must buy for every BSB fan. Good luck with KNBHA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why BSB named this cd \\"Black and Blue\\"?","review":"This I often wonder \\"why?\\" whenever I look at my copy of Black and Blue. Some say BSB named it after Rolling Stones's album \\"Black & Blue\\". Some say the blue colour represents the bluish BSB album \\"Millenium\\" cover (maybe) and the black is for the black clothes in N SYNC's \\"No strings attatched\\" (no way!). Well, here what I think : The Black colour shows just how mature BSB have grown and the Blue colour is for the wide open sky, which shows the BSB are thinkers and that they are \\"broad-minded\\". Listen to \\"Time\\" and \\"The Answer To Our Life\\", the most maure songs on the album.By the way, Black and Blue is excellent and I just love BSB even better. Now, they have changed their genre from bubblegum pop to adult comtemporary. My favourite song is The Call, it's so catchy and cool. You'll love the album, (if you have taste for decent music, that is) trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best EVER!","review":"This Cd is really good in every way. Nick, AJ and Brain's vocalising ablity has improved a lot. The music is truly breath-taking and the lyrical content is nice too. I have been listening to Black and Blue for over a month and I still ain't bored with the songs. Though, I'm not sure that fans younger than 12 will like it as much as millenium but still it's good enough for the older crowd. The songs in it are mostly the ballads(really sweet) and they show so much emotion in them, it's just heart-melting. The upbeat songs like 'the call' and 'get another boyfrind' and 'not for me' are cool too, so are the mid-tempo ones. Buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!","review":"All you teenage girls who want to hear real music about love and relationships with some meaning, I'm gonna save you real quick. This music (BSB, NSync, etc) will seem so shallow once you listen to the following album, go get it from your parents or the store. I'm 21, so this album came out even before I was born. But it was written during a divorce for the artist and is still considered the best pop album on relationships and love ever:Blood On The Tracks by Bob DylanIt is perfection. It makes what the boy bands are doing seem shallow and meaningless. They couldn't write a single line of any of these songs if they were locked away for years. Songs such as Tanngled Up In Blue, You're Gonna Make Me Lonesone When You Go, and You're A Big Girl Now will blow you away with emotions. This is what music is all about. It is musical poetry at its best.You'll thank me down the road for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bsb has done it agian","review":"The Boys have done it agian. they have shown us what excellent artists they are. they wrote more than half the tracks on this album. This cd is a must have for people who like: BSB, Easy listening music, Pop music, and R&B music. Pick this Cd up today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Signs Of Slowing Down...","review":"This album shows signs of slowing down for the Backstreet Boys in the sales and charts department. This album sold 8 million which isn't bad if you don't compare it to their other albums. This album features \\"Shape Of My Heart\\" Their only top 40 hit which hit 12, \\"The Call\\" hit a disappointing 52 and that is it. The album fell out of the top 40 album charts in 15 weeks and was quickly gone. This album shows their weaknesses and now in a changing music scene it will be even harder to stay on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugg...","review":"I liked The Backstreet Boys when they first came out. I even liked them through their Millennium stage but, I think that this CD was WAY below them. While some of their competing groups such as NSYNC have at least changed their style and written their own music these Boys are still teeny-boppers singing music by some unknown fat guy. I think that this CD deserved no stars but, that wasn't an option so I was forced to give it one, like they even derseve one."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh puhlease, let's get rid of all this trash","review":"I used to be a huge fan of the backstreet boys. I was a fan from the beginning, but the past two albumns have changed my mind. I thought that millennium was just there changing process but now I see that black and blue is just a trainwreck. There are only a few good songs on here, and they will most likely be made into singles or already have been. Don't waste your money [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB rocks","review":"I have the c.d. and I can stop listening to it and also I am going to be seeing them live on their black and blue tour the date of the concert is on March 13th and I can not wait to go and see them on tour because they are the best and also I might be meeting them too but I do not know yet but I am hoping that I can go and meet them.My fave songs is Shape Of My Heart and I Promise you with everying I am and also How I feel in love you they are so sweet and I love them a lot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Okay, first of all I'd like to say that this CD SUCKS! It has way too much sound effects, the vocals sound horrible, and the ballads make you want to throw up. Seems to me that they just threw this CD together to try and beat the record of CD's sold in a week which *NSYNC had made with 2.4 million copies. Speaking of *NSYNC, doesn't I Promise You (with all I am) sound kinda familiar?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, another recycled album","review":"I can't fault the Backstreet Boys for recycling the same old material. It works for Britney Spears. Actually, it works for all boy bands/teeny pop. Once in a while, something good actually floats to the surface, but most of the time it is prefabricated crap. It seems like teeny pop music is starting to run out of ideas. They've used every sound on their little keyboards and have run out of words to rhyme \\"heart\\" and \\"break\\" with. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I really looked foward to getting this CD, because I like the BSB music. But when I listened to it in the car, I was so disappointed in it. I can honestly say that I only like 1 song on the whole cd- Shape of my Heart. Most of the songs have the same beat and it gets old. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"... BSB is back!","review":"That's right...and the BSB is still back again with their third world-wide release, otherwise known as BLACK AND BLUE. I love this album - it's one of my favorites - and there is not one bad song on this entire CD, and you can't say that to just about every album!BLACK AND BLUE shows that the Boys have matured and they are no longer \\"boys\\" but \\"men\\". Their unforgettable soulful harmonies and vocals blend in well together with each and every song. They do a lot of songwriting on this album, too (half the songs were either written or cowritten by the BSB themselves!) and they really show their songwriting talent.The stand-out cuts however, are \\"The Call\\", \\"Shape Of My Heart\\", \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\", \\"The Answer To Our Life\\", \\"Everyone\\", \\"More Than That\\", \\"Time\\", and \\"Not For Me\\"....."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Pity!","review":"It's too bad Backstreet's career is over. I'll miss them, especially since I've been such a loyal fan since they came onto the scene in '91. The first two albums were so incredible, I couldn't believe how bad this was. Their voices are still great, but they shouldn't be allowed to write music. \\"I Want It That Way\\" was so perfect. I couldn't have been more dissappointed in \\"Shape of My Heart.\\" \\"The Call\\" has to be the dumbest song I've ever heard, \\"you're dropping out my battery is low, just so you know we're going to a place near by, gotta go.\\" I'm not kidding, that's really part of the chorus! The only listenable song here is \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\" the rest is just- BORING!Get \\"This Time Around\\" \\"No Strings Attached\\" or \\"Sooner or Later\\" if you're looking for a boy band worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Black and Blue\\"","review":"This cd is one that you need to add to your cd collection.

I know what your thinking, shes a bsb fan and she thinks everything is good that the backstreet boys do or sing, well- I Do :), BUT the lyrics are cool and they arent just about partying,having fun, and not worrying about anything . Its alittle more onto the edge that \\"Millenium\\", and the songs are more stronger,too. You will agree with me once you hear atleast one tune. Its not just pop music, its alittle bit of each kind of music!!! This Cd is highely recommended by me!! The songs are catchy,makes you want to danec,and fun to sing along so what are you waiting for?? isnt this what everyone wants?? BUY IT BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Review!","review":"Backstreet has done it again. They've produced another quality album. I don't think this is the best out of all of their work but as always with BSB you can see the effort they put into it. I hope this review is helpful to you!If you like 98 degrees, N*SYNC, Britney Spears, Youngstown, Christina Aguilera: This is your groove! Its got all of the preppy pop tunes like Youngstown, Britney Spears, N*SYNC and 98 degrees but with some powerful and soulful tunes like Christina Aguileras. This is a must have cd for this kinda music lovers! Go and order it today!If you like Greenday, Bon Jon Vi, Creed, Offspring: This probably isn't your groove. It doesn't have that hard rock sound you love. If you have a pretty wide range for love of music then this might be something you'd be interested in!If you like Eminem, Dr.Dre, Snoop Dogg: Deffinetly NOT your groove! If you listen to Eminems lyrics he really puts down this boy band stuff, whatchya doing looking at it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing spectacular","review":"I do not particularly enjoy the musical stylings of the Backstreet Boys, I myself prefer punk rock. However being the open minded person that I am I agreed to listen to my sisters black and blue cd. I have heard their other cd's before, and I think Millenium was the best by far. BSB are now well into their twenties, they will probably never again regain the power that enabled them to once be one of the most powerful pop bands of all time.But I truly believe that Nsync, though not a horrible band will never truly soar as high as BSB."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Wow, Backstreet is DEFINITELY back! I have been a huge BSB fan for two years now, but I really didn't know if anything could be as great as the Millenium CD. But Black and Blue is BETTER! It shows the growth the boys have been through over the past year or so. I think it is wonderful how they are easing into the songwriting process. I absolutely love the song \\"Time\\", which the boys wrote about their freindship. The whole album is great, but my favorites are Time, Shining Star, How Did I Fall In Love with You, Not For Me...and the list goes on. I recommend this CD to pretty much anyone, especially pop msic fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pop but it's good. :)","review":"The Backstreet Boys have outdone themselves with this third studio effort. I'm nineteen and am definately not traditionally a fan of pop music, but I do enjoy this cd. The up-tempo tracks will definately make you want to get up and move while the ballads put you in that sappy lovers' mood. I have to say I respect this group the more they write and work on new music. They're really coming into their own and it's about time. If you enjoy groups like Nsync, O-Town, & so on then this album is definately worth giving a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet's Definately Back","review":"Anyone who doesn't believe that Backstreet's Back is in for quite a surprise after hearing their new album Black and Blue. This album has a variety of different songs from the upbeat song The Call to the low-key How Do I Fall In Love With You. No matter what mood you're in you'll be able to put the cd on and fall in love. All I have to say is for the people who believe that the Backstreet Boys/pop music in general is fading out, you are very very wrong!

The author talks about interviewing a German soldier named General Otto Hermann Fegelein who gave himself up in the Bavarian Alps. However this same officer was discovered in Berlin trying to escape during the last days of April 1945 and was executed by direct orders of Hitler himself. I do not see how this SS general could have been at two places at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, there was confusion at the end of the War!","review":"I read this volume seeking a clearer understanding of conditions on the ground at the end of of WWII, the year I entered first grade.But page after page the message was garbled and confused and at the end I was wholly unsatisfied with the meager offering of F.E. Manuel.Previously I had read Manuel's \\"A Portrait of Isaac Newton\\" and there the author was decidedly candid regarding the subject and I learned a great deal about Newton and his authoritative grip on the Royal Society.One saving grace - its a short book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"neal from Connecticut","review":"I've read hundreds of books about the Second World War and purchased this book assuming I'd learn alot about something my prior readings had missed: what it was like in Germany after the fighting stopped. I was disappointed. The writing was disjointed and confusing. There was no flow to the story. I learned little about that period of time or what it was like to be there. Ultimately, after reading 40 pages and then skimming the next 50 I put the book away. Don't bother buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I wasn't impressed with this book. I had expected something broader in scope; something more profound. Instead, I found a rambling set of reminiscences. Manuel was an intelligence officer in the XXI Corps during the closing months of the war in Europe. He provides no original insight into combat operations or how they were affected by the intelligence his unit gathered. Rather, he provides a run-on panoply of impressions and anecdotes, almost without stopping for breath, primarily gleaned from his and others' interrogations. While some are interesting, most are uninspired. This is a slim volume (some 130 pages) that becomes tedious and does little to educate the reader about this tumultuous time other than to provide some insight at the individual level into the befuddlement and desperation of Germans, soldiers and civilians alike, as their world crumbled. If your interest in this period is great, then this book is worth a few minutes. Otherwise, you ought to pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Money","review":"This tv is not high quality stuff, though it's cheap.

Beker's approach is that basically he knows what Paul means to say, and rather than providing detailed exegesis, he will simple assume away works like the so-called deutero-Pauline letters (Ephesians, 2 Thessalonians) that undermine his thesis that Paul has nothing to say about the timing and the events of the parousia. Especially after so much work has been done by people like N.T. Wright on the question of what exactly the \\"day of the Lord\\" was that Paul was waiting for (and whether it actually came in the 1st century in the form of the Jewish war and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD), Beker's treatment of the parousia delay is totally unconvincing at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"Good for scratchy pots ... a disaster for faders.

Well, the power and magnetism, teasing, and camraderie between Davida and Marc ended up being a fabulous love connection. After realizing he had the wrong person, Marc loved Davida's voice and personality so much that he kept calling back. They developed a phone relationship and, of course, met in person and the sparks continued to fly. Davida is the widowed mom to eight-year-old Destiny who throws in enough \\"Will you be my daddy lines\\" at Marcus to tug at the reader's heart.

Maybe I expected too much: they sounded like a cross between \\"Badmotorfinger\\"-era Soundgarden and \\"Appetite For Destruction\\"-era Guns'N'Roses at first, but that was too much to pull off for any extended period of time (like by the end of the second song?), and it quickly dissolved into a second-rate Buckcherry without the party attitude; nobody's getting \\"Lit Up\\" here...I should have picked the Finger Eleven CD instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone want to buy my copy.","review":"The album comes on strong with Soulcrusher then slips below mediocre pop metal that is not even good enough for most lame alternative radio stations.There is some nice guitar work (a bit Tom Morello at times) in some of the songs but the second rate Chris Cornell impersonation is too much to get past.

His style reminded more of Axel Rose than cornell sometimes, in fact the whole band and style reminded me of G'N'R (listen to the chorus of 'Nothing at all' and tell me it's not Roses'esque), but I liked it, I liked it a lot.If you want a good rock album that isn't too 'pop' or too heavy, or doesn't have 12 songs of some guy simply screaming his head off, then buy this album.If I had to use two words to descibe this album, they would have to be 'pleasantly good'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulcrusher crushed me","review":"An excellent hard driving hidden gem of hard alternative rock.

For those of you who think, however, read Without Conscience by Hare, he is a foremost expert on the subject and doesn't meander through an essay on why he thinks people are psychopaths, but gives portraits of psychopathy and doesn't shy away from the fact that much of antisocial disorder and psychopathy occurs randomly.

Four of the seven performances exceed nine minutes, yet there are no slow or aimless moments.

He loved the look. But, the watch turned out to be defective. The watch would turn on at times and then would not turn off. This was immediately after opening the package for the very first time. I tried to see if it was the battery by taking it to a certified jeweler (spending money) so as to not violate the warranty in case of returning it. It turned out that the battery was full. Thus, the watch is defective. I emailed Tokyo flash and they offered no help whatsoever. THen I returned the watch to Amazon. Amazon honored the return and for that I am grateful. Another note, the jeweler offered his expert opinion as a certified watch repairer and years of experience: the inside construction is not sound or worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"While I love the oddity of this watch, its quality is so poor as to make it unwearable.

One note- our vet sold us a very small 6 oz bottle for $30- definitely recommend buying through amazon/online because the bottles can be found in bigger size (17 oz) and for less than $30.

Further, the spring tip is not threaded into the main body, but is simply held by direct contact. But the fit was loose enough in my stylus that the tip fell out several times during use.

Then I turned to the \\"Sport's Medicine Bible,\\" and guess what? It didn't cover it.My elbow injury is healing nicely thanks to Levy's book. As for this book, a waste of time. You would think a book with the word Bible in it would cover everything, but I found Levy's book covers more injuries and sports than this one. And I wouldn't complain as much if this book had a different title, like \\"Baseball Injury Bible,\\" but it's misleading when it didn't even handle my injury, which is a common injury in weight lifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good even for old ladies!","review":"I bought this book after tearing a calf muscle and pinching a nerve in my back.

I ended up not giving it to my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Guide With Good Messages","review":"I bought this for a gift for a girl about to turn 12. I looked it over before actually giving it and was impressed. It was a good mix of information presented -- not just the biology of what is happening but also emotional and social changes. There were even sections about dealing with bullies and how your friendships may change as you grow. The wording was matter of fact, but casual enough to appeal to a tween. I liked the message that waiting to have sex was the best choice, and the book substantiated this message with the reasons why. I think when the time comes for my own children to start reading up on these topics I'd like to supplement this with something that goes into more detail about the biology -- but this is a great overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"greattttttt!!!!!!!!!!!

Not only will I not listen to it often, I didn't even make it through once! Gone is the piano, gone are the artful and relevent lyrics, gone are the powerful and thoughtful arrangements, gone is the natural sound of a wide range of instruments in the music. In it's place is an overly synthesized, uninteresting and weak attempt at fusion jazz with a rap bend. This cd should probably be in the R&B section if you look for it at the store! If you like the Bruce Hornsby that gave us such great cd's as \\"Hot House\\" and \\"Spirit Trail\\" you will hate this cd.

I am in particular a fan of his keyboard work (absent on this CD) and keep praying for an instrumental/ensemble album. Beyond this, Big Swing Face is a huge dissapointment. I am all for reaching in new directions and self expression but please don't forget the basic traits that made your music great, in particular melody and musicianship. Neither appears anywhere on this CD. There is little creativity, not many melodies that you will hear even the most die hard BH fan humming, and for lack of a better adjective, weird. Perhaps this is how a young jazz student feels about Coltrane on a first listen, but the problem is subsequent listens seem to enforce first impressions. I will remain a fan and always enjoy his guest appearances on other albums from Bonnie to Lorber, but it has been some time since I was this disappointed in a CD purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I've given this CD 4-5 complete runs through, trying to let it grow on me.

It's value as history is only matched by Robinson's self-promotion. I suspect all the name-dropping and claims of inventing wonderful ideas that --almost-- saved Eastern are nothing more than an attempt to pave a way for his own corporate future.This book is clearly worthless, as a history of Eastern, as a study of airline failure, or even as an acceptable account of the events surrounding the end of a great airline. If you are a collector of books about commercial aviation, you might want this one on your shelf (your lowest shelf) just for grins, but if you are thinking reading this book will give you some insight into Eastern Airlines, forget it. You'd be better off reading Bernstein's \\"Grounded\\"--only marginally better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Question if he Even Worked There","review":"This book tries to be an \\"inside account\\" of the failure of Eastern Airlines.

I'm tired of picking up game programming books that claim to teach game programming but they don't even create a working game. I bought this book for Linux game programming exposure and because it promised to having in-dept coverage of AI. Major areas of AI are basically defined and the only source code that is mentioned / supplied on the cd is for a template for creating a counter-strike bot. The author has a very good writing style because I was lured into reading most of the book; however, the book should actually do what it says and at least create a 2D / 3D shooter of some sort rather then just a hand full of demos. This book should have never been published on the basis that it tries to cover way too much which results in chapters that do nothing more then just cover a broad definition of the topic at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Programming or theory discussion?","review":"I've never been so disappointed with a computer book purchase. This book claims to be about programming games for Linux. However, it falls woefully short of this mark. I will admit it does have some code snippets, but these are very few and extremely buggy. To top things off, the author rapidly skims over most topics in a manner that is more akin to a theoretical discussion than instructional guide. I highly recommend saving your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks any real information","review":"If you are an absolute beginner to programming games in Linux this book might be useful in that it introduces you to some of the main libraries used in Linux game programming but the book lacks any real information.

All in all, it's probably on of the safest options for a recreational drug. As long as there are human beings who want an easy way away from their problems, there will be a need for such substances as alcohol, cigarettes, (moving on to the illegal drugs) X, cocaine, LSD, acid, etc. However, marijuana (if consumed, not smoked) is much safer than any of the afore mentioned substances. I've smoked pot; I love it. It's not something I'd do on a regular basis, but it's like taking a shot or having a couple of cigarettes. If regulated, it would be perfectly fine.

I had a VHS copy of the movie but somehow it has deteriorated so I ordered the DVD. It's quality is good but not great. It is, however, good enough for me to enjoy a one of a kind movie.

I had heard of the Arrow before, but I had not realized how ambitious and successful the project had been, how precipitously it had been cancelled, and how all the airplanes, equipment, and plans had been destroyed. It seemed from the movie (I want to read more on this) that many officers in the U.S. military were impressed with the Canadian machine and wanted to buy it or at least investigate it.

This one took me about 2 months to read, so I was reading a few books simultaneously. At first, I liked Messer's style of writing, but as the book dragged on, it would appear that her writing would be better suited to poetry than prose; her sentences are often weighed down with multiple similes, metaphors, and symbols. Also, the feeling of superiority and self-importance that seems to accompany owning a really old house got pretty tiresome. For dozens of pages, Messer explains the meticulous process of dating the house. Experts are called in just to determine whether the house was built in 1646, as vehemently claimed, or later. I would suggest this book only to a person deeply interested in history/houses/New England."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM - enough said","review":"Why buy this CD then find out it is DRM.

How many times and for how long does one need to see someone laughing maniaically or a driverless car running in circles before one gets the point?The use of dwarves seems in this later day, with our more evolved view of sexism, racism, agism, and whatever else, to be somewhat exploitative (sizism?).I can understand the viewpoint of those who find this film wonderful, but I feel that the rave reviews should be balanced by another opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Dwarfs Started Small","review":"Very disturbing film which gains in stature after re-viewing with the director Herzog's commentary. As depressing as the film is, there is a lot of humor in it. Herzog's obvious love for and delight with his cast shines through. Crispin Glover's contribution is minimal and a little puzzling. This is a special film and if you are just now looking to get into Herzog's work this is really not the place to start. On DVD try Fitzcarraldo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was very disappointing and i would not recommend others to waste money purchasing this book. The brief product description initially drew me to this book, however the characters in the book seemed a bit confused at times regarding their roles for the story. for example Alex who turns 18 in a few months, demonstrates characteristics similar to how a 14 or 15 yr old would behaves. (clingy and not at all independent of his mother) the main character Leela behaves very immature, weak and not at all like a woman who is 36. she encounters Jack's old girlfriend \\"Nora\\" who lies and tries to mislead Leela into believin that Jack doesnt want her.

It's a real hardware modem not likethe cheap, windows-only ones which unfortunately haveflooded the market and make finding a good hardware onevery, very tough. Be glad that this modem still exists.Any time you replace an internal modem you are asking forhassles. So most people's comments in that regard arecompletely unjustified.

The concept seems kind of cool at first: you want to fall in love with the main character of the opposite sex. The problem is, everything in this game is completely impossible to predict. If you pick the seemingly best responses, you don't necessarily win. I could go on about how corny and not fun this game is but apparently enough people have already said that. My main contribution to this discussion is just to remind you to never buy Sprung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring game","review":"Not sure this can even be called a game - it is more like reading a bad book where you decide some of the aspects.

More like a gel with salt granules, this can be used as a body wash.The blue gel seems to promote a sense of freedom with elements of lime, mandarin and bergamot for an uplifting emotional appeal. Leaves the skin scented with a refreshing almost grapefruit like fragrance or a lemony cologne. This is a scrub men will enjoy and women will want to steal.The blue color will remind you of your favorite ocean and the salt granules are more smooth than scratchy so this can also be used on the face. This is perfect for when your skin is in an oily or combination mood. This is slightly drying if you have normal skin.

I am honestly very disappointed with the product.Just about the only positive about the product, is the feeling after rinsing off. It does help make you feel more clean, but not as much as the description leads you to believe.The scrub doesn't foam up at all. Literally, nothing. For the price of the item, you really need to use a very generous amount just to feel \\"clean\\". Definitely not worth it, when you factor in the large price. The smell isn't great either. To me, it smells just like black licorice, and for someone who doesn't like the taste, the smell isn't any better either.I purchased through Prime for Valentine's Day, so obviously it arrived on time and all of the other jazz.

I'm pleased with the quality, but I am tempted to paint the windows white, as I have read others doing, so that she looks more real. All the sound effects work great. As with the other Diamond Select/Comic items, you have to remember to locate the batteries and move the switch from \\"Try Me\\" to \\"Play\\" for it to work as it should. I like that there was an extra battery covering provided with the model. Even though this is a toy, I would be hesitant to let any child play with it. It is rather delicate and should be used primarily for display."},{"rating":"2","title":"NCC-1701- Original Version -Diamond Comics - Captain Kirk Commanding","review":"Nice replica of original production model.

When he finally came on stage around midnight, it was just him, his guitar, a violinist and a percussionist who looked like a cross between Boy George and Alice Cooper. Anyway, Paco put on a very good show and I was quite impressed. I later learned he was up until last year, a member of the band SouthFM. When I got back to San Jose, I went to Rasputin Music and bought both CD's. I have not had a chance yet to listen to the other one, but \\"Drama Kids\\" is a really good CD.

However, my dislike for this printer is associated with the jamming that occurs when printing a larger print file. As a previous evaluation noted, the printer jams and you end up wasting lots of paper and ink re-printing. The printer worked fine for the first few months. As the usage increases the paper feed begins to have problems with feeding paper that is aligned properly, and jams when the paper is eskew because the feeder mechanism pulls paper faster on the right than on the left, leaving a printed page crooked, if not jammed before completion.I would not recommend this printer unless you are into frustrating yourself.

Perhaps the best description is they sound like The Spinners minus the funk, soul and catchy songs ... if that sounds like faint praise ... it is.So, the three songs listed above are worth hearing - perhaps on a single disc collection but the rest really depends on how much you like ska & light funk.

The book is not clearly written and does not seem to follow a logical order. Unreferenced symbols are used in formulas throughout the book. Often, out of the blue, a statement such as a=xyz is made. In order to find out what a is, the user has to has to turn backward several chapters. All too frequently in derivations, a formula is referenced that is ahead in the text, or in a future chapter. Notation is also confusing in terms of symbol choice. For example, 'r' with a dot on top of it is used to denote the radial component of a position vector change. The reader is admonished to not confuse this with the velocity when a simple subscript could have sufficed.I think this book is useful as a reference for someone who is already very familiar with the subject and does not need to understand how any of the equations are derived (because he/she already does.)

The illustrations are well done and the story is really positive, but it isn't 'fun' to read over and over because of the wording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Experiment","review":"Despite the title, don't expect anything dancelike here. This is lethargic, drifting music with no noticeable rhythm and very little melody either; it's difficult to imagine what could be choreographed to go with this, unless it were slow-motion, stylized movements, such as Tai Chi. The Tibetan vocals at least have a relaxing quality. However, for me, the electronic accompaniment is excruciating and makes this CD unlistenable. Your mileage may vary; clearly the previous reviewer enjoyed it. But, if you're intrigued by works that fuse Tibetan Buddhist vocals with New Age accompaniment, I'd strongly recommended the collaborations of Choying Drolma and Steve Tibbetts instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"19 Perfect, Thought Provoking Folk/Pop Songs.","review":"After hearing the first two single's (Something Crazy & Cecilia) I took a chance and bought the album (through import). After the second listen I found it to be a little dark (Something Crazy, Cecilia) , a little uplifting (Maria), and filled with hope and dreams (Forever 17). I can't find fault with this guy. His music speaks to so many people on so many levels. In my experience, it is rare that you find an album that has so much meaning, with every track as strong as the one before it. It has shot to the top of what I see as the best album's of 2003.

To the other reviewers complaining about terrible taste, you probably just had a rancid batch like this...I've had these crackers long ago, and loved them, which is why I ordered them. What's strange is that I bought a box from my supermarket maybe six months ago, and they were also rancid. Tam Tam crackers are the only crackers I've ever heard about problems like this.. maybe they are particularly susceptible to going rotten?

They were rancid and expired nearly a year ago. I held off reviewing them because I was pleased with how fast Amazon issued a refund. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Everyone is entitled to make a mistake. It wasn't until I noticed these very same crackers still listed that I felt compelled to warn anyone considering purchasing them to save their money. I'm very shocked and disappointed with Amazon for continuing to sell them when they were made aware by several people that they are expired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Warning","review":"The crackers we received went out of date 04/2009. That's not the worst part. You can't see the expiration date because it's on the INSIDE flap of the box and it must be opened and really searched for to see. Because of this we tasted them before we saw the expired date. These crackers have been stored somewhere where fumes from exhaust or nearby stored chemicals have also been stored for a long, long time. The crackers have been steeped in fumes to the point they are caustic. It made me run to wash out my mouth. My son tasted one at the same time before I could prevent it. He was sick on the spot. I've called Amazon and explained in detail our experience and I hope no one else is poisoned. Someone right now should be going to this warehouse in Nevada and investigating their hazardous food storage practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been good...2 years ago.","review":"Sent these crackers to a friend for what was supposed to be a funny gift from the third party seller fulfilled by Amazon.

If you want Tam Tam Crackers I would recommend a different avenue to obtaining them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid, blechhhh, ptoooey!","review":"I've read very similar reviews on here so I guess it is a really bad batch. I called Manishewitz and the woman was really nice and told me the number on the flap \\"1681\\" meant that they expire the 168th day of 2011 so it must be an ingredient that was bad. She made good on the 6 boxes as well as Amazon, so I am more than happy. If you bought these, don't be afraid to call Manishewitz at their number found on their website. They will send you coupons (how many i don't know yet) to replace what you've bought, and it's good for them to know what went wrong with this \\"experiment\\" so it doesn't happen again.

She has a lovely voice, and sings the old Tin Pan Alley and similar genre songs straight in the way they were written, without a lot of jazz embellishment. (Not that jazz embellishment is bad, it just doesn't always work with this material.) I'm a big fan of hers, so my opinions may be a little biased; but if you love this music it's hard to not enjoy Morris singing it.Kern is not as well remembered as some of his contemporaries, and this album reveals some of the reasons why. At his best, with songs like \\"Look for the Silver Lining\\", \\"Long Ago\\", \\"You Couldn't be Cuter\\", and \\"All the Things You Are\\", he should never be forgotten. But some of his other work is not as memorable. This album is worth the purchase for the winners, but not every track is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!

This CD is an excellent work. Her voice has never fit so comfortably and her lyrics are more emotionally intelligent. This is the work of a more grown up Samantha Fox. The music is all electronic, but it is far too comfortable to be considered cold hard techno. The melodies and harmonies are smooth and pure and the songs are painted with many warm and vibrant colors. The music is quite danceable and will inevitably get you moving, but it has a sunshining dreamlike feel to it as well. This is Fox's best album of them all.

It's a book for the independent thinker who would like a balanced view so they can make up their own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't the Velvet Underground already make this record?","review":"Aping, aping and more aping.

Friends in Sydney have been raving about these guys for a while and I was fortunate enough to receive an Australian copy of their full-length debut CD (it was released there before anywhere else in the world) and it's been on rotation for weeks. This is R'n'R at its best. There are elements of Velvet Underground, Pavement, Dandy Warhols and mid-'70s CBGBs rock. This LP deserves to be huge in a world saturated with safe, tame music. By the way, buy the UK version on Amazon UK as it has the original cover art, not the wimpy US art (what was the record company thinking?). This CD is the most essential purchase of 2001!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there is hope for rock 'n' roll!","review":"The Strokes have been hyped up in the music press recently so I was a bit leary to hear them. But to my surprise, I really dig them! The music is a nice contrast of rough-sounding rock with sweetly appealing melodic vocals. In a weird but nice way, Casablanca's voice reminds me of Jim Morrison's crooning. In addition, I'm so happy The Strokes have come along to play great music for us hapless folk being drowned in manufactured pop and pitifully boring \\"neu metal\\". They prove that rock is thankfully not dead! I'd recommend this to anyone who'd like to hear a new spin on an old punk sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"These guys are the saviors of rock? How? Why them?

Slightly funky, slightly jazzy, pretty zany too!Much of this is fairly listenable but there's nothing particularly about it and it's not getting any further air-time on my HiFi after being initially auditioned.I'd probably enjoy it more if my Spanish was more colloquial but I don't get any of the allusions. The band sound like they are having a great time though so......I'd be struggling to recommend this to you - so I won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth, funky, goofy, subtle.","review":"Musically speaking, Los Amigos Invisibles are an extremely smooth and funky band, seamlessly mixing Anglo and Caribbean Hispanic elements into their music, in a way that's accessible to many audiences. Yet in their eclecticism, their regional specificity never gets watered down-- their humor, which pervades the whole album in particular, is very specifically Hispanic Caribbean. And this is not just in the lyrics of the songs (hilarious though they are). The musical and stylistic allusions are up to it, too; for example, \\"El Barro\\", a song about a boy with a pimple in his nose, will send anybody familiar with Latin teeny-bopper boy bands reeling with laughter; \\"El Baile del Sobón\\" is a hilarious cartoonish parody of everything that's wacky about your random disposable roots Merengue song. The way they sing in general also often sounds \\"off-hand\\" in a way that I'm not sure translates across their cultural context, adding to the effect. A work of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third album of the greatest venezuelan dance band!","review":"This is not the best album this band has to offer but its a nice album full of disco sounds mixed with jazzy grooves and latin percussions (venezuelan).

Very very difficult beginning, the only reason I hung in was that a friend had read it and told me it took 129 pages to get into it. Actually, from 129 to the end, it was good. But I wouldn't recommend it because of the slow start. I can handle slow starts, but this was ridiculous. And I read that this author is an editor, so that amazed me that the start took so long.

Years ago I purchased this same album on vinyl (remember that?) and I am delighted to see it available now on CD. None of the tunes are particularly rare -- all have been performed in many other collections of Renaissance music -- but the collection of branles by Arbeau and the superb performance make this CD stand out.In 1985 I took a class in Renaissance dance, and we used this album for the source of the music. Though played a little fast for the beginner, this is perfect for recreating the fun of the country and court of the 1500s. Reprints of Arbeau's book by the same name are available in most libraries, and they describe & teach almost every dance played on this CD.

After using a little \\"fry daddy\\" for years it was time I got something new and this is exactly what I needed. It is much safer because the unit itself is much more stable, it can be closed during and after use and the outside does not get very warm despite the temperature of the oil. This way I don't have to worry about my cats knocking it off the counter or someone accidentally getting burned. I like that it has different temperature settings.

We had a DeLonghi that we really liked, but got tired of the clean up, so decided to give this one a try. Even after preheating for over 15 minutes at the highest temperature, the temperature of the oil never gets high enough to correctly fry the food. (I used a cooking thermometer to test the temperature on several different occasions; even after the 15 minute preheat, the temp. was at least 20 degrees too low. As every good fryer knows, correct temperature is key to great fried foods.)

I was originally told to return it to the store where it was purchased to exchange. Easier said then done when it was a gift from 1200 miles away.) This was when I discovered my new one could fry half what my old one did. My new one was harder to clean... AND the lid was all plastic. My old TeFal (after many years 8+??) STILL gets to temp faster, gets hotter and keeps at temp longer (and cannot be accidentally unplug...has a longer cord too).

Historical, in part, and humorous, sad, zany, and unexpected. I can't wait to read the follow-ups to this. It is translated form the Russian. If you love penguins, pre-21st century Russian lit, or maybe you are an obituary writer or love, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cold inside and out","review":"When reading \\"death and the penguin\\" one has the persistent sensation of coldness. It's not only because the story takes place partly during winter in Kiev and the surrounding parts of the Ukraine, but also because it tells the story of people that try to connect in a frozen emotional world - a world where human life has a zero-temperature value, and a connection with a penguin that was set free (together with other animals) from the Kiev Zoo is as rewarding as a connection with a young woman, or a policeman, or a sickly old man. As many gifted writers who operate in places where everyday life is essentially miserable, Kurkov conveys the feeling of dismal reality with a mix of fatalism and a biting sense of humor. A minor chef d'oeuvre, marred only by its last 20 pages, which to this reviewer seem to have been written with some carelessness and take away from the chilling realism of the rest of this strangely beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Yom Kippur reading","review":"I started reading the book in Yom Kippur in the morning. I finished it at night. It is an interesting, well written book. It is funny and sad at the same time. It's about loneliness. The cold weather, snow, the frozen Dniepr river serve to illustrate that. I'm waiting for an animation / graphic novel adaptation of the book. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly funny","review":"The infuriating and, finally, almost- endearing main character is an under-employed Ukranian journalist whose luck turns -- though not necessarily in a positive direction -- when he gets a steady job writing pre-obituaries for the rich, powerful and dubious. He and his pet penguin develop a sideline as paid guests of honour at the subsequent funerals. The characters and situations are funny, fun, and, sometimes, ominous. The writing is crisp. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I wouldread more by the same author. I recommend it enthusiastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different and Existential Tale","review":"I didn't know what to make of this book as I was reading it, but the story and its quirky characters stayed with me long after I had finished. It's a somber tale, a post-Cold War mystery that dances around an existential void, highlighted by the absurd presence of the penguin. It's also darkly funny, and you really have to read it to get it. But I highly recommend that you read it! Good, unique writing should be rewarded with readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes my 'Top 10' list","review":"All I can say is 'Wow'! This book has both things I love: a good plot and a penguin. Kurkov is an excellent writer. His characters are a little bland, however, but with such a thick plot, it was smart to keep them from sticking out like sore thumbs. Overall this book was well written and translated. I will love it always, and hopefully, when I have finished other books I put off reading, I will get to enjoy Death and the Penguin again someday.

But on this album it sounds like an overly poppy set of B-sides some of them are catchy but none of them are very distinguishable from songs that came out 10 years ago.

Great read, kept me laughing at various points throughout. Kept in mind that this was written during the heat of the women's revolution , and thus had a repetitive revolutionary tone-but nonetheless all said with good intentions in-spite of how male readers will obviously respond to the point she is trying to read.

And the version of Mad Mission on this CD is just so much...I won't say better...but amplified and fully realized . Even the performance of [Let Him] Fly is better and I was quite jaded by its constant rotation on the radio in 1996.I have all her albums and cannot recommend this one enough. Her live versions amplify and enhance the studio recordings from the other albums. It doesn't hurt that you have Buddy & Julie Miller and Emmylou Harris singing and playing along, but this album would still be a fantastic showcase without them.My favorites are Goodbye, Rain, Long Road Home, Tony, Mad Mission and Fly, although there is not a \\"skip\\" on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An art of her own...a \\"no regrets\\" buy....","review":"When Ms. Griffin sings it is as though her voice has stopped just short of crying. And, yet, the lyrical quality of her music never seems self-indulgent. She can be the reflective heiress, the friend of a gay suicide, the lonely, pleading lover with neither the phelgmatic drift that takes hold of so many poetic songwriters, nor its equally possessive histrionic counterpart. There is a tension to her music. This live recording, with her occassional comments between numbers, serves to loosen things up a bit. I wish Ms. Griffin had a wider following, more acclaim, etc. Yet, then again, there is an intimacy to her sound that might well sacrificed in the process. At any rate, there is nothing lost in A Kiss in Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Is More","review":"I have been an avid follower of Patty Griffin and her music since the first time I heard Living With Ghosts. While I enjoyed and appreciated her ability to front a more substantial backup band on Flaming Red, it is the intimacy of her voice and an acoustic guitar that is the most heartfelt and soulful. 1000 Kisses brought her back to her routes and influences with its wonderfully eclectic stylings. This outing confirms that Patty Griffin is one of those rare singer-songwriters who barely needs accompaniment. Sometimes it seems that more that one instrument is too many. This CD (and great DVD) affirms her presence and quiet intensity in a terrific live venue. Definitely not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live but Cooked","review":"I'm a big admirer of Patty Griffin but I liked the original versions of Tony, Mad Mission, and Rain much better than these live versions. The orginals are more personal and passionate. I used to listen to Mad Mission over and over and the live version has a very different emotional resonance. This live version of Tony is very different from the much older live version that you can hear on KCRW's program archives. One brings tears to my eyes and the other doesn't. The sweetness, agreeability and nostalgia which permeates this performance (not to mention the cloying album art and DVD) is much less appealing to me than the potent mixture of anger, sexuality, grief and passion I felt from the originals, and from much earlier live performances I saw in Texas. High volume vocals have a bootleg sound, with a penetrating extra dollop of high frequency resonance that always makes me reach for the volume control on my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kiss in Time","review":"Well, first of all,\\" It's Patty Griffin\\"! I am never disapointed with her releases. This woman knows how to deliver!She is so talented, I can't believe it took so long for me to find her.

She's so sweet!!(Now that sounds creepy!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This CD was absolutely charming and delightful. I've owned it fora couple of years or so. The sound is on the spare side, notcluttered or over-adorned. I guess the challenge here was tomake a ukulele CD without having come across as a novelty -it doesn't.

It's really a one of a kind volume, because so many books on Amtrak take highly polarized views of what should occur with that agency. Instead, Anthony Pearl illustrates rail policy that actually works in several countries around the world, and explains America's failed attempts at high speed rail. He does not make political judgments (such as Joseph Vranich's \\"End of the Line\\" and \\"Derailed\\" do), but rather succinctly provides a wealth of information about what actually works.

Great sound, easy to use controls, lots of options. However, the designer completely missed the boat on the most important aspect of the product. This is an alarm clock first. No one buys this to replace their home entertainment center.

First sign of trouble was when the back-up battery would drain even when the unit was continuously plugged in. Next, the clock began to run slow.

Not in order, they would jump ahead or jump back even when spinning the wheel the same direction. Lastly the connection between the iPod and the system became corrupted. The speakers would be staticy and I would have to wedge a piece of paper or something between the iPod and the unit to get a connection that would hold. Eventually, I couldn't find any position that would get the iPod and the unit to connect anymore. When it was time to replace it, guess what? I didn't blow $100 on another unit.

The LCD is so bright on this thing it kept me up for over 3 nights. If you are using it as a clock/radio/alarm clock replacement you may want to think again. It has three settings to dim the LCD, but it just didn't go dark enough. It just literally shines a blue light in your face. I'm returning it based solely on this, nothing else.

When I was able to connect the ipod to the unit, the ipod sits on top of the radio and is very susceptible to being knocked off when reaching over to turn off the alarm or something else especially at night or in the morning when you aren't really awake.

I was about 30 miles from Atlanta on a high mountain. My car radio received clearly over 25 fm stations. The iHome managed 2. No am station was audible.

Now I refuse to put my IPOD in it at all, looking at some of the other horror stories I've read on these reviews.

So it you like to listen to a little music and then hit the snooze button, every time the alarm goes off it resets to level 19 and you have to turn down the volume...very poor design. For some reason the volume setting works fine on the sleep feature and normal radio/ipod modes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item stinks- Literally","review":"I have the black model.

Not the kind of thing you want close to you while you're sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bright! Not for light sleepers!","review":"We have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light. Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room! My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it. We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking features of a $10 clock radio","review":"Wow - what a poorly designed product. No presets for radio staions. Volume on \\"wake to music\\" ramps up way loud very quickly ( & no way of disabling that \\"feature\\" if someone else in the room/house doesn't have to get up). Awkward \\"form-over-function\\" volume and tuning controls. Cheap feeling buttons. Back-light for display does not auto-dim. $20 extra for a remote? Buzzing sound when the ipod is docked. Because my wife bought this for me as a birthday present is the only reason it wasn't returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black iHome Works Great!","review":"I love my black iHome. Amazon was the only vendor that I could find that had the black one when they first came out. They also had it for the best price. I received it promptly and it was in excellent condition.The sound quality is just what I wanted for the bedroom and I love that if I forget to dock my iPod, the alarm still wakes me with a gentle beeping sound.The only con I can find with the iHome is that the volume and time setting buttons are bulky and not very sensitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept that loses in practical use...","review":"I anxiously awaited the delivery of this clock radio so that I could both charge and use my iPod at the same time. I read a review about the brightness of the display and promptly minimized the significance of this problem. Don't make the same mistake. It is blindingly bright. Perhaps the designers don't sleep or didn't put it to a real test in their own home. Other irritating issues include: 1) the buttons on the clock, although nicely lit and legible at night, make the noisest clicking sound, 2) the alarm doesn't smoothly increase in volume--it hits you like a defribulator, 3) it has one of the worst AM reception qualites of any radio that I have owned and 4) the power cord is slightly to short. I emailed the company about these issues but never received a response--to busy?...to apathetic? Save your money. I went back to my Bose and simply used a AUX cable to reach the same effect except without the charging ability...I am okay, now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bogus","review":"i bought one of these ihomes cause it says it will charge the ipod while docked.

However, the radio reception is bad - could not even recieve NPR without a hissing sound. A free radio that I got some years back had better FM reception! Furthermore, the speakers produce an audible humming noise when playing music on low volume. This got to be annoying very quickly. So shipped it back to Amazon who promptly refunded the amount. Checked on apple store and they do not stock this particular model. They only stock the iH6 - therefore ordered that one from Amazon. Will let you know how it works out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep time very well...","review":"I suppose I am being a bit harsh here, but I expect a CLOCK radio to keep time better than to lose a couple of minutes each month. All other aspects of this item work well, but why bother paying for the clock feature if you can't depend on it? Buttons on top stay lit (cool), and sound is good, but the a/c adapter plug is one of the largest \\"bricks\\" you will find these days. I ended up selling to get an atomic clock radio from Sangean.

About 3 days after that occurrence she plugged it in only to have it wipe out everything on it. Her iPod was just over 1 year old and out of warranty.

But it increases quickly and gets very loud, very fast.

(you can set the \\"sleep volume\\", but that is a different function) It is hard to believe that a product could ever go to market with such a blatant design flaw. Even the crappiest 70's clock radio bought from Goodwill will have a volume control that sets the wake volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Set the Wake-up Volume - Very disappointing","review":"I just got off the phone with iHome customer service. I called because when the iHome alarm comes on in the morning, it's very loud no matter where I set the volume before going to sleep. iHome Customer service says that's the way the unit is manufactured. You cannot set the wakeup volume where you want it. The fact that it comes on gradually is no consolation when it continues up to a ridiculously loud volume. Secondly, as other reviewers have said, the backlight on the unit is too bright, even on the lowest setting. Thirdly, a really loud beep occurs when you change the alarm settings, so if you're partner is asleep when you change the wakeup time, they'll be awake shortly. It's like a smoke detector going off. The iPod alarm clock is a great idea, but the basic functions of this unit are really a problem. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought it was cool","review":"It was a nice design, and is easy to charge the iPod however i am returning it because of two main reasons. I have to cover up the clock to sleep - the display even on the dimest setting is WAY too bright. It lights up the whole room. The second thing is I don't enjoy jumping out of bed at 6:00 in the morning. There is no way to set the alarm volume, and it automatically comes on VERY LOUD. It wakes me up at a volume louder than i normally listen to it - down the hall. Very bad flaw, I don't know what they were thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad alarm clock","review":"As a docking station for my iPod, it's great. The design is cool and this product is easy to use.

The orange-lit buttons on top are also too bright.You can't adjust the alarm volume. I found it to be way too loud.The \\"gradual wake\\" feature isn't much of a feature, as it cranks up to maximum volume after only a few seconds.This product was very disappointing.

I have to push the buttons about 20 times to get them to function. The volume wheel makes the volume go up and down while turning it in one direction. Usually I have to play with the wheel to get it to the desired volume as it shuffles back and forth. It rarely picks up radio stations and the sound is poor.

When the alarm initially goes off, Ipod plays just fine. After the first snooze, the buzzer goes off.

I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations.

I was pleased with it overall but the extremely bright light, not-so-gradual wake up, and no way to set the wake volume or the song you wake up to were huge annoyances. I got used to it eventually. About 4 months after having used it, i took my iPod off one day to find the connector loose and my iPod not charged at all. It had completely broken off. I have always been extra careful to not move the iPod while on the dock and to take it off gently, and it still broke. All in all, this product has far more cons than pros, and needs to go back to the drawing board.Soon after my iHome broke, I bought an iBlaster from Bed Bath and Beyond. So far, it works much better. It's a sturdier construction, you can turn the light off, and is generally easier to use. It also cost 20 dollars less than the iHome and includes a remote. It still has no way to set the wake volume though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats wrong with this","review":"Iv had two iHomes.

I dont really know what to do, it doesnt even look that good. It makes annoying noises which really arent helpfull when your trying to sleep, and thats normally! I wouldnt buy this. Really, its worth getting some bose speakers instead, then atleast you wont break your ipod too. Another annoying thing is that mine didnt come with a remote, like many others, i would have been less irritated if it had. The thing is i cant really take it back because its a present, so annoying.

I had to cover it up at night, which defeats the purpose of a clock in your bedroom.Two, the volume of the iPod and radio alarm settings is too loud. It claims to \\"lull you out of sleep\\" by increasing the volume \\"gradually\\", but by that they mean from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds, and there is no discernable way to adjust the setting. Needless to say, it is not fun to wake up to, even if it is your favorite song.Anyway, I should have just bought a speaker cradle for my iPod, because I went back to the 15-year-old clock/radio my grandmother gave me when I was 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing key features for home use","review":"Looks good and sounds good, but don't use as alarm/bedroom music system.

It can be raised higher than that, but that is the lowest. In the revised model, the lowest alarm volume is \\"10\\" and it can be raised from there.The only way to determine if it is the new model is to look at the box.

I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until knobs stopped functioning","review":"I loved this radio for the first year of ownership until the knobs stopped working. I see others are having the same problem and it's really dissapointing. When you try to use the knobs to adjust something like volume or set the time the numbers just seem to randomly go up and down for every click.This is a very strange error and because both knobs quit at the same time it makes me believe that the problem was not caused by faulty knobs but instead something more fundamental to the unit failing like the firmware.I wouldn't be surprised to see a class action lawsuit if as many people's units are failing the way mine did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke TWICE for no reason","review":"I received the iHome IH5B as a Christmas gift in 2007 and it broke TWICE since January 25th, 2008 for no reason. The speakers stopped working probably as a result of some kind of interference. I confirmed this with SDI Technologies (the people who provide service for iHome products) who said the exposed iPod docking station leaves the device vulnerable to outside interferenes with other wireless devices. I had to send in the unit for servicing on my OWN dime the first time and I refuse to send it in a second time. This product is a piece of junk and would NEVER buy an iHome product for anyone based on the extremely poor performance of this product and poor customer service from SDI Techologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I pod Home","review":"This \\"home\\" charges the ipod while serving as an alarm clock.

That's where the good abruptly ends. Their customer service is AWOL if you try to get any communications started. The radio tuner is lame, especially on the AM side, and the gentle wake feature climbs to volume 19 in about 15 seconds. It's enough to cause cardiac arrest for the dead. When asked about these \\"features\\" they have a standard set of canned responses on their website.(you'll be lucky to actually communicate with anyone). If all you want is a device to play your iPod loud, purchase something else. If you want something to integrate your iPod into a clock radio, avoid this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a year, it has turned into a static machine","review":"The thing worked great as noted in the other reviews, but as it passed the one year mark, it is almost impossible to play it without annoying static coming out of at least one of the speakers. The ipod has to be held by hand to get it into a position without static. This happens on both my ipod and I am using the correct adapter. The connectors on both ipods are fine.. It's the ihome with a crappy dock connector"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This IPod Base!","review":"I got this for my personal home use with my IPod. I wanted something to play around the house. They speaker quality is great, and it is very easy to use. I recently began using it as my alarm clock and love that I can wake up to my IPod at a gradually increasing volume (It does not \\"blare\\" you awake). The ONLY drawback I have with this product is the light from the digital face is kind of bright. It does have three varying intensities of brightness, but even at it's dimmest I have to place a book in front of it! Otherwise I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"This unit has numerous faults, the main ones are:#1 - The radio reception is atrocious.#2 - The sound is weak; the bass is bad, but perhaps OK for a unit this small.

You can't turn it towards you as you sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temporary device","review":"I would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months. There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days. The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time. The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good news for light sensitive Sleepers!","review":"I just got the iHome iH5 Black model from Amazon. Compared to my wife's ~3 month old WHITE iHome iH5, the dimmest setting of the LCD is very dim; almost looks off in daylight. Again, I'm comparing it to an older model, which is significantly brighter at the dimmest setting. Those of you who can somehow see clock radio LED's through your closed eyelids (like my wife), can now buy this product without fear of being bothered by the LCD backlight.(However, the buttons on top are just as bright, with ogange light shinning through small slits on top of each one. I can't imagine that bothering anyone.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sad example of design blind spots.","review":"I know this has been covered in other reviews, but I'm currently fuming enough to reiterate these points:1. The backlight on the clock display assures that you will not only be awoken by this clock, you actually will never get to sleep! Isn't there some torture technique that uses bright lights?2. The un-customizable wake volume is such that when I was sleeping in a completely different bedroom from where the unit is, I woke up thinking someone was in my front yard with a megaphone.Granted, the concept of this unit is innovative and points at an as-yet-served market need, but the execution is yet another example of sloppy design. Did they even try it themselves???!!!I just returned my unit and will hope that iHome has spurred better designers to enter this category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Item.","review":"Wonderful item! Get the Ihome and wake up to Music rather than the buzzer. I love it. You can also wake up to radio. and yes there is even a buzzer.

The sound, and features are great, but the overall quality of the controls are very lacking to say the least. The only control that I really use is the volume control. After the first 4 months I noticed that it was becoming increasing difficult to control the volume. Seeing that it is digital, the volume would suddenly go from say 10 to 35 in one movement. If I attempted to adjust the volume down, it would continue to increase. The quality of the servo is very poor. Other than suddenly blowing out your other office workers ear drums, it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't play iPod - arrrgh!","review":"After about one year the button that activates the iPod went dead, all the other buttons work.

Keeps iPod charged; can wake up to ratio, buzzer or iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Features, Unreliable Connections","review":"I like the features. I'm satisfied with the sound. The user interface could be more intuitive.HOWEVER, my overriding complaint is that the docking port (as many other reviewers have mentioned) is not reliable. The connection is poorly constructed, so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the iPod isn't there any more. If they could fix this quality problem, it would be well worth the $100, but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can't justify it at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this!","review":"My sister and I both received iHomes for Christmas. I was very happy UNTIL, after 5 months of regular use, my speakers stopped working with the iPod. The speakers became filled with STATIC and the music was virtually impossible to hear. The speakers had not completely broken, as the iHome radio still worked fine, but the sound quality while playing both my ipod and my sister's iPods on my iHome was ruined. Now, 3 months later (8 months total after buying the iHomes), the sound quality on my sister's iHome is becoming increasingly static-filled. We cannot hear our music over the static.In short, this product is A WASTE OF MONEY. Buy something else!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design and Overpriced","review":"I bought this for my kid for Christmas. What a mistake that was. The functionality as a clock radio is below average. Pair it with the Ipod and it is dismal. No remote included, when you need one to make the Ipod function in the docking cradle. If I could give this product a big fat ZERO, I would. This was way overpriced for what you get, and to not include that remote in the price is shameful. The nighttime display is so bright, I can see it lighting up the hallway 15 feet from my kid's bedroom all the way into my bedroom. Oh well, I don't have to worry about her sleeping in the dark. Now if I could just get to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the 1st 11 months","review":"I absolutely loved the iH5 clock radio for the 1st 11 months. Aside from the constant hassle of trying to get my ipod video to properly fit into the docking station; I was very happy with my purchase. Eleven months later my problems began: the clock constantly resets, often a factor in me being late because I do not have the correct time and the ipod will often stop playing after a few minutes. I called ihome for customer support and they replied by stating that the product is not guaranteed to work beyond the 90-day warranty. If I wanted it fixed I needed to send it to El Paso and it would cost me at least $40. Since $40 is half the purchase price of the unit, I am on the hunt for a more reliable unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowly failing after one year","review":"At first I tried this on my nightstand, but even at its lowest setting, it was much too bright. So we put it in our kitchen, where it looks nice on the counter. However . . .After a year of use, the display is starting to go out -- the light is much dimmer on one side than the other . . .And worse, it loses about five minutes a week. I really never expected a digital clock to lose a significant amount of time, but the iHome does. I'm just about to dump it. There are better choices out there, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality.

Even though the directions say it can be adjusted, I can't seem to figure it out.The second problem is that I have set the alarm to the iPod setting and the beeper goes off and then later the iPod. I have tried to disengage the alarm and then reset it and the same thing happens.The third problem is that it frequently knocks the iPod of the \\"shuffle songs\\" mode.Many reviewers said that there was no remote, mine came with one and I don't actually use it much.Don't purchase, wait for a better model!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IHome","review":"Overall the product has worked the way it should except for one thing.

The controls are easy to use and self explanitory. I Highly recomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"I got this for Christmas and I wouldn't have bought it for myself.

But the reception is better than my old clock radio. the sound is better than my old clock radio. and so far i have been going to bed to the ipod and waking up to the ipod, I set the second alarm to go off just to make sure. Just got to remember to turn the alarms off friday nite and back on sunday nite.I don't think you can find those fancy alarm features on any ipod clock radio, anyway. and compared to the timex i was looking at the controls are real easy to use. and its real nice to have the ipod to go to bed listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't charge latest Ipod Nano!","review":"Great price and product in every way, except that it is not compatable with the latest generation Nano!

Sounds like my dating life :P Also, a lot of dust shows on the shiny black surface. The clock light is very bright, even on the lowest setting. It's like I'm sleeping on the surface of the sun!

Changing the time was a little laborious with the wheel (that imitates the iPod wheel), but then again, those of us who have iPods are used to spinning, right? But less than 6 months after I purchased the iHome, the darn wheel to set the time and alarm stopped working. So basically, I have an expensive set of mediocre speakers with a clock. As long as the power doesn't go out, I guess I'm okay. But I'll have to be agreeable to waking up at 5:40 am from now on, I suppose.Bottom line: nice idea, poorly engineered."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I bought the iHome so that I could choose which songs to wake up to off of my iPod, and it worked well when it actually WORKED.After being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off I tossed the item - it wasn't worth all of the problems to keep at all if I couldn't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning.Other people have mentioned the too bright display and the \\"gradual volume increase\\", which I eventually got used to, but I could see how they would be incredibly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised - display too bright and alarm volume extremely loud","review":"The product does everything it advertises and works well - except - the alarm volume is extremely loud on it's lowest setting and the display is far too bright on it's lowest setting.

This unit would be ideal for a partially deaf and blind person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw kills this product","review":"The design flaws have been covered by other reviewers, this is just another review to help drive the point home about how poorly designed this unit really is. It is truly insane the architects behind this unit thought every person in the world prefers to be waken up at full volume. My wife, who bought this unit for me for my birthday, begged me to return it with no hard feelings on her part, just make the stupid thing stop playing! And be sure you really grasp how bright the lcd display is on this thing. There's two settings: 747 landing strip, and the dimmer setting, Lear jet landing strip. I put a fat book in front of the display so I can go to sleep at night. Wait until they redesign the unit and fix the flaws.

What's worse is that the skip/stutter malfunctions have now started to occur on my iPod (just over a year old), making it unuseable. The iPod won't reboot, and iTunes won't recognize it anymore. In fact, any time that I plug the iPod in through the USB port, iTunes crashes and won't reopen unless the iPod is disconnected.

You will not be able to use caller ID unless you rewire your whole house. The manufacturer claims that this product will work with caller ID but that is not true. Any phone signal that comes out of this product will not display caller ID. You will need to run a new set of wires to each phone location and connect that to your phone line BEFORE it enters the DR401 call manager.

Hats off to the contributors to this book and for the editor for taking the time to introduce these poems to America!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alabama Women Speak , a memorable literary collection.","review":"Alabama authors have stepped forth to share short stories, poems and quips that will lift the heart of the reader. Ordinary & Sacred as Blood, authored by Alabama women, will trigger your every emotion. It truly promises and delivers something for everyone. You'll treasure this book forever. Delightful, thoughtful way to remember those on your gift list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for young and old about real women of past/present","review":"I laughed, cried, and identified with many of the poems and stories.

My favorite book in 4th grade. It was so good that I still remember the book as an adult and bought it for my 2 boys that are now in the 4th grade. They both loved it and finished the book in record time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I read this book when I was about 10 years old and I loved it. I read it at least 20 times before I turned 12. I have recently re-read it and it still a great book. I bought it so my 9 year old son could read it too. It will be a Christmas present for him, he is not big on reading, but like me, he loves the martial arts. This is a great book for any young boy,(or girl) who has been bullied and are too afraid to tell an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe its just me","review":"IM all for hood books but maybe it was just me but i could not get past 115, i feel like it is taking too long to get to the action or the point, i lost interest. i read a reviewer on here comment and i must agree it has not caught my attention and i am all for hood books i own or have a vast majority of them but this one is not hittin it right now. if possible somebody persuade me i should continue but right now im not feeling it and i quit trying to figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: IF YOU READ THIS BOOK, START ON PG 15","review":"I'm still trying to figure out what the hype was about this book. First, it was designed for a nonmature audience. I'm very grown and was disappointed to read about a seventeen year old. There was nothing different in this book than any other urban tale. I didn't like how the author told at the beginning what was going to happen at the end. That's why I put a warning to start on page 15, 3rd paragraph. You'll probably enjoy it more if you start from there and then go back to the beginning pages. There were too many unanswered questions at the end, but not enough to write a sequel. I do not recommend this book for mature audiences. This book should be in the young teen's section. I'll let my 15 year old read it and come back with her review."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't like my review...","review":"THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE I WAS A FAN OF EDWARDS' BOOK THE LAST BAD DECISION, BUT I AM NOT A FAN OF HER!

I LIKED THE WAY SHE INTRODUCED THE CHARACTERS AND MADE THEM ALL STAND OUT AND HAVE THEIR OWN IDENTIES AND LIKED THE STORY LINE AND THE UNEXPECTED ENDING, BUT EDWARDS HERSELF, I COULD DO WITHOUT!

I just knew him and Chancey was going to battle it out again in the sequel. I'm mad at that! Overall this was a excellent book!!!! The real-life issues had me stuck until I finished it. I have never cried on a book before, but I couldn't help sobbing like a baby at the end. He died for nothing!! The author who wrote this story is cold-blooded for messing up the readers head like she does. I'm still waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me Chancey really ain't dead!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, yet smooth","review":"Pete's new album is amazing. It's quite different than his first CD, So They Say. Untold has powerful songs with mixes of acousitc, electric, saxaphone, organs, female vocals and more. Its definitely an album you would want to pick up for everyday listening. I would find it very hard to get tired of this CD, as it seems to mix in a little something new every time you listen to it. So, if you are a lover of dispatch, singer-songwriters, and in general, amazing music, definitely pick up and support Pete Francis. You wont be disapointed. This album is $...well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Gray Wannabe","review":"Not that that's a bad thing. David Gray happens to be a personal fave of mine. I bought this cd for the song Untold, having heard a brief snippet of it on a tv show. I need to give it more play, I'm sure, to find all the nuances that other reviewers here seem to have found on this cd. So far, I'm not feeling it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch your hair! But otherwise, I like it.","review":"I have a lot of pain in my neck & shoulders, and have been looking for some ways to work on that area between massages. This works pretty well for me. There's one review about it collapsing. I cannot envision it - this sucker is pretty hard. Either they've changed it or he had a defective one, or something. It has a *little* give, but not much. I like its shape because it's not as prone to slipping away as a tennis ball or handball ball. One caveat - if you have hair longer than ... well, any hair, almost, just be sure to get it out of the way before positioning the tool - OUCH! I am still playing around to figure out the most effective angles and positions. I'm looking forward to showing it to my massage therapist next weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but it's a bit hard","review":"I've been wanting someone to make something like this for a long time for to stretch the sub occipitals at the back of my head, but this thing is a little hard and I haven't been able to figure out how to get it in the right position to make it work yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"best tool for massing","review":"this is a very useful tool to use on yourself or on your clients. sure does save on your hands and thumbs.m. phipps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I think all the good reviews are from people who sell this thing! The picture on the instructions shows the model resting her neck on it I could not rest my head on it, it would not support my neck. I found it very uncomfortable both at the back of my head, on my shoulder blade and on my buttock for sciatica. Will have another go before I send it back, so far its not lived up to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This product doesn't make any sense to me. I've used numerous back and muscle related products and they all do something useful. This one - not so much.One major problem with it is that it is made for you to 'lie' on, but it isn't strong enough to actually put any serious weight on (and I'm not a big person, just regular size). I think if it were really solid and held it's shape under weight, maybe it would work, but absent that, it is marginal and there are much better (and cheaper!) alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand","review":"I don't quite understand what the deal is with this product. I could pull a similar sized toy out of my kid's toy closet and produce the same result. Perhaps I'm missing something, but this isn't one of my better purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit or miss","review":"This product looks like a hit or miss depending on your injury.

It's hard to put it under the right position where you pain is. It also lacks of flexibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"not 'soft'","review":"I had expected this to be 'soft' since that's how it's labeled and certainly softer than the 'firm' Davinci Tool. However, I can feel no real difference between the two and can find no place on my body where they help more than they hurt. Also, besides the fact that neither is soft, they are both too large for my body. There should be a choice in sizes. Wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good stylus","review":"When the original stylus that came with my Palm m515 started to slip out of its storage slot, I decided I needed a replacement. I ordered several different brands to find the stylus that suited me best. Of the four different m500 series replacement styli that I tried, this one was second only to the LandWare Floating Point Stylus. This stylus has a metal shaft, good weight, and it fits nicely into the storage slot. It also contains a ball point pen that is accessed by pulling off the end cap, and a reset pin that is accessed by unscrewing the tip. This is a good choice if you can't justify paying the LandWare Floating Point Stylus' high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I was expecting a lot more out of this game after I read all the reviews. The game is not adicting, I played it for a couple of days and then put it up on the shelve, a sure sign that I didn't enjoy it. Everyone's tastes are different and I guess I like more of the strategy and a lot more types of games within the games. I would not recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIGS is BEST","review":"I've been playing this game for a bit over a day and it is the best baseball game I've played! I have played several other baseball games on PS2 and XBOX 360. The Bigs has a very simple control layout, varying levels of challenge, REAL player names, and terrific graphics (using HD connection and HDTV). This game concentrates on the fun of the game instead of realistic playing. It gives points and \\"power ups\\" for great plays...you won't find that in games that focus on realism. It takes nothing away from the baseball, but adds a lot of fun.I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a FUN, QUALITY, baseball game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"I love this game. It is so entertaining. It's a good alternative to the \\"serious\\" baseball games. In this one you can just have fun, hit a crap load of home runs, build up your own player and do little games. It's just a fun game. I recommend this to anyone looking to have fun while playing a game, and not getting pissed at everything(Call of Duty 4)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Wait a mintue...","review":"So I bought the Reflections [Vinyl] edition, and it came well packaged and in a timely manner. However, when I opened it, instead of seeing the blue version like the picture, and the sound track like the one in the description, I had a tan/beige cover with a shorter track list. After inspecting it, I realized I have received the special edition. It is sealed, and in excellent condition (no bent corners, no runs in plastic seal) but is not what was advertised. As this is a present for someone else, it is yet to be determined whether this is a great surprise or a bad mistake.****Update****As hoped, the present turned out to be a great surprise. The person receiving the present had neither edition and was excited to have the vinyl of such a great artist. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd to add to your collection","review":"I loved the extra tracks in this CD. Also loved the slow and dance tunes. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like A Forbidden Fruit","review":"I got this special edition hoping to find some pleasures in the mixes. I think you'd be better off saving money buying the single album version. This album is great in many ways, but not like PvD's older style. When I first heard Forbidden Fruit, I was determined to find out more about PvD...For one, there's more vocals on this album, featuring Jahn Johnston, whose voice is ok. You should check out the beautiful voice of Justine Suissa in Armin van Buuren's 76 album. If you are a die hard fan of trance, her voice will captivate you! Those who really liked PvD's trance-like music would find this album refreshing and different. There's certainly a mixture between pop, trance, dance, and hard progressive beats. The best songs are Homage, Connected, Spellbound, and Kaleidoscope."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unsatisfied with product","review":"i have written several times requesting to return the merchandise. i received a the CD reflections by Paul Van Dyk, and it is a double disc set. well, i received two number 2 discs and not number one. the reason i decided to purchase this CD is because of the music contained on disc number 1. i have yet to receive any thing from media crazy. all i asked for was the disc number 1 to be sent to me. i did not want my money, but i have not received anything from them. now, i do want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrub Dog of Alaska","review":"Book was a turning point in my youth that I was excited to share with my family.

My old grill was made of steel and aluminum and was a total pain to clean. So, I thought this TFAL, with non-stick surface would be the answer to my prayers. I was wrong. Not only did the chicken breasts I was grilling stick to the grill, but the marinade literally burnt onto the surface. After soaking the grill for hours, and with A LOT of elbow grease, I was able to get the darn thing clean. I called TFAL's consumer help line, and they told me that grilling with marinades was not recommmended, and that I should soak the grill in vinegar for a couple of hours to remove the burnt on mess. What is the point of having a non-stick grill if things stick to it? And whoever heard of grilling chicken without some kind of marinade? Save your money and pass up this loser. Mine is going back to Amazon and I will stick (pun intended) to my old grill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feasting Free on Wild Edibles","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It is broken down according to type of wild edible (ex. fruit, pot herb, salad, beverages, nuts, etc. The only thing I would change would be the layout under each plant. It's hard to discern where the recipes are because they are incorporated right into the paragraph. It would be nice if the recipes were titled and had lists of ingredients and then directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah!","review":"This is a really mediocre book with even more mediocre line drawings and the layout is poor. The \\"recipes\\" are integrated in narrative style right into the same area of the book that contains botanical information about the plant. The book also contains useless information about what Native Americans did with the plant 150 years ago. Personally, I find it very hard to identify plants from simple, black and white drawings, particularly when said drawings are small and not very good, and most particularly when it is a plant I intend on eating! I am really sorry I purchased this book, but I purchased it together with another book called \\"The Forager's Harvest\\" by Samuel Thayer which is, by contrast, EXCELLENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, one of the BEST stories on the subject ever!","review":"This is one of the most powerful and amazing stories written about the Holocaust. The first-person account of Mr. Gordon's experiences as a horror, the despair, the fear, the brutality that was the Holocaust. Mr. Gordon, in his own words, takes you from the very doors of the Auschwitz gas chamber, through the war years where his spirit and his determination to survive were the only things he could fall back on. This is an incredibly vivid portrayal that rivals (and in some cases surpases) any similar book or movie on the subject. It is required reading for anyone who seeks a definitive understanding of the subject. It is written in clear and simple language which also makes it an ideal teaching text for junior high and high school aged students"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fantastic read, recommended for all students","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I'm not religious or Jewish, but this book tells it all about how humankind can succumb to the worst of circumstances and yet still find meaning in life to go on. This book is about how a Regime can take control of a continent overnight and about how war can create enemies of us all. I'm a 42 year old white female American who finally has an understanding of hatred in a way that I never did before. Everyone should read this book. I cried through the last chapters recognizing a young boy's freedom at last. It's a must read for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first biography","review":"This book was so inspiring and real. I just read it in my middle school english class. The pain and enduring was very descriptive, and it's really sad to know that what you're reading actually happened. I'll definitly be reading more biographies and nonfictions in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important history, poorly written","review":"This is important reading. Unfortunately, the narration wasso poorly written it was hard to keep going.

I am unhappy none the less about getting a book that is completely different from the book and pages shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?!?!?!?!","review":"I didnt like it. And I usually like movies that are psychological. It was just disturbing seeing animals decapitate. SPOILER And why would someone want their leg taken off to be symmetrical? Just a weird movie. I thought some of it was okay, but overall I didnt like it. I am a film student so I had to watch this movie for film class, besides that I would have probably never watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"existentialism in motion","review":"EVERYTHING in this film is deliberate and meaningful, in contrast to life, or the view thereof it offers, anyway. everything to be shown or heard in this film can be interpreted in any number of ways and all of them are intriguing. the characters are way out there and yet the seem to be actualizations of things we've all contemplated, only abstracted and made ridiculously absurd. the composition and lighting all seems bizarre and unworldly, yet there's no reason we couldn't see any of these scenes exactly in the real world. the film's one weakness, if it can be called one, is that it is rather inaccessible. after multiple viewings, the whole picture eventually comes together and i have appreciated it more every time. if you're looking to just kick back for a bit and shut your brain down, though, this film will be an awful drudgery and seem rather pointless. maybe that's what greenaway is getting at, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly abstract, bizarre study of life/death/decay","review":"A visually striking film focusing on the zoological fascination that two brothers have on birth, life, death and decay. Not the meaning of life and death but the physical properties of existence and non-existence. Although there is some male and female frontal nudity in this film, there are no sex scenes as such. The dialogue vibrates between being witty and tedious. A slow moving film proceeding towards an inevitable conclusion. There are only a few people to whom I could recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very twisted","review":"This movie is very twisted and very humorous in a odd sort of way. I did like it to a point, but at times it was very hard to follow. It was a movie of depth and philosophical meanings. When you are about to watch this movie, be prepared to see decaying animals. If you like a movie with alot of meanings, then see this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgia","review":"As a boy scout many years ago I used to entertain our troop on camping trips by reciting skits from Shelly Berman, Bob Newhert, Bill Cosby and others.

Luckily, I had a social studies teacher who had several copies he'd lend to students. Once read, never forgotten! Armour's humor motivates readers to read and learn. If you already know the facts he's satirizing, you'll giggle and guffaw. If you DON'T have the foggiest idea about the subject, you'll darn well WANT to learn about it so you can appreciate the humor. I had a few Armour books in my classroom library when I was a teacher, but sadly, the books have disappeared over the years. Now it's time to search for replacements online. Onward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious---not for feminists","review":"Feminists will probably hate this book. Not too surprising, considering that they are full of hate. This hilarious book briefly looks at several famous women (Cleopatra, Catherine the Great, etc.) in history and you will laugh every step of the way. Beware: his puns will make you groan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable vocalizing!","review":"I purchased this rather over-resonant recording for the glory of the singing of Peter Anders. His voice in the Strauss songs is truly heroic and of the caliber and nuance that is not heard today. Here is a glimpse of the kind of vocal delivery that Strauss expected in his orchestral songs - an interpretation that is passionate and urgent, not fussy or over- interpreted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"Ajami is a really interesting look at Israeli society. Showcasing the gritty side of Israel, outside the glitzy buildings of Tel Aviv and the religious plurality of Jerusalem, this film shows the tougher side of Jaffa and the struggles of Jewish and Arab residents and how their paths cross towards the end. I think this film is great for those who are interested in Israeli society and the interaction between both Arabs and Jews. The plot can be a little choppy due to its chapter system, but in the end, it finishes well and makes you think hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film, seemingly forgotten by general public","review":"I don't think it got nearly as much press as some of the other nominees, but it definitely deserved its nomination and other awards. I loved the blend of Arabic and Hebrew as well as the contrasting landscpaces and storylines facing the film's characters. One important feature that viewers shouldn't overlook is the acting. None of the actors in the film had any acting expreience prior to filming. That's right. No one. Moreover, most of the film's scenes were heavily improvised, so the actors' dialogue and emotionals are raw. This made the film seem so much more like a documentary than a movie. It had it's light moments; I laughed a few times, but this film is heavy and not for the faint of heart. Still, if I were you, I wouldn't shy away from seeing this powerful piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"romantic book","review":"I enjoy to read that fantastique book.it speak about the short life of the last Napoleon called l'Aiglon.

I shopped around and looked at other shelves, and this one fell in between ones that were more professional and expensive than we desired, and those that were way too flimsy. I also considered purchasing some smaller shelves but decided they were bit expensive for the use I intended, so decided to wait until these had arrived. When they did, I was so surprised! I expected them to be good, but the are GREAT. Very sturdy and the quality is quite apparent. They were easy to assemble, with clear and concise directions, extra parts, a warranty, and even a product registration. They are worth twice the price, and now I will be purchasing several more for all of my storage needs. A great product I would recommend to anyone - I have already shown it off to several friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This is just a one page summary of Hank jr's discography, birthdates, divorces, etc. Hardly a 'biography'. $9.95 for a 4 minute 'read' of dates?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rejuvinating the soul","review":"I purchased this book at a local book store in the West End Mall in Atlanta Georgia. I literally travelled with this book for weeks reading a page here and a page there until I was assigned a book report for one of my MBA classes. I found this book to be more than interesting. Its one of those books you dont lend out and always keep around on your shelf. I thoroughly enjoy reading about successful black women their accomplishments and contributions to society and their advancement in the corporate world. I am one of those professional women who have a burning desire to succeed and advance in my career and after reading the interviews and experiences of some of our very own I was deeply inspired.

A travesty.I own the LaserDisc version and live in HK. I have seen poor quality Chinese Video CDs - 1990s technology. They are better.Every scene in which there is any fast movement or action degenerates into a set of poorly resolved blocks of digital noise. And this in a black and white film.I could do far better myself.The engineering of the transfers is incompetent.This should not be on sale.Perhaps the Coppolas will reissue their version, weak though it is, to avoid it being sucked down by this Korean failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad service","review":"I didnt get any issues yet since October very disappointed .I contacted them and they told me that they will ship it and until now nothing came."},{"rating":"1","title":"For $5 it was fine, but wouldn't renew again","review":"Not my sort of magazine.

The manager at Compusa, warned me that Sony won't consider it a defect unless there were at least 20 dead pixels in the center of the screen, so if the second unit is defective he couldn't do any thing for me.

But a novel with a one-dimensionally insufferable character whose transformation makes him one-dimensionally selfish violent and cruel just won't work magic.

Don't read this book.As said in other reviews, it is backstory.Grim backstory.For the dark side. But who cares? Are we not supposed to be connected to our stories. Don't we want some conclusion that leaves us with peace. Here we have something that fills in a gap that did not need it.Turtledove is a historian first and maybe something nagged at him to write it, but it makes Videssos seem less than it was before this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed when reading this novel. The characters seem to be very shallow in comparison to the Legion novels and even the follow on Krispos and Time of Trouble novels. The type of dialogue between the characters is stiff. The author needs to re-read his Legion novels and get back to that style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil can be plain boring","review":"The main character here is a prelate transferred from Videssos the city to an outlying province, who is gradually corrupted by Skelos.

The only value this book brought me is that it at least took me in the mindset of a man who lived before i was born and i enjoyed some of the old terminology that was used. But i can pretty much sum up every chapter for you as: i ran into a peasant today and he told me he saw a fairy once...end of chapter. none of the stories build on each other and they are all short with not much meaning behind them. Don't waste your hard earn money on this book. I understand WB Yeates to be one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, but i was not impressed. I will continue to search for a good book to read about Irish myths and folklore, but i highly recommend for those new and interested in Norse mythology to read: Children of Odin by Padriac Colum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for what it is - Very Hard to Learn","review":"O.K. I bought this some months ago on a colleague's recommendation. After a few DAYS of going through and trying to create a site I had a mediocre, confusing bunch of mish-mash. So I went back to square one for a few MORE DAYS. This software is really not for visual thinkers. If you are an artist or creative type - Dreamweaver's not for us. After a couple of weeks I tried FrontPage - it's worse.I finally found a more visual and intuitive program called Net Objects Fusion 7, which I also have reviewed.If you want to look at and learn complicated code without really seeing what's happening Dreamweaver is for you. For the more creative or artistic types or if you don't want to learn all the complex code I would recommend NetObjects Fusion 7.

Other reviewers are right...Dreamweaver has become bloat-ware with too many features no true web-professional needs.Once upon a time I loved Dreamweaver. It was a great code editor with a simple to use FTP client. But, I've had enough; Dreamweaver MX crashes on me 4X a day on average. I'm going in search of a clean and simple code editor. If I can find one that has some kind of code complete feature for XHTML, CSS and ASP.net, so much the better.Furthermore, thanks to WYSIWYG editors, I fear that too many developers out there don't really know what they are doing anymore. If you're a novice, here is my advice: learn to hand-code XHTML & CSS for your front-end web development and embrace W3C web standards.

[Among HTML Pro's failings: it defaults to .... names, it loses your graphics, the styles ..., the whole look of pages is unprofessional, it ... ah, forget it].Money was at stake, so I bought Dreamweaver MX. Now, I'm not saying it was very, very simple. I did have to look at the manual briefly (30 minutes) to come to terms with its approach.

If you want to make a website, go get yourself a book about html, later php and asp. If you make a website yourself in pure html, you exactly know what you're doing opposite to dreamweaver.

From the fascinating history of the development of scientific theory and experiment to the philosophic implications arising from the latest and most respected scientists of our own times, Dr. Schaefer not only leads us in a comprehensive review of scientific thought and practice, but then goes on to lead us to ask the same questions for ourselves - Do YOU see the evidence for God?

Schaeffer tackles the question of the coherence between Christianity and science with the refreshing honesty and intellectual rigor of a first class physical scientist -- applying it equally to scientific evidence and Biblical interpretations in a way that will help students of science think through these issues for themselves.The book manages to capture the electricity of Schaefer's public lectures to a university lecture hall of packed full of students.

Tony has been able to dicern between many different types of physiologies and target nutrition programs which are specifically for each one. Tony's book has become standard reading for my clients and has helped significantly to take the guesswork out of nutritional programming for them.

This book is not for helping you change your habits over the long-term, but it interesting because it gives you a range of options should you need to lose weight quickly.

It is pretty much physically impossible to lose 5 pounds a week unless you are morbidly obese and totally starving, which is not healthy, nor is it realistic over the long term.

Wayne and his crew of sharp shooters and africa tribe people go and capture animals that are order from zoos in the United States. yet, still Wayne has to put up with a female photgrapher that the Indian gave permission to come to Africa to take photo's of the crew and what they do. Two questions need to be answered in the classic. First can this crew get the animals that are order without getting hurt and the second question is what will the crew do after the season over. I like this movie just for the fact that I will never make it to Africa and this was as close as I would get. I give this movie 5 wessel stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine 'Duke' Wayne Safari pic that blows Clint 'what's-his-names' 'White Hunter, Black Heart' away!","review":"Since Clint has gone 'politicallystupid' lately with his last five orseven lousy pics, it's time to watchthe original best US male actor!

I've seen everyone of his movies and repeatedly you will see many of the same people over and over again. Hitari was filmed in Africa and the scenery is beautiful. His relationship with each character developes creatively as the movie progresses. I loved the movie.

Hatari has a great cast, and an excellent script and footage of the animals is fantastic. But I'm glad animals are no longer collected for zoos in this way. Nevertheless this is a fun movie, and I have enjoyed it everyone of the (at least) 20 times I've seen it over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Splendid","review":"Some movies are simply a joy to be in the presence of. Hatari! is one of these. As in practically every other Hawks movie, the characters are cool and subtle in their delivery and interaction with one another, and while a first-time viewer will marvel at the wildlife action shots and the African scenery, the reason one will return to the movie is to see the performances of Hardy Kruger, John Wayne, Elsa Martinelli, and Red Buttons, and how they interact together throughout. A very cute and pleasant and entertaining movie. I've seen it countless times."},{"rating":"2","title":"HATARI JOHN WAYNE","review":"This was one of the \\"Duke's\\" best movies, in my opinion.

I would learn the forms in class, and just have to remember them. I often wished for a quick review as I was preparing for a belt test.Now that I am not actively practicing TaeKwonDo, but a different Korean Martial Art, it has still been important to demonstrate my previous knowledge of TKD forms. This DVD makes for an excellent review, and Master Kim has excellent form that you can use to correct or alter your movements. As has been pointed out on previous reviews, it does not teach the proper technique for different strikes, blocks and footwork/stances, it merely demonstrates them. As such, it is not a replacement for learning the poomsae in class, but it will greatly accelerate your ability to learn and remember them (even when you want to relearn them years later!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but...","review":"The content of the video is technically correct but layout and quality of the video leaves allot to be desired. The editing of the DVD is wrong the video of the first form is actually Taegueg 2 not 1.

It's a great way to review each poomse at home so you don't have to spend a lot time bothering the higher ranking students in your class for help when you forget a movement. I use it to practice each new form as I learn it from my instructor and to review all of my lower belt forms for testing. The different views (front, side, rear, etc) make it easy to see the movements and Master Kim's performance is top notch. Just don't let anyone borrow your copy or you'll have to nag them to get it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on point!","review":"Great video. Follows the Taegeuk Poomses perfectly.

Perhaps he was buried too long in the Basie band for his own good.Everything and everyone here swings, from the opening choruses of \\"Your Only as Old as You Look\\" through the title tune, and than some. Foster's playing is full or lyricism and clearly reveals the influence Coltrane had on him. The rhythm section is excellent and not only beautifully supports Foster, but never attempts to upstage him. Exemplary of the seemless blend that exists here is the work on \\"Leo Rising.\\"Speaking of relative unknowns that warrant more exposure, where has pianist Stephen Scott been? Christian McBride and Lewis Nash are, of course, well known, and clearly validate their reputations with this session.There is not a weak cut or filler on this disc, which is one outstanding recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice, but had problems, and is pricey","review":"I love the exterior look of the poduct, but the product has not worked correctly from Day one, (The display has black dots all over it, my son said they were dead pixels?

Needless to say after going to the Sony service center 3 times now and not having enough time to wait to drop it off we took the monitor back wheere we bought it, not from Amazon.com. I purchased another brand for alot less and it has worked flawlessly right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought the Sony because it looked as if the screen images were better at the store. But when I set it up I got a bright white ghosting around all the letters, especially on a white background. Also, it seems to be a little soft around the edges of the screen. There are some areas of the screen where a word seems soft and right next to it is a word that is very sharp. It's a pain but I'm thinking of packing it back up and returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of buying from SONY!","review":"I bought the HS93 model from the internet. I had several BRIGHT always on pixels from the very first day. It was centrally located, and very annoying. I tried to return the monitor to the internet vendor, but they told me to call Sony directly. Apparently this is Sony enforced policy. So, I called Sony and they said that unless there was 8 (EIGHT) pixels always ON, they would not replace or refund the monitor!!!The monitor was made in Malaysia, and, I bet they mass produce the monitors with minimal quality control.I got so upset, that I bought another LCD monitor (Envision) at the local Fry's Electronics. It was cheaper and the color was more natural. You loose the natural tones due to Sony's high contrast, so, pictures don't look normal.Buyer beware.... check and confirm return policies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony quality in doubt","review":"This is a beautiful monitor but it went black after 1 week.

He has created an intriguing tale, well drawn characters and a wonderful vacation from reality - all of which make for a fabulous, can't put it down kind of read.This book follows Franklin Flyer, named after the train he was on that crashed when he was a newborn, from 1939 through to the later years in his life. From New York City to Europe and back. Each chapter is a year in Franklin's life and each year brings new and interesting characters and exploits.The first chapter introduces you to Franklin and quickly sucks you in, giving you some enigmatic thoughts to keep in mind while reading the book. Christopher once again delves into the topics of fate, destiny and luck and manages to wrap up each and every question and plot line that he introduces Franklin and the reader to. While not as spellbinding as his previous novels, Veronica and A Trip to the Stars, Franklin Flyer is certainly worth reading and enjoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Magical","review":"Franklin Flyer is composed with shallow plots and minimal character development akin to the ideas behind 'March' or 'Gob's Grief' maybe even 'The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay' but the story was executed poorly and hardly worth finishing.

Neither has the experimental novel. New works in both fields are now exercises in genre. In that sense, the author's Our Ecstatic Days is simply another novel off the assembly line. Like a new one from Sue Grafton or Tom Clancy, except painful. I enjoy Erickson's journalism, but ended the futile exercise of attempting this novel after 100 or so excruciating pages. There is an audience for this sort of fiction. Unfortunately for Erickson and his publisher, in a nation of 280 million there are probably only a few hundred such literary masochists.

It did no good. I let the cake cool in the pan and went to take it out. WOW! This came out in clumps... no matter how I tried, it would not come out clean and pretty, which was the reason behind using this pan in the first place.

Manages to pack a good deal of information into such a small space. Needs some more practical advice. Instead of \\"wood shavings,\\" for bedding, it'd be nice if the author pointed out that pine shavings help keep the odor down. Also, neglects systems of raising mice in large quantities. This would be good for reptile keepers who raise feeders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin Video Bus II","review":"I would rate this product ZERO stars, but this format does give me the choice.

The sheer quality of the music on this CD has restored my faith in music and young up coming bands.I have two favourite songs on the record. Revolution in the summertime, and The Loser. The whole album is total genius but these two are in a different stratosphere, as good as it gets.The Loser is my favourite song of all time.I could go on and on and on but you'd be better to listen for yourself.Enjoy it folks, while it lasts as bands like this usually burn out quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotland...or SanFrancisco 1967?","review":"Very cool music. Reminiscent of the Byrds at their best. Jangly guitars and laid back lyrics. I LOVE the sounds.

She does a great job of playing with the fact the two main characters look identical, yet come from different worlds, and when they switch places so much exciting, fun stuff happens! I also love it because it's a romance novel, but full of drama and not quite political intrigue, but the intrigue of \\"politics\\" among the filthy rich. The back cover says that \\"Gossip Girl\\" fans would like this book, and I'd say so because of the whole rich world versus poor world thing--but also because it's got great plot twists and turns, and I'd wager to say characters that are just as fun and developed (if not more) than GG's! And, as always, Wann's drawings of men and women are simply gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value SDC I can find","review":"The Sennheiser e614 is a great SDC, I have primarily used it for recording acoustic guitars, but it made a great job of recording percussion - it delivers a really natural sound.Over the years I have used many condenser microphones from Octava MK012, through AKG to the quintessential Neumann KM84. To me, the sound of this mic is more akin to the Neumann KM84 than any of other value mics I have used. It provides a really warm sound without the over emphasized highs I have heard from many other SDCs in this price range. The sound remains very detailed with no obvious signs of smearing. I was worried that the Supercardioid design would be a problem but I did not notice excessive proximity effect, rather it did a good job of minimizing room sound.This is one mic that will stay in my mic arsenal, its really good value and a does what so few mics do well, it accurately copies the sound being recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to painting","review":"My son and his daughter painted these two pictures together.

Don't believe it! In this new edition, Keirsey wisely elaborates on the important distinctions between his theory and Jungian \\"elementalism.\\" He also distinguishes important terms that are interchangeable in everyday speech (e.g., the SP's \\"excitement\\" vs. the NF's \\"enthusiasm\\"). His new book is considerably thicker than the earlier one, but it's worth it: complex ideas require space for clarification. Judgments of this kind are subjective, of course, but I also found Keirsey's description of my particular temperament to be more accurate in the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ULTIMATE theory of personality","review":"I wish that I could give Please Understand Me II much more than five stars in this forum because such a rating does not do justice to this astouding work. Vastly superior to the excellent first version, II expands upon the ongoing research into temperament psychology with the most cogent and cohesive structure that I've seen in any book in the field. In short, IT ROCKS!!! Keirsey's volume has given me invaluable insight into the workings of the people around me that most people take a lifetime to achieve. My friends and relatives are utterly sick of hearing me talk about this book, but I just can't keep myself from applying the things that I've learned from the book to everyday life. As for claims that the book is hard to understand, if you can pass 11th grade English you shouldn't have any trouble with PUMII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the original","review":"The major difference between the original and version II is that the author and his followers have turned the subject matter into a kind of religion in version II. Like all religions, it needs to have many layers and become more mysterious and require interpretation from its clergy. Feh. The first book was clear and to the point. This new and improved version is needlessly complex and bulky. Mr. Kiersey, next time, just change the color of the cover and use bigger type font if you need more pages. I rate the original with 4.5 stars...this version gets a 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never read the first one.","review":"I never read \\"Please Understand Me\\" and really had no clue what the Meyers-Briggs personality test was prior to a chance encounter with a test by the author.

Maybe there are other books on the subject that are more informative and/or are easier to read. All I know is that this book in one week answered questions that I had agonized over for years. For that reason I am recommending it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Recent Definitive Guide to Personality","review":"Keirsey's book is the most recent definitive guide to personality theory.

I can deal with technical manuals (I used to write them for a living and have a graduate degree) without any problem, but bad writing just can't be overcome or rationalized away.Take the test online, read the distilled version of your personality type on the page(s) that follow(s), and never pick up this book if you care about your sanity and/or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge help if working with people","review":"This book could be a huge help in understanding people behavior and motivation. I bought this book for my Project Management class but it is essential information for anyone who works with people or wants to understand human factor.

Understanding and applying knowledge can help to avoid personality related pitfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you really do want to understand other points of view","review":"I have loved reading this book. I was stuck home for while and found an old battered copy of the first 'Please Understand me\\" - I was hooked. It is filled with nuggets of insight and has changed how I perceive the behavior of others. It has been great to be able to rethink people's behavior that bothered/upset/hurt me as operating with a different set of priorities and tendencies. It has also helped me manage how I relate to different people, minimizing some tensions (at least on my part).I am encouraging everyone to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings insight into the elaborate world of personalities","review":"At first I was hesitant in buying the book, I was skeptical of whether it measured to my expectations and whether I would learn from reading it. I knew my personality type before purchasing the book, so when I got it in the Kindle app I jumped right through the NT section. I liked the organization and the elaborative explanation, the multiple sections, including a chapter about parents and children and how their personality type influences them. Overall I couldn't stop reading the book, wrote multiple notes and highlighted it. I have read it multiple times and its definitely a book that I will have, reread, and keep learning from. Definitely worth the purchased if this is your first book in personality types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex, and Hard to Read","review":"I found the new version of Please Understand Me to be hard to read, written in a very academic language. What made this book very easy to understand was a companion title I purchased called Understanding Yourself and Others, An Introduction to Temperament, by Linda V. Berens, Ph.D.. This book simplified the ideas in Please Understand Me II, but did not lose the richness of the concepts. I recommend purchasing it with Please Understand Me II, it is only $4.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"A great book and a fun jab in Americas ribs, especially during the Bush years. Some of the satire was a bit cliche but fun nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helprin looses it half way through.","review":"This book started off great, with subtle jabs at the Royalty, Parliament, etc. As it progressed, it became outrageously silly to the point that by mid-book I wondered why I was wasting my time. Helprin can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"moderately amusing but tedious","review":"The first third of this book is hilarious, but once the characters are stripped of their endearing pettiness, fumbling, and other hang-ups, the book becomes weighed down by long-winded, anticlimactic speeches and descriptions. Helprin may have had good intentions, but after a while it started to feel he was hitting me over the head with a two-by-four inscribed with the words, \\"WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A KING?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"I am a passionate fan of Helprin's since I first read Winter's Tale as a child. I am still haunted by the extraordinary imagery of his previous novels and short stories. F&F is not a terrible book in an absolute sense, but compared to his past work it is a huge disappointment: a parody and a farce, worthwhile art forms of course but far from the most noble. This is not even that funny a farce. The \\"important\\" themes of nobility, leadership and love are not well served by the broad comedy, and the comedy isn't that funny when set against such themes. To me this book is a spectacular failure, and a shock coming from an author who has been note-perfect in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and not nearly as funny as it wants to be","review":"What a waste of talent. Mark Helprin has done brilliant work in the past, but here he squanders his gifts on self-indulgent farce. Imaginative, yes, but that in itself is not a virtue, when the imagination leads him to take a lame joke (for example, an argument between the intellectual Freddy, a/k/a Prince Charles, and the dimwit Fredericka, or Princess Diana, as to whether she has one bosom or two) and spin it out for pages and pages. His view of the British royals is not entirely mean-spirited, but nor does it seem terribly well-informed. As one reviewer pointed out, the characterization of Fredericka owes more to press reports about Paris Hilton than it does to any real understanding of Diana. There are occasional flashes of wit and insight, but not enough for a book half the size of this one. I hope the next novel from Helprin will be worth waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Do not let the slow beginning of Freddy and Frederika deter you, truckin through IS worth it. I cannot stop recommending this read. Helprin did an excellent job of combining humour with what I consider to be relevant social commentary. After the first 100 pages or so, the book flows so well I had trouble putting it down. I look forward to picking up Helprin's earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freddy and Fredericka by Mark Helprin","review":"The first twenty or so pages led me to believe that a great imagination might once again be at work. I have slogged through half the book, based upon the belief that a great writer must produce great works and the next page would justify my perseverance but sadly, this is one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read.Much of the dialog and repetitive scenarios, appear to be mindless, pointless and definitely very difficult to imagine as credible at any level.I find it hard to give the book to anyone as I cannot recommend anyone read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very desperately in need of an edit","review":"I am sad to agree with the reviewer that said this was one of the worst books he/she had tried to read, because I was so excited to buy this book - from the description on the back to the enthusiastic one-liners from newspapers sprinkling the cover. It even started out nicely, with enormous promise in the first 15 pages or so, but ever since I have found almost every page painful to read. It is as if someone had a really elaborate dream they decided to write down ... nothing makes any sense, nothing seems to really drive the plot forward, and what could have been a fun premise instead is just words, words, words and even more words. It seems like it should be funny, it seems like a great idea, but none of it translates into anything with any real logic or that makes me want to read more about these characters and their adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I am half way through \\"Freddy and Fredericka\\" and don't know if I will finish it, except to read the ending. The review of the book in our local newspaper, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, was funnier than the book has been. I was laughing so hard over the review that I had tears running down my cheeks; that hasn't happened with the book, because its length seems to reduce the humor to silliness. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"No title.","review":"Mark Helprin is capable of writing some of the most elegant prose in contemporary fiction. He can make anything he describes sing with life. That is his strength. But he is no humorist and is out of his depth when he tries to be witty. He is alternately earnest and silly in this novel. The wordplay and puns are facile and make his more heartfelt observations, where he reverts to type, seem cringingly inappropriate. Freddy and Fredericka may have been a lark to write, but it is not all that much fun to read. I was distracted by Helprin's self-indulgence almost all the way through. At least the author had a good time. I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle price more than paperback price - really???","review":"I am a Kindle user and will not be buying this book because the Kindle edition is more expensive than the paperback. Come on publishers - does it really cost more to produce a Kindle version than it does to produce and distribute a paperback?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, a long winded and tedious read","review":"This is the first book I have read by Mark Helprin, and I suspect it will be the last. Although there were bits that were genuinely clever, for the most part the book tried too hard to be witty and failed in the attempt. The characters, all of them, were annoying to the point of distraction and it felt as though you could have read about every other page and not missed a thing as it rambled on and on. I was really looking forward to reading this book and it was such a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fierce & Humorous Satire","review":"This was a good book due to Helprin's obvious intelligence in constructing a fierce and humorous political and class satire. This novel skewers western politics and society. Freddy & Fredericka was laugh out loud funny in many parts. While not one who minds lengthy tomes, this one could have been a tad bit shorter for my liking. By the end of the 500+ pages I was a bit tired of Freddy & Fredericka, despite their charm and humorous exploits. Overall, a smart and extremely funny novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving Up!","review":"I've been trying to read this book for over three months and have only gotten through about 75 pages. It's wordy, tends to steer off-topic, and just does not hold my attention.There are funny parts, no doubt, and I've found myself laughing out loud at a few of them. But it's not good when I open the book each evening and forget what I'd read the night before.My boyfriend is a big Helprin fan, so I was excited to delve into this novel, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to shelve it for now. Maybe someday I'll have the patience to pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"cracked up a lot","review":"I really enjoyed the time spend reading this one. It was comic relief in a world that often takes itself too seriously. As Americans we are only exposed to royalty and their antics through the tabloids, and in this novel we find that the tabloids have probably been reporting too seriously on their royal quarry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book.","review":"I loved it. It is perhaps the silliest book I have ever read, but then I turn a page and it moves me profoundly. It is very long, but well worth it, especially if you enjoy the Marx Brothers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh too deep to be audible","review":"Sometimes a book delivers laughs that start so deep in your bosom and is so satisfying that you feel like you need a cigarette afterwards. Although Helprin at times falls into the 'Tom Robbins too darn clever for your own good' school of humor, there are moments of pure genius that make you desperately search your lonely room for someone to read it aloud to. Alas, my black lab does not share my sense of humor and I was left with merely a 'hrrumph'. So please read this book, make it a best seller, raise Mark Helprin up to the lofty heights to which he belongs. Also,if you haven't done so already, run don't walk to read A winter's tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment for a Helprin Fan","review":"Helprin has become increasingly silly and has, it seems, lost his touchstone. Even where he attempts to rhapsodize about human existence in Freddy and Fredericka, he is too verbose and misses the mark. It is not horrible, but it is not great literature, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant surprise","review":"I have read all of Mr Helprin's books and I have to say that Winter's Tale remains my favorite. However, F&F; is such a delightful read I couldn't put it down. I don't think it is too long as other reviewers have indicated; my interest was captured from beginning to end. His characters, as usual, are deftly drawn and his amazing descriptive abilities are at the forefront once again. It was a long wait but well worth it.(Also, check out 'The Pacific,' his latest (and I think best) collection of short stories.)

However, it really never gets to that level. The story takes place in a hospital with a very special little girl causing tragedies to those she percieves as a threat. But, many of the deaths she causes are for reasons that are not clearly explained. A quick read but a not particularly engaging one.

It's as if an amateur recorded this CD on a computer, using Nero, and forgot to tick the \\"no pause between tracks\\" box! What a terrible blunder! This utterly ruins one's listening experience! Shame on the ones who have recorded this CD and on the ones who are making people pay for the privilege of listening to this recording full of interruptions!

The actual test covered much more than this book did. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"About 20% useful","review":"I'm a college professor and two of my advisees studied this book before taking the Ed Psych CLEP.

This CLEP study guide for Introduction to Educational Psychology cover less than half of the material on the actual exam. Now if you read all of the reviews on this page you will read all kinds of different things. Some of the earlier reviews seem to say that this CLEP test is a slam dunk if you study this review. It may be that the questions on the actual CLEP test have somehow been updated because this book does not cover the material on the current CLEP test all. If you have never taken a CLEP test before you might want try an easier CLEP test first such as Principles of Marketing so that you can have success on your very first CLEP test. If you keep taking CLEP tests like these and keep flunking them when you finally do pass a CLEP test you are going to feel like Thomas Edison when he invented the light bulb after 10,000 unsuccessful tries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Really good book...I didn't know I had to take a CLEP until a week before the exam, so I rushed out and grabbed this book.

It fits the laptop perfectly, as you would expect, and is well-padded to keep the computer protected. Unfortunately, there is very little space for anything else in the case. I assumed that the advertised space for an extra battery would accomodate the AC adapter, and although you can cram it in there, it's not a good fit at all so I prefer carrying it separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not visually appealing","review":"To be inspired to cook, I like to have a well presented cookbook with a photo of each dish. I didn't find this book very inspiring for two reasons. Firstly, although the cover photo is very appealing, the photos inside the book are fuzzy. It looks like they were taken using the kind of fuzzy photographic filter which was fashionable in the 90s. I find this style really irritating. Secondly, the print is very small, and uncomfortable to read. These factors may not bother some people, but for me they really spoilt the book.

I find no fault with the performances, but I would term it \\"mild-mannered\\" in contrast to other performances by other ensembles that I have heard. If played in the background, this CD is unlikely to capture anyone's attention; and that may be completely proper--this music might have been performed simply as background or incidental to other goings-on.

You may like this film if you enjoyed the movie, DEADFUL MELODY, because it has a simple plot,poor dialog, poorly-executed story, yet dazzling fighting scenes.

The suggestions for discipline didn't begin to touch on the special needs for these children and things that really can be done to help them. Some of the essays negated research findings without providing any evidence. For example, research has shown for a long time that diet doesn't impact ADD. This was disproved by numerous studies over 30 years ago. This book reflects the feeling of some people on these issues. It has some really far out ideas, like these children come from another planet. I don't believe my daughter comes from another planet.

ADD, ADHD and Aperger's Syndrome are real problems that our kids face. Yes, I agree that kids today are not like we were, but doesn't every generation make that staid observation? The world moves faster every day and then we are shocked that our children struggle to keep up. Anyone with a basic knowledge of the roots of ADD and ADHD knows that they are NOT disorders of a surplus of energy but are in fact the opposite, and profiteers are making money off of parents who don't know how to help these children learn.

Some of the writing was confusing and hard to understand. At times it was contracdictory. An Indigo child is this, but than in Indigo child is that. Really, it's based on what \\"color\\" the child is.? What does that mean? There must be some underlying theories that are behind some of this writing, but they are not explained.One idea is explained. That idea is that these children are from outer space!? This seems to refute the idea that ADD children have always been and have not been identified and also it refutes the other idea that ADD may be due to environmental factors. I don't know which if any is true, but I don't believe our children are from outer space!There are some writings here that are well written, but they don't give practical advice on ADD children or children with special needs. There are much better books out that deal with these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As a mother of a child with ADD, I was looking for fresh ideas and insight. I wanted tips for parenting, methods for understanding, and real ideas that might help. This book did not fulfill any of my goals. The main goal of this book is to sell the idea that these children come from another planet. There are no new tips or ideas in how to help these children. Although there is preaching about not using medication. My suggestion is that if you want real help, look somewhere else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"As an ADDult myself and a person who works with children I found this book to be very enlightening. However, this book is not for close-minded people. Some of the concepts and idea may seem a bit off the wall to some.I think those of us who spend time around ADDults or children with ADD know there is something different about them. This book looks at the differences as something postive instead of just dismissing it as a chemical imbalance in the brain. It is a very well written book with some great ideas and useful suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New age book on space aliens","review":"This book is about a \\"trekkie\\" new age philosophy toward children. This is not a parent guide on dealing with children. According to the writers, the Indigo children are children from another planet sent to earth to teach us how to love and introduce us into a new age. The \\"fine minds\\" the back cover describes the writers of these compositions, are believers in a metaphysical philosophy that we have space aliens living among us, mainly our children. This book does not deal with practical parenting issues.

Complete with feelings,channeling, spiritualism and wishful thinking. One of the posters summs it up when he claims to be an Indigo adult and finally discovered that he was not the problem but others were. This brilliant person also noted that society is dysfunctional-well, Golly!...the so-called Indigo children are supposedly noted for their egocentric behavior, impatience, strong feelings (as opposed to rational thought)and a dislike for any authority which their feelings cant tolerate. Isn't that wonderful-soon the world will be ruled by spoiled brats with autistic tendencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange book about children","review":"I picked this book up because I thought it might tell me something new about dealing with children, especially those with ADD. I was interested because my child has ADD. First, I couldn't figure out what Indigo meant. The articles in this book were very confusing. I think any parent could see their child as an Indigo child. However, as I read more I became shocked. The idea that our children are different because they are space aliens is pretty far out! It seems like the authors are not all here mentally! I realize that everyone is entitled to their beliefs. But let's be up front about it. The advice given on dealing with chldren was also disappointing. I'd recommend a more down to earth book for parents. Don't waste your time here unless you are a follower of this space aliens among us beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe in angels but........","review":"First, so you know where I am coming from, I do believe in angels, and in the importance of spiritual development of children. I believe all children are special and we need to learn to understand them. I thought that this book would be helpful. However, there is a mixture of quality in terms of the writing and presentation of ideas. I couldn't figure out what an Indigo child was from the essays. Some were incoherent. Some of the essays were well written, but offered nothing new in terms of a child's spiritual, learning or other development. When it came to the idea that some of these children are from outer space, another planet, I had to draw the line. I believe in God, angels, and spiritual intervention. This book misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"As a teacher I picked up this book and thought it may have some new approaches to helping kids. It does alright. According to this book, children with ADD or ADHD have come from another planet to prepare us for the new age. There are many techniques that are known to work and help these children, but this book doesn't go that far. It scratches the surface of how to really help these children and deals more with this our kids are from another planet philosophy. Unless you are into believing this idea that our children are aliens, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indigo Children ~ Super Sensitive Kids","review":"I'd like to refer anyone reading this comment to the reader who posted this review: The Quintessential Resource On Indigos, April 23, 2005...scroll back and take a look. They said everything perfectly! Why be redundant?I would like to clear up, though, the misconception that seems to be floating out there that these kids don't need boundaries, guidance. That's totally untrue. They DO. Moreso than the other children. These children need these things to grow up to be respectful adults. If not, they WILL grow up thinking it's a free for all. Yes, they are different..yes, they require tons more patience, but they are sooo worth it!I hate labels. Of any kind. ADD, ADHD...even Indigo, Crystal, Rainbow, etc. Personally, I feel these children should be called \\"Super Sensitive Kids\\". By that, I'm talking about their inner energy and needing to channel it properly; anyway, that is for another topic:~) Please read the book with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"no me gusto","review":"no me satisfiso la información del libro como concepto no específicamente del autor creo que hay información mas relevante con respecto a niños hiperactivos"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"Lee Caroll is great and I have enjoyed all the Kryon books. I have been working with challenging children for many years now and I am a little disappointed by the book. Although I am sure that the \\"Indigo Child \\" phenomenon exists, as I have witnessed it myself in my classroom, I found the book very simplistic and not properly supported by hard facts. Too many comments from people that are deeply into the new age movement talking about their own children being amzingly special..Don't we all think that of our own children? As a worker in the field I was looking forward to something a bit more substancial. Also beware of the \\"I am an Indigo Child \\" syndrome that seems to be developing in some spiritual circles, with claims of specialness and uniqueness. Aren't we all one? Isn't that what it is all about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only an alternative language","review":"This book basically describes the same people that Carl Jung discribed in Psycological Types. If you continue to read you will realize that these children have always been around in about 1%-5% of the population. Think about how society has changed and why these children are currently being labeled then do a little research about children like Einstein. You will find out that society today in general does not desire children like Einstein in our public schools. If you really want to understand your child and help him/her succeed in todays world continue to read and enlarge your languages. I recommend really learning about Myers Briggs Type Indicator and once you have learned the language (yes it's a bitter harder than giving people a color aura) try reading Nurture by Nature by Paul D.

On this disc, Ian Hobson does remarkably well in sorting out the myriad of polyphonic lines, juxta-position of complex rhythmic patterns--showing the listener that every note has its place and reason, and nothing is excessive, which it can easily seem in the hands of a lesser pianist. He does an admirable job of keeping a firm hold on the melodic line, but he is not perfect. Athough keeping his cool in his valiant, intriguing, and poetic efforts among these Herculian monstrosities, he can sometimes lack fluency. When this disc was first out, it served as a first release for many of the featured selections, and their performances have since faired quite well among increasing standards. Sound is good, if a bit boxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little stilted for my taste","review":"Ian Hobson deserves a lot of credit for bringing us a rare glimpse into these greatly under-rated works. I feel guilty only giving him 2 stars for his efforts.But then again he probably should've mastered the works more fully before recording them.The Godowsky Studies are famously difficult; there is no question about that. But Hobson sounds like he is still glued to the score. There are hesitations at the ends of phrases that sound unnatural and take away from the flow of the music.My overall impression is that he recorded these pieces before knowing them fully, and letting them mature properly. Hobson probably has what it takes from a technical perspective, but this CD is not musically satisfying.Also, the sound on the recording lacks the mellow, homogenous quality of the best piano recordings, which further reduces the pleasure. Perhaps he will re-record these works in better conditions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"FREAK'N SWEET GAME!","review":"This is about the most awesome game i have ever played!

Frayser Boy spits some tight rhymes to some clean azz beats on his first solo album. I especially enjoy this C.D. because it is a change from the rap you hear on the radio today.

Also, the price is far better for Honey Maid graham crackers than it is for Stacy's pita chips.In any case, these cinnamon graham crackers are a great substitute for Stacy's pita chips. The cinnamon crackers are a favorite of mine to grab as a snack with a tall glass of cold skim milk. They have a satisfying crunch to them when I bite into them, though I could do without the crumbs all over.

I gave up on this book and went back to old fashion work with my Bible and commentaries. I do not recommend this book for adult Sunday School teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book enjoyable to read and keeps your attention","review":"Reading this book as part of my school curriculum. This book is so amazing I don't want to put it down. I struggle understanding the old testament, it is dry and sometimes hard to inturpret...but this book reads like a novel.It really draws you into the OT characters and connects it to our current life events. This definitely draws you in, keeps your attention and keeps you wanting to read more. Awesome entertaining book while educating you in bible history. I will keep this book to read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightning - a must read for any Christian !","review":"This was a required read for a college class, but has soon turned into one of my favorites. Dr. Hindson has a true God given talent to bring the beautiful stories and lessons of the Old Testament to life. His pure and easy word flow only adds to this treasure of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vapid, yes...though totally fascinating...","review":"I can't help it. Even though I believe that the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor were probably two of the most self-serving people ever to exist on the face of the planet, I find them totally fascinating. And this book lets us into their domaine. Imagine a man so totally mesmerized by this woman, that not only did he leave her a fresh flower on her pillow every night of their married life, he slept surrounded by photos of her (separate bedrooms). There were 10,000 photos of them in his bathtub (covered with a mahogany top. He ONLY showered.) that were discovered after her death. That means for the duration of the time that they were married, they were photographed approximately 300 times a year. Every year. The photographs of the refurbished decor in the Paris house were fascinating. Too bad everything was sold after Dodi & Diana's death. This book is truly a window into a lifestyle that no longer exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a sneak peek into their very private world","review":"I was very impressed with the photography and the information contained in this book. Wallis Simpson is amazing, she comes off as more chic and more royal than any of the royals. Fascinating inside look into that very glamorous era, and it's most powerful couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much to pay for a couple with zero to offer","review":"It is beyond me how any person with a functioning brain could ever find the Windsors more than the most over publicized, most tedious couple who ever inhabited the pages of People Magazine and its predecessors. What is even more alarming is that there are people willing to pay $67.50 for a book of pictures of the duke, the duchess and their collection of stuff. Pardon me for my rant, but I needed to do it. I don't think I've ever typed out my feeings on this subject before. I've ranted about this couple more than I wish to admit.. but, hell, we all have our quirks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Moving Experience!","review":"As usual, The Bathroom Reader's Press has provided food for thought and and thought for digestion.

He has written a potted history of George whilst at the same time denigrating any of his friends/associates (eg Eric Clapton). The best piece of advice to anyone thinking of buying this book is \\"don't\\" - I only wish I had taken that advice...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Personal Editorial?","review":"Well, Elliot J. Huntley must not be interested in telling a concise history of George. His work sounds and feels like an editorial, with his personal thoughts all mixed in. If you just want to read more about the solo years of George then this book will infuriate you. He personally criticises most other artists George ever came into contact with or thought of as friends. Has he even listened to their music? He puts down Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, and many others. Now, this gets exhausting and stupid about two chapters in. I found myself getting very annoyed. However, it has loads of information hard to find on George's solo years. That is the only reason I gave this book two stars. One should think Mr. Huntley should stop writing books and actually go and sit down and listen to some decent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't purchased","review":"I couldn't get past his spiteful, sarcastic writing style.

My advice: BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best naturalist, creative non-fiction books ever.","review":"Loren Eiseley changed the nature of non-fiction writing, yet few have heard of him and his following is intensely loyal, but very small. First of all, this volumne will be a keeper for your library, but you'll find yourself giving it to people you respect. They will never return it. Not a book to be missed by any reader. Completely unaffected by the forty years since its publication, as powerful and wonderful as ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are few books as profound","review":"Years ago, I mentioned The Immense Journey to a friend who was at the time studying to become a Marriage, Family, and Child Counselor. We went our separate ways. When we met a few years later, after she had begun her practice, she told me that she had indeed read the book, and that she had recommended it to one of her clients. \\"It saved my life,\\" he told her after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. Eisely makes me dizzy sometimes with his beautifully and entertainingly written evocations of archeological time. He was amazingly precient in seeing where our population explosion would lead us. The chapter entitled \\"The Judgment of the Birds,\\" (I think) brings a tear to my eye... and this is a most curmudgeonly writer.I confess I'm an Eisely nut, and have read everything he wrote. For perspective, I also like Richard Russo, Alice Munro, Anne Lamott, Kent Haruf...One more thing: this book makes a great gift for just the right person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful Journey","review":"Long before Lewis Thomas, Stephen Gould, and Hans Jonas...This is philosophical biology in its most poetic form.It may change your world, because it may change you. How often does a book do this?Particularly grounded in this gadget, electronically-mesmerized age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague, Disappointing","review":"Eiseley essentially drafts the story of evolution, with personal observations thrown in, but in a style I found maddening. I guess he didn't want it to sound like a textbook so he laced the book with poetic-sounding sentences and vague references. Half the time I didn't know what he was talking about and had to re-read the sentence or paragraph several times. Eiseley has a strange way of writing, as if he's trying to make the subject matter more fascinating than it is. However the story of evolution is fascinating enough. He shoulda just played it straight and let the story tell itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthropologist or Literary Hall of Famer?","review":"This book can quite simply be summed up in a few words: A storyof evolution... I admit that I was required as a university studentto read this book, and I have enjoyed the readings that my English class has offered thus far. However, the only people who are going to enjoy this book are absolute Darwinistic evolutionists who enjoy dry reading about how rats are the \\"fathers of mankind.\\" I caught myself asleep several times through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For collectors only","review":"This is a re-release of Elvis' 1967 soundtrack EP for his movie Easy Come, Easy Go. The EP went to number 1 on the EP charts in the UK, but failed to make a splash in the US. Neither the movie or the soundtrack were very good. While Elvis' performances are good, the material is so weak that their is not much he can do to salvage it. His management should have been fired for giving him weak material like this to record. For avid Elvis fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Insight Made New","review":"Interesting & provacative look inside our relationship to food. More than anything this book helped me see where we have lost our way in relation to food and the spiritual significance it's long had in our society. What's truly wonderful is that Altman has inspired me to recreate a ritual around my meals. To be more thoughtful in what & how I am eating with others. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Reality: Wiowode's World is Wonderful","review":"This novel, it must be said, is not quite as good as Wiowode's finest, 'Beyond the Bedroom Wall.' But Wiowode's second best is anyone else's excellent. As North Dakota's poet, Wiowode uses prose in stark, image-packed lines to tell the story of two brothers, their respective roads through triumph and tragedy. Though Wiowode is a Christian (Presbyterian), he doesn't flinch as his characters grapple with homosexuality and even sibling experimentation. Alchoholism, a factor in Wiowode's own life, also plays a role, as does the uncharacteristic (for a modern novel) love of parents found almost solely in Wiowode. This is a beautifully-crafted book, a story about faith, sin, lostness, and love. Redemptive, yes. But not cheaply so. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good that I want to take credit for it simply by living in the same city.","review":"That city is San Diego, and it takes something really REALLY good to make me forget that SF and LA still monopolize California's culture.

This is a lovely handbook for daily living -- brief enough for busy corporate types to digest easily, but deep enough to satisfy the philosopher in search of real meaning. There's nothing terribly unusual in what the author is delivering here. But the way he handles lifestyle issues -- with common sense and compassion -- will resonate long after you close the book. -- Cynthia La Ferle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here...","review":"Something to pass the time on an airplane trip.

This is not the lesson of Babel. The lesson is that man cannot reach God by their own efforts.Biblical inaccuracy ruins an otherwise nice sentimental book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reminder of what is truly important in life.","review":"Dr. Meyers has written a delightful book reminding us of the importance of the simple things in life. Furthermore, he has kept the book simple. It is easy to read in one sitting, but it is not a book to put away after that reading. The 12 chapters each make a nice daily devotional study. We gave copies to all of our children for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, Comforting and Inspirational","review":"I found both practicality and comfort in this slim volume. If I lived in Oklahoma City, I might give Meyers Ministry a whirl."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE VALUE AND SOUND QUALITY!","review":"I hesitantly purchased this 3 CD set, figuring the sound must be below average for the price, but I have to say, the quality is great! I still can't believe such an essential collection, packed with 54 tracks can be had for this price. This is a GREAT starting point for newcomers to the House of Cash. And die-hards will appreciate the inclusion of many songs that do NOT appear on the many,many \\"best of\\" collections credited to the Man In Black. Well worth every penny, and it won't take alot of pennies to purhase this bargain of a lifetime, so buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandman? Maybe","review":"I have read other Katzenbach novels, but this one is very different. I like the style of his writing; he takes the time to fully develop his characters. The plot is slow-moving but I found the descriptive paragraphs engrossing enough to read every word. The word \\"sanity\\" takes on a new meaning in this story. And the very subtle intertwining of reality and illusion plus switching from past to present sets this novel apart from your common ordinary suspense thriller. Is this \\"madman\\" really mad? Take the time to read this absorbing novel and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great read!","review":"I really like the suspense! Towards the end, I couldn't put the book down because I was dying to know \\"who did it\\". I thought the characters were brought to life fabulously. Felt like I knew all of them. The writing was good and I liked how the story line went from the present to the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much description","review":"Ive read several katzenbach books, and the analyst is one of my favorite books of all time. However, The Madmans Tale was too slow. Really good premise, but he was too descriptive and it seemed like he was trying to lengthen the book. I skipped through a lot of paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like bad sex","review":"I read this book on vacation and found it to be intersting enough not to put down but kept hopeing it would get better or have some great twist (involving the main character) at the finish.

It was alright (I didn't throw it away) but could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madman's Tale","review":"Better skip the reader's reviews and try another book.

I enjoy the tight writing and characters of Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane. Aside from a fairly intriguing first chapter, the rest of the writing here was a complete disappointment. Way too much internal thought process with overwrought emotion, e.g. \\"Will I ever love again?\\" and the like. I started reading the first line of every paragraph and skipping the rest. I finish everything I start so I did get to the end to see if there was a payoff in plot, but no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I usually try to at least finish a book but this one was impossible!

With a unique blend of characters and a writing style sure to pull you in, this thriller will keep all his fans satisfied.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Way too many words -- especially adverbs and adjetives. It's as though the editing process was skipped in the rush to publish. The premise of the plot is intriguing but it becomes increasingly unbelievable as it goes along. For a while I wondered if that was an intended part of the plot, given that it takes place in an asylum. By page 345 I no longer cared. I rarely give up on a book in mid-read, but I did in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"a confusing totally unbelievable farrago","review":"I read it to the end hoping, in vain, for some clarity to this overwrought, confusing and completely unrealistic \\"thriller\\".

However, the rationale for some of the large group focus seems to flow entirely from a preoccupation with dividing large groups into smaller groups and then applying tasks or games to these subgroups. If you have never thought about working with groups this book may be of some use, but by and large I judged many of the examples were impractical in terms of the time and resources needed to get deploy them.My key reservation about these icebreaker books is that they are written more to help the presenter break the ice rather than any presumed intra-audience barriers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Icebreakers","review":"There are so many great ways to get a group started with this book. It's perfect for the people who are inactive and very active. From get-to-know-games to every-day-fun.

I've had them several times, and the ginger flavor is always pleasantly strong.The wrappers, unfortunately, are consistently a pain to deal with. Most of the time, the paper sticks to the candy in a way that requires five minutes per piece of candy to remove enough paper to eat. Even then, you frequently have to make the decision of whether to just eat some paper or throw out a significant portion of the piece of candy (because paper is irretrievably stuck to it) that you've just labored so intensively to unwrap.I'd rate five stars for the candy by itself.

Unfortunately model 2503.52 is a Omega Railmaster and while it is part of the Seamaster line it is not an Aqua Terra. There was nothing outside of the model number that stated it was a RailMaster. The watch came from Amazon and when I returned it I was shocked to find that Amazon Customer Service was going to hang on to my money for over 30 days - thus I was paying interest with the credit card company. Even more unfortunate is that this is company policy on any thing listed as \\"jewelry\\". I'm still waiting for Amazon to process my return.Oh- if you look at the ad for this watch now it states it is a \\"Railmaster\\" on the site.I still want the Aqua Terra, but would caution any buyer from purchasing any watch from Amazon as you will be waiting a long time if you need to return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful subject spoiled","review":"This book definitely does NOT read like a novel (contrary to the propaganda on the cover). While the research is exhaustive, it reads like an assembly of facts scribbled on note cards. There's no insight into the person to tie it all togehter. Even worse the descriptions of the Nash's work is unnecessarily shallow even for the layman. I got through this book inspite of the writting, but only because I find the man, his work & his disease so fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not A Biography!","review":"This book should be retitled \\"The History of Mathematical Research In The 20th Century\\". I am an avid reader and possessed of a degree in mathematics, but I was hard-pressed to follow a good bit of the theoretical information presented in this book. Further, I find that the inclusion of such material does not enhance, but rather detracts from the story. That is, of course, assuming the story is supposed to be the biography of John Nash. Within the first 150 pages one would not be exagerating in the least to say that there are probably less than 10 pages presented about the life of John Nash. This book is tedious, cluttered with extraneous information and not much of a cohesive biography. When I read this and see the rave reviews and credentials of the author, I do not wonder why my 6th grade daughter cannot yet write a cohesive paragraph. The problem seems epidemic in our culture if this book is any indication of the \\"literature\\" which is receiving kudos for greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius and Mental Illness","review":"Sylvia Nasar has written a very engaging biography here. I say \\"engaging\\" because though the book contains a great deal more about Nash's life than I need to know, I continued to read it thoroughly. Her command of the English language alone is pleasure enough, and her work is as much an invitation into the arcane world of higher mathematics during the mid 20th century as it is into the cross-wired and brilliant mind of Nash. Her Nash biography is a must-read for anyone interested in the sympathy between genius and mental illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinarily dull reading for such an interesting life","review":"\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is promoted as the story of a brilliant mathemetician who overcame mental illness to win a Nobel prize in economics. This is misleading. He won the prize for work he had done 40 years earlier, in spite of his history of mental illness.This biography is no Rocky-of-mathematics comeback story. It's the dry, detailed, well-researched, yet ultimately superficial tale of a man who saw the world a bit differently, and yet the author gives us little sense of what it was like to be John Nash. She tells us what happened in his life, gives us the dates of the important events, and relays anecdotes, but never truly gives us a sense of what life was like for Nash.After reading the biography I feel that I know what he did, but not what he was truly like, and that is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed look at a true genius' life","review":"I am 16 and an avid reader. I admit I skipped the passages explaining the mathematics as I am no math whiz. Truly I despise math, but reading Nash's story was intriguing to say the least. Even at 16 I understand the struggle and hardship that Nash and his family had to go through while Nash was in the midst of schizophrenia. I recommend this book for any reader who wants an intriguing, detailed look at a true genius' life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unauthorized biography?","review":"This book chronicles the life of Nobel prize winner John Nash. I found it disturbing in the distinct sense of \\"gossip\\" I got from the whole book, as John Nash was only referenced as a direct source once or twice, and although Alicia Nash (John's wife) was referenced more often, I still felt that the couple's privacy and wishes weren't respected enough. Note, however, that my opinion isn't based on anything except the feeling I got from reading this book.Another downside is that there was a bit too much detail given to certain things, such as the people Nash met throughout his life... a large percentage of this book doesn't have anything to do with John Nash.Given all of that, it was still incredibly fascinating to learn about this intelligent, torn, complex person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad story","review":"I was torn between two emotions - sadness for Nash and his family and joy in the human friendships and love that supported him through all his difficult years. It's a tribute to the mathematical community that there were so many individuals who cared and assisted him however they found possible. As for the details of the book, it's well written, articulate and full of historical anecdotes. Makes for a very pleasant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must -read, goes where the movie does not...","review":"First off, I have to admit I loved the movie and credit it with getting me to read this book. After reading this book, however, I realized that the movie (as absorbing as it was) left out so many important details about John Nash's early and later years, details which make all the difference in understanding the richness and complexity of his life....his childhood as an eccentric, if gifted, child, his connection to two different women (and the two children he had) and the oddness of those relationships.The author also reveals that one of Nash's children suffers from acute schizophrenia and writes about the similarities and differences between his illness and that of his father. If you want to go beyond just the brief intro to Nash's life that the movie portrayed, be sure to get a copy of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story of a troubled man","review":"The book is well written by Sylvia Nasar. After reading this book, you can't help but wonder how much one can attribute John's illness with his total selfishness in life. It seems to me, that had he not been so brilliant, he would have had to learn to treat people better well before he reached his 50's and 60's. I found it particularly shameful at how he treated the two woman in his life and his two boys. It seems clear that had John not been a genius, his life would have been incredibly aweful and that it was only his genius that kept him off the streets. That alone is a sad reality about mental illness. Clearly, John was one of the very lucky ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like Book, Go Book, By Isaac","review":"I loved this book. This book makes you think about all the good things in life and how these good things can be taken away in an instant. I liked how Sylvia Nasar went in depth into the early life of John Nash. This book is basically about one man, a genius, and his struggle to overcome schizophrenia. Nasar did a beautiful job of showing how schizophrenia can totally take over a person's mind and not let go. I highly suggest this book to anyone who loves a true story about someone's struggle and success in repossessing a life lost out of no fault of his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A math phobic who loves this book","review":"Don't be concerned about the laboriousness of this book. I hated math in school- and still have nighmares about the last test I have to take- but this book was one I was sorry had to end.This is a book about the human condition and a truly great mind, and it has neither too much nor too little technical info in it. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice biography of a mathematical genius","review":"This is an extremly well written biography of Dr. John Nash well know for his game theory.If you are interested in math and people behind the math then this book will interest you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuis, Love, Reawakening...","review":"A Beautiful Mind is a essential and very loose resemblance to the movie. Its a great and brilliant biogrphy of the life of mathematical genuis John Nash who won the Nobel Prize. Th Genuis of John Nash was when he went crazy in Princton in 1949 and was a very different guy then all the others at Princton. Love came along when he met a beautiful girl so to become his wife who believed in him so much that he succeeded in life and his schitzoprenia. John Nash went through a lot of pain becoming what he is now. Reawakening is when he wins the Nobel Prize. The book isn't very touching but is very astute. It's a legacy. I rate this book with 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful mind, a annoying man","review":"While reading the book I kept wanting to like Mr. Nash. I couldn't, he seemed to be an annoying prig for most of the book. Always trying to show off. I slogged through the book hoping but even the ending was tepid, 'glad he got the Nobel so he could get a credit card.' There was not enough in the book to show why he deserved the Nobel, more of an 'it was important'. Some things were explored with great detail and other parts were glossed over, a very uneven read. This is one book I will not recommend to other people. I can only wonder how the movie was able to dredge enough interesting things together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete story","review":"This is the rest of the story, to anyone who saw the movie, this will give you the details, and so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a novel","review":"(Spoiler alert) The book wasn't anything like the movie, but an excellent and engaging read. Nasar does a thorough job of including an adequate amount of detail about the influences in Nash's life without getting too bogged down in name dropping (the list of influences is interesting). The progression of his life, as told in the book, and the events that shaped his influence in the fields of mathematics and economics, all leading to his Nobel Prize award are put together well to keep the story moving. A fast-paced, compelling read.Two minor criticisms were the omission of occasional details about who people were or specifics of some events the reader was expected to be familiar with, and the lack of explanation about some of the theorems and proofs Nash worked with that would have provided additional insight into the level of his genius (but might also have weighed the book down).Overall, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a very worthwhile read and exciting, non-mainstream biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"more information than you need or want","review":"If you want a detailed account of the life of John Nash - along with a detailed account of everyone and everything that touched his life, then this is your book. Well written but much too much information for the non-scientist. And I never did find an explanation of his game theory.... was it ever really explained or only its impact?"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Nash is messed up","review":"John Nash made the life of those around him miserable. The person who suffered the most is his wife. An intelligent woman who is attracted to a selfish man invites misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dad's father's day gift","review":"Amazon's website wouldn't let me type a zip code; the website defaulted the zip based on city name and zip was incorrect. As a result, package couldn't be delivered and I was issued a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissenting view","review":"It looks like everyone loves this book and the movie will probably gather all the oscars, but I don't like the book and I will not see the movie. I have been reading a number of Math books lately (In Code, The Code Book, Fermat's Enigms, ...) and all have been 5 star. I guess they spoiled me. This book is so boring that I gave up about 3/4 through.The author gets diverted into telling a multi page bio about every person that John Nash ever met. Whenever the author begins to discuss one of his contributions she ends up quoting someone else' paper. I don't think she understands any of the math. She certainly can't describe it in her own words.As far as John Nash, Nobel prize or not he is not worthy of being written about. None of his Math accomplishments could make up for his disturbed behavior. John Nash is to Math as Mike Tyson is to boxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a scientist with a strong math background","review":"I loved the movie, so I was excited when I came across this book at a used book sale. That excitement didn't last long, this book was horrible! The author gets bogged down by irrelevant details, often giving way too much biographical info on minor characters I didn't care about. The first third of this book was all about the atmosphere at the various places John Nash worked and/or studied. Just too much boring detail!I was hoping to gain more insight into Nash, but in the end I was left thinking that the author didn't know enough about him to tell his story which is why the book was filled up with all kinds of boring, useless information.I almost didn't read it. I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Will Expect","review":"I had already seen the movie when I plowed through this biography of the great mathematician John Nash. In my reading, I could not decide if I was reading a book about math or a book about psychology. There is a lot of extra information about other mathematicians and their works that I found irrelevant to the point of the book. A simple focus on Nash, with the story of his life is what I had expected. However, what I got was more information than I was interested. Stick to the movie. It overdramatizes the life of Nash, but it's a lot easier to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINATLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"Ok, so maybe in buying this book I was looking for a biography. A true biography in the sense of a well written review of someone elses life, that is both captivating and inspiring. Instead, most of this book reads like a text book. Not just a advanced mathmatics text, for the endless pages of mathmatical jarble of which i could understand none. But also, a history book. A comprehensive history of mathematics in the 20th century. The book reviews and discuss every major mathemetician, economist and a good portion of the physicists of the 1940's and 50's.I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on the book, because, like i stated earlier i was looking for an inspiring biography and also an argument for the age old battle about books and movies and which is better. well, i suppose this book wins, because it decided for me to never see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your facts straight....","review":"Whenever I read a book and find obvious errors that I know about, and I am not even an investigative journalist, I wonder what else is wrong about it. Ms. Nasar, it's Jacob Wirth Restaurant in Boston, not Jack Wirth and the law firm was Choate, Hall & Stewart, not Steward!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"This book does not do justice to John Nash. He's a brilliant man and deserves someone to write a real book about him, not just copy down facts and call it a book. Anyone with time on their hands could have written this book. It's just a collcection of facts, many of them completely useless and irrelevant, that are put together in a \\"book\\". It's much more interesting to read Webster's dictionary than this book. John Nash is a great man, I'm so sorry on his behalf for this \\"book\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Genius or Fermat's Last Theorem instead.","review":"Here is what I learned from this book: John Nash was a gifted mathematician and a complete jerk. Before I read the book I was hoping that I would find out that there was this great mathematician who tragically gets schizophrenia. After reading it I found that I simply could not feel bad for Nash. Every time his schizophrenia would go into remission he would go right back to being a complete jerk to everyone. Some people never learn. I would recommend reading Genius by James Gleick or Fermats Last Theorem by Simon Singh instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the movie at all","review":"Nasar is a good writer and she's obviously done her research. My problem was with the subject matter. In this book John Nash comes across as boring, creepy, and a bit of a jerk. Not the kind of person I care to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenging Book","review":"I read this book and the \\"notes\\" in the back, with a great deal of difficulty (I even researched \\"Reimann's Hypothesis\\" on the Net) and turned down corners of pages for discussion. However, I know of no one who has read it because it is a very complicated book with mathematic discussions. (I can balance a checkbook). The story was quite remarkable, the frightening medical treatment and the total sadness of Dr. Nash's younger son was difficult to read. It is good to know Dr. Nash is still alive after so many years of illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"So...what is this book about???","review":"I had just finished watching the movie Beautiful Mind and rushed out the purchase this book...I was very dissapointed with it.I was dissapointed in the way the book was written. The first 1/3 of the book reads like a brochure for Princeton, Nash is hardly mentioned. The rest of the book mentions him more, but the author CLEARLY was trying to write the longest book she could by filling it with the most bulls**t she could copy and paste. I found myself skipping over nearly entire chapters due to this.I would recommend the movie instead of this book anyday. The movie makes Dr. Nash look like a genious with some social problems, living an adventerous and romantic life while dealing with a mental illness. The book makes him out to be a COMPLETE jerk, though still a genious, living a life not to terribly extraordinary. I dont know which description is more acurate, but at least the movie is MUCH more entertaining and less frustrating then this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We never know what a genius is","review":"Nash, Erdos, Schmann, Tchaikovsky, Shelly, Gould, Mozart, and many many more.Important theorems in Games, in Differential geometry, in Differential equation only before 30, and by intuition. Alas. (Alas, Since I major in mathematics.)We never know what a genius is, never know what on earth does lurk in his mind, never understand the struggle of such an uneasy spirit; unless we are genius ourself. However, usually a genius is not interested in other genius's life. This fact really hurts, since I have read this book.While it makes me feel so good that Nash has recovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conveys,very well, Nash's mental and professional state","review":"The book is a fascinating document of enveloping madness. The book documents John Nash's life so well that we get a good picture of the upper reaches of the Math profession and the Halls of Academ. It is very interesting and suspenseful as Ms. Nasar tracks Nash's deteriorating grasp of reality. But so much is revealed that I wonder if Nash truly had paranoid schizophrenia. His early life showed some features I associate with Autism and the \\"Rainman\\" experience. The pressure on him to succeed may have just pushed him into a neurotic defense- as perhaps Bobby Fisher may have done. The level of abstraction required to operate at Nash's professional level removes the thinker from reality to a high degree. It requires holding on to huge numbers of totally abstract \\"realities\\". As Von Neuman once said, \\"Holding on to these concepts can only be done for seconds at a time.\\" I wonder if it Nash reached the end of human ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real John Nash","review":"Sylvia Nasar, the author, is the real genius here! Written in 2001, and consisting of more than 400 pages of facts and research all knit together to form a riveting story of a mathematical genius with Schizophrenia, this book is a chilling page turner.Rather than review what has already been posted over the years, I will just say the book is helpful if you have an interest in mental illness (and higher mathematics), are curious about Princeton and other ivy league universities, and have seen the movie. It is not an easy book to read. John Nash, the heralded math genius who would be around 83 years old now, fathered a son with the same illness.I take comfort in the fact that now, eleven years since Nash was able to enter a remission and continue his quest in problem solving, there are no doubt better medications and more understanding of this disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and Fun little house","review":"I bought this house and the bumper cars for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas.

I ordered this book recently and while the first chapter provides some useful defintions, the rest of the book is mind-numbing. In fact, I gave up after chapter 3. If you have to re-read paragraphs two and three times to understand what the author is trying to say, then it's not \\"accounting made easy.\\"In addition, the examples of financial statements only offer \\"XXX\\" rather than actual numbers.

It seems very very sturdy, and is just what I had wanted and hoped for. It seems like it will be very versitile and will last a long long time. The fact that the sides or front don't move were actually the final selling point on this. Per suggestion from consumer reports, they recommended static sides.

We wrapped the toddler rail up and put it aside for later.I ordered the white crib and had to wipe it down after assembly, the smudges we put on came right off.Wood looks to be a good material.

It is very sturdy and has a wonderful cherry finish although does take some time to put together. We used wood glue as added support which worked out well and we highly recommend. Also we used an electric drill which saved us a lot of time (which we finally used after assembling two out of the three pieces) instead of manually screwing in the nuts and bolts. As other commments have mentioned the finish does scratch easily so be careful when you put it together.We also bought the 4 Drawer dresser and the Combo Changing Dresser. We were nervous the woods may be different shades but surprisingly all the pieces matched perfectly and complete the nursery. We are very pleased with our DaVinci purchase and of course Amazon.

Second, the screws stripped out of tne sides when she jumped on the bed in a fit (didn't think it was time for bed). Of course this broken side piece is a required part in the growth of the bed. My granddaughter is now three and in a new bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good and works but gets scratched very easily","review":"It looks nice and it's been working ok so far for about 3 months. The wood seems to be light and cheap material, and it gets very easily scratched. I know it can be converted to a full size bed but I don't think I want to use it as a full size bed at the rate it's getting scratched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"Super sturdy.

It's fairly easy to put together assuming there are two of you to do it. It does scratch kind of easy, but don't think any less than any other wood. It will be interesting to see how it holds up over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dents and scratches!!","review":"I had high expectations due to the positive reviews. This thing is a piece of junk. I tried to hook the mobile on it and the wood made an awful crunching sound and dented. The slightest touch or bang and this thing will scratch and dent so be careful. I've only owned it 3 months, have not yet even used it, and it already looks awful. Not to mention the screws are all exposed. Its an eyesore. There is no way I am going to be able to convert it to a bed when my son is older, it will be too scratched and dinged. I am so disappointed :( For my next child I will be purchasing a more expensive brand made with real wood. You obviously get what you pay for. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts essential for assembly","review":"I can't actually comment on the assembled crib itself since there were multiple pieces missing from the box and I'm still waiting for all of the pieces to arrive. Several weeks ago I started assembling the crib and found that the lock washers were not included in the package. I wrote the company and they sent lock washers which arrived a couple of weeks later. Once they arrived, I again tried to assemble to crib, only to find that the mounting brackets were missing. I guess I should have checked to make sure all of the parts were there when I first discovered the lock washers were missing, but I assumed the chances that multiple items would be missing were zero. I won't buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"indentations and scratches","review":"The crib's wood has many scratches, indentations, tears on arrival, even before we started to use it.It was hard to put it together.

Then at three month my baby started to roll. I tried putting the bumpers in, but they would not fit, so we were going to try to fix it. I put my son in the crib while I went to the bathroom and when I came back out his leg was stuck in between the wooden slates up to his thigh. I could not pull his leg out, so we tried pulling the slates apart trying to bend the wood to shimmy his leg out, but it did not work and he was screaming in pain and panic. To finally get him out we had to pull one of the wooden slates until it actually broke off in order for us to get his leg out. Fortunatly for us he was not actually harmed any any way. We have not put him back in this crib. The slates should not be wide enough for a little baby's limbs to get stuck and then the end slates be so wide that the bumbers do not fit. This is an unsafe crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"made in china or taiwan","review":"I have been researching cribs extensively. There is alot of misinformation on the internet including information stating that Davinci cribs are made in the USA. Davinci cribs are made by the company Million Dollar Baby.

The Amazon listing, however, does say that the hardware is not visible, but there is *a lot* of visible hardware throughout. The cherry finish is also quite red. I had been hoping for a less bright finish since the espresso seemed too dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - Stay Away","review":"We bought this crib to take it overseas. At first it seemed like what everyone else thinks about it - stable, heavyset, sturdy etc.After moving once (taking it apart and remounting it), the side panel literally started falling apart around the screws' holes (both the bigger ones as well as the smaller standard cruciform head ones).Turns out its massiveness is only apparent. In fact this bed is made of grade C particle chipboard. After unscrewing and remounting it a couple of times, say to lower the bottom as your child grows, you will find that this bed is really a cheap, low quality piece of furniture that just looks impressive.Fellow parents - stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, nontoxic crib","review":"It's a beautiful, strong and well made crib. Some people commented that the brand dings easily, and it does, but all baby furniture that's made from wood is made from pine, so all the brands ding easily, go to your local baby store and see for yourself...I did. This brand is very safe and non-toxic compared to the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and Beautiful","review":"This crib was exactly what I wanted. All of the pieces came in the box, with clear instructions and labels fo individual pieces. The finish is beautiful. After about an hour and a half, dad and grandpa had it built and put in it's place. There was one small ding in the furniture, but it's to be expected when furniture is being shipped. I am very happy with this sturdy piece of furniture, and I am sure my baby will love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Crib!","review":"Though it took some time to put together, after we were done, the crib looks beautiful!

And ordered the Davinci Kalani Convertible Crib in Espresso. I am so glad that I did!!! The finish is absolutely beautiful, deep and rich. My husband assembled it in about an hour with no confusion from the directions. This crib is VERY sturdy, and I am so pleased with the craftmanship. I ordered the MDB Twilight Crib Mattress to go with it, and it fits very snugly with no gaps. I also ordered the Storkcraft Ottoman and Glider in Espresso as well, the finish on the glider is just a touch darker than the crib but nothing that I would consider to be too noticeable. I am very pleased with my purchase, and am thankful for Amazon Product Reviews!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DaVinci Kalani Convertable Crib in Espresso","review":"Nice crib.

I actually destroyed part of it in a fit of rage trying to get the machine bolt to fit into the barrel nut to assemble the frame of the crib together. Now I am out the cost of the crib and need to go buy another one. Even for those who are used to putting furniture together, prepare to lose your mind with this one.

The sides of the bed are VERY SHARP, SQUARE, and HARD. To prevent my baby from banging his head and knocking himself out, we had to wrap both sides of the bed in queen sheets (looped in between the slats) to buffer the impact. Also, it is not as tall as pictured...this was my fault for not paying closer attention to the measurements. PLEASE compare the dimensions to other cribs to get an idea of the height. The height is great if you are a shorter person or not healing well from a C-section. We purchased the DaVinci Parker for our first child and LOVED it (wood is a little soft though) and thought this would be another perfect buy. It was too much of a hassle to return, so we made it work with the sheets. This bed should not be sold or redesigned to make curved sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy but difficult to put together","review":"After a small shipping snafu (if you order both the crib and changing table together there is a system quirk that will change your shipping to standard even if you're eligible for free Prime) we received the crib. There was a small piece of wood that had broken off one of the legs but because I was so impatient to get it together I just used some super glue to fix it. The crib was very difficult to put together. The instructions weren't always clear and we had significant trouble with the barrel nuts. Some of the pieces connected at odd angles and as a result took forever to get just right (after we had already stripped some of the nuts). Once together, the crib is actually very solid and sturdy. It does scratch easily (so be careful when assembling) and it is a bit lighter then it looks in the picture and I had hoped, but it still matches the rest of my furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Beautiful","review":"I purchased this crib for my upcoming first grandchild on his parent's recommendation. It arrived promptly and in perfect shape. It was easy to assemble. The crib can be converted into a youth bed with shorter sides and then later into a twin size bed, so it can be used for years with just the addition of a couple rails (sold separately) and the twin mattress and box springs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Crib!","review":"The DaVinci Kalani crib is everything we've hoped for: beautiful, easy to assemble, perfect size for our nursery...The price was right, too!AND it came w/ the toddler rail!

The baby has not come yet, but as far as the look and price, we love it! It's a little lighter than the typical espresso, but we still like it. We have had no problems with scratching so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"After reading tons of reviews and reading consumer reports, we decided on this crib for our first. Unlike many of the other reviewers, our box arrived perfectly intact and and crib itself was in perfect condition. The best part was that it arrived in just two days. I was able to put the crib together with hardly any help from my husband (who is not too good with tools...putting things together, etc) who only had to hold something while I tightened it. The only things I did have trouble with was putting on the feet (because some of the holes were not lined up properly) and getting some of the locking pieces to line up with the screws (because the holes for them were drilled too deep). I ended up having to put small folded pieces of paper in the holes for the locks so they would sit up higher so the screw could go through.The quality is great and the wood is beautiful. You can't get a better crib for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful crib!","review":"My husband and I just put our crib together and we love it. It arrived quickly and none of the pieces were damaged. We didn't have any problems with the finish scratching and we had it together in a couple of hours.

I will update after the little one has used it for a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"I priced around several cribs at all the major stores. Unfortunately, the one I really wanted was on backorder way too long so I shopped here on Amazon. I think this is an excellent price for the quality. I haven't actually used the crib yet, but I can tell you that it is TRUE white and it seems very solid. Took about 45 min.-1hr to put together.Was delivered on time as promised and with no scratches at all. For now I am 100% satisfied and I am very picky. I love ordering off amazon. I just ordered a Glider, will see how this pans out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy - Not Practical for Babies","review":"While this crib looks beautiful and is very sturdy, the wood is so incredible soft that it scratches very easy. Not only is it hard to assemble without causing nicks and scratches in the wood but once you put your child in it you can kiss the nice look goodbye. Our 1-year old no longer chews on things and puts things in her mouth but one day rested her mouth on the edge of the crib, not even gnawing on it, and now the finish is stripped and there are dents in the wood. It is a shame because this is a great looking crib and seems to be fairly good quality but the wood is way too soft for this to be a practical material for a child!! The idea that you can keep this bed for years to come is a farse because by the time your child is old enough for the full-size bed the wood will be so scratched and dented that you will want to replace it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegent and sturdy.","review":"It looks as good as it does in photos, and i am also satisfied with the quality of wood used.

The instructions were poorly organized and was his only complaint. Other than that, his ole ingenuity guided him and the crib looks great. The crib is a lot bigger than anticipated but welcomed. We had 4 screws left over and can only imagine it belongs to the toddler rail, although it would have made just as sense to reuse screws. We tested the stability by placing our 20 lb dog in the crib, and it remained stable."},{"rating":"2","title":"DaVinci Kalani Crib","review":"Very nice crib. Beautiful to see all set up, very sturdy.

I ordered from Amazon.com on a Tuesday afternoon and it arrived on my doorstep Thursday morning. All the pieces were included and in perfect shape. My husband put it together in less than an hour without any problems. Unfortunately, he didn't check the dimensions beforehand and chose to put it together in the living room instead of the nursery and it did not fit through the doorway. It unassembled very quickly and was even easier to assemble the second time. It looks beautiful and feels very sturdy. Our baby isn't due for another couple of months, so I cannot attest to the durability over time, but I have no doubt that it will be fine for many years as a toddler bed and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I love this crib. Adds elegance and class to the nursery. It matches well with the rest of the furniture in my home. VERY easy to assemble even at 9 months pregnant. NO scratching problems or marking of the wood. Standard size mattress is a tight fit, no extra space for baby to get fingers or toes, arms, legs caught. Baby bumpers for the crib set i bought don't really fit well as the end ties are too short to go around the thick legs, but that is not the crib's fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price for what you get!","review":"I bought this crib after a lot of research, debate, in-store trials, etc. My main concern was sturdiness. I've seen some people give this product a poor review based on ease of assembly, but that is not fair or very helpful. It's a piece of furniture - it's going to take a little time and patience! I'm only giving this 4 stars because I don't know how it's going to hold up with baby. Also, we had to make one of the pilot holes a little deeper with a drill in order to get the holes to line up. Other than that one snag, it wasn't difficult to put together.This crib is very sturdy and the mattress that is recommended with the crib fits perfectly. I bought the espresso and it is really pretty and looks like it costs more than $250. If you want an awesome finish or wood that isn't going to dent - don't buy a soft wood crib like pine! Fork over the $800+ for an oak crib!Definitely recommend so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"eXCELENTE CUNA","review":"Al fin mi esposa me convencio de comprar esta cuna, ya la armamos y quedo muy bien!! escelente producto que espero nos dure por añosfacil de armar pero se necesita otra persona que ayude"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit Form and Function","review":"Only using it for a newborn at this point so time will tell on additional options.

However, when he does decide to try and climb out this crib converts to a bed, perfect! I have enjoyed this bed and highly recommend it to all. It is quite big & decent quality. I assembled it & then had to take it apart and put it back together after moving overseas & is still in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of this crib and we are happy with the cherry color. Assembly was easy for me with just a minimal overview of the instructions, which were easy to understand with ample pictures.The 4 star rating is due to the top horizontal rails on the front and back. The mounting holes in them are just a hair out of alignment so at the top of the legs its just out of alignment, which is hard to see but easy to feel. Overall I doubt that it will be noticed unless pointed out.All the hardware was there and I suspect that the toddler rail will look great when it comes time to use it. There are extra holes predrilled in the legs that go unused for the crib but will go to mount either the toddler rail or the \\"bed\\" frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sturdy","review":"I expected the product to be lot more sturdy. I purchased based on the reviews posted earlier, however I was a little disappointed with the sturdiness of the crib. It is definitely good looking and get VERY easily scratched.

Little disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I purchased the ebony colored crib and also the dresser. The wood materials seem heavy duty and the crib is very strong and well made. The option to convert from crib to toddler to full sized bed is well worth it vs having to buy three different beds. The head and foot board of the crib have a nice sleigh bed style with curves. The feet of the crib is that similar to high end expensive cribs. I would def suggest this crib to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal flaw: no storage underneath the crib!","review":"The crib is solid enough and fairly easy to install, however, the front rail is fixed so low that it is impossible to slide anything underneath to store it.

Look at the clearance on the lower front frame, you can't slide anything more than like 5 inches underneath..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy Customer","review":"With all the choices out there for cribs I looked for a while. We just received ours and put it together last night. It looks great, it's light weight to easily move around the room, and it was easy to put together. I think and guy could put this together in less than 1hr. I would definitely recommend. As far as how well it holds up, that is yet to be seen. The wood feels sturdy, but is light weight and may scratch easily. We bumped two pieces together and it left a ding mark. So far so good. My son is teething and chews on it but its still holding up really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice crib, assembly confusing","review":"Just put the crib together so cannot comment on durability, but looks sturdy, nice finish. The only thing I didn't like, after we assembled it following the instruction booklet, we found a separate sheet with additional instructions inside one of the bags with hardware, that we were supposed to insert another part with every screw. Nothing about this was mentioned in the main instruction booklet, how were we supposed to know there is another additional instruction sheet somewhere else? Now we basically have to redo the whole thing because of this. Happy with the product but not with the instructions. Another note, as other reviewers mentioned, it does not fit through doors, so to move between rooms you'd have to take one side out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELVIS'LL BE ALWAYS THE KING","review":"A great album.

I don't know if appearing on ACL for the first time made Dave and the boys nervous, but a listless, tentative air pervades almost the entire set. Rick Shea's overbearing lap steel drowns out the other instruments; the usually reliable Bobby Lloyd Hicks' drumming is downright sloppy in spots; and Dave has some glaring vocal misfires during his ill-conceived \\"Cupid\\" interlude in \\"Border Radio.\\" This album also contains the most lackluster version of \\"Fourth of July\\" I've ever heard.

But there are also insightful interviews with other major figures including Joyce Carol Oates, Cynthia Ozick, John Hersey, and Yosef Brodsky.

This book was billed as a serious of essays but that is completely wrong. It is ONLY a collection of book reviews (from the late 1970s through 2002). Powers acknowledged in the introduction that the reviews \\"appear here with only small changes to correct minor factual errors\\" and \\"they address many episodes of American intelligence history, but make no attempt to settle controversies.\\" It is a scam to call these \\"essays.\\" The book is not worth even the price of shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many interesting insights","review":"I have been familiar with most of the facts presented in this book for quite a few years. But this book has added significantly to my understanding of how and why certain things happened. To be sure, much of what Mr. Powers writes in these long, essay-type book reviews is speculative, but he has a far better sense than I have ever had for the interplay among events and people. My knowledge has been so-to-speak \\"technical\\", i.e. the facts and nothing but the facts, thank you very much. To this, Powers adds insight into what else was going on that affected the various successes and failures of intelligence he discusses, and some useful thoughts on whether and how much these successes and failures mattered, anyway.

Her best lyrics are the more personal (\\"I am So Ordinary,\\" \\"Bethlehem\\"), but even these are far to pretentious or or amateur to have any resonance combined with the pop-ballad production they are given.When Cole attempts a poignant *statement* as in \\"Black Boots\\" or \\"Curandisero,\\" the results lack the originality, passion, or lyrical style to do justice to the politically-correct subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Harbinger\\" proves to forcast things to come...","review":"Paula Cole's debut, \\"Harbinger\\" is a little known album that reaches the core of her music. The soulful ballads that are present on this album are some of the most candid and revealing songs in pop music. Supported with Cole's haunting voice, the songs of \\"Harbinger\\" resonate through the mind and weasel their way into the subconscious. The simplistic beauty of \\"Ordinary\\", along with the minimalist style of \\"Chiaroscuro\\" add to the complexity and depth of Cole's music. She is completely unprecidented and unlike any other artist. Original melodies and incredible music lend themselves to create the masterpiece that is \\"Harbinger\\". If you love songs like \\"Me\\" from her album, \\"This Fire\\", you will love this album. \\"Harbinger\\" is true to its name, in that it is a warning to stand back and accept the inevitable success of Cole's talent and mystique."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ALBUM!!","review":"I was fortunate enough to see paula cole open for sarah mclachlan in atlanta's fox theatre. This was long before she had made the bigtime. This album was her only body of work at the time and the minute we left the theatre i had to buy this cd. Her voice reached to the lofty heights, sending chills through my body. I dare say her performance came close to outdoing sarah mclachlan's. The songs are so unappreciated, and I felt were ignored when this fire came out. I think this album gets overlooked alot and I think it overshadows in my opinion all of her work since. It is a wonderful album. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions of Heaven and Hell Before Dante","review":"This book was in excellent condition.

However, readers should know that, subsequent to its publication, informed criticism of the book led to the extraordinary step of official revocation of its Doctrinal Certification within the LC-MS. Descriptions of this book as \\"controversial\\" -- while tantalizing -- fail to communicate the clouded reputation of this flawed and out-of-print work.The dedicated reader can find a superior treatment of the Missouri Synod Lutheran understanding of these topics in respected contemporary works such as Harold Senkbeil's \\"Santification: Christ in Action\\" (ISBN 0-810-00308-2), Robert D. Preus' \\"Getting into The Theology of Concord\\" (ISBN 0-570-03767), or in classics such as C.F.W. Walther's \\"The Proper Distinction between Law and Gospel\\" (ISBN 0-570-03248-2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Lutheran Theology written by Lutherans?","review":"This book shows the disfunctionality in the LCMS now that has been allowed to exist for at least 50+ years now, possibly even since 1939.The theology behind this book was rejected and termed as unbibical in the Praesidium's decision concerning false doctrine filed against one of the authors. Sad that the decision said that this most basic doctrine of Justification and Law and Gospel is not understood by the authors. So no wonder when the Lutherans took over CPH and doctrinal review they discarded this. How about Courageous Churches and Luecke's book as well.Certainly who is in seats of power in synod publishing and control makes all this happen. When are we as Lutherans going to stop playing politicas and be the confessional theologians we and our history says we are?This book is well sized up by excellent review in LOGIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understated elegance","review":"I love this watch!

Nice size; feels comfortable in the hand; a few of the commands to modify text have an awkward pattern or series to them. It could be very good. PROBLEMS: 1) it shipped without the CD for the software. 2) After downloading the software, I came to realize that it is not compatible with Win ME. I have to scan text, and upload to a PC that runs Win 98 and then transfer the text to my PC. No where on the web site or in the printed material does it state this. In fact, technical support does not even OPENLY acknowledge this. 3) Since the company is in Sweden, one must relay on email----the first response took a day or so. Not bad. The second response took 3 weeks. I am still awaiting a response to the 3rd \\"fix\\"that tech support has suggested---4 weeks later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novelty to impress your friends","review":"Initially I was stunned by this technology. I scanned text from books, the newspaper, nutrition information off a candy bar wrapper... all with reasonably good results. Once I started to use if for serious work, I was substantially less impressed. I had planned to collect specific data fields from a printed directory; instead of using a sheet-feed flat-bed scanner followed by heavy cut&paste, I thought I could just selectively hand-scan the needed data fields. While the OCR accuracy might be acceptable for short passages, the error frequency becomes unacceptable when more text is collected. The frequency of errors was so great that I went back to the flat-bed and cut&paste. I like the ergonomics of the unit.

Accuracy is not good enough for most purposes I have tried to use it for and I have found it much quicker to type out text manually, or even write it out by hand, than to try and scan it in and correct the errors made by the CPen. The XTNDAccess infrared connection which I needed to purchase with the device is extremely temperamental on Windows 2000, and impossible to install on Windows NT Workstation - the tech support people were downright unhelpful and refused to direct enquiries to customer services. The battery life on the device is poor and I found I had run down the batteries in only a few hours of use.

The book kept me interested to the end and left me uplifted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrr","review":"I have enjoyed Clair Poulson's suspense novels in the past. The story line in this one was no different - I liked it. What bugged me and the reason I am rating it so poorly is the character Warren. The guy is a jerk, controlling and shows signs that he could become abusive. Yet Jeri excuses him because he had 'reason'. Given that she does not love him and doesn't end up with him but part of the solution to the story is that he winds up with her best friend. It bothers me to no end that he is presented as a 'good catch'. The issue of domestic abuse is serious and girls should be taught to recognize potential signs and not be encourage to rationalize it to acceptance. Although I truly enjoyed the book, this issue is so egregious the rating goes from 5 stars to 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain cheesy","review":"I got this book at a book swap and later saw that the first 75 pages were missing. I read it anyway and found that I missed nothing at all. The writing is very amateurish with the characters doing lots of cheesy self-reflection. The end is nothing but LDS (mormon) propaganda. The main character is torn between her LDS standards and the man she loves. Lo and behold he turns to the mormon faith and all is well. Puh-leeze!

The story covers a period of time interesting to me and in an area near my home. The heroes are good people with normal character flaws, and the villians are the kind of people you can easily hate. The story is tied in to real times and real events. The author is obviously very familiar with the Cheyenne Indians and the frontier during the latter 1800's. A spellbinding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldschool Neurosis fan left hungry","review":"I started listening to Neurosis with the release of Pain of Mind and for a long time they were my favorite band by far. Ever since A Sun That Never Sets though I haven't really enjoyed their music very much. I still think they are awesome and unbelievably talented, but the music just doesn't drive me anymore. I miss the heavy days of Souls At Zero and Through Silver In Blood. For anyone that feels similar to me I doubt you'll really enjoy this album very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Of The Year","review":"Sorry folks. I hate to say it but this album is boring to me. Except for the second track, I haven't listened to it since the first week I bought it. The second track does kill though, a glimpse of the \\"crush you with one hand\\" Neurosis that I used to know and love. I am a huge fan of everything they've released except the first two and this one. I must admit though, I didn't like A Sun That Never Sets at first either until I saw it live. Maybe I'll try to like it again some more and give it a few more spins. Check out the song samples, see what you think. True fans will buy it no matter what. I did. But for the most part I agree with \\"A Music Fan\\" ... fans of heavier stuff will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Awful","review":"It is beyond me why an author would distort history that is so interesting on its own.

This book is beyond terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lions and Tigers and Bears! Oh my!","review":"Now look, even the most pedantic of historians or history buffs must allow novelists to tweak the facts to aid their plots. BUT there is a line once crossed that passess from tweaking to revising. If this book had presented itself as a revisionist historical novel--then fine it's a decent enough read. The question I always have for this type of excess (when not labeled as such) is why-when the actual facts are just as intriquing or exciting? The fact that after-the-fact the author fesses up doesn't dispel the annoyance and disruption that occurs when the knowledgeable and true-history-loving reader is reading. If you care about history and historical figures at the level that most of the reviewers seem to, then its a good enough read-so enjoy. If you truly care-read if you want, but be afraid-be very afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad if you don't mind alternate histories....","review":"Somewhat entertaining, and I give any author credit for writing a readable story, but as far as Julius Caesar's life goes, this ongoing series is more of an alternate version than anything else - just keep that in mind.Those more interested in a much more historically-accurate, as well as meticulously-researched and vivdly-detailed series on Caesar and/or the fall of the Roman Republic should read Colleen McCullough's \\"Masters of Rome\\" series, in which Caesar's life begins midway through the 3rd book, \\"Fortune's Favorites\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst book I've ever read","review":"I am a lover of all things related to Rome and the Roman empire, but I can't believe how bad this book is. It would be different if Rome had a ho-hum, unexciting history but given its true history I don't know why anyone would put forth such a poor, and frankly, LESS interesting backstory to what were in fact extraordinary events, people, and places.I'm so glad I checked this out of the library and didn't buy it. It might be the worst book I've EVER read.I agree with other reviewers, the Colleen McCullough books are wonderful. And for light reading about that era, the Marcus Didius Falco mysteries by Lindsey Davis are an enjoyable read. This series, this author, however is an utter waste of time, paper, and ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventure continues...","review":"I can't say enough about this series!

No he lived for many years more, died in Africa and should be a MAJOR character in the next books in the series - except the author has decided to kill him off. Ridiculous.Caesar personally kills Mithridates during a great battle the same year he escaped from pirates??? No such thing happened.There are many other major changes in History that make this mediocre book and series a must avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diabolically bad : pity we cant give negative stars....","review":"This is grim stuff. One of the things that attracts me to Caesar is that his (extremely well documented) life reads like an adventure novel.

Sorry, but you've got to be out of your mind. Warrior was a great hit for about five minutes. He no-showed events and botched many a match. He wasn't nearly as great an interview as Hogan, and he turned his back on his fans plenty of times. Oh, and the greatest match of Warrior's career? With Hogan.

This false statement may have been a popular myth among southerners at the time but it is a lie. The narrator does not indicate it as a myth but as a fact. As a documentary, it gives the impression of truth. There should have been a subtitle or a following note that clarified the remark as propaganda. To leave it in the documentary in its present state would be the same as giving credit to a holocaust denier in a history film. As I said, this was a nice effort overall but, now I have to fact check every single thing to see what else was fabricated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Worthy","review":"This movie is awesome!!!!!!

Its like a cross of new age jazz and flat beats with a little bossa nova mixed in. Really dissapointed in where this series has gone - there is really no need to venture outside the single digits i.e. volumes 5-9 with this series.. believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clara is trying to escape Hittler her family finaly makes it","review":"WOW, what a great book. I think it was deffenatly intended for little children becuse it was'nt that discriptive and was'nt that gross. So after that I rate it about a 8-9.

Easy for children to read and also gives them an insight to other cultures and the hard life of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of the Holocaust","review":"This brief story follows Clara, a young Jewish schoolgirl of Innsbruck, Austria as the German National Socialists begin their persecution of Jewish communities after the German National Socialist annexation of Austria. As Papa and Mama prepare the family's escape to the neutral country of Switzerland, the story focuses on the anxiety and fear as the family makes hard choices in order to survive. The epilogue eventually finds the family in England at the end of the war and alludes to the terrors of the Holocaust. However, it does not specifically name the atrociites, allowing parents to talk to their children about this historical reality. It especially struck me that the author's dedication is: \\"For Clara, with remembrance, for Mimi, with love, and for the one and a half million children who perished in the Holocaust.\\" This is a difficult story that must be told to children of this generation and future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Night Crossing was a very good book.","review":"THE NIGHT CROSSING Hi, I am a sixth grade student,and I read The Night Crossing ,and it was a very good book.

I found this one in my sister's room and decided, well, what the heck, It's short anyway, I can just zip through this! I knew that it was intended for grade1- grade 3 audiece but it probably wouldn't even appeal to them either. I just couldn't find anything interesting about it. The book is about a girl named Clara and her sister who have th get away from their country and to England. There really wasn't much description in it and nothing really happened. I also found it very unrealistic. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the author really tried to impress people and from the looks of the other reveiws, it looks like a few people did like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mixer","review":"I received my mixer very quickly and have used it a number of times with excellent results.

Oh, but wait, the promtional code isn't available now. Trying to work this out with Amazon through alleged customer service was a nightmare.

For years, these \\"must have\\" items have been on the higher end, price-wise. I found this item to be equal in performance to the higher priced units. I found the unit and the attachments to be of a sturdy quality. I lost count of the number of Christmas cookies that were made from the amount of cookie dough my neighbor and I made in one week."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!","review":"Very sturdy construction. Much better than I expected. I made whole wheat bread the other day and it didn't even hesitate to blast through the dough. My wife has used it several times and loves it too. I origonally wanted to get her a KitchenAid, but I did a lot of research on the best mixers and I agree that this is the best value for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for 7 months","review":"I purchased this mixer 7 months ago and only used it maybe 10-15 times total to make cakes and mash potatoes. All of a sudden the speed regulator stopped working and no matter what speed I put it on it mixes as if it was on 12. I had to scrape potatoes off the walls because when I put the mixer on # 2 it started mixing so fast everything flew out of the ball. Will be calling HB to replace it within the warranty. I'm only afraid that they would send me a refurbished unit that will stop working too. Fingers crossed. I wish I had purchased Kitchen Aid instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems pretty darn good to me...","review":"This is my first stand mixer, so I have nothing to compare it to. That said, I like it just fine. I bought it to give my arthritic hands and wrists a break from holding a hand mixer cause I bake a lot. It mixes stuff up just fine with no more bowl scraping than the hand mixer required. Haven't whipped cream or egg whites yet, but I've done a few bread doughs. It's nice and solid, stays put on the counter. The head flips up without having to pull it out from under the upper cupboards, something I hadn't thought about, so that was nice. Love the apple green color. Beaters are easy to clean. Seems like a good mixer at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mixer","review":"After agonizing over this purchase, reading the negative reviews against positive, I'm so glad I finally decided on this purchase. I've had it for a couple of months now, and it has been put to the test with yeast breads and cookies as well as various other mixing challenges. It has performed well in all aspects. Haven't had a problem at all with undo shaking of mixer head or problem with ingredients mixing properly or having to scrap bowl repeatedly. And it is really quiet. Haven't used the splatter shield as that has not been a problem nor has adding ingredients to the bowl. I would recommend this mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"new mixer","review":"After 42 years my old Hamilton Beach mixer had to be replaced. The beater was bent beyond repair and no replacement could be found. This seems to be the best successor I could find.

I still pine for my old one though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for dough!","review":"I make a 1 pound whole wheat loaf of bread once a week. The mixer head wobbles terribly during the 7 minutes of kneading and the mixer tries to walk off the counter. Under this light load, the first mixer lasted less than 1 year before the bolt holding the head to the base snapped in half. Hamilton Beach replaced the mixer. I figured it was just a fluke. It's not a fluke. The replacement mixer is doing the same thing and I'm now smelling a strong odor of ozone from the motor head.VERY disappointing considering the fact that HB states that the mixer can handle the lightest egg whites to the stiffest dough! When the current mixer fails, I will be buying a Kitchen Aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand mixer","review":"This mixer has made baking so much easier for me. I love having both hands free to add ingredients and this mixer has the power to mix heavy ingredients well. I really enjoy using this mixer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"We had an ancient Kitchen Aid and I loved it... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky. Our daughter now has it and is happy with it. We bought the Hamilton Beach mixer and I like it almost as much as the Kitchen Aid. The best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up, making things a bit easier. The only slight complaint I have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump... it's a little too fast for what I want, most of the time. Another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"forget kitchenaid.........this one is a keeper","review":"First of all I bought this for my mother for christmas.......she is a big baker and had been wanting a kitchenaid for ever........I saw this one and really couldn't see any big differences..........I was right.......I think it's better.

It has been my best appliance yet. It does all the 'heavy' duty mixing my hand mixer wouldn't even touch. This product is as good, if not better than Kitchen-Aid brand. Has all the same utensils, except for attachment potential of which I wouldn't ever use anyway. This was just what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"hb mixer","review":"I had to replace a 27 year old Oster kitchen center. Unfortunately they do not make those anymore... I got this mixer because of the good reviews and price. I had been leaning toward the KA but changed my mind. I think I made a good choice. I am happy so far. I have done cookies,cakes and merangues (sp). I was happy with them all. You do have to scrape but that is really nothing I don't expect to do. It is really quiet compared to my kitchen center. So far so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"I do not believe there is a product as good as this one costing less than twice. It works like charm. It is sturdy, the way the head lifts off the bowl helps a great deal to remove it. The three mixing tools add versatility to the machine.

I'll buy extra bowls so I can beat the eggs and mix the dough separately before mixing them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mixer for the price","review":"I've had the Hamilton Beach mixer for 2 months now. It performs just as well as KitchenAids of equivalent capacity, with less noise and for less money.My only complaint is it's advertised as a 12 speed mixer when in fact it's a 6 speed. The speeds are numbered 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. I don't how they get away with this nonsense. Not that a home mixer really needs 12 speeds, it works fine, but it's false advertising and the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.I bought this for $136 on November 7th 2012. The price seems to fluctuate randomly quite a lot, so I would suggest putting it on your wishlist and checking the price periodically.Another thing to always consider when buying a mixer is the price of replacement bowls. KA bowls are around $50, while HB sells bowls on their website for $23."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Beech all metal stand mixer","review":"I have only used this mixer once to make a pudding and it met my expectations.

We plan on buying more of the Eclectrics Appliances in Pineapple, and are in the process of re-doing our kitchen.

We are lucky to have him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Rednecks and White Liberals","review":"I'm 66 years old and after reading Thomas Sowell's book everything finally makes sense to me - specially in today's culture. I grew up in an ethnic European neighborhood in Pennsylvania. It wasn't until 1965 when I was drafted and sent to Ft Jackson South Carolina where I was exposed to the Southern culture. Come to think of it, most of the NCO's back then were from the South and either of Irish heritage or black. Thanks Mr. Sowell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Clearly debunks the liberal argument of victim-hood of blacks and the falseness of most of their historical arguments and hysteria - the facts based presentations shows the socialist & \\"dependence-on-government\\" agenda of the democrats and the agenda of mediocrity or dumbing-down of American to the ignorance of the minorities (blacks)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your mind","review":"If you want to be entertained this is not the book for you, but if you want to learn something and maybe broaden your outlook on why things are the way they are this book is a real winner. A truly scholarly approach to some of our narrow perceptions and preedjuces we all have to one estent or another. Some parts of it demand a second resading to really understand properly but it gives a new explanation that deserves serious consideration. The only thing missing is a good bio about the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sowell is one of the best and it shows here again.","review":"Anyone reading this just wants to know whether the book delivers or not.Bottom line is yes, Sowell does a splendid job of uncovering and explaining with ample sources the nature and origins of current popular cultures in America. Sowell goes back through history to track the growth and influences of current cultures today and the journey is quite interesting. Political correctness be damned, Sowell tells it like it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, right","review":"The main problem with this thesis, aside from the fact that it is yet another attempt to blame everything on the South, is that these pathologies did not manifest until the northern migration. Gangs, disintegrating families, epidemic drug and alcohol abuse, rampant illegitimacy all occurred after Blacks moved north and were plugged into the welfare state. Part of the reason Blacks are returning South is that they are more comfortable there, have more in common with white Southerners than hypocritical yankees, and fit comfortably into a culture of faith. At least he is trying to look out of the box....but blaming ANYBODY at this stage of the game is not part of the solution. Its the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A black man defends slavery!","review":"Basically, Sowell belives that A)Urban black culture is a result of interaction with poor white trash; B)Slavery wasn't really a racial thing; C)Other minority groups who exploit urban blacks are, in fact, providing a valuable socio-economic service; and D)Blacks need to stop living in the past and blaming whites for their problems.He brings to mind that blind black man on Chappelle who was a white supremacist. Only, Chappelle's version was more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sowell's Revisionist History","review":"Sowell comes across as having no idea what he is talking about. This book is nothing but revisionist history. I am not sure where Sowell gets his absolutely ridiculous ideas. I suspect he believes in the entity theory of intelligence as well, since these he falls into the category of academics who use racial bias as fact instead of documenting his research and conducting real empirical research. Columbia University can surely do better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sock it to me","review":"Dr. Thomas Sowell is back and he's smacking down smug assumptions in his usual blunt way. The book starts out with an essay that discusses why a big chunk of the black population lives the way it does. Although the conclusion Dr. Sowell comes up with isn't new-- anyone with an understanding of history would make the same one the way he presents it without sentiment or excuses is marvelous.Other essays are on middlemen minorities and why they catch hostility from the failed cultures around them, the amazing feats of German communities outside of Germany, the cultures that consistently over centuries produce high achieving people, the history of slavery (Newsflash kiddos--slavery was not an all American sin. It flourished all over the world and continues to this day)and talks about the high and low points of black education.This a brilliant book that sugar coats nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Thesis","review":"Fascinating thesis, I think he proves it well.

This was by far one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, you get what you are expecting and/or hoping for and then a whole lot more. I was lost for words when the zombies exploded from their graves. The humorous moments our cast finds themselves in, the biting one liners- it was funny, it was gross, it was grossly funny.

I love the point and shoot mode plus all the many, many other functions for when I want to use them. The only problem is the lag-time from taking the picture to getting it on the memory card. However, the good folks at Nikonusa tell me an 80X digital memory card will help this. Also there are adjustments on the camera that allow for fast shots. I have only touched the surface of all these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Technology for the price","review":"Abysmal bit of engineering. I returned the first one because I thought it must be defective. No camera at this price could have bad focusing and snail-like write times and lag, right? Wrong! This camera has a sharp lens, but do your homework. It's a VERY slow chunk of glass and the contrast based AF module ruins shot after shot. Lag and write times mean you can't catch a special moment unless everyone agrees on a time and place for it. It's almost funny, unless you can't get your money back. You could make all kinds of excuses for this dog if it cost 279.00, but it's current price of close to 700 dollars just buy a DSLR. Cameras are about being able to shoot focused shots when you hit the shutter button, without DELAY. The 8800 is incapable of that by a long mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best prosumer digital camera availlable","review":"I bought this splendid camera when it was released last november in Hong Kong.

Before the zoom malfunction, the camera took great pictures on a perfect day, but night time, indoor, and action pictures were almost always blurry even if you put it on the night time, indoor, or action settings.

Nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card...no help. Now Nikon says says send it in and we'll fix it- but don't say what it will cost... The shots I do get aren't as good as an HP camera we have that was half the price. The controls are ridiculously complex. The flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light...the whole thing is a piece of junk. The only good shots I've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away...but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable...

Once they are cinched on tight, they rarely slide down and don't require further adjustments even if you've gotten all sweaty. The fit and finish is very nice, and the medium size was true to fit. The only issue I've experienced is that the velcro straps easily get caught on the cloth seam covers during fitment/removal and are making the material fuzzy.

The author explains what's wrong with car transit in the US and how it could be improved by various methods. The method that promises the best result is road pricing. This is done by charging cars for their use of the road.He doesn't doesn't explore the possibility of road pricing using onboard GPS units perhaps because the technology didn't exist in 1997 when the book was written.

I went through 3 of them in a short time. Every time I called the company, I got the same ridiculous response from their representatives. They pretend that no other customers are having difficulty with their machines (not true, if you read other reviews) and then proceed to try to find something you are doing wrong. Even the replacement units they sent didn't work. For the past 2 years, I have been using Waterpik or Interplak units with sinus attachments instead, and although their lifetime is only 6 months, at least they don't cost $100. I am going to try the sinupulse now that my latest interplak bit the dust. Hopefully it will last longer than 6 months for the $97 I'm going to spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hydropulse- an excellent way to irrigate your sinuses","review":"My name is Jordan S. Josephson, M.D. F.A.C.S. and I am the author of the book Sinus Relief Now recently published by Penguin Books. The book is about sinus problems, allergy, asthma, snoring sleep apnea and gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD). I am a total believer in patients irrigating their sinuses on a daily basis. Irrigation removes infection, allergens and irritants. I personally suffer from sinus problems and irrigate myself. I recommend irrigation to all of my patients. The hydropulse (a nasal irrigator) is a very effective way to clean out your nose and sinuses. This irrigates with a bit more force than a netipot which is required in many cases of bad bacterial or fungal sinusitis and is better in cases of recurrent nasal polyposis. This is an excellent product. I recommend and show you how to use nasal irrigators in my book Sinus Relief Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for water pumps, but prefer neti pot","review":"We purchased this unit before there were any reviews written, with the hopes that it would help with a swollen turbinate/sinus condition. While the pump did pulse the water through the nose, it did not seem to encourage the flow of cilia any more than the daily use of the neti pot. In fact, we prefer the neti pot, as it is easier to use, less expensive, feels great, and doesn't require so much trouble with all the rinsing and mechanics of use. Plus, the neti pot travels much better too, if you are on the road. All in all, this unit sits on our bathroom shelf, unused after a few weeks (and that was months ago). We'd strongly recommend daily use of the neti pot if you are looking to have convenience and good nasal irrigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overpriced","review":"Well, this does what it does, vibrates while squirting water (adjustable pressure) but it reminds me of kids' ten dollar walmart christmas toys like plastic slushie makers and what not. Doubt the motor will last many years. Don't know much about Grossan research; I think I bought this hurriedly after reading a sales pitch that resembled a medical review.Don't know what alternatives are around, but there's room for improvement on this cheapo. I'm not saying it doesn't work. Mine has run several hours properly, and doesn't smell overheating or smoky like a cheap blender would. It is about as noisy as one though, so don't expect 100% privacy when you're using it.I would probably recommend saving money and buying a used one in working order if you can; you won't feel so ripped off, I doubt any of these ever really get that much use, and cleaning isn't a big issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyday usage as machine just won't hold up.","review":"I am a chronic allergy sufferer. I use this machine daily and when it works, it works great. However, I am on my second unit now (first one lasting about a year) and this one is dead in less than 7 months. The motors in these pumps just don't hold up. They burn up and lock up regardless of any type of regular maintenance the instructions tell you to do. To be short, if you're going to use it daily, use a different brand as this one won't hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grossan HP100 Nasal Irrigator","review":"We have used this product for more than a year.

Coriolis has taken the opportunity to create just such a book for everyone.Taking the Server+ exam apart is no small task but this book does manage to take the important points like the Server Room layout and security, data storage with SCSI, ATA, USB, SAN and RAID, CPU and memory and put in a format that makes the studying easier.Moving on the book talks about the bus architecture and the BIOS setup structure. Then you have coverage of the topics like peripherals, network interface cards, network hardware, server types. Also very good overviews of the NOS like NT, 2000, Novell, UNIX and Linux is in this bookFinally the book closes up with troubleshooting and disaster recovery. This book should be the final reading before the exam, overall a very good source of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Server + Exam Cram not up to Coriolis Standards","review":"The Server + Exam Cram covers most of the subject matter in the Comptia Server+ Exam. However much of the material is descriptive rather than hard information expected from a \\"brain dump\\" tome. There is no excuse for the many typographical errors throughout the book, as well as incorrect answers to practice questions. One of the answers listed Amps as a unit of Amplitude, rather than Current flow, showing that the Authors had no concept of basic electricity! Many of the Comptia exam questions are now real world situations with more than one correct answer, which this book covers superficially. This Exam Cram book needs to be revised and brought up to the Coreolis standard of hard facts, accurate information, and practice questions simulating the actual Server+ test."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one takes the prize! (That's not a good thing)","review":"Coriolis books always seem to have more typos than other books but this one takes the prize! There were so many blatant errors in this book! In one of the explanations to a question on the sample test (#36, p.304) starts off saying, \\"Answer d is correct.\\" and the very last line of the paragraph is \\"... therefore, answer d is incorrect.\\" If that wasn't bad enough, the \\"correct\\" answer to question 5 on p.207 is wrong if you read the text on p.195. Give me a break!I took this exam today and passed but I think I actually did worse because of this book. If I would have chosen one of the other study guides, I'm sure I would have done MUCH better. If it weren't for the quality of the I-Net+ Exam Cram I would be through with this series permanently!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While the few other Coriolis Exam Cram books I have used have been of good to excellent quality, I discovered when only a few questions into the Server+ exam that this particular book was almost completely useless. I did pass the exam, but with little help from this book. There are numerous typos (is that GB or MB?), inconsistencies, and straight-out errors. The actual content is barely relevant to the onslaught of experience-based troubleshooting questions on the exam. I gave this two stars instead of one because I do recall a couple questions (out of an eighty question exam) where my studying in the book actually did help me. I hate to give a Coriolis book a bad rating, seeing as how they've always released quality products in the past, but this book is just terrible in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Server+ resource","review":"This book brings nothing to the table except for more review questions for a Server+ candidate to dutifully go through. Even then, some of the questions and answers are mismatched. The information presented are wrought with spelling errors and can only imagine that the editor(s) were busy doing something else. The SCSI, RAID and backup chapters did not have enough information in my opinion which is a no-no considering the emphasis the exam puts on these topics. However, this book is a quick read and is best used a week before the actual exam date much like the Passport series, but I think you'd do better elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exam Cram Server+ Full of errors but cheap","review":"I bought this book as a second source for studying for my Server+ exam mainly because it was cheap on the Amazon used market (50 cents). This book has served that purpose well but I'd be reluctant in recommending it as a primary source for study as it has many distracting errors; many of which could lead the reader to answering test questions incorrectly. I could recommend this as a secondary reference for the well experienced reader who would not be lead astray by the errors. The poor proof reading of this volume is evidence to the reason for the disappearance of Coriolis publishing shortly after this book was printed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful to pass the test","review":"This book doesn't cover a lot of things one needs to know the Server+ test. It's definitely not up to the usual Exam Cram standards. The chapters are lacking facts and information, structure, and are quite frankly boring to read (yes, some technical books are quite entertaining or informative...;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You expect me to pass the exam with this?","review":"I give you 2 stars for effort. This book didn't not have any relevant information in it about the Server+ exam.It did cover the basics of the topics but it did not include any useful tips or proper practice questions relating to the exam. It did not go into detail on what to expect on the real exam or did it cover the objectives fully. I was very disappointed in this book and was surprised it was so thin for a study guide. Do not use this as your only source for the exam.

The original photos are held by the Omaha Public Library, can be viewed online, and are outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for neck support. Buy for lumbar, maybe.","review":"Bought this for lumbar and neck support due to disease. Lumbar is merely passing. And there is NOT ANY neck support. There is a gap between me and the back support that would need to be filled to provide support. The lumbar is attached by velcro. This product needs an additional piece to velcro for neck support to fill that gap. Buy a lumbar pillow and neck pillow -- cheaper on you. I still have to add three pillows to make this work because the design is lacking. Probably returning after being delivered just today. None of the previous reviews stated the lack of neck support requiring to add pillows or something to adjust for the poor design. I think it would be okay if you already have a really good chair that fits you like a glove. And then, what's the point of having to buy this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The new Obus *Ultra* Forme is much better than this one","review":"I purchased this Obus Forme High-back Backrest and found it wanting.

At various times I have lent one of these to friends and the biggest problem is to get them to return them.This is not a magic cure for all back problems but it is magic if it helps your back problem and since it is high back it does seem to help many people. As you can imagine it does help my back problem which recurs when I am forced to be without it for a week or so (traveling, for example).

However, when I got the book, I was a little dissapointed because out of 600 or so activities, I couldn't even get a week of lessons out of it. Partly was because some of the themes were for younger kids, and would only take up about ten minutes of circle time. Others, were thought out, but would require items that were not typical classroom materials. Another element that threw me off, was that I assumed the activities were tried by other teachers and recommended, but it seemed like they assimilated the ideas because they fit with the theme and not necessarily because they were approved by other teachers"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Dispersion of light to achieve fracture of white light is not significant.

At some point inmy teenage life, I can't remember whether it was before or after this DVD release, but I went to see Hilary live in the NIA, Birmingham. She was lip-syncing then.The most annoying thing about this DVD though, is that the footage is extracted from two seperate concerts, which just clearly proves that she is lip-syncing, as we are not even seeing the live performance, just seperate audio and seperate footage.I strongly do NOT recommend anybody to put themselves through this poor excuse for a \\"live\\" concert.

The voice dubbing for Hilary was an interesting choice, and I personally wish they hadn't done the dub--Hilary's vocals rock live. The real gem of this DVD are in its behind the scenes features. Seeing her practice with her band is such a great feature, and seeing her and her sister tour the bus for the first time.

Second of all, its all prerecorded, and you can tell because during the show i noticed the rubber flaps underneath the cymbals whenever the drummer would hit them (they stop any real noise from coming for the drums). As for the guitarists, I watched them very carefully, they dont hit any of the chords they are really hitting, and exactly HOW DO YOU GET A DRUM MACHINE IN THAT quickly if its not already recorded, its impossible (and plus a drum machine comes from a keyboard, but the drummer was \\"playing it\\").

Be prepared for down and dirty fights, for comic relief, and for scenes laced with insight and break-your-heart sincerity. Cal pulls forth emotion. But even if Cal Brantley weren't the star of the Loser's Club, Baker has created a host of other characters to entertain even the most jaded mystery readers. Harley, I think I'm in love.

I use them on the ground and up in the trees. While the picture may have been obvious to someone with good eyesight, that it is a two-handed tool, the text is not so clear.

It works as advertised and I was able to trim several trees and remove a dead evergreen from our yard the same day I received the Lopper.

Ironically, it's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount. This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2\\" socket wrench and a little common sense. I have a full size B&D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating.

I could wish that it were lighter, but I will take the weight to get the power. It goes right through three and four inch branches like cutting a piece of paper with shears.

The handles are safety made so that it will not operate without you pushing on both black buttons. Also, the chain guards seperate from the cutting chain so that if the width of the object you're cutting is a little thicker than you anticipated, you are still given some 'wiggle room' with the blade guards.

B&D makes tools for only the lightest of use. It is not unusual to get only a year's use of one of their tools and then have to replace it. Critical componets are held in place with thin plastic. Cheap bushings are used rather than bearings. Gears are plastic, not metal. Switches break from normal use. etc. And god forbid you don't drop it, because you'll be toast.

Not owning this album is highly frowned upon and i suggest that you buy it as soon as you're done reading this review.

This entire series of recordings is distinguished by his outstanding technique and intelligent rendering of the wonderful Chopin piano repertoire.

And it really is a shame. It's in the top 10 of his albums, and right behind Rust Never Sleeps in terms of live music. However, I do like the mystique of this not being on CD, even though I am glad Hawks and On the Beach are CD now. So what you need to do is buy the vinyl, and either buy a turntable and convert it or have someone do it for you because that is what I did and it is worth it. Yes, it's basically a $200 CD now, but I have other albums to convert. As far as the music goes, everything everyone else has said it correct - I sat there with the headphones during Last Dance and was blown away by the sonics of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart of All Youngs Music","review":"This has to be the Neil Young album to savour.

When Sendak died I looked at the reviews for Alligators All Around and thought it would be good too. The illustration is terrible. Very few things even allude to the fact that its the same person creating the books. Also, the concepts on each page are too abstract for a child learning their ABC's to understand. I would think a child would need to be 3 or 4 to start to understand the concepts of what is happening on the pages, but kids start learning ABCs before that. So, by the time they can understand the captions, they already know their ABCs. Simply using alliteration for weird actions doesn't make it clever or cute either. It is interesting that you follow the alligator family through the book, but that would also be lost on a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to improve their casting","review":"Bought these to do a complete swap out of all the brakes on a '03 Neon.

I wanted to return it because I have no use for it if my dog doesn't fit in it. Come to find out they charge a 20% restocking fee. After also paying for the return shipping I will have spent about $55 to get a refund of about $9. DO NOT BUY this product unless you are absolutely sure your dog will fit in it. And definitely DO NOT BUY FROM SAFE HOME PRODUCTS, INC unless you are absolutely sure the item will not have to be returned. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.

She feels better about riding in the car now and does enjoy seeing the scenary as we drive. My only complaint is that the front of the seat does sag a little. The bottom seems sturdy and there are enough straps to be able to adjust the seat to the correct height. Once the seat is in place, it is very easy to put my dog in and take her out of the seat. There is a strap to fasten her harness to and so far she hasn't been able to jump out at ll.Overall it was a good purchase and does the job I needed it to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific car seat","review":"I bought this for my porkie 12 pound Pomeranian and we are extraordinarily happy with it. She used to be a ridiculous nightmare in the car, because she wants to see outside and she wants to be close to me. She fits great, has room to turn around, can curl up and sleep in it, and she can easily see out the window. She always wears her harness which attaches to a clip on the device so she can't jump out. We drive for hours and she is very content and comfortable (of course we stop periodically for walkabouts). If I have a passenger, I hang the dog's car seat on the back of the passenger seat and she faces the back. That way, she's still close to me and she can still see outside. The bottom strap of the car seat has never interfered with my passengers' comfort in the front. It's lightweight, the straps are super easy to adjust, and it's secure and affordable. Terrific choice.

My rat terrier (7 lbs) is very crowded in the car seat. There is enough room for her to sit but really not enough room to get comfortable. The car seat was a hand-me-down from a Havanese (think Shiz Tsu) who was WAY too big for the car seat. The car seat gets hot. Very hot. There's not enough room for the dog to have a chew toy or anything to keep her occupied. It's not difficult to assemble, but it is difficult to dis-assemble if you need the seat. And lastly, one of the clips broke. So the seat cannot stay propped up, it sinks to the base of the chair.

I like that I have the choice of several alarm sounds. You also have the choice to wake to radio or CD.

I love the weekend sleeper that prohibits the alarm from going off on weekends (or any other regular days you choose). I also like that once the alarms are set (2 alarms)you don't have to reset the alarms everyday unless you choose to change the time for the alarm. Of course, listening to a cd before sleep and waking up to whatever format I choose is great. I have the cd come on at a low sound level then gradually raise the volume to ease me out of my sleep.

We like the sleek look but it's much too large for a night-stand table. The sound is terrific, even our kids like to play their cd's on it, and we like the wake-up features. The buttons are much too small on top of the unit and since the writing is silver on silver tone buttons it makes it very difficult to see which button you need to press.

The basic plot remains the same...only this time he stuffs three stories into one book. Once again, he includes the same elements that have pervaded the entire series.

He would do it that way for three or four steps until his invisible opponent and his real opponent were on the ground.

It offers some statistics, but only enough to support its current argument, and fails to consider the collective picture. There are some interesting observations that made me say \\"Yeah, I could buy that with more to go on...\\" but lack significant follow up or substantiation with the social, cultural, economic, or political developments of the past and present.

Do an online search for the following words: Smithsonian Seeger One grain of sand. You should find the Smithsonian Global Sound site with a sample of Pete Seeger himself singing the melody of his song. It's a very gentle, haunting lullaby.Of course, we're not blessed with Seeger's voice, so we simplify it a little. Still, I'm glad to know what it sounds like when he sings it--being able to sing in a tone that matches the lovely illustrations has made this a favorite book in our house.

I read an uncomplimentry review of the book in the Washington Post, but proceeded to buy and read the book anyway. I think the concept is what is so intruiging - who has read Lolita and not wondered what was going on through little Lo's head the entire time? But having read Lo's Diary I found it terribly dissapointing, so unimaginative and lacking in great prose - especially compared to Lolita! - that it becomes worthless. I read the entire thing, and although there were a few good parts (the part that is quoted on the back of the book is one of the few exceptional lines) there is truly nothing in it that sheds any more light on Lolita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat it up like candy!","review":"I wanted to love this book and hoped it would be worthy of its origins. It is not. However, it is an entertaining piece of fluff with none of the merits of Nabokov's \\"Lolita\\". The prose is not at all believable as the words of a teenager and there was little of the girlishness of the \\"real\\" Lolita. Still, I have to admit, I read it in one sitting as one does with any mindless book. Pia Pera had a brilliant concept, but she blew it. The Foreward by Dmitri Nabokov is warning enough. So, if you can put your purist literary opinions aside, this is a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible attempt at Lo's Perspective.","review":"I just finished this, and I hate to say that I am disappointed. From the language in the book, I found it hard to believe that Lo was just twelve years old. This story gave the impression that the author had forgotten what it was like to be a child. Instead of writing in the mind of a child, I get the impression that the author read a \\"How To\\" on being a child and drafted her work based on that. I realize that Lo was sophisticated for her age, but some of her vocabulary was just too advanced for a twelve year old. Further, the style of writing was so tedious to read that I found myself wanting to skip through paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is one too many stars","review":"This book was a waste of my money and is not worth my time to review.If you buy it, you'll regret it.

Reading \\"Lolita\\" itself alongside \\"Lo's Diary\\" shows that Pera, for the most part, fails miserably in her attempt to shed new insight into the character of Dolores Maze (aka Haze.) In addition, the aforementioned maturity of voice lends incredulity to the book, as no authentic twelve-year-old, no matter how precocious, could write a diary with language like that. All in all the book was a letdown, though it does get deliciously catty at times. Its beginning chapters shone above its dreary middle and ultimately dull denouement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Rarely do we find a unanimity of opinion in reviewer circles. Yet it happened for Lo's Diary. Every reviewer worth his column in the book supplement bashed and destroyed the book. I had to pick it up and read it.The premise seems promising enough, Lolita from her own perspective. Obvious issues in freedom, feminism, etc. This is most obvious, not by what the book says, but by the fact that the book exists. It is carried through in such an unpolished way that you're better off reading straight criticism, or better yet, another Nabokov novel.One wonders, especially after reading Pale Fire, whether Nabokov meant it to be a book about Lolita told by an egomanical Humbert, or rather, what Nabokov meant by it. Questions of betrayed promises of freedom (or whether promises of freedom are always betrayed?) about the silence of the opressed?Still, people don't disappear silently. Want the real Lolita? Read the original again. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Begin","review":"I stopped at the back jacket. Today, I was at the local monstrosity of book store, and was caught by the title. The concept seemed interesting, I supposed, but in the end I tend to believe that it's being is rather fundementally -wrong-. One of the more interesting aspects of Nabokov's original masterpeice is Humbert's delusions, Lo's inaccessability, the secrets and sorrow of the situation they'd both brought themselves into. I found the very honey drips of her personality that leaked through only once or twice in Nabokov's work added so much to the tragedy of the book. This sense of quiet tragedy, the secret life of a little girl and a man with a sick mind wasm I gather, unfortunately twisted for the sake of feminist retrospect. I found what quotes I could pull from 'Lo's Diary' were dull or written in a fashion that smacked of a short feature from the glossy pages of Cosmo. 'Lolita' was a shining example of literary brilliance, and this book never needed to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful.","review":"If I were the Nabokovs, I would have fought tooth and nail to keep this travety from being published.

The venturis hooked up fairly easily, but are paper thin, more like a slinky made of aluminum foil, but they still functioned fine all summer. I uncovered the grill this year and the burner is rusted (but still in working order) but the venturis are all rusted and broken and need replaced.

It is about 2\\" longer (1\\" either side of centerline) than one I replaced (many years old - really bad shape). So I'll get more heat and more useable grill area. Easy to install. Rated it a 4 ONLY because I wish it was made of high nickel stainless (so it would last longer) AND wish they'd include a WING nut for the stud that attaches on the bottom of the burner for fixing to the grill. Not a big deal on the wing nut, just would make it easier to install and I can get wnut (later) from the local hardware store. Time to grill some chicken!One other thing: if you're going to buy a grill, get one with a CAST housing, not \\"stamped\\" stainless or carbon steel.

The only attachment for the flexible gas pipes (VENTURI's) to the grill itself is with two little springs, obviously made for some other purpose, so no adjustment is possible to acheive a true blue flame. Finally, with reddened hands from the screw driver and twisting the tiny springs on to an available screw, the unit lights fine, but with a largish yellow flame, which is O.K. - but not optimum.

The venturi arms were stronger than I expected and held up nicely after inserting and removing the assembly from the grill several times as i adjusted the height of the legs.

The only thing innate to the opiates themselves is that they are addictive as are many other things in life to some individuals.

Dancing and singing along, my 7 month old thinks I'm crazy and loves being \\"be-bopped\\" around the living room. Would make a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for all ages","review":"Dan Zanes rules! We have four of his CD's now, but this was our first. His music covers many genres, all upbeat, and is real \\"move around\\" music. My favorite on this CD is the Wabash Cannonball. My son loves House Party and my youngest daughter is a fan of the counting song; she has taught it to her entire pre-school class. If Dan's goal is to have everyone singing and dancing, then he has succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby and husband groove to this CD","review":"My 18-mo.-old daughter perks up everytime I put this CD on the stereo. She bobs and wiggles and turns around in a circle. And it something I don't mind listening to again and again and again like some other children's CDs I won't mention by name. My husband really like this music, too, and will listen to it both w/ or w/o my daughter. A big hit in my family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids music we like, too!","review":"Finally people are making kids music that we can enjoy! Dan Zanes is great, there's no denying it. He ranks high up as a \\"most played\\" artist with our kids, right under the new Laurie Berkner DVD \\"We Are the Laurie Berkner Band\\" that they've latched onto (another great singer we really enjoy).Way-to-go for making kids music that more discerning music listeners can enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 month old loves this CD!","review":"Holden really responds to this CD especially Down in the Valley!

Thank you Dan Zanes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracking the ACT:with sample test on cd rom","review":"This is the worst book i have ever bought. Some of the test tips helped but it was mostly just common sense that came with twenty bucks.

Unlike the others in the series, such as X-Men or Spiderman, I thought these films rated about the same as the first Hulk: flat, unable to conjure the rich emotional mix of unique and clearly developed characters, and far too dependent on special effects. This is, of course, a matter of taste, but I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to forget that I was watching something made up. In this case, it felt derivative, the acting was OK but not solid or outstanding, and it didn't evoke a world that can live on in the imagination. In a word, it didn't work for me.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"This was a fun adventure for kids and adults alike.

It is an excellent value for the 2 movies. I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Movies - consistent characters","review":"I decided to get this 2-movie set version for the value and convenience. The original Fantastic Four movie disc offers the movie in Widescreen with a couple of featurettes. The Silver Surfer movie disc shows the movie in Full Screen format on side A and Widescreen on side B with commentary available. While I didn't expect all the bells and whistles on the second film that was offered in the other released editions, it would have been nice to have one featurette included.I enjoyed both movies as entertaining diversions. The special effects are quite good. The characters continue the first film's fun banter in the second film. However, don't expect great depth into the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Distinct Disappointment; Not Really a Spider Book At All!","review":"First off, this book's not even by Spider. I'm not vertain why he lent his name to it, much less wrote the introduction. The book itself is a loosely connected series of ramblings of a proto-typical dope-fiend from the 60's San Francisco scene. It's a bit trippy, and even mildly insightful once is a while, but was certainly not worth picking up if you're expecting anything like the quality of writing and storytelling that Spider Robinson imparts to all of _his_ works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renewing my faith in the series","review":"After reading volume 3 of Samurai Deeper Kyo, my faith in the series has grown. The art is wonderful, and while the lettering is very small, the dialogue is snappy and I think it's pretty well translated.In this volume the reader finally gets an idea of where the plot is going, and frankly, it's a very exciting turn of events. Violence! History! Supernatural demons! Sword techniques with long names! Fanservice for the guys! This manga has everything.And don't you dare compare it to Rurouni Kenshin. Let's be honest now, if you've read this far into the series, you know they are nothing alike. So I say, read this manga. If you're just venturing outside of the darling Adult Swim line-up (\\"d00d! Inu-yasha is leik the BEST anime ever. EVER, I SAY!\\") Then this is a nice introduction to manga, and if you're just looking for the plain old plot and violence line, well, this is for you also."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"This product is not recommended for purchase.

The DaVinci Emily Mini Crib was a beautiful buy, so I did not doubt the DaVinci brand when choosing a cradle for our bedroom.

It really can make you think about all sorts of random things, and that's one of the reasons that i loved this book so much! It has everything from adventure to (a little) romance. I would recomend this book to any age group and any gender (though i think girls would especially like but that's just me) who likes fantasy and adventure.~Also recomended: Twilight and New Moon by Stephenie Meyer and all of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of two minds","review":"Although I bought the book for my 12 year old niece to read for a school project I read it myself and I found it very absorbing and fun reading.

I found the book refreshing and full of potential for discussion between parent and child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess What?!","review":"This is such a great book! As a (...), I found this book fun, exciting, and a kind of mystery. If you don't like guessing, or tyring to figure out the plot, this book isn't for you. This book keeps you guessing 'til the very end. My sister, who is 10, also fell in love with this book. The number one reason I read this book is because it has a strong beginning. A little confusing, but strong. A great book that keeps you guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book 5 times!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this book.

Read this book and rate it a high rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the best","review":"This book was an absolute edge-of-your-seat adventure. A definite page turner and full of suspense! I recommend this book to children of all ages. Coren is a headstrong,thoughtful boy who fears life and everything in it but still stands up for what he believes in. Lenora is a feisty, spirited, young girl with an incredible imagination. Together the two are the most unbelievable pair in book history. Great Job Carol and Perry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Two Minds","review":"I really love this book. I like reading fantasy and romance. This book has both but has more fantasy in it. Princess Lenora is a girl who is turning 17. Her father brings Prince Coren to her for her birthday. Her parents and Coren's parents wants them to marry. Before they met both saw something in a mirror or water. They both don't want to marry each other and some how they both think that there is something wrong with each other. They travel to a another world were they both most trust each other to save themselves and others. I think that anyone who loves fantasy with a little bit of romance should read this book and read the sequel to it.

She told me it was a fantasy, and immediately, I lost interest because I am not a fantasy fan. She brought the book to school the next day. I decided to read it, only to oblige her. At approximately 6:00 pm this evening(Sunday, Sept 5) I picked up \\"Of Two Minds\\". I was absorbed into a whole realm of capriciousness and of romance and of pure magic and mysticism. It is now 7:22 pm. I finished nearly half an hour ago. I cannot wait to read the sequel, \\"More Minds\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad characters","review":"This book had an okay premise and a semi-creative plot (basically the whole \\"I didn't like the arranged marriage until I got to know him\\", and also a bit of \\"what kind of monster will I grow up to be?\\"). It could have been a good book, but the characters are just obnoxious. I was so annoyed at the princess', well, princessy attitude.The boy is just trying to help and she turns everything against him, when it's really her own fault.

But when Blake starts to sing at the end of the 70's there was nobody but he. His carreer was brilliant and by the end of 80's he was a really master of the voice. Ok his instrument it's not the most beauty but he can sing with a miracle technic, every coloratura was there, the \\"martellato\\" style, the spianato, and the fiato....what a fiato and you have to add the wonderful phrasing. He was one of those artist you have to see and hear live because he was even more electrifying on stage than in records.On The Rossini Tenor blake prove why he is the most important rossini performer of the last century and why he is still on the ear of every rossini fan. Hes a King between belcanto singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither pictorial nor history","review":"The information and pictures in this book are offered randomly and leave readers with a number of unanswered questions. The book is neither a coffee table pictorial nor a well-researched account on the nation's capital. Even though it presents some scattered information, nothing is systematic. When someone picks a book on the history of a certain city, she or he would like to learn about where the name of the city and its areas came from, what landmarks still stand today, what the stories behind them are and so on. Instead, this book pastes some random pictures and comments on them. At times, it does not even offer such commentary. I learnt a lot more about the history of Washington DC from Wikepedia than from this book. I certainly do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Cliche-Ridden As His Vapid Daily Column","review":"Bob Levey claims to care deeply about good writing. But he ignores Strunk and White's admonition that the writer should always keep himself in the background. Indeed, Flaubert once said that the writer \\"must be like God on the page, present everywhere yet visible nowhere.\\" Unfortunately, Levey inserts himself into nearly every one of the chapters (as he does in his insipid Washington Post columns), when it is clear the book would have been decent if he had stayed out of it.This book does have some scarce nuggets. The history of Washington is indeed riveting, but not because of any pedestrian rendering by Levey. Unfortunately, Levey is not qualified to handle the material, and the reader is left only to speculate about how good this book could have been in the hands of a more talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Model - Disappointed","review":"The swatter I received was an older model.

The compilers have played it safe here, choosing only established mainstream artists to feature in this collection.In past releases, Wow proved to be an excellent source where we could get a taste of new, up-and-coming or just plain too-quirky-for-radio artists. Sure, it made for some inconsistency in the overall sound, but it gave us a better idea of the diversity of Christian music out there. It gave the little guy a chance to get noticed and appreciated.This is an outstanding collection of songs and artists, make no mistake about that. It just doesn't cover the same territory that past Wows have. This will be of great appeal to those who embrace the mainstream.

All I needed was this Keyspan adapter and a download of the latest XP driver for the tablet from Wacom. I still have to use my Wacom power supply for the tablet (it doesn't get the power from the USB), but that's no big deal. The setup works wonderfully. It cost me $40 for the adapter but it saved me many hundreds by foregoing the purchase of a new tablet! Easy to use and works as promised. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will cause BSOD if used heavily","review":"I've used numerous 19HS for casual stuff over the years without incident; However I recently hooked two weather stations to a system running win7 x64 and now I get a BSOD (IRQL not less than...) every few days.

I tried the 10.5 driver and it did not work properly. Fortunately, I found a working driver on the tripplite.com web site. Although it is a beta version, it seems to work well.There is really no excuse for Tripp Lite to not provide a proper driver on the CD since Snow Leopard has been out for nearly a year. It is equally annoying that this is still in beta. AFter all, many users of these devices are Mac users because Macs do not have serial ports. I recommend Mac users consider getting the Trendnet usb to serial converter, which comes with a non-beta driver for Snow Leopard, and works flawlessly. The only advantage of the Tripplite version is the led which flashes when the device is receiving power and turns solid when the serial port has been opened by a program. This is a real advantage for those writing programs that use the serial port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Don't bother buying it. My USA-19HS worked initially when installed but when I unplug it from the USB port and reconnect it all it does is loop back information sent to it. It will not receive data sent to the serial side. I reloaded the drivers and it worked but as soon as I unplugged it from the USB and plugged it back in it no longer worked.All the diagnostics say everything is fine. It just does not receive data and echos back anything sent to it. Called TRIPP tech support which was totally useless. Their tech support does nothing more than read a script. I explained that it echoed back anything sent to it even when not connected to another device. Their response; the device it is connected to may not be compatible! I just told them it was not connected to anything. So I connected it to another com port on the computer with the same results. Their response; the device it is connected to may not be compatible!

The only problem that I had was in the installation. I installed it on Windows 7. I also installed it on Windows XP. During the install under XP, I had no problems whatsoever, however, My first Windows 7 installed failed.

Fortunately I was able to open the housing by pulling it apart. It worked just fine after pluging in the internals to the printer but it tended to unplug easily. So I took the empty housing and a Dremel tool and sanded down the area that was causing trouble and it worked. It took some time but the end result was worth it.

As for the goal to \\"clarify\\" the Asians mystique, I think the author added some fuel to the whole story and simply told where one can go to find plenty of cheap sex.

Not only this, but also the fact that they can take abrasive metal music and expose the inner beauty of their melodies and accent their percussive structures simultaneously.

While this is true, I feel that is not necessarily a negative.

If you trim/file them, the white disappears so that's not an option. Aside from being way too long, they just look plain unnatural. You can see the space between nail and press on. I will stick to the nail salon, even if it does cost more. After removing them a few hours after application, my toe nails are so irritated and funny feeling I wanted to have a foot soak right away.

They say that the Taylor's Ridge Trail is 0.4 mile from Ship's Gap when, in fact, the Trail is at Ship's Gap -- it is 0.4 mile from the Historic Marker about the Gap. They place Snake Creek Gap a few miles from Ship's Gap on the north side of Villanow. The Gap is actually several miles south of Villanow. Their explanation of why Federal troops were left ar Villanow (to prevent Johnson's retreat from Dalton) makes no sense. If the rest of the book is as filled with mistakes as this tour, travelers will come away from their drives with a very skewed view of history and geography.

After my wife suffered for a solid year and a half with UTIs and many rounds of antibiotics, we have found relief in D-Mannose.

No more infections. No more living in fear of the next one. Freedom of anxiety after intimacy. No more horrible pain.*** IMPORTANT*** Make sure you try to get your urine alkaline. Cranberry, OJ, blueberry, etc will basically cancel out the beneficial properties of D-Mannose as it causes the bacteria to go into a \\"protection\\" mode instead of releasing hold of the bladder wall and attaching to the D-Mannose to get flushed out.

I'm still very tired of constantly having to treat my infections with antibiotics though, so I've decided to turn my focus again to d-mannose, wondering maybe if was just this brand. There is definitely some hope in reading others reviews who explain for them it wasn't d-mannose, but this specific brand that didn't work for them and I hope that maybe the same will be true for me and there's only one way to find out!

My UTI's are way more infrequent, and when they do come I can clear them up within a day or two. I take a dose every few hours during an infection, then one dose a day in between as a preventative measure. I haven't felt this free of UTI's in years.

It was suggested to her for one of her pups with the same issue. Since using this product, my girl hasn't had any issue at all. It's been about 2 years now and the only thing that keeps her clear of infection and in great shape without problems. Amazing Stuff!

I take a tablespoon in water every morning (it's tasteless) and I haven't had one since I started doing so. (I used to get one every week!) I can't believe it is so easy and so many women are still suffering because they don't know about it. I still haven't figured out why doctors don't recommend it. Maybe they want us to pay for antibiotics!! I honestly don't know if this brand is any better than other D-Mannose products, but I read that the powder is better than the pills and this brand had so many good reviews (and was cheaper for a larger amount!) on Amazon, so I tried it and I'm going to stick with it. I really feel like it's a small miracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show gets 1 star, bonus features *probably* earn 1 more","review":"I loved the premise, but boy was the show a let down. A four comic team is a real drag when 3 of the 4 comedians aren't that funny. Even this could have been countered by giving Dane a bit more face time than the rest (and with material that most fans hadn't already heard many times)...but of course that didn't happen. The bus footage wasn't very insightful or interesting. Neither were the obligatory reality show excursions that they took.I haven't seen the DVD yet (it's still on pre-order). Hopefully the bonus footage captures some of what the show itself missed. If not, count this as a 1 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G!!","review":"Got this DVD set as a delayed Xmas present. I was under the impression, from the case, that this was going to be a lot of stand up performances of Dane and the others. All it is is a series about them going on tour. There is nothing interesting about it. Nothing rewarding about it. I love Dane's jokes and all, but you only see about one joke from each comedian per episode. And the jokes that Dane tells are the one's from Retaliation. I wouldnt recommend this. I gave this 2 stars because it comes in a metal case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass - Only for the hardcore","review":"Love Dane, often listen to his CDs repeatedly at work. Show was \\"blah\\".

O/w even if you love his stand up, it's just not an entertaining show."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Reality Show Stupidity Than Comedy","review":"I am a huge Dane Cook fan, but he's been disappointing me lately. My biggest complaint about this DVD is that it does not include a clip of the full stand-up act. It's mostly about their 'adventures' on tour, providing only sample bits from the show. And the bits are FUNNY! I want more stand-up comedy, less reality show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"I'm also a Dane Cook fan, but not this time around. Tourgasm had potential. And despite that potential - 4 comedians traveling across the country in a tour bus - this reality TV-like concept falls flat on its face. There was no comedy throughout the entire DVD. NOTHING WAS FUNNY! The comedians in it complain more than they make jokes. This DVD was a waste of money and time. Spare yourself.Dane, if you're out there, stop with this promotional stuff and give us something with more substance. Your bits are hilarious. Your future as a reality TV-star? No so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Not Funny","review":"It took me several tries to get through these DVDs. How could someone so funny be this unfunny...

I apparently thought it was the comedy tour that Dane does his skit about The Price is Right and the WHEEL OF BLOOD.

Anyone want to buy this from me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly packaged","review":"Of the three DVD's included, the majority of them ran fine, however one of the discs froze up several times.

The interactions between the four are sometimes insightful, sometimes annoying, and often entertaining if not particularily hilarious. As a reality show it's ok and worth watching maybe once. But you know what would have made this show great? If it was funny. The standup routines including Dane Cook's might make you smile once or twice but there's little in the way of side splitting hilarity to be found. In fact there isn't any. No full set is provided either, rather just edited bits and pieces, dribs and drabs. For a reality show it's not bad, for a comedy dvd it's covered in flop sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good dvd for the price","review":"for a 3 dvd set this was pretty good. it was funny and interesting.

Because it is a story about a mother who is convinced her drug-addicted daughter has been murdered \\"Last Step\\" evokes the \\"We came to believe...\\" passage that all twelve-steppers know. It is no treatise on any program, though, because it is also a story about a woman who is taking her first step toward independence and toward love.Here we have a tale about how a woman gathers up her strength to follow her convictions and, in doing so finds more strength. Here we have a story that combines a whodunit with some memorable characters, a little romance and a straight-forward attack at moving a mystery along.

I purchased several cookbooks that I love and the recipes are great. I then purchased Dr. Phil's cookbook. I have tried several recipes and none of them are worth cooking.

He has given me some great tips in many areas of my life, so when I heard him mention this book on his show I ordered it immediately. I'm delighted with what I got. The recipes are easy and use normal ingredients - not lots of expensive stuff from gourmet shops that you will never use again. Since both my husband and I work full time we don't have a lot of time to cook so I need something that doesn't take hours to prepare. We tried the Dijon-Roasted Salmon today and it was delicious.

I watched the episode where Robin was making her oven fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I was sold. I immediately ordered the book. I made them tonight following the recipes to a tee. I am now still tasting the awful taste of the cumin from the chicken in my mouth and the overpowering rosemary from the potatoes. Don't get me wrong I love both of these seasonings. But, the mixture was too much. All of the leftovers are now in the garbage disposal. I have been making low-fat oven fried chicken and mashed potatoes for years. The recipe I usually make for the chicken, comes from \\"Cooking Light Low-Fat Ways to Cook Chicken\\" cookbook. That recipe is fantastic, with basically all the same nutrition values as Dr. Phil's book. The potatoes you can follow the recipe right off the can of chicken broth. The brining of the chicken was a useful tip though.

'He's a Deep Deep Lake' sounds like a song that was left off the album 'Kid A' by Radiohead...only it would've been the best song on that album. It's got an awesome bassline. And 'Sick of the Shame' is a song you might hear from Coldplay. The song fades into a wall of sound which is followed by a Phishy hypnotic funk outro. The other songs on the album are listenable although the vocals wan about. Beautifully depressing, Film School has made a mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like so many books... Not what I thought","review":"I thought this book would provide information (it does, but very little) about the lazy scholarship and outright denial that many leftist, particularly, in academia have about communism. The book ends up being a whole lot of name calling, and very little presenting of actual facts.I recognize the schizophrenic love affair the left has with communism and am always looking for more and more (as if it was needed) facts to show how evil and devestating communism is. Instead, this book belongs on the bookshelf next to Al Franken and Ann Coulter and more ideological shrieking.Don't waste your time, this book is so much fluff.

Bought crossman pointed in same weight and went form 11\\" group to 2\\" group immediately and about 20 shots later cut one hole at 18 yards 1 inch wide (plus one flyer/my bad). I have heard the Benji NP could be a bit finnicky. I am here to tell you there seems to be some truth in the story. Daisy Pellets were dirty and lots of small pieces coated the breach after loading. Crossman pellets were clean and every pellet fit the same when loaded. Daisy was very inconsistent sizing but if this works for you in your particular gun that's great, it was terrible in mine.

For instance, he makes different ships (or fighters) and weapons from Star Wars then goes around the house to different parts of the galaxy. These are much easier to put together and especially *PULL APART* (independently) than Legos! The only issue we've had is sometimes he pushes them together pretty hard, so one of the little edges that snaps onto the other piece gets pushed backwards. But we've only had to throw one away.

The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly. 3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum). 5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings. You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory. It must be formatted in FAT 32.

If I had to do it over again, I'd spend a bit more and get a better player - one that will last long enough for me to get tired of the songs I have on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Multipe problems!","review":"I bought this MP3 player on sale and at the time, I thought it was a steal. But I quickly found it was not so.- The headphone jack doesn't play stereo (only mono) when you put the headphone jack in regularly. The only way you get stereo is if you pull out the jack half-way. I'm willing to accept that this may be a dificiency with my player alone.- When you upload files, the player puts them whereever it wants. It doesn't put them in order, like the newest to the oldest added files.- Scroll feature is not adaquate if you have a lot of files. It takes forever to get to the song you want because it scrolls one at a time.- It doesn't read a lot of MP3 files that I know are good, because I can play the same songs on my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for Granddaughter","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my tech savy Granddaughter.

After reading a number of positive reviews, I purchased this device to use with audiobooks from Netlibrary. The first disappointment was in discovering that although you can play wma files on the e130, it cannot bookmark them. Therefore, it is difficult to find where you left off, especially when you're listening to an 11-hour book. The next disappointment came when after only two weeks, the device will no longer power up. And finally, I am frustrated by the fact that I paid $66 for this device and two weeks later the price is $54. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Quality, Stupid Software","review":"I have been using Creative Muvo for a while, which allow you to play songs in a folder. But this stupid Sansa only wants you to sort your music by Artist, Album and ... Anyway, I like to edit play list on my computer and selete maybe only one or two songs from an album. I like to listen to difference singers. But this become very tough with Sansa, you have to either listen to all songs or you have to edit your Tags.I hope there is a firmware upgrade soon, which allow you to play a specific folder.The sound quality is so lame, WOW is totally a joke.

The SD storage slot is a nice touch. The screen makes it very simple to play songs by title, artist, album, or random shuffle.

One really feels as if they know Alice Faye by the end and having her complete film and discography is always useful (she only ever did one stage show!). Funniest bit: Upon meeting Alice Faye for the first time, a starstruck Betty Grable said, \\"You have eyes just like a cows.\\"!! Awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved Alice Faye, Book is hard to Read","review":"Book is about one of Hollywood's sweetest gals.

It is big enough to accommodate my nephew well into his first year. Only thing is the mattress pad that comes with the crib is totally insufficient if you want the baby to sleep comfortably. Definitely get another mattress. Also, it's hard to find mini crib bedding (unless you order it here) but regular crib sheets can be tucked under and pulled tight so they fit fine. Quick shipping. Overall a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good simple design","review":"The crib arrived today and we excitedly pulled it out. The packaging was minimal but sufficient; the hardware solid and substantial (and nothing missing). The whole thing came together in about 20 minutes, no fuss, no confusion. Overall, I am impressed with the simple but solid design.Oh, and I've heard some people complain about the thinness of the floor material and I would only say this: it is made of MDF, a sort of dense particle board that is very hard. Compare the weight of a 3/4\\" sheet of plywood with a 3/4\\" sheet of MDF and you'll know what I mean. Our toddler has many pounds to gain before he has any chance of putting a foot through that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this crib!","review":"This is a fantastic little crib. Granted, it will have a limited lifespan for my 20.5\\" 6 month old. But, at present, he still fits with plenty of room to spare and I'm confident this crib will last through his first year. I initially purchased this crib for it's size and design. I prefer contemporary lines and natural wood. However, I didn't realize the portability of the crib would also come in handy. We were able to drag it from bedroom to bedroom as we moved the baby into our bedroom and then out again. We use the crib with the Da Vinci 50 coil mini crib mattress (I threw out the thin mattress pad the crib comes with)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool","review":"I actually got this bed as an alternative to caging my poodle and shih-tzu.

Some of my friends used their convertible cribs up to 18 m, I am hoping we will be able to use our mini crib at least for 1 year, we have a 18 lbs 3.5 month old here... The only thing we don't like is the mattress, flimsy and noisy, plastic crinkly noise, wish they sold it without a mattress or improve it. Didn't use rocking feature because it is more important for us to be able to move it around. I purchased it mostly because of that and I like the rounded yet simple features if this crib. Note if you install a mobile, hard to get through standard doors because of that plastic mount on the outside, but possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied with quality and refund service","review":"The product is overrated. It is not sturdy. The lock buttons do lock together but the tabs on the post,(small plastic inserts that fit into grooves), slide in and out with a small nudge.

When you pay so much money for a \\"coveted Swiss watch\\" you would think it should do the one thing its supposed to do, show time, precisely - that's not the case. Also, if you buy this watch online you have to mail it in to Omega for repair. If you want to take it for repair to authorized repair center, you have to pay for the repair out of pocket. If you need a watch that never needs batteries get yourself a nice Kinetic Titanium Seiko. It cost 3 times less, its lightweight and always precise.

She demands a three month period to get to know each other before they cosummate the marriage. They marry and then set out to trap the arsonist known as Lazarus. Lazarus is infatuated with Julia and calls her Flame. It is all Morgan can do to keep Julia safe. This is a great romance and mystery novel. There are many red herrings that make you think you know who Lazarus really is, but it is not until the end of the book that we really discover Lazarus.

I'm a reader who enjoys a flawed hero in a romance and this one was good. The story was well-developed and well-written with one exception. Any one who has ever had severe burns knows how damaged not only the skin can be, but also the underlying muscles, tendons and bone structure. I found it somewhat incredulous how quickly our hero healed without becoming a laudanum addict for his pain and with so little crippling effect.

This story contained two extremely likeable characters. The dialogue between them was so entertaining and well worded. I loved every encounter between them.

If you want to know what is REALLY going on here, as opposed to what the narrator says is going on, you will have to pay attention. (The narrator is not necessarily being one hundred percent candid about everything.) Nothing is an accident--every detail of the scenery, every nuance of the characters' facial expressions, and most especially the choice of words...a lot of the phrases have more than one possible meaning.\\"Killer Smile\\" may look a lot like an old EC Comics horror tale, suitable for reading at Halloween--but the story actually takes place on Christmas Eve. In all of the best Christmas stories, miracles happen and wishes come true for one or more characters...sometimes in unexpected ways. This one deserves to be read twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I did not like this book! The author had good potential but she contradicted herself alot throughout the book.

The rest of the music \\"really swings\\" and is great fun. Jive Junction, the DVD of the 1943 movie, was a surprise - I didn't realize teenagers were already acting that much like the 1950s in 1943! Listening to the teen lingo of the day is nostalgic as well. Speaking of nostaliga, the second half of the movie was filmed at the Hollywood Bowl. You can see the venue and hear the Bowl orchestra as they were in 1943! The video quality is certainly watchable.

It tells the story of Camel in such a way, that even a 30 year fan of the band like me, can find fresh and new things to learn about the band's history.I really enjoyed watching it.A little tip. I ordered both my Camel DVD's from Camel productions and they came signed by Andy Latimer himself. As a guitar player since 1968, I have long been influenced by Andy.

The plot itself is highly melodramatic, sensational, and confusing. The SURPRISE ending might have come from some other novel since it has no logical connection with the plot.

All the usual elements are here, but feel pasted on and contrived...the \\"derrieres and one doudoune\\" scene mentioned in another review is the perfect example. It's a bit creepy because in all the other books M. P. is the innocent victim of surprise risque encounters, not the perpetrator bordering on a dirty old man. Worst of all, the plot is boring...perhaps it's not fair for me to review since I stopped halfway through. If you're a huge fan, give it a try, since it's part of the series and you might disagree with me.

When he finally gets his first break, there are wild circumstances that get in the way of the catch. Eventually luck swings in the right direction and the killer is caught but with a big stretch of the law.Lucas has a way with women. I think Jennifer is a wench.

The story line of Rules of Prey was tedious. Lucas makes Woods' Stone Barrington appear the amateur womanizer!It was astounding that this author would choose to toss in some strong anti-NRA language. That's enough to cause Sandford to be crossed off my list of preferred writers.Are there really avid cop story readers who don't appreciate the constant efforts of the NRA to ward off the gun control left?

I stopped reading Sanford's Bad Blood because it was so terrible. Rules of Prey was better, but not by much. I actually finished reading this one. John Sanford can write. I'll give him that, but writing skills is not why I gave him one star. His main character in Rules of Prey treats women despicably, and they're alright with that, like that's going to happen. Furthermore, the main character is depicted as a man who feels that the ends justifies the means. I don't feel I have to agree with everything that a character might do, but Sanford's characters leave me with a feeling of yuck. I don't like being in their heads. I don't want to have anything to do them. I don't like them -- any of them. The sooner I can forget about this book the better. I have concluded that I am not a John Sanford fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is more than the paperback","review":"Depending, of course, on where you buy it--the cost is the same from Amazon. Outrageous. Won't buy this book, or buy from Berkley/Penguin, until it's offered at a fair price. Amazon lied in promoting the Kindle as a lower cost way to read.The rating, obviously, is directed at price gouging, not artistic merit. However, it reflects on artistic merit in that Sanford, and Berkley, allow it. No shipping costs. No printing costs. Same price. What's wrong with this picture?[Edit: The rating reflects on the ethical merit of Sanford and Berkley, as opposed to artistic.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Sickening","review":"I was absolutely disappointed and appalled at this book. There was more sex in this book than in some trashy romance novel. The women were so stupid and disfunctional that I couldn't even relate to them. I don't know any women that live like these women do. This could have been a good book but this authors wild fantasies got in the way. If you want a good suspense thriller stay away from Rules of Prey it is not worth your money. The name of this book should have been Rules of how to Prey on Women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for \\"Mr. Macho\\" only","review":"Disappointing book! The male characters are superficial and brimming over with mega-macho egos (ie, the main character drives a fancy sports car and has girls falling over themselves to be with him, etc.). The book also has plenty of unnecessary profanity and disturbing violence. If you appreciate quality literature, I definitely recommend that you skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prey for Davenport","review":"While reading this book I kept waiting to get to the part that would scare me so much I would \\"get out of bed and go downstairs to make sure the front door was locked.\\" Never happened, all I got was annoyed. I think Lucas Davenport is a total creep and did it bother anyone else that his pregnant girlfriend drank wine and beer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Protagonist leaves a lot to be desired","review":"But I had a problem that was big enough to remove on star from my rating: the protagonist (and the love interest he impregnated). The main character is a pig. Pure and simple - he's all over the place with women (and apparently this behavior isn't confined to just the first book). I don't particularly find that to be an appealing character trait, so it's hard to like the lead in a series when that's the way he behaves. The woman he's going to have a baby with is a back-stabbing twit whom I also dislike, even thought I don't appreciate that he was hopping in bed with a criminal witness on the side, behind her back.I may continue on with the series, but if these characters continue to behave like idiots, I doubt I'll be able to for much longer. I'd eventually grow to despise them and that never bodes well for me when it comes to books. :-p"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG - What a Rush ...","review":"Not your cuddle-up in front of the fire mystery thriller ...I have previously not given much thought to any of the \\"Prey\\" series, considering them too violent, too stereotypical, or something. Boy - was I in for a surprise! Lucas Davenport, the main character of these books, has a well developed persona from the get go. This being the first book of the series, as well as one of John Sandford's earlier works, was refreshingly riveting and I found myself not wanting to be distracted from reading more and more as I got into the book - I just finished this and have already started on the next book, \\"Shadow Prey\\" and it is equally as attention-getting as \\"Rules of Prey\\". I do love good mysteries - particularly when the characters get to evolve through development in ensuing books. Thank you Mr. Sandforda good read - not for the faint-hearted"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill Ride with some Twists","review":"My first \\"Prey\\" book and I'm hooked.

Sandford is too good a writer..and too successful to need this , so why does he do it?? I went through my copy and used whiteout on the swear words!!(and there were a lot) and then looked at the text again. Every word missing, or every phrase , was totally unneeded....did not contribute at all to the text. So.. the prey series books are very good.. easy to read etc..but be forewarned.. there is a lot of profanity. If this does not bother you then go for it. I will use library copies..not my books so it does not bother me that much.. but i will not pay $$ for these books. three stars for the story...two stars for the book. I note that sandford is not alone in this new?? trend; the later Parker books(Donald Westlake) also had unneeded words... I guess i will just have to adapt.. not like!! but adapt. Everybodies doing it(not Lee Child so far!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prey Series review - good, fast read","review":"First, I'm reviewing the whole series just right here at the start, no point in going book by book. For a good summary of the series and it's draw, read Chris MB \\"CMB\\" review (should near the top of the list). I like that explanation of how a tired genre can still work - good characters, not over the top, fast pace.Why I like the series is that each book is new and though the characters grow and change, it's nothing absurd. Also, the problems / villains seem real, not like a comic. But while it's good that the bad guys aren't supervillians, it would have been nice if every now and then one was really smart. I find overall the villains lack depth or flare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davenport you are the man!","review":"Wow, Wow, Wow!!! Lucas Davenport has brought detective novels to a new high.

Boy, was i wrong! Everyone hates lawyers and this one will not make you feel any better about them. I was not going to read this book from what my friends who had read it told me. I decided to take a chance and try it out, I am happy I did. Once again Lucas Davenport shows us that he is human and that he can make mistakes. He even can cover up for himself. Davenports humanity or maybe lack of being a superman is what makes it so easy to sit down and read this book. It feels less like you are reading but more like you are having a beer with a friend and swapping war stories. READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for it too end!","review":"The main character is a womanizer who would be a modern-day Human Relations nightmare. I found myself cringing at the condescending way that he talks to and treats people. The plot was okay, but I just couldn't get past the jerk. He seems to have the common interest at heart, but comes off as a 1940's detective from a B flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruined it for me","review":"I was interested enough to keep reading, but I found the pacing slow in spots. There seemed to be a lot of interaction with the media.The best parts of the book were with the main character, but I still didn't really care for him. He's a playboy who has one woman pregnant while he sleeps with another, and still fantasizes of yet another. Meanwhile he had proposed to the pregnant woman...talk about morals that are out of whack.I wanted to like this book but the ending ruined it for me. The last 10-15% of a book should have the reader eagerly anticipating the ending; sadly I just wanted to reach it. Once I got there, I felt like I had wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Only 4 starts cause of Jennifer","review":"Was well written, exciting. The main character is great, interesting but MAN I just cant stand Jennifer his horrible future live-in love interest that gets herself pregnant on purpose without his knowledge. I almost considered not even finishing it because of her despicable deceitful behavior. I was forced to make sure that down the series she leaves because she just turns my stomach. She gets herself knocked up which is bad enough, then constantly does things that are untrustworthy and awful. Shes terrible. I hope she dissapears forever.Luckily 4 books down I see he has a new love interest.

I decided to go back to the beginning and see how Davenport started out.It was nice to see where the money came from and that he began as a tough guy. As with the other books I've read, I'm not wild about his main girlfriend/wife. The game development detail adds a lot to the character and how he works.The hunt for the maddog kept me hooked. There's nothing quite like the take-down of an obnoxious jerk, for a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and drawn out","review":"This book is long and drawn out and not all that interesting.

The best thing I can say about this book is that it is well researched, but I have to wonder if it was not just too well researched. Do we need all this detail about both McNamara's maternal and paternal antecedents and those of his wife and ex-girlfriend?The author is way too much in love with irritating literary devices such as his use of nouns when pronouns or proper names would suffice (\\"a secretary of defense and a Quaker\\" instead of \\"McNamara and Morrison\\"). Once or twice and it's clever, but these devices are used continuously throughout the book. The work would have been better and more readable had it been half as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great concept in search of a great editor","review":"The concept behind The Living and the Dead is great. Unfortunately, the execution is subpar. The author seems incapable of telling a story in serial fashion. He starts one aspect of a story, only to drop it and move to something else before returning to the original line of inquiry. Much of the book's potential power is lost in the writing style. Additionally, some of the connections the author tries to draw between and among the individuals profiled, the war and McNamara's convinctions are tenuous at best. Heavy use of a blue pencil would have made this work much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong, wrong, wrong","review":"Bothe McNamara and Hendrickson were wrong about the war then and wrong about it now. It was eminently winnable. Hendrickson's one-sided propagandistic account is biased, dull and hysterical in tone. His prose is dense and obscures rather than elucidates the subject. And Norman Morrison deserved to burn -- it's just a good thing that chance at the last moment took his daughter Emily our of harm's way. Ultra liberal pap. Pass, and buy Ron Spector's After Tet instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reason for Anger","review":"These poems contain a good deal of anger and remind one of the late 1960's and the AIM movement. But why shouldn't there be anger? The same injustice toward Indians and gays continues today.

However, even though this book definitely cannot be considered very educational, some remedies presented with such simplicity that can be effectively be used at any home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya love","review":"A fabulous book, well written and so much solid information from the women who learned straight from a Maya Healer herself, Don Elijio Panti. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking/needing \\"real\\" healing... laughter and prayer are the best medicine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatil","review":"Excelente sonido para su categoría.Versatil y de gran nitidéz. Suena muy bien en ensayos donde no se amplifique la batería."},{"rating":"1","title":"Péssima produo","review":"Um campeonato como este merecia um vídeo com produo profissional. Apesar de ser um apaixonado por Tango, nem isso salvou minha opinio... No gostei e no recomendo.:("},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"It was every thing I was looking for in a good product not much more I can say every thing was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Formula Doesn't Work!","review":"I loved Grant's Ant Stakes until they took the arsenic out. I had great success two years ago with them, then bought the new ones and they didn't work. The ants just kept coming. Then I found on old one in the back of my cabinet and put it out and it got rid of the ants. That was 2 months ago. I scoured all the old hardware stores in town, but they had sent the arsenic ones back to the company. I think some states might still sell the old formula, but not California."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WORK!","review":"This item DO NOT earn any stars, because it simply DO NOT WORK. There are ant bait stations in the package, I've tried three times, never worked. Ants just go around. I threw the rest of away. DON'T waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grants \\"used to\\" kill ants","review":"I used these first in 2008 when I had ants everywhere. I haven't seen an ant since then. Naturally this spring when I saw ants again, I went to the store and bought another pack of grants stakes and put them where I saw ants. I noticed this time however the ants don't pay them any attention. I have yet to see one ant crawl anywhere near the stakes. I did notice they used to be metal around the bait now it is all plastic. I am not sure if that contributes to the problem or not. Either way this time they have been a complete and utter failure. I moved on to the terro stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"These have never worked for me or anyone I've talked to","review":"Having wasted money on these and other products, I finally decided to do some serious research. The bottom line is that fipronil is the best active ingredient. It spreads easily through the colony, and the killing effect is both reliable and sufficiently slow that ants don't die off before doing so. See my review of Combat Ant Gel, which contains fipronil.The other issue is whether ants take a given bait; there are sweet ants and protein ants, and your little invaders may completely ignore this and other products. This is another reason why a gel has a much higher guarantee of working: if you need to, you can mix it with food they like, although fipronil does work via contact as well. If Grant's ant stakes actually worked for you, you just got lucky. If you're searching for reliable ant control, go with a fipronil-based gel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"I purchased this product from the local Home Depot, based on the recommendation of a store clerk. I have placed several of the traps directly in the line of ants that comes from outside of the house to the kitchen. However, the ants went right around the traps and they do not seem to have any interest in the poison. Next, I tried to put some food on the traps - ants came and took the food, but ignored the poison. As per one of the reviewers' suggestions, I have also tried to stir the gel with a toothpick, to no success. From what some reviews are saying, my understanding is that this product used to work great before they changed the formula, but at this point it seems to be ineffective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ant's not interested","review":"The ant's are not attracted to this in the least. It says on the package that the product is guaranteed- but does not give any info as to what to do to return the product. Terro works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Works...Too Fast For Me","review":"I had 2 major problems with Grant's Ant Stakes:1) The ants didn't seem particularly fond of it. It's probably just the variety of ant that I have, but they don't seem to flock to it. But, the reason for that probably is...2) It killed my ants too fast. The idea is for this to get back to the colony and the queen...but the ants that got to the poison didn't make it off the counter, let alone back to the nest. It's hard to get the line going if the scouts croak before getting back home.The ants I have are very small, even for ants (about 1/16\\" long), so that probably isn't helping. So, it might work for your ants, but it really isn't having an impact on mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work anymore, waste of money","review":"I used to have a box of the Grant Ant Stakes and they seemed to work great. I needed to get a new box and got one from Home Depot (with the Ambro packaging), and it is completely ineffective. I buried the stake deep so the hole with the bait is almost at ground level. The ants have now built their ant hill almost over the stake. Sigh... It seems to be their way to have a good laugh over this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars, does not work -- do not buy this","review":"As others have noted, the old ones worked well. The new formulation simply does not attract the ants.If I caught each little bugger and stuffed the bait down their gullets, this might work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ants laugh at my feeble efforts.","review":"My home is overrun with ants. It's real bad. So I took the offensive. It was between Grant's or Raid at my local grocery store. I already knew Raid didn't work so I went with this. I should have just lit my cash on fire. I threw one of these directly in the middle of an ant trail. Sure the ants were crawling over it but they were completely ignoring the bait. Back to the drawing board. I'm going to hit up a hardware store where they have a much larger selection of ant death.I live in SoCal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all","review":"Used the product as instructed and nothing. The ants casually passed by every stake showing zero interest in it. After doing some research online, I poked inside the opening with a toothpick. That seemed to have some effect but not much. Ended upo buying another product that started working right in front of my eyes. If Grant's product doesn't work for you, try Hot Shot Liquid Ant Bait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews before buying","review":"Like many others are saying, this product made by the same brand used to work GREAT. My family wouldn't buy any other. Now they're just raking in the profits from an old reputation. These stakes DO NOT WORK. They used to, but they've changed something in the ingredients and ants simply ignore them now. We even placed some right in the middle of a row of marching ants and they just kept marching right around and over it. Do NOT buy this thinking that you have used them before and expect them to work just as well now. That's what I did. Complete waste of money."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],O={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-c61d3702"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/39.md","filePath":"quotesmag/39.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/39.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
