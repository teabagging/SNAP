And it's a thin plastic that seems like it can easily crack with heat underneath the hood (hot/cold/hot/cold etc.)For the cost of buying a separate fuse and going through all the hassle looking for it, I just opted not install one until I see a decent priced one at WalMart or elsewhere.

The CD does not contain any of the \\"songs\\" from the movie! What it does contain is the music that takes place in between the \\"songs\\". You know- dark, moody sounds, etc. There are no lyrics on the CD, and certainly none of the thumping techno you may be looking for. If you want some moody stuff that played in the background of Blade, this is for you, if you want the more lively stuff, you are better served by going to the \\"other\\" Blade CD. On that one, I must agree W/ the reviews that state \\"don't buy it for the techno\\", as only the last 4 songs ARE techno. The bulk of the CD is hip-hop & rap. But I bought it anyway, because the New Order remix of Confusion is so delicious that its worth the price of admission alone. Makes me want to go kill a vampire or two myself!

The first one--the one with lyrics that begins right when they show all the vampires dancing--is \\"Tao of the Machine\\" by BT, and The Roots. Run a search on google, I found a downloadable mp3 from some foreign site. The second song, the techno music without lyrics, is \\"Blood is Pumping\\" by Voodoo and Serano.

But, is it worth drinking toxic poison every morning?So, I washed all the removable parts again and ran at least 10 tanks of water through to see if the odor would subside.

The timer was not too bad, but it was definitely more difficult than the Krups ProAroma timer had been. It was hard to determine whether the timer was set to \\"On\\" or \\"Off\\". It was almost impossible to set the length of time that we wanted the coffee pot to remain on. It made a good cup of coffee. And the glass carafe was easy to pour and did not drip.

There's even an entire story about the origins of toilet paper (i.e. the Sears catalog).There is one warning that should be mentioned here: This 3rd edition is full of spelling and grammatical word errors.

I guarantee, however, that it will never again see the inside of a CD player. I hate to write a review this harsh because I LOVE RINGO, but yikes...how the mighty have fallen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album that always gets dissed","review":"With this Ringo proved that he wasn't trying to be a flashy over the top rock star. He was just having fun making music that he enjoyed. I think that fun comes across through his performance on the album. \\"Who Needs A Heart\\" and \\"Tonight\\" contain all the elements of being hit singles. Ringo's vocals are good on all the songs on this album. If you like fun rock and roll buy this, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not among the best of Ringo Starr's albums","review":"Ringo Starr's BAD BOY offers three worthwhile songs: \\"Hard Times,\\" a solid rocker; \\"Heart On My Sleeve,\\" a from-the-heart pop tune; and \\"Tonight,\\" in which Ringo delivers an affecting vocal about new love. Beyond that, it varies from so-so to so-what. The production value on \\"Who Needs A Heart\\" and \\"Monkey-See, Monkey-Do\\" grew on me through the years, although I wouldn't include either on a best-of collection (and Ringo hasn't asked me to compile one). Ringo Starr's BAD BOY is for the fan who wants to have everything. Those who would like to hear one of his best albums should try TIME TAKES TIME, RINGO, or GOODNIGHT VIENNA; the latter two now include superb CD bonus tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it only if you've got every other Ringo albums","review":"Giving this CD five stars is pure madness. How many millions stars would you give to the Beatles' albums then ? Really, I'm a hardcore Beatles fan but I've got to admit this album is not the best Ringo made, to say the least. I love \\"Lipstick Traces\\" and I enjoy some other songs on the album, but what about this ugly disco cover of \\"Where did our love go\\" ? And boring and overlush songs like \\"A man like me\\" ?

As one of the worst albums by any of the ex-beatles, this sad little collection of warmed-over disco beats and hokey scmaltz does not endear itself. Several of the tracks are from Ring's long-forgotten \\"Ringo\\" TV special,a version of Twain's \\"Prince & the Pauper\\", with Ringo playing both himself as a rock star, and as Ognir Rats (the pauper). As such, these are the most successful tracks (\\"Heart on My Sleeve\\", etc.). But songs like \\"Where Did Our Love Go?\\" just don't cut the musical mustard. A long and winding road indeed from the multi-smash days of the 1973 \\"Ringo\\" album. Luckily, he has since recovered from this fiasco, most recently with the highly recommened \\"Time Takes Time\\" and \\"Vertical Man\\" albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most forgettable Ringo album","review":"One does not listen to Ringo albums for seering emotion (one would instead listen to John Lennon) or pop craftsmanship (one would instead listen to Paul McCartney), but for fun. Ringo's albums are generally fun.

While watching his weekly TV program, I saw how Price lambasted the white members of his church as guilty collaborators of America's treatment of blacks. This is the same thing as blaming Japanese-Americans for the attack on Pearl Harbor. If the white members of Price's church were bigots, then why were they attending in the first place? The following week's broadcast showed Price chastising his black attendees for harassing white attenders as they left services the week prior! Price continued his tantrums for many weeks--which now constitutes this book. This whole episode demonstrates how Hagin and Price are more alike than different. Ignore the book as you should these two undisciplined, self-righteous teachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fred- look in the mirror","review":"This book, along with all of Price's \\"teachings\\", is pure racist garbage.

All are interesting. Most are funny. One -- the piece on Sarajevo -- is intensely moving.Four stars out of five.

They are both great! They are just extremely different. Compared with the space-age futuristic upbeats of Superman, Songbird is much more simple, with accoustic guitars and mellow tempos.The title song is absolutely gorgeous, if somewhat short. Her cover of \\"Tomorrow\\" is unforgettable. And of course there's the Streisand megahit \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\". Every song on this album is beautiful and worth a listen, even the eclectic \\"Honey Can I Put On Your Clothes\\".Stop comparing this particular album to Superman. Instead, appreciate it for what it is and was meant to be. Just because they were released back to back, that does not mean that this album had an obligation to be Superman Part II. They are both excellent and Songbird is one of my favorites. And with 60 Streisand studio recordings released, that's saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System, but no power input","review":"I bought these after buying a few diffrent travel speakers. these can be used with or without the amp.

You can buy a pair of E-706s for half the price of an E-708 pair and save some money for a subwoofer. For just a little more you can buy the excellent E-710, 3-way speakers with 10-inch woofers. Both options seem more sensible, unless speaker size is really an issue (E-710s and subwoofers are pretty bulky)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great speaker with utter clarity!","review":"These are the best speakers I've had yet.

And Paul made the typical mistake of thinking he could just pick up a pen and let that screenplay flow without any trouble. The screenplay is GARBAGE. Paul himself later ACKNOWLEDGED this. He said, \\"I really got caught up with writing the screenplay, so that I started giving other people ADVICE about writing screenplays. I really lost it there, and realize now I didn't know what I was doing.\\" At least he fessed up to it.

If you watch it as a couple of music videos loosely connected by a plot this film is great. I expect I don't have to tell you that the music is brilliant - this is after all Paul McCartney we're talking about - \\"So Bad\\" is heart-meltingly beautiful.

But in a way that is just as well, since the people who will enjoy this movie are specifically fans of the music of Mccartney and the Beatles, rather than a general movie audience. Taken as a film Broad Street is pretty dull, but so was the Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour. What Magical Mystery Tour did have going for it was great songs with fun psychedelic videos to go with them. Broad Street does not have songs as great as the ones in Magical Mystery Tour (what does?), but the songs that are here are mostly good fun. Even a few Beatles tunes are covered by Mccartney with a studio band.

If you like a fun movie filled with great rock 'n roll music, this is it. Lacking the pretentious joylessness of the Wall or the over the top dramatics of Tommy, it is a romp through the music of Sir Paul. The same Paul McCartney that masterminded the Magical Mystery Tour (which I also love) gave us Broadstreet in '84. The plot has the depth you would find in an Elvis movie and stands more as a long music video than a film, but what a video. Eleanor Rigby is elongated with the orchestral Eleanor's Dream which is my favorite segment. It is a dreamy look at Edwardian London with well written orchestration and a bit of violence that keeps it from being too sweet.All in all - a fun movie with some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film is very interesting!!!","review":"Paul is a genius and the man that composed the essential and style of Beatles's music.

The songs are very beautiful and the performer of YESTERDAY is the best version solo than I heard it. \\"Bad boy\\" is a deliciuos song and \\"No more lonely nights\\" is a imponent song.

The two readers who have reviewed it looked at it as a religious book, when really it is a brilliant historical account of the basic religions of the world. And looked at from that perspective, it deserves 5 stars, because you can never detect any biasedness while reading it.

It is more like a graduate student's thesis with references interrupting the flow of every other sentence.

Compared to many cruets this does not have cheap rubber seals that just don't last. The mouth is more than wide enough to refill by just removing the top of the cruet. No excess oil drips either.

The story was lightweight, insubstantial and certainly not a new idea.The presentation was nicely done as far as the drawings and the page layouts. It took all of 30 minutes to read the story. When I finished I wondered what I was missing, that such a trivial piece of work should get so much publicity.

Sophie Dahl does a wonderful job writing a beautiful, almost typical, love story. The fact that this is in almost such a classic love story format, would make it dull, however, she adds her own spin on everything, and it truly pulls you in. The pictures just add to the tale, making each page a delight to turn. This is one of those books that you want to read over and over again.

This feeder makes a cute display outside my front porch. The only problems I see is with the re-filling. It can get pretty messy sometimes as the entire top portion dismantles with one screw which happens to be the same screw that you need to unscrew to re-fill! Secondly, the feeder can get pretty heavy if you fill it completely. Thisis scary cause container is made out of real glass! Bottom line is one must be a bit careful when re-filling and this might not be a job that you would give to your excited little child to do which can be pretty disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painted or coated to appear as copper","review":"For the money, it is okay, but if you are expecting copper plated, you will be disappointed. The feeder part is a generous sized glass globe which I was surprised it was not some form of polycarbonate.

There's also not enough suggestion of why the wife does the horrible thing she does to her husband -- one brief scene with a priest that seems to delve into horrors from her own past isn't enough (and it's not even clear that that's what the scene is about).This movie strives for an artistic, art-house feeling, but it fails to convey a genuine sense of the lives of these characters.

They are very hard to find in stores, all of the new painting books come with a set of watercolors. Those sets don't have lids and are a big mess after one use. Plus, very little children have a hard time understanding the brush has to go into the water, then the paint each time. For \\"water coloring,\\" with very little kids, I much prefer these books. They just dip their brush in water and away they go. The only thing I would change would be to make the pages thicker, as my daughter regularly wears holes into the centers of her \\"masterpieces.\\" In terms of educational value, I generally do prefer blank paper and finger paint, acyrlics or tempera (something with wet paint that can be directly applied) and a more open-ended art experience.

The argument is intriguing, but one shouldn't take it so seriously. It's best to read this book with the same healthy skepticism one would bring to a \\"JFK assassination conspiracy\\" book. The author is simply connecting dots in Joseph Smith's life to construct his theory that Smith had a personality disorder, and that this disorder was the essence of his religious genius. The book's critical flaw is methodological: Morain never really compares Smith with other case studies from the literature on dissociative disorders, rendering his conclusions pure speculation. Still, Morain scores a few interesting points, and made me say \\"hmmmmmmmm\\" more than once. Five stars for readability. Three stars for scholarship. That's an average of 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep","review":"This book is a disturbing look into a deeply troubled mind. Unfortunately that is all I can say about William Morain.

One such event, referred to in the title, is the death of Laban by his own sword at the hands of Nephi. It is also my understanding that, according to the author, Laban and Nephi are supposedly brothers and sons of Lehi. This leads the author to look at Joseph's family dynamic and make comparisons. I am assuming that this is a key instance in the text since it is referred to in the title. I would like to point out that in the referenced story from the Book of Mormon, Nephi and Laban are not brothers. They are somehow distantly related, but had not met previous to the events immediately preceding Laban's demise. How does this fact affect the overall argument of the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ridiculous","review":"What a crock of bull. I can't believe I spent money on this.

It then goes on to show the relationship to Quality Function Deployment, Robust Engineering, the Quality Loss Function, Concept Development, TRIZ and reliability.This book is quite comprehensive, but not at all a quick read, as there are many mathematical illustrations that need to be studied to appreciate.A added plus for those who are anxious to get right into Axiomatic Design is a software download that can make the relationships easier to handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Axiomatic Design, Meet Six Sigma","review":"Basem El-Haik has made a significant contribution to the evolving field of Design-for-Six-Sigma (DFSS). Axiomatic Design has long been a compelling methodology, but as a discrete design methodology it did not have the leverage that Basem has created by integrating it with other Six Sigma methods.This integration is particularly apparent with his work combining the design axioms developed by Nam Suh with Robust Design optimization. The application relevant introduction of Design Domains, Functional Requirements, Domain Mapping, and Decomposition (Zig-zagging) creates an effective foundation for the 'effective' implementation of Taguchi's Parameter Design.This book is a must for the professional implementer of DFSS or anyone interested in demystifying the fundimentals of system design.

Many more could be cited.While historical fiction writers certainly have license in interpreting history, the good writers stick to the known timeline. If they stray from this, they usually explain to the reader the reason for having done this in an afterword. Mr. Panella owes his readers an explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ATTRACTIVE & COMPACT","review":"This is simple and lovely enough for the more 'restrained' and formal garden. (it looks like it cost a lot more than it did). I didn't want a chunky stone birdbath for my front yard and when I set this one up I knew that I had made a good choice. Very classy!I took the advice of other reviewers and PUT ROCKS IN THE HOLLOW BASE COLUMN - thank you.The bowl is pretty but also pretty deep so I couldn't use a 'wiggler' and I ADDED SOME STONES IN THE BOWL FOR THE BIRDS TO PERCH ON.It is taller than most birdbaths that you see and when I put it with the roses it stands a little above so it can be seen a bit. I also added my little solar pump to keep the water moving and it looks great because the pump is black and, though it looked 'obvious' in the shallower stone baths, it disappears nicely in this one.I am very happy with this and how lightweight, easy to assemble, and inexpensive it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts","review":"We have had this product for about 1/2 a year and it is all rusty and deteriorated in the bowl of the bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"This is a great product if you have long, processed hair. I have waist length straight, thick hair, and it's professionally colored. I condition when I wash it, however I use Scruples Soothing Polish after drying my hair. It really helps the ends, and it smells great! It doesn't leave your hair flat -- just smooth and under control. Plus, it's cheaper here than at the salon! Try it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the most part---YUCK!!!!!!!","review":"This is my introduction to Reba. I liked her show and liked the little singing she did on it. I liked the first 10 songs sort of and absolutely hated the rest. It definitely is not country: it's a cousin to Celine Dion. It has those awful drums, sythesizers and strings and that constipated straining for emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S NEXT? A REBA DISCOGRAPHY COLLECTION?","review":"That is all that is left! Folks, please, Reba is a fine singer, but you've heard all of these before. Sure, they've thrown in a couple of good new tunes for good measure but they aren't worth the price of the CD. Real Reba fans already own everything she's put out. The only thing left for MCA to do (Mercury, her first label already did it on Oklahoma Girl which is far superior to this) is put out a complete output of every recording she's ever done. Enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA'S BEEN THERE, DONE THAT!!","review":"Everyone knows Reba McEntire has dozens of #1 records. We did not need another compilation to note this fact. What WE DO NEED from Reba is a fresh CD to get her firmly grounded back into the music business which is where she belongs. Her television series stinks but her music, for the most part has always been wonderful. This CD is a testament to that, BUT, we did not need another reminder of it. We've got plenty of those....namely all of her previous greatest hits packages."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEARTBREAK HOTEL. NOT WORTHY OF CHECKING IN.","review":"The Big C&W star turned Big TV star sings all the Big Ones. Funny, but when lumped together in one collection, it becomes so abundantly clear that almost all the tunes are about heartbreak and loss ... she's leaving him, he's leaving her. Yeah, yeah, we know that's the soundtrack for life ... but that doesn't mean you can't divorce yourself from the music. Hey, Loretta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BUY THIS.....","review":"when there are already three Reba greatest hits packages out there, plus a compilation of all her Mercury hits?? It doesn't make any sense. I agree with the reviewer below...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Sing About","review":"I enjoy the song at the beginning of Reba's show, so I thought I'd order this album without listening to any of the music first. Shouldn't have done it. Nothing jumps out as a classic or a hit. I guess that's why I wasn't familiar with her music before her show came on TV. It all sounds the same, and it's not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA #1","review":"Boy, this purchase was my one of few with amazon cds.

Why would ANYONE (new Reba fan or veteran Reba fan) want to buy a product of hers which contains songs already released on her previous CDs and her three greatest hits packages?? Sure, the CD contains two new songs but those two cannot justify the price of a new CD. I just don't understand why people continue to support someone who is filthy rich, is over-exposed on television and cannot bring anything fresh and new to the music industry. Instead of buying this CD, why not use the money you would have spent and donate it to the \\"homeless shelters\\" or the \\"missions\\" for poor people who really need it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO TOOK THE UGLY PHOTO COVER???","review":"I agree with the other reviewers here who say that we DID NOT NEED another Reba Greatest Hits Collection. The first half of the CD is fine. THe other half features Reba at her poppish, foppish worst. But Reba needs to sue her photographers. The woman is fifty years old and she's still trying to make herself look like she's twenty. She fails miserably. The cover photo of her looks like a wax mannequin reject! Reba (never a beauty) will win no beauty contests with the cover photo here and as for the music...well....you've heard it all before and I'm sure if you're a Reba fan you already have all the songs on this collection (save for the new singles...which are forgettable) so forget this collection. Advice to Reba: Get a new photographer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Music","review":"I was slightly dissapointed with this collection. I own the second and third hits CD's, but I found this CD to be lacking with some music.

I see you everytime you come to New York. I saw you on Broadway, I own 33 of your albums, some in CD AND record or tape form.I am highly disappointed at yet another greatest hits album. Your real fans have been there through and through. Yet the new music we get is on an album which has songs that already appear on how many others?The reality, is that this is Reba's sixth hits package. She had a Best of album in the early eighties, then greatest hits vols. 1, 2 and 3. She also had a hits package of her early music, Oklahoma Girl, and now this. I'm tired of it. Way way WAAAAY too many country musicians do this crap.Enough is enough....albums like this take advantage and do nothing but disrespect your real fans.The only reason I gave this two stars, is because the songs are no doubt great. Just an unfortunate compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba's best!","review":"This two CD set of Reba's #1 hits includes all of her Billboard #1 singles as well as a few that topped the charts on either Cashbox or Radio & Records. The best part of this set is the sound. The songs have been remastered and sound better than ever, in particular the Mercury recordings. Disc one is my personal favorite. \\"Somebody Should Leave\\" is probably my favorite Reba song ever. \\"The Last One To Know\\" is another great one. There are a few songs missing here, \\"Fancy\\" and \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" for example, but those didn't top the charts, save those for the inevitable \\"Essential Reba\\" which we'll see I'm sure at some point.This is a great set and one of those albums that you know the words to every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba IS love!!","review":"Just being new to Reba, I am in awe of this lady's talent and passion.This is a keeper and must listen to for all the walks in life we will face.

This band is a slave to the stereotypes of the subculture, coming off as goth as count chocula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for kids","review":"The watch has buttons that are very easy for a child to push. Also, the Indiglo feature is very helpful. The timer feature is good when you want to give a set time for your child to do something.

That's not a winning trifecta and this book is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better.....","review":"My bad rating isn't for the music , which rocks - it's for the piss poor mastering !

This CD is essentially an interview although Dave Matthews' voice has been spliced into the commentary by the interviewer.

Being a devoted Dave Matthews fan I believe that this is not very interesting and I wouldn't consider it worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting time...","review":"Someone may have mentioned this already, but it is worth noting again: This so-called biography has several errors in it. The basic gist of the DMB story is there, but don't rely on it for specifics. It is humorous if only for the English lady's accent (and her telling of the story- what she emphasizes), and yes the background does resemble elevator music! The ten short clips of a band member talking (mainly Dave, but Carter once) are from Interview Sessions (which is much better than this one). So if you like collecting DMB things, get this. Otherwise, don't bother.

David Allan Coe will always be known as one of the greatest country singers of our time, although country radio and the CMA doesn't give him the credit he deserves. From the fun song \\"Divers do it deeper\\", to the ballad \\"Would You Lay with Me(In a Field of Stone)\\", and the classic bar room song \\"You Never Even Called Me by My Name\\", this CD takes you on a ride you will not soon forget. The instrumentals, the voice, and all of the classic lyrics make this CD. I would strongly recomend buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steiner's most accessible and inspiring work","review":"George Steiner defines this work as a work in the 'Old Criticism'. By this he means it is inspired by admiration for the works. And it has a sense of the works as contributing to one's overall political, historical and literary sense of the world. This as opposed to a New Criticism which would concentrate on a close reading of the text in and by itself.Steiner's subjects here are the two giants of Russian literature, who Steiner considers in a way the greatest of novelists. The vast epical world of Tolstoy the master of depicting the great sweep of life, and the more tormented inner worlds of the master Dostoevsky are connected here with their great predecessors in world- literature.This is an inspiring piece of Literary Criticism, the kind one reads as if it were a continuation of the work being criticized, a literary work of distinction in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DermaNew refill sponge applicator","review":"The seller should make it clear what tool it fits.

This man clearly hates White people and traditional society. He refers to the settlers who established the 13 colonies as 'illegal aliens,' for instance, even though they were not illegally entering a foreign state but rather settling in the wilderness of North America. He also refers to non-Whites in the USA as 'emerging majorities,' which is a true enough description given the anti-White immigration policy of the US Federal Government, however, Betances cheers this fact and is openly biased against White people - whom he wishes to see replaced.

This is a very comprehensive collection - the selections are well-chosen and I'm pleased to see that a decent amount of great songs were all put on a single disc instead of the 2-disc nonsense. Highly recommended for the casual fan and even for the hardcore fan that might not want to spend the money on the box set .... which I believe ultimately gives you a lot of stuff no one is interested in anyway (not so with EVERY box set, but a lot of them).

There's also a cover of \\"California Dreamin'\\" & two brand new tracks that round out the set for a total of 22 songs. This makes it a better collection than History released many years ago.Rhino has done its usual high quality remastering. The liner notes are very good.

The saucy innuendos of the aerlier movies was now considered old fashioned and comedy in 1978 consisted of full-on explicit sex jokes and four-letter words. This Carry On has swearing and sex jokes, but it's so embarrasing to watch, not to mention miserably unfunny, that it didn't seem worth making.

The special effects and gore scenes were pretty standard fare considering the low budget,but not cheesy. The best saving grace of the whole film was the plot of the whole thing,a melding of different genres that actually added up to a pretty cool little storyline.

Uniting Nations are only using the refrain of the song which is an example of simple scoring in the charts! I can understand it from a 'dance-oriented' point of view for people who like to dance on this track, but it makes me sick everytime I hear this...

While the setting and subject matter are clearly \\"Western\\" in nature, the novel shares few other similarities with traditional stories of the West. There are no encounters with Indians or shoot-outs with rival Cowboys. Instead, Williams' story brings to life the brutal nature of the hunt, the drab and barren existence of life in a Colorado boom-town and the mix of beauty and terrible ferocity of nature with an almost naturalistic approach similar to that of Zola."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific Western.","review":"Great read.

The writing is excellent; the description of the land, the buffalo, the stench of the killings, the snow, pine trees and the physical description of the men. However, that's it. I never felt any connection to the characters themselves. I just got bogged down in all the detail, the endless description of the miseries these men endured only to have everything lost. Someone suggested this novel could be Camus writing a \\"western\\" - that pretty much sums it up. However, Camus left me pretty cold; this does the same. I'm not sure what food for thought this provides beyond life is hard, meaningless, and so what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pas pour moi","review":"A let down and disappointment after reading his novel \\"Stoner\\". This story is a rather boring example of \\"A boy's swell adventure\\" without much adult interest. I don't think the author was close to this subject. Some gruesome description of the slaughter of bison is not news to me but might enlighten those who still hold on to the myth of the west and its heroes. Such a contrast to \\"Stoner\\" which is brilliant and obviously an area close to William's experience and knowledge. I think \\"Stoner\\" is one of the best novels I've read in the last 60 years or so. Skip Butcher's Crossing and go directly to \\"Stoner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Translation","review":"This translation is very well done.

It gives a good basic idea about the revolution - the major events and what motivated the colonists.

Their interactions are funny, especially when they are fighting, and they make sure they get to see and report on all the important events of the day. One suggestion would be to incorporate the bonus material - the quizzes and news items - into each episode as was original to the TV show. It's odd to watch all the bonus material at the end of the episodes. All in all, this was a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series","review":"Fantastic series!!!! Skip buying one episode at a time and just buy the whole set. I've had children ranging from 3 to 12 begging for the next episode. Very well done in terms of making Revolutionary History captivating for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids' series!","review":"This is a great series to teach kids about American history -- and thoroughly entertaining, too. The characters are likable, there's plenty of humor and action, and sensitive topics are dealt with gently.

I'm sure most of the information is over his head, but he still enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I have 5 kids, 5-15 years old. They all love the libertys kids DVDs.

This set incudes 15 hours, 40 episodes, and some extras, like the \\"Mystery Guest Game\\" and Ben Franklin's Words of Wisdom.The videos make the personalities involved seem more present-day, and the video children (James the journalist, Sarah the Brit helping Americans, and Henri the little French boy) have modern attitudes and expressions.There is not too much gritty reality in the battle scenes. We like them, but I don't use these as a substitute for actual biographies. I do let my kids watch them (even down to the kindergartener) -- I'm pretty strict about TV, but these make the cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Educational Tool!","review":"I use these movies in my classroom and my students love them!

My children were very young when this first came out in 2003, but now they are in 2nd and 4th grade and can really appreciate it and learn a lot from it. We watch an episode or two together and it really sparks a good learning conversation. The music is contemporary and the lyrics are easy to learn for the opening credits. I love it! I also have shown this to my students and they love it too! If you want to brush up on your American history, this video is definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Victory Kids","review":"We love watching this series.

My son is only 13 months old...yes I realize he isn't old enough to understand this kind of stuff yet...but it does hold his attention. He doesn't get to watch much tv (he'd watch mickey mouse all day if i let him lol) so what little he does watch I want it to be something he can actually learn from. In my opinion, if it holds his attention and he's learning, that's really great. I have to admit that hubby and I really love this too...we sat and watched \\"the boston tea party\\" last night and even learned a few things from it ourselves lol. I can't wait until my son is old enough to grasp things like this because I feel this set will benefit him a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"now is a good time for cd's","review":"i got several of the lasted recording of the jacksons and michael is because before he died i had all of these on albums and want them to last longer great like it puts me back to the 70's and the 80's a time when it was not like now calmer peace and that is why i bought these still great after all these years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music From My Time!","review":"I grew up listening to this album and others by the Jackson Five and I was glad to see this music available on CD now, thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P.

But after reading this book, I'll keep the errors, just please don't subject these amazing journals to the ego of someone like Anthony Brandt!!Brandt's intrusive comments (which fill the book) are extremely annoying. What in better times would have been at most a footnote, is now made a part of the text, making reading this book like reading a blog with the commentator's comments inserted right in the middle of the text!Brandt just can't keep his mouth shut and loosely comments throughout the book. Some of his notes in the beginning of chapters are interesting, but much of what he writes are from his own subjective viewpoints and should not have been included within the text.The National Geographic should have caught this before publication of these priceless journals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expurgation of William Clark's idiosyncratic spelling fails","review":"The real joy of the Lewis & Clark journals consists in their presentation of early 19th Century American idiom and spelling. This edition modernizes spelling, grammar and sentence structure. Clark , for example, never spelled Sioux the same way twice. Mosquitos often was spelled as mosquitors. I deeply missed the charming character of William Clark's English. Its absence is palpable in the text. Meriwether Lewis, on the other hand, was an elegant stylist whose prose needs no modernization. On balance, a disappointment that robs the true wealth of the Lewis & Clark Journals"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Mannequin","review":"If you are designing your own dog clothes, you really need a mannequin.

There is no excitement anywhere on these sessions. The Left Banke's two albums are great, but Brown's abandoning the Banke for this really seems like a step down. I've had this on vinyl and got rid of it, bought it on CD thinking maybe I'll like it this time, but no, there is just nothing going on here even remotely close to what The Left Banke did. Subtlety is one thing, but boredom is another. Montage is mostly the latter. It's not terrible, but there is a reason it bombed commercially; it's mediocre. And the cover art is just as unmemorable as the music. I disagree with another reviewer about the second Left Banke album, minus Brown (except for one track.) I think it's better than the first. But Montage? I'll pass (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good- but not great","review":"Felt I needed to provide balance in regard to the other review. I blindly purchased this cd because of my love for the Left Banke. This is a very good album and certainly should be purchased if you are a Left Banke devotee. I strongly disagree with it being better than Left Banke's debut however. But there are several very good songs on this album, I particularly like Tinsel and Ivy.If you have a chance to listen to this album check out Men Are Building Sand. It contains the most painful recorded note I have ever heard- completely off-key. What's the deal? No other complaints aside from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must Have!","review":"I've been Listening to this Album for over 30 years. What an awesome contribution to the 'Story Telling 60's' that has come to be the greatest music of all. I remember asking my grandmother who Priscilla Gray was. She said, 'ask your Uncle, he sang it! Thanks for the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece.","review":"This Cd was my introduction to sangeet music, and it still is among my top 3 albums in that genre. Pramod Kumar was a pupil of Ravi Shankar, he has passed away in 1983. Kumar has developed a very distinctive, dynamic and powerful style of playing the Sitar.He is accompanied on flute on some of the tracks,and the interpertations focus more on the Gat than on the Alap sections of the raags.The sound quality is excellent,and I recommend this recording (and also the first part of the series,\\"The Paths of Raga 1\\", which has been falsely filed under \\"Pramod Kumer\\" in this catalog) highly. A must-have for any serious lover of Indian music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scale","review":"Nice broad weighing platform. Easy to use keys. Nice big display. The volume function is kinda cool - you enter a code number from the included cheatsheet, and the scale automatically converts to cups-and-tablespoons as you weigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best projectmanagement philosophy ever","review":"GDPM is the best tool for planning organisational change projects. It is not suitable for technical projects. GDPM is both a philosophy and a method and exactly that is what makes it so powerfull. Apart from adressing the five pitfalls in the beginning of the book it introduces layered planning. GDPM is about planning the WHAT and making people responsible (the WHO) for results before the project starts. After that the planning of the HOW is a cascade. In an organisational change project you can't plan activity 216 at the beginning of the project. You should only plan the activities of the first 3-5 milestones. GDPM forces you to organise your communication as well and makes sure you communicate (the 2way street) and not inform (the 1way street). The nice thing is that you need only two A4 forms to plan your project which makes it not only an effective method but also an efficient one.Buy it, use it and get hooked to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay on your belt","review":"The quality of manufacture is generally excellent. It is reasonably well finished. The belt hook is completely inadequate, which is the primary (and secondary) reason for selecting this product.

Wish there were more books out there on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and original","review":"The Highway QC's belong the top groups in gospel history, along with the Swan Silvertones, The Souls Stirres, Five Blind Boys of Alabama and The Caravans. This music, recorded in the early 60's, features smooth and soulful vocals over a tight harmonic background.The group is mentioned as the group Sam Cooke started singing in. I enjoy listening to them no less than to Cooke's recordings with the Soul Stirres, and maybe more...Their style is original - you cant mistake their sound for anybody else's.The CD contains two LP's. Both are great, though the sound quality of the second (from track 13 on) is somewhat clearer.If you like gospel, soul, or even Jazz and Blues - I say you cant go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THE BEGINNING:","review":"Okay, let it be known, this is the beginning. Sam Cooke did start with this group, but he never recorded with them. When he left the group, Johnnie Taylor took his place. He can be heard on 'Somewhere To Lay My Head', I Dreamed Heaven Was Like This and a couple others. When he left the group to replace Sam Cooke in the Soul Stirrers, Spencer Taylor (no relation) took his place in the QC's and he is the leader even now. This disc is awesome. And just about complete, the only thing missing is 'All Men Are Made By God' But I found that on another various artists compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"KAYE ON COLUMBIA","review":"The CD title is ridiculous. (The above review is also ridiculous. The song she refers to isn't even on the collection. Amazon, do you read these?)Why devote 25 cuts called \\"the Collection\\" to the 3 years at the end of Kaye's career? Granted Harbor Lights was a biggie, but Kaye had 13 years of RCA/Victor hits before then, massive hits, including Don Cornell & Billy Williams as the singers. And Eddie Cantor had a charted song with the band in this same period, which is missing.Overpriced and over hyped..at least all the cuts were real singles, and the liner notes were complete. Don't be fooled by the title. Between this one and \\"Best of the Big Bands\\", with only 6 charted songs out of the 41 cuts on the CDs, and skipping 97 other charted songs of the band, Columbia is selling Columbia, not Sammy Kaye.The only two Sammy Kaye CDs on Amazon worth the money are \\"21 Best\\" and \\"Kaye on Vocalion\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for Poor Little Robin","review":"It is a good CD if you like this kind of music.

Amazingly, they repeated the old errors so I returned the product. While checking the movies for closed captioning (or even subtitling), I noticed the overall quality of the movies is not good.

There is much wonderful fresh air, good home cooking and everything one would want on an ocean isle.

It is a very nice size (I actually bought the 15x15). It was also fairly easy to erect once you got the hang of it. BUT then came a rain storm, and this is where this shelter bombed. It has an air vent at the top that is designed to help it vent heat and wind, however it also allows rain to enter due to a bad design. So sad, if it just didn't have the top vent, this would be an awesome shelter.

It marked a very distinct quality between SACD and normal CD. My favourite tracks are Badia, Simple Gifts and Give Me One Reason. The accoustic guitar is crystal clear, the orchestra has added more depth and the vocal coming from centre speaker is really wonderful. Recommended Surround Setup included in the cover booklet is quite helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selection of music","review":"I don't actually have an SACD player, so I've been listening to the CD layer only. Still... I'm blown away by the sound quality on this disc - I imagine the SACD layers sound even better. Furthermore, the selection of music on this disc is outstanding. If you have a SACD player, I'd say this is a must buy. If you like the artists/tracks on the disc, you may consider getting this even if you don't own an SACD player (you may later)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disappointed","review":"I received and listened this sacd on Oct,18th.I have some comments about this sacd :Manufactured quality is bad,from track 1 to track 7 , the music is performing very well , but from track 8 to final track , it is out of order , I heard some interruption on each track and sound became small , when I changed to CD mode, the sound is still small. I also listened to another sacd(also manufactured by telarc-stir it up), the music is performing very well , so I can sure this sacd have problem,I would like to suggest telarc to check the quality of same production lot.If telarc don't clarify this issue , you should consider carefully before you buy this sacd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I am amazed at the negative reviews here.

My background and credentials are solid. So much for the critic above's claim that this is for stupid naive people in the dark ages.

These two problems still exist today. But I think this book goes too far. There are no references to back up the \\"facts\\". It was written by a journalist with no credentials except that she is on a lifetime crusade to repress people's sexuality. It is published by Ascension Press, a religious publisher. Of course it is going to denounce his work. This publisher represents people who live by the bible and Kinsey's research does not follow the bible. So why does that make it wrong? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is biased and lacks basic knowledge of science.","review":"So many poorly backed shots are taken at Kinsey that the author loses total credibility. If you are looking for a poorly written work of fiction, then buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Perspectives/Politcal Messages","review":"Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy. Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war color Talese's story from start to finish. These themes give the tale a characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places. In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to be trying to put forth during the entire story. These perspectives, and those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of traditional native Italian scholars. Still, the book is in a bold attempt at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life!","review":"A beautiful tale of fathers and sons woven withthe realities of immigration, war, and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Gives a lot of historical information in a novel.

Like many hipper-than-thou kids from that time, I sneered at Fogelberg. Nowadays, I can relate (pardon the Californianism) to his music better, now that I've seen enough of life to know what he's been singing about. \\"Longer\\" is an almost-too-sweet ballad, but oh that flugelhorn solo! Traces of this song hover throughout, for instance, Eric Clapton's \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" and \\"Tears in Heaven\\". The title track is my favorite, along with the instrumental introductory track, \\"Tullamore Dew\\". (Note: on the cd, there's a cue blip between the two tracks--very mood-breaking.) On \\"Phoenix\\", his vocals are still glassy smooth, but he still manages to generate some real steam. This is a fine, classically rocking mememto of the end of the singer-songwriter era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"I enjoyed this CD as much as when I first purchased it, when it was first released.

Every album has a few great cuts but for someone more drawn to his rock 'n' roll side, the drippy ballads and folkish muzak just got to be too much to bear. On this, his sixth album, Fogelberg's stylistic swings reach the breaking point - he rocks harder on the songs \\"Face the Fire\\" and \\"Phoenix\\" than he ever has before, but with \\"Longer\\" and \\"Heart Hotels\\" he lets his sappy romantic side go way overboard as well. Hard to believe a fan of one side of Fogelberg can stomach the other. I recently burned my own \\"Best of\\" CD for Fogelberg - 2 or 3 songs from each of the first 6 albums. Now I'll sell the albums and never miss them a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"BYZANTINE MUSIC FAN","review":"HI ,I AM ALSO A BYZANTINE MUSIC FAN ,ESPECIALLY THE GREEK BYZANTINE MUSIC,I ALSO LIKE THIS CD AND I ALREADY HAVE IT SINCE 98"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the books","review":"They are very good books but I like the tape better.

Their music is varies pretty well, sometimes moving along slowly, sometimes rocking, often very ethereal.

My babies have liked this rice cereal from the beginning and still do after over a year.I believe this is the best of the Earth's Best cereals. The oat Earth's Best Whole Grain cereal is oat FLOUR whereas this one is whole brown rice. That's a qualitative difference.

On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice about DVD version","review":"This is a spectacular film to behold. One of Wong Kar-Wai's best but the DVD transfer is the worse I have ever seen. No budget involved basically. Half of the frame is missing because of the subtitle bar.

Perhaps, buy the cheaper VHS edition if you are really desperate to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ashes of Time\\" DVD release is terrible!","review":"I can't judge the quality of the film because the DVD is so terrible. The transfer is poor - it looks like a VHS to DVD copy. The English subtitles cannot be turned off. They were placed in a gray (not black) bar that covers a third of the frame. You can see the Chinese subtitles peeking out during long lines, so it is clear that this was a cover-job. Wait for a better release - save your money. I think Wong Kar-Wai would be embarrassed"},{"rating":"1","title":"ASHES OF TIME DVD DISAPPOINTING","review":"It would be unfair to judge a film by a poor presentation, so I'll decline any comment about what I saw of the film itself. But this dvd is a big disappointment, especially considering the price. I think it's more than 20% of the picture that's matted out to hide the old subtitles; I think it's closer to 30 (several times you can see some of the old subtitles above the new ones). There's alot of picture missing and I frankly gave up watching this after a couple tries. At some point I'll finish, just to justify my purchase to myself.

The plot is philosophical and deep but it's extremely choppy and dragging. The fighting scenes are below par compared to other good Kung-Fu films.In short, it's not fun to watch. It should be called \\"Ashes of Movies\\". If you like moody, deep and philosophical pictures, you might like it. I don't. I prefer to watch the ones that are entertaining first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish Out Of Water","review":"There's no doubt that Wong Kar-Wai is a visionary director and accomplished storyteller. But Ashes of Time is to Wong Kar-Wai as Mallrats is to Kevin Smith, a slight blemish in an otherwise stellar career. Although Ashes of Time is a beautiful piece of film making and cinematography, it is an absolute turd of a movie. Jam packed with popular actors and pop stars who make Sophia Coppola look like an oscar winning actress, this film was in dire need of a few (major) script revisions. If Ashes of Time is the first Wong Kar-Wai film you've seen, don't write him off as a hack, Chungking Express, Fallen Angels and Happy Together are some of the best films to have come out of Hong Kong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is not the usual hong kong movie that Im use to seeing Its very different with little fight scene.

It might play better in the theatre. It might look better on DVD or Blu ray. What I watched was an old VHS version that looked like a third generation dupe, practically no detail at all.That said, evidently some versions of this movie please some people. I have to admit, there is something there, I'm not too sure what. Imitation Morricone soundtrack kept me looking for Clint Eastwood in his poncho just over the next sand dune, but he never materialized.If I come across a used Blu ray of this I may give it another look. I'm not sure if I saw 'Ashes of Time', or the Redux version, the title on the cassette box was all in Chinese and on two tapes, even though the running time was only 100 minutes. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie!","review":"This was an incredible film. Perhaps I'm biased simply because I AM Chinese; then again, everyone has to admit the plot was complex and well thought out. I have heard that some people did not understand the movie entirely and it is somewhat hard to comprehend. I was able to grasp the movie's meaning from the beginning only because I grew up hearing stories of Dong Shie and Ouyang Feng, characters by the popular author Jing Yong. Many people, not knowing the original story, do not realize that the movie tied together loose ends left by the author (such as why Ouyang and Hong hated each other from the start.) When I watched it, a sort of epiphany came over me. It was kind of like, \\"Ohhh!!! That's why he named the island Peach Blossoms!\\" Maggie Cheung was also wonderful in the movie--she appears in the last part of the film and the focus is only on her for a few minutes. However with only a few simple gestures and a red dress, she absolutely steals the spotlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, Terrible DVD","review":"This is a travesty!

I suppose they didn't have a neat tag (alternative? hard rock?) but the mix of styles they have works well. This is a good album...but I like The Stuff better.Their acoustic side project, Two Rivers, showcased Tommy and Bryce's harmonies as well as some beautiful lead vocals by Bryce. I saw them rehearse this live and thought they had a good chance to do something with this but the acoustic rock movement was still 5 years off and they just missed the boat.

There is just a groove, a feel to the whole album very upbeat, a party like atmosphere and it reflects in all of the songs. Woody's never been a great vocalist, but these songs suit his abilities just fine. \\"Worry no more\\" opens the CD, a boozy bar anthem with a loud chorus and \\"We all get old\\" also is a standout cut. What Woody lacks in range, he makes up for with passion. Overall, it's just an upbeat album that is allot of fun to listen to, you can tell everyone had a great time recording it. As usual, the guitar playing is top notch, with great rythms and slide guitar. A must for any Ron Wood fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Through and Through","review":"This album contains one great song after another. The clever wordplay of Ronny's lyrics have kept me smiling since it first came out in the late '70's.

It should be noted the supporting tour for this album was a once in lifetime experience. Keith Richards on guitar and Stanley Clark on bass just to mention two of the performers. Finally take your time enjoying the album cover artwork. These are all examples of Ron Wood's artwork. Ron Wood has been producing art longer than he has played guitar.

On my first listening, the quality of the vocals and instrumental work, then as now, left me wondering why this group was rarely considered to be among the top groups of its time. A second listening left me with the idea that the group's enjoyable but somewhat shallow lyrics kept them out of the top league.Hijinx and Straight On (for You) are good examples of how the group sometimes picked a catchy phrase, repeated it a lot, embellished it a bit, and called it a song. With the talent and energy the group brought to the studio the results were often amazing, as witnessed by songs such as Crazy On You, (probably) from their debut album.Enough of the negative and back to the title. This is a great album -- well worth 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest Heart songs you've never heard","review":"If you are only a casual Heart listener you may be familiar with the title track and 'Straight On' thanks to the radio. However 'Dog & Butterfly' should be listened the whole way through to be appreciated. The second side should not be divided into separate tracks ('Dog & Butterfly', 'Lighter Touch', 'Nada One', and finally 'Mistral Wind'), but should be listened to the whole way through to truly reach the place where Ann's vocals want to take you.You'll never hear finer vocal work than Ann Wilson, and you'll be hard pressed to find better Ann Wilson than 'Dog & Butterfly'. Her haunting voice brings forth such emotions as wanting, hurting, and yearning, but also demands attention, and can grow into a rage. If there is a better female vocalist than Ann Wilson I never heard her, and probably no one else has either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Masterpiece","review":"I've been listening to this album for 20 years and have still not grown tired of it.

I remember how much time we spent in school taking about ways to save the environment, but now I am grown with kids and caught in the game.

I even put it aside to read another book about Princess Diana in its entirety, which was fascinating. Now that I'm back to this one, I've decided to skim through and locate the interesting parts until I'm finished with it. Patrick Jephson takes forever to make a point... the book is somewhat well-written, however, which may be its only positive point. I don't like smut or tawdriness, especially about someone who contributed so much to the world as Princess Di did, but sadly that seems to be all Jephson knows how to recount.

Jephson comes across like a short man working for a tall woman. I'm not sure what his role in Diana's life was, but he certainly did not help. His book is full of put downs and I'm left with the general impression that he did not like her. How is it that he could be the executor of her will? Possibly an oversight on Diana's part. I can't help but agree with her sons that this books only intention is to exploit her. Don't bother reading it if you truly care for her. It is a very sad story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"The author betrays his royal employers on every page, while boosting his own ego. Jephson comes across as vain, smug, and unforgiving. He seems resentful that the royals are merely human; always negatively comparing them to his own seemingly flawless performance. (\\"Somehow, I felt, [the success of the royal tour] would not have been possible without me...\\") He accuses Princess Diana of complaining that \\"nobody ever told her that she was doing a good job,\\" yet the entire book is a prolonged whine from Jephson about how unappreciated his super-human efforts were by his employers. Jephson should be ashamed of himself -- this book is a gross betrayal of an employer who treated him fairly, if not as family.

His scornful opinions of his former boss repeat endlessly in this overwrought, judgemental book - despite the fact Diana is shown as faultlessly punctual, dependable for star quality, truly compassionate, always perfectly groomed, and with a wicked sense of humor, she is faulted for any number of things from eating a Cadbury's fruit and nut bar between appearances (evidence of bulimia, for Jephson) and for having \\"mixed motives\\" in her charity work.Jephson states early on that he scorns those who keep journals, and his own lack of notes make this stream of conciousness writing very short on facts and anecdotes, and full, instead, of an uninteresting man's self examination. Princess Diana supporters and detractors alike will find little to learn or ponder. Simply a waste of time for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is about the authors life .","review":"This book is very well written however, it is about the authors life.... as an assistant to Princess Diana.

Every veiled compliment was always taken back for some reason or another. The only thing I question now at all about Diana's mental capability is that she kept this loathsome, egotistical, whining crybaby in her life all of those years. It saddens me, he probably made a fortune off this. No wonder her poor sons were so up in arms. I couldn't finish the book because besides being so unkind, it was least forgivable becasue it was so BORING!

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that much of what he writes is true but what a book! Jephson will praise the Princess in one line or paragraph but then he'll tear into her the next and still be writing about the same thing. It also appears that he claims to be responsible for much of what good the Princess did from planning events (or salvaging them)to writing most of her speeches. Such a smart guy, loved the good life too, no wonder she let him resign. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Mr. Jephson was hard to live and work with and would have been put out if he hadn't left. Charles Spencer says the guy was more interested in his bank balance than the truth. Patrick Jephson and James Hewitt are two of a kind, both traitors and business failures, who care about money more than decency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayal","review":"This book is a study of mortal greed, revenge and plain pettiness. Jephson comes across as an irrational misfit who doesn't quite know if he loved, or hated the Princess.He has abused his position and trust, and proven himself to be just another \\"shark\\" feeding off the very person he once promised to protect and serve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadows of a Princess-for a reason!","review":"Very informative; in some respects too much so--the details the author goes into too often come across as dry and boring. Although on the plus side, he does show more of Princess Di's personality that would have surprised many had he written the book while she was still alive. All in all, however, I'm glad I got it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dull book about a egocentric private secretary.Blah.","review":"I mistakenly thought Mr Jephson would present an interesting, fair account of the life of the princess as seen during his tenure with her, yet all I can gather is that he is more concerned with presenting himself in a good light. Between the lines you can almost hear him bleating \\"It's not my fault\\" and other such ungallant sentiments. What comes through in this dusty, boring book is Mr Jephson's pitiful attempt to become \\"one of them.\\" It will not happen, sir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire an editor!","review":"This book is nearly 500 pages, but barely half of that is informative and even less is actually interesting. I've read nearly every book about the Princess, this is one of the few I couldn't finish. I was interested in a portrait of Diana the woman rather than Diana the icon. I also read this book to get some insight about the inner workings of royalty and the \\"palace machine\\". Any hopes of this were lost in Jephson's endless rambling.He criticizes Diana from head to toe, most of which seem ridiculous and petty. I have no doubt the Princess was a demanding and difficult boss, but Jephson makes her seem more like a soap opera villian than a normal, flawed human being. Before the first chapter is over, you'll be wondering why this man stayed with Diana for so many years. His bitterness overshadows what could have been and interesting \\"insiders\\" perspective of the Princess. AVOID IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shadows of a private secretary","review":"Except for money, what is the point in writing a book several years after someone's death detailing each and every one of their faults. The book is a complete loss since it only tells the reader one side of Diana's personality and that, as he writes, is completely horrible. The writer is so busy telling us why he disliked her, he completely loses his direction and is hard to follow. Don't spend your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadows of a Secretary","review":"I LOVE reading about Princess Diana, I have read a lot of the books out there, so take it from me, this one stinks. Don't waste your money unless you want to read the \\"Patrick Jephson\\" story. The author spends too much time telling us about the duties of his job, politics of the palaces, travel arrangements, and precious little dish about the Princess. I was hoping to read about incidents that would bring her image down to earth - instead of a saint, I wanted to hear about her human foibles, opinions, and ideas. I only made it to chapter 3, then I lost total interest in the book and ended up donating it to the public library. Better people should attempt to read this for free than waste valuable money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous Psychobabble","review":"The author, Princess Diana's secretary, was a pompous twit, who fancies himself to be a psychiatrist. Every good deed the princess did was analyzed to death by this \\"loyal\\" secretary. I newly discovered the meaning of boredom while reading this book. It was more like a logistial log of prepation for trips. I kept wondering, while suffering through what should have been titled, \\"Jephson's Revenge\\", if he ever knew her at all, or if he ever even had a personal coversation with her. I'm just glad I bought this for under $2."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pitiful Attempt","review":"Mr. Jephson's attempt to write a book about his former employer is such a mish-mash of jumbled sentences and thoughts that the reader is left to wonder did Princess Diana have a mental problem as he speculates or is Mr. Jephson the one who needs a therapist? Mr. Jephson has written a pitifully spiteful book that is difficult to read and to believe.It was not worth the money. Writing is certainly not his forte,nor is the truth held out in great regard here. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this one! Mr. Jephson's television interviews led me to believe he was going to give a truthful, unbiased account of Diana's daily life. Maybe it was truthful, but it was certainly not unbiased. The first chapter is absolutely appalling. The nasty way in which he relates his tales erased his credibility with me. This book is nothing more than a vengeful attack by a pompous little man. Disappointing. No wonder Diana was unstable if she surrounded herself with \\"friends\\" like Mr. Jephson. Not a very nice man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another leech making money off the Princess","review":"If you want to hear about how Patrick Jephson earned a living, carrying baggage, running errands, making sure the flower girl is standing at the right spot, etc, etc then you should buy this book. The book has Diana's picture on the cover, but it is not about her, it is more about Jephson himself. The minute the Queen sends a letter asking the Wales' to consider divorce seriously, the errand boy decides to jump ship. And now this book. Diana's lady-in waiting, Anne Beck-Smith did not serve her employer well by hiring this man. This nervous, starstruck chap should not have been given the privilege of serving Diana.I guess not everyone can be a Paul Burrell. Diana's former butler is a man of integrity, character, and professsionalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The novel, \\"Shadows of A Princess\\" by P.D. Jephson was a little disappointing to read. When I picked out this book I thought it was going to be full of facts about Diana that nobody was aware of. While some of the facts were new to me, others were not.The book though enlightened me on how difficult of a life Diana lived. She always seemed to be so happy, but this book really showed how troubled her life really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the Princess!","review":"This book, I thought was about the Princess, was all about the Author!!

Sadly, there is very little of this and somewhat of a ludicrous plot. I only watched for the nudity, but even that was more for comedy than for actual clothing-optional views or lifestyle. One good thing about this, in fact, was that the filmmakers were unafraid to include full-frontal and semi-nudity in the women, but not in the men.I also found the film a bit too frank with its sex talk. Thank god I only paid $2.99 for a one-time On Demand download. It's just not worth any real money.Long story short: If you want to see what averages out to be around 10 minutes or so of actual clothing-optionality and MILF, I would encourage renting this rather than making a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fractured Plot, Horrible Acting, Amateur Script","review":"I have seen kindergarten school plays that were better scripted, had better dialog and interaction, with more professional actors and settings.

Dr. Kramer has both the humility to recognize he holds no particular magic answer that applies to all people's situations and demonstrates a belief in the reader's intelligence to make their own choices based on the material he presents in the book. I appreciated the book greatly for its presentation of all the complexities involved with such a decision and for its assumption that I had the ability to use the material in the way best suited to my situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Much of what I thought has already been said, and probably better than I could say it. I've read many relationship books. It just seemed like the Dr. was more interested in getting a book out and demonstrating to the reader that he's a smart and sophisticated guy. Far too important and serious a Dr to be accused of writing a pop psychology book. And he certainly hasn't. Feels like the book was written because he felt some sort of obligation.

But here is the vastly annoying part of the book - even after sleeping with Justin, she won't marry him. Her denying his proposal was about a 100 pages and it was about 90 pages too long. She loved him! She knew he liked her, appreciated her, needed her. So he did out outright say he loved her, well, it was unrealistic that she would continue to say no even after it was apparent that her refusal caused a rift in his relationship with Pen and her husband.

It was terribly uncomofortable -- The pads on the inside were compacted and pressed extremely hard against his face. (yes the helmet was loosened)2. Visor Breaks on impact -- When being shot at around 300fps the visor breaks off, while the one i bought from Walmart is in perfect condition.

This book is FULL of information to be sure. But much of the \\"history\\" is simply chronology strung together, with no academic interpretation. Granted, Persia's history is extremely long and complicated, maybe the author was trying to streamline into one manageable volume. But what made the book unreadable towards the end was the grammatical and typographical errors in the text.

The educational value of this DVD was limited and I would characterize it mostly as entertainment. It introduced the sight and sound (albeit synthesized) of the orchestral instruments. That's nice, but it is nothing a baby wouldn't have to watch more than a few times to learn.For baby's musical development, my favorite baby DVD was Trebellina, which teaches notes pitch and tackles a number of instruments, instroducing them individually as well as together.

But they didn't purport to be what this one does, and they didn't misuse electronics to this extent.Instead of a child getting excited about music, he will end up indifferent, or worse. I discourage my son from watching this video. He much prefers listening to real orchestral recordings, anyway. He is learning the sounds of the instruments by listening to the different solos of Ravel's \\"Bolero\\" and the like.Here we have proof of what music becomes when you replace real musicians with Samplers, Sequencers, and Synthesizers: boring. I challenge the Disney company and/or Baby Einstein to re-record the soundtrack, as originally arranged, but using a full group of real musicians instead of the 3 S's. Hear the difference for yourselves. Then, with a few tweaks, you will have a quality product. Please send me the new version of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze!","review":"So very very very disappointed. As a former music educator (band, orchestra, etc), this was a complete snoozer.

What could have been a great chance to introduce babies/toddlers to music was missed. Instead, instruments are introduced using some fake electronic violin, cello and other instrument \\"sounds.\\" Also, as someone else noted there was an ommision of the oboe, which is a very integral part of the woodwind section. When the piano is introduced there is a jazzy version of \\"Fur Elise\\" which is an easy choice, but the video misses out on a wealth of piano music. Then piano and guitar play \\"Fur Elise\\" AGAIN Flaminco/world music style. When the orchestra is finally introduced they play a hockey version of Beethoven's 9th with the \\"canned\\" instruments.

The book is a hodgepodge of Power Girl and the modern main storyline serves no purpose as PG is just as confused as readers. The art by Amanda Conner is decent yet not spectacular.

Battery life is'nt bad if you can get the rapid charger to work properly. If you do any serious project you need buy a lot of batteries and use the snail charger. I am presently returning my 5th rapid charger. I even bought them from different stores to see if maybe it was a bad batch of chargers sent to one store. Nope.

I ended up getting a 12 volt Bosch and I am much happier now - more expensive, but I find the single-handed locking chuck just as easy to swap bits as with the Firestorm setup and I know I have a much better quality product. I have yet to find a Black and Decker product that is worthwhile and probably never will, since I am done ever purchasing their stuff.

The main reason why i gave it 1 star is because i was able the strip second gear out compleatly by drilling a 1/4 inch hole in a 2x4. which was most unexpected since the low gear was able counter sink large wood screws in a 4x4. might be good for light use thats it. i now have a 12 volt dewalt xrp which is a very powerful tool and well worth the extra [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Drill is Horrible - DO NOT BUY FROM BLACK AND DECKER","review":"I bought the Firestorm Drill and also the cordless circular saw.

This has me thinking I have bought the wrong drill because I sure would like to have a Black & Decker hand saw and flashlight that uses the same batteries like the older style.

The fake vintage-ness of it looked great. However, after having worn it for a few days its flaws became very apparent.The most noticeable flaw is the over sized crown. It looks great but constantly comes loose because it's too large. This causes it to stop time on the watch, and with enough wrist movement, winds the hands back and forth. At least once a day I have to reset the time. What use is a watch that can't keep time?Then I accidentally dropped the watch while putting it on one day.

There are unexplained squishy noises coming a dead body in the first half of the film, and a dead body (I kid you not) rolls out of the way to avoid getting squished by one of the still living characters.

There was no reason that this film should have been produced this way. The cinematography was so bad that you can't really see the movie. It was filmed sideways, upside down and very shakey. I thought that this was a very bad produced independant film. The story could have been a good one but the director ruined it.

Just another snotnosed punk director using \\"creative license\\" to throw a classless and unnecessary scene in. He explained in the comments mode that he just wanted to show everyone that the guy 'thought' about becoming human again, then just so he could drive it home that he was a monster, made him do the most monstrous act you could do.

A group of friends go into a new uncharted cave somewhere in Russia and encounter a deadly something or other that starts killing them off.

It would seem his interest in the women is not culinary.The story has potential, however the cinematography is abysmal. Visually, it's hard to follow thanks to overzealous use of hypershake, dust, fog, upside down and sideways shots, flashlight closeups and complete blackouts.Overall, I have to concur with the others here.

I have learned that the gears in the drill are plastic and the stalling out I read about in other reviews is a common affliction.Overall, it has not been a purchase that I am happy with, but when you shop price Vs quality you are at risk.

A search on the web shows that this is a pretty common problem with the 18v chargers. B&D makes a poor quality product and does not stand behind it.

So, 2 ruined chargers and one dead (defective?) battery later, I am left with a drill, maybe 1 good battery, but no charger. I'm not taking a chance on another charger. It will likely die as the others -- and that's an answer way too expensive to a problem that probably won't go away.

Personally, 'Z=7L' is WAY too experimental for me. Almost painful to sit all the way through. Mauricia Platon's clearly over-the-top dominating vocals is showcased - especially on tracks \\"Marochsek\\", the jazzy \\"Atature\\" and really out-there \\"La Soupe\\".

Its sort of harks back to Dr. Octagon in a very tangential and original way. This record though stinks of too many influences. Edan's first record got him alot of attention and that attention can be felt in all the feat's. Primitive's attention was well deserved because it was so off kilter and intelligently immature. I was hoping that this record would maintain that immaturity and do what it purported to do, amplify the psychedelia of Edan's already idiosyncratic demeanor. Instead Edan seems to have moved up in the underground hip hop ranks and tends to be more boastful than thoughtful about it. Don't listen to this record until you hear his first is my recommendation.

Although the retail packaging seems sufficient and it was packaged appropriately there were dirty marks and rub marks on the snout and ears, which mostly came off with all-purpose cleaner but not all. Also looks to be some sort of shiny residue on one side, maybe glue that doesn't come off. No one should have to clean a brand new product to try and make it acceptable for keeping. That's poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but very serious design flaw","review":"This piggy bank is soft, durable, and adorable, but it has a major design flaw. Because the legs are hollow and the plug hole in the bottom is surrounded by a lip, it's very difficult to get the coins out. Once you pull the plug and turn the pig over, all the coins spill and slide into the legs. The lip around the plug hole inside the bank also prevent coins from sliding out. The only way to get the coins out is thus to shake the bank violently. The only coins that come out will be those that hit the plug hole directly.This bank is wonderful for kids who want to look at it, but not for those who want to insert and remove coins."},{"rating":"1","title":"dirty piggy","review":"My daughter was devastated when her little brother smashed her porcelain piggy bank so we bought her this plastic unbreakable piggy bank for a replacement. She loves it and I agree that it is really cute.

This bank is perfect. It's pretty large, but my kids love holding them and love getting coins to put inside. There is a black plug on the bottom to open, but I'm not worried about them figuring out how to do it. Plus, I keep the piggy banks on a shelf where they can't reach.It only comes with a blue gingham scarf, so I just cut a piece of scrap floral fabric for my daughter's so we could distinguish between our 2 pigs.The only negative is that the pigs have little scuff marks near the tail end due to the packaging, but I'm willing to use a little acrylic paint or marker to cover it up if the kids wanted me to.I've already had a few people (grown-ups) ask about where we got the cool piggy banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"My kids love this piggy bank.

It's very frustrating for her, and even I have a hard time when she asks me to fish out her money for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for older kids","review":"This is a perfectly well-made functional piggy bank. If, however, you plan to take the money out with any regularity (say, your 3-year-old's favorite game is to put coins in, then have you empty the bank so she can do it again), I don't recommend it.

New generation is better than the old one in that its one button, its worse in that you have to tear these things apart to figure out why they aren't running every year when you try to fire them up. When they run, they're great. From year to year, they stop working.I had a very revealing conversation with the customer support manager last year when I said, but this is the new replacement unit for last year's failed unit, so why isn't it under a new warranty and she replied, if we did that, we'd have to send everyone a new unit every year!

Worked great for two years, then in July of 2002, it wouldn\`t stay on. Called customer service a few times, did everything they told me to, but eventually they sent me a new power unit under warranty. That lasted a little more than one year; in 2003, we started having problems with it again. Called customer service today (July 5, 2004 -- no wait for service rep). Did what they asked. Appears that the muffin fan is dead. Asked about replacing it -- they don\`t have any parts information. Not under warranty, must replace head for $350 (and get 6 months warranty on it) or \\"upgrade\\" to Pro 2004 for $600 (and get 2 years). I asked them about reliability -- they said the new Pro is more reliable; don\`t know if I want to spend $600 to find out.While it runs, it does catch a lot of mosquitoes, but when it breaks, it's an expensive lawn ornament.

This doesn't even begin to cover the time on hold with technical support and starting it over and over holding the silly button in for five minutes each time. I finally emailed support for my last ditch effort to fire it up this spring and they said that the only thing they could do for me is to \\"trade\\" it in on another model if I sent them another $425 and paid to ship it back to them.

This is not a usual \\"Rat Pack\\" compilation with witty banter and outtakes. Instead it is composed of very old Sinatra songs (probably recorded in the 40's), some very early Dean Martin interspersed with cuts by Sammy Davis, Jr. which were recorded in front of a live audience.

Things like wearing different clothes or hanging out with different people or whatever crazy things women make us do for their love. Whoever thought of the idea that it is about masterbation has too much time on their hands, and that is apparently not all that's on his hands.

The only negative is that you can sense a change in direction on this lp. Where its predicessors are very edgy and experimental , this album is like i said \\" catchy \\". There's also some shlop on this one: Take on the World and Evil Fantasies . This is the period where Priest is getting a taste of success ... and i guess if you want more success ( airplay ) your songs have to be shorter and sweeter.

Cross \\"Sinner\\" with \\"Exciter,\\" and that's kind of what you've got. \\"Delivering The Goods\\" is a kick-@ss opener and one of my five favorite Priest songs. It's an overlooked classic. The variety between the tracks while still maintaining a constant aggressive attitude is amazing. \\"Evening Star\\" is a bit more commercial, but still kicks along. Then, of course, there's the title track and \\"The Green Manalishi,\\" both of which are very good as well. \\"Before The Dawn\\" is a beautiful ballad sort of thing that feels just a bit out of place, but the musicianship and emotion more than makes up for that.

On this one, the drums and cymbals punch through with more clarity and the guitar intro to \\"Delivering The Goods\\" has even more of a staccato flair. As for the album itself, this CD is definitely my favorite of the pre-\\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" era Priest discs. It runs the gamut from full-on hard rockers (\\"Delivering The Goods\\", \\"Rock Forever\\", \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\", \\"Running Wild\\", \\"Burning Up\\"), pop-ish singalongs (\\"Evening Star\\"), beat-heavy rhythmic dirges (\\"Take On The World\\", \\"Green Manalishi\\", \\"Evil Fantasies\\"), ballads (\\"Before The Dawn\\"), and even a prototype disco-metal tune (\\"Killing Machine\\").

This book is really for people who want to change and who want to be rich, not just make ends meet. However, even if you just want to work your job and have security, this book doesn't put that down or invalidate that.

It is very poorly written, extremely repetitive of information in the earlier book and so badly laid out from a design stand point that I was offended. The worthwhile new material, having to do with what type of investor you are and giving a step by step process for moving into the quadrants that lead to financial freedom, would make a good MONEY magazine article. The rest is padding. I guess you have to spend your money to get the new information, but you don't have to waste your time reading the whole thing.

Aside from a few (very few) useful and engaging stories, like the one about the \\"quaint little village\\" with a water problem, this book is just one long, boring, repetitious slog.

As for how the the author made his fortune, the financial data was too sparse to gain any knowledge from. For example the author found a property worth $100,000, but was able to buy it for $80,000. Was it really worth $100,000? The author sold it on a wraparound lease and made money, he said. The cash flow discussion did not reveal how it played out. It would have been interesting to see how the income taxes and depreciation worked. I don't believe that the profit on that venture in the long was significant. Moreover, the author and his wife were broke and living free with someone else. Where did they get $10,000 to start buying the property they invested in? Pop's money?

I decided to listen to the positve reviews and ignore the negative. That was a mistake.The books contain alot of \\"fluff\\". Over simplified information and stories. In one of the Rich Dad books, the author goes on to speak of the different kinds of \\"leverage\\" and then alludes to the leverage of popular children's fairy tales.

There are some repeat \\"lessons\\" but they tend to go more in depth and have different examples that help me have a better understanding of the concept. In one of the books RTK uses an example of the financial education that you need to be financially free and compares it to the foundation of a building. These books are helping me lay that strong foundation.As a side note, I listened to the audio CD version of this book and the only things I didn't like were the speakers voice (very robot-sounding) and the fact that every time he mentioned a particular quadrant, he had to say both the letter and name of the quadrant... this got a bit tiresome and a bit Sesame Street sounding (ie \\"B, Business\\", \\"I, Investor\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"Robert Kiyosaki's style and information are easy to absorb and comprehend. Out of all of his books, I recommend \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\" to read first. It really gets to the core about how our money works in terms of our employment styles. Robert explains the four ways to earn income: either by being an employee, (E) self-employed, (SE) a business owner, (B) or an investor (I).These 4 types of workers make up the cashflow quadrant, and he explains the difference between them, and which type we should all strive to be, if we truly want to be financially free.I have been playing his \\"Cashflow\\" game for years with family, friends, and in Cashflow groups.

I know this was also done in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but this time it was overkill. The motivational messages started to wear thin when you can see that it was just to fill up a page. There is also something very contradicting I found between the first and second book. In 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' he said that owning a business is very hard and he dosen't recommend anyone starting one unless they truly desire to have one. Then In 'Cashflow Quandrant', he says that you should own a business first before moving into the I quandrant to invest in stocks and real estate. Uhhh.....hello? These are the reasons why I'm giving it only 2 stars.

No insightful truths emerge. Some basic financial guidance does, but stuff that is covered better elsewhere. And after 200 annoying pages of this, it shifts into a not-so-subtle sales pitch for some other product the author has dreamed up. Light on content, and more than a little manipulative.Like a previous reviewer has suggested, I'd advocate instead reading a lot of the (free) content available at the Motley Fool investment site (they also sell books, but start with the free stuff ... there is a lot there).

Using them in a pistol-grip crossbow and they fly nice and straight, but once they hit something, they break at the tail and are done.

The Tawian half aluminum half molded hard plastic are just awful. The plastic and aluminum parts of the shaft don't line up on more than half the arrows, causing them to fly eratically. In addition the plastic on two of the arrows broke on the first shot into high density foam made specifically for archery. It is not hard and there is no reason for the arrow to fail.A tip - don't throw away the broken shafts. Take the aluminum part and make fletching from masking tape. They don't fly quite as well as the Cobra arrows but they do OK if you do the fletching carefully and it's far better than wasting money on more of these crap arrows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great.","review":"I have both plastic and aluminum bolts for my crossbow and both work very well.

What i did with the fletching and tip is used super glue to glue the fletching back in and straighten the tips out. I would recomened carbon or plastic bolts if you are just target shooting. If you are hunting than these are probally best, although the fletchings might come out due to over penetration. So watch out for that. Over all i don't like these bolts.

The characters are boring and predictable, and the dialogue is flat.

He imagines the elevator, the automobile and fax machines, for example.Not horrible, but not up to the standard I expect from Verne."},{"rating":"1","title":"A xenofobic book to avoid","review":"The only merit of the book are Verne's technological prophecies whichat times are very accurate. For the rest, this is a very bad book.Worse than bad, it's xenofobic: Anything non-French is looked down upon.The racial arguments are nauseating: it's like reading nazi propeganda.The author goes so far to glorify war, to long for the days that you couldkill a man in duel. All about the so-great French honour. Next to that,the story itself is empty. It's mainly a summation of all the 'great Frenchauthors', nothing more. This book discussed me. Avoid it if you do notbelieve in the supremecy of pure French blood. Today, such a novel wouldbe considered fundamentalistic, and un-fit for publication.To conclude: Verne's publisher was right no the publish this. It's a shamethat the modern day publisher did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible vision (terrible plot)","review":"Verne's ability to extrapolate a remarkably accurate vision of the future by dreaming of uses for the new inventions of his day is incredible. he foresees the mass-market use of paper made from wood pulp, automobiles, calculators, fax machines...etc. by looking closely at the inventions that are just beginning to receive attention in his own time. The plot of this novel is not really worth anything; it serves only as a framework around which this vision of 1960 Paris is built. This is a good (short) read for anyone interested in how technology evolves and might serve as a primer for aspiring futurists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost","review":"If only it had stayed lost, maybe surviving only in rumor and speculation, we could have imagined the great things Verne might have predicted. We could have wondered at the clever plot twists. Just out of reach, it could have been great.But in our hands, apart from his reporting on the newest of the new inventions of his time (e.g. a rudimentary fax/telegraph machine), we can only follow the thin, strident plot and marvel at the visions not seen.Of course if you love Verne, you have to read it. Just lower your expectations a bit. There's no Captain Nemo here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"When this novel was published a few years back, I was looking forward to it. After all, I loved Verne's classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. We all do, right?Then I read Paris in the 20th Century.... Well, it is indeed surprisingly prescient about future technology. But that's the only good thing to be said about it.The plot is flimsy at best, the characters have no appeal and the overall tone is one of self-indulgent whining. Incessantly so. Oh, how awful a world would be if certain poets ever failed to be lionized! The same list of poets repeated ad nauseum.In short, don't waste your time on this. If you want a well-written book that shows a dystopian future with a culture-technology clash, read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or Ray Bradbury's Farrenheit 451."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original Editor Had It Right","review":"I don't know which book previous reviewers read (and gave it 4 stars) but this novel is truly awful!!! The original editor buried it and there it should have stayed. Unfortunately, someone has decided to capitalise on Jules Vernes reputation to make a fast buck.

However, the literary construction around these ideas was very poor. Thankfully a short read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but uneven","review":"Well, this was Verne's first book, so one has to treat it with an appropriat amount of respect.

In it one can feel Bart writing and singing(Yes there are two tracks with Bart singing himself from a special he did called \\"Bart on Bart\\") about the East End he knew and embraced. You can see Bart's interest in writing about \\"villians\\" and \\"loose women\\" and how he naturally fell into writing about the same types of characters from Dickens' Oliver Twist and to go on to write \\"Maggie Mae\\"). It's not as polished as Oliver! but there are some really good numbers that you will be happy you heard and they will keep you humming.

If I were a head coach, it would be required reading for the Freshman and Sophomore staffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"STRONG POP COLLECTION","review":"A surprisingly effective excursion into pop for Baez, with a set of melodic songs gracefully interpreted. The lilting reggae of No Woman No Cry works well - she tweaked the lyrics (Trenchtown becomes Boystown) for a more universal application. Song At The End Of The Movie and Before The Deluge are magnificent sad songs without being despairing, whilst Honest Lullaby is autobiographical and reminiscent of the earlier Gulf Winds.

Highlights some of TOC's Thinking Processes in a very practical and fun way. As with all of the TOC novels, it is important to remember that they are applications of TOC, which is a generic management system. I was a tad disappointed in the ultimate solution to the problem presented in the book. It ended the book with a very \`deus ex machina' feel instead of the usual demonstration from TOC that the constraint is usually in policy and lack of end-to-end thought. Still, as said mentioned, well worth the read - should be supplemented with The Goal and It's Not Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story - incredibly insightful","review":"This book was a slow start, then I really started to come up to speed on the healthcare system, their challenges and issues and enter Harry, with the ideas on Theory of Constraints which Beth grasps very quickly and starts to put to use. It is very encouraging as she decides to take on this amazingly large task to hand, armed with just her new thinking and analyzing techniques. I really enjoyed the read. I was however very frustrated and disappointed at the endless number of punctuation, grammar, and other similar English language errors that the publishers had made.

Not a classic or a tight album but it's better than a average bling-bling bullcrap. You feel?So, this CD is alright. I really liked some guests like kRS, Sadat and some of the DITC staff. The album has some great beats and great rhymes delivered by Finesse and his team mates. I liked \\"Brainstorm\\", \\"Speak ya peace\\", \\"No gimmicks\\" and the bonus with Sadat and 'em.

I wasn't expecting much from the Black & Decker, but two deficiencies did surprise me. The collet has only one split - I've been told that to properly grip the bit, there should be four splits in a 1/4\\" collet, and I've seen inexpensive routers with only two, but never just one. I was even more surprised to find there is no way to adjust the height of the bit from under the table when using the router in a table. To change the depth of cut, you have to remove the router from the table, reset the plunge depth gauge, plunge the router and lock it down, and reinstall it in the table. Since I bought this router to use both in-hand and in a table, it wouldn't work for me, especially since I often make cuts using two or three passes with gradual adjustments of depth in-between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast forward review","review":"Some of these black and white \\"roughies\\" have some decent sex sleaze scenes in them, but not this collection.

And there's one suggested belt scene that never gets started.Other than that, you might like this if you're a fan of zaftig 1950's style women wearing hose and yards of underwear. But most of the action involves a lot of half-clothed orgy scenes on the floor (not very comfortable), maybe because they only had one bed in the hotel room they filmed it in, I suppose.

Besides all else mentioned already,it reads like a story. No theoretical arabesques, just nitty gritty factual details so you can see connectednesses for yourself. Baltzell's very factual illustrations of idealisms' realities and human tensions towards cultishness versus civic participation serve as a useful lense and compass to me ever since reading this book. I recommend it whenever I can, particularly to someone who, like me, may at one time, be shocked by a human experience or contrast and want to ask why. I'd recommend it to any one ever involved in a cult. Its readability is comforting and enthralling, and it is deeply seated in a sense of the continuity of history and human nature.

It worked fairly well for the 1st year. The second season I noticed more mosquitoes biting the kids and fewer in the trap. I made sure everything was clean and in working order and kept feeding it propane. At the end of the season my igniter (the little push button starter that looks like the ones found on your typical propane grill) failed so I put it in storage and figured I'd call the company and order a new igniter button (they cost about $10.00 at your local hardware store). American Biophysics just informed me that they won't sell me the $10 igniter. I must buy a reconditioned powerpac for $375.00 instead.

The third year the noise got louder and the catch dropped to nothing, so I shut it off and I'm gonna try for a repair, but from what I've read the company has new owners and it's unclear if repairs will be available any time soon.My recommendation: if you're rich, buy a new one of these every year and live a beautiful mosquito-free life :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mosquito Magnet = Unreliable piece of junk","review":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!

The author tells you the story of how the Samurai came to be with the intent of showing how Japanese Fudalism is not just an analog of Western Fudalism.

I read the book, downloaded the CD into my iPod and took it to the driving range. I worked on the tempo and hit balls and found that I hit some pretty well. Over the weeks I've had a mixed reaction to the process. If your mechanics aren't where they should be, I don't understand how this book will make you that much better.I've been working on my swing and trying to get it smoother and easier. In doing that, I think my swing was getting slower. Tour Tempo made me realize that I was swinging too easy.I think the book is worth checking into, but don't expect a miracle without a lot of hard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and cd","review":"I'd been struggling with my game and somehow ran across this book.

However, as some other reviewers have pointed out, this is not the \\"cure-all\\" for all your swing problems.If you have major flaws in your swing, this book will not be a complete remedy. Speeding up your swing may eliminate or diminish some of your bad swing habits, but not all of them. You will remain frustrated and hit bad shots.While every golfer can benefit from this book, I think the book is even more helpful for those golfers who already have a relatively smooth, effective swing.Tour Tempo does contain exercises to make sure your swing is correct. However, I doubt that most high handicap golfers can implement these suggestions without some further instruction.So, by all means get this book and learn about tempo. It's a vital element of a good golf swing. But don't count on this book alone to cure your swing deficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Contribution to Golf Instruction","review":"Beyond Ben Hogan's bedrock classic, this is the finest golf book I have read. Hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"More power please","review":"Did I ever need this book and cd. I have been slow to adopt the tempo to my game on the course because now all my clubs hit to long. If your swing gets in the right tempo so many bad habits disappear on their own and I finally feel the whiplash effect that your body creates with the proper tempo. My body is finally working as one.

On second thought don't buy this book I might have to out play you sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they say","review":"Not impressed at all. The book was nothing but the author patting himself on the back for what he claims is a great discovery. It then turned into story after story - including his son - of how Tour Tempo helped improve golfers club head speed. Nothing much to help you with your swing. I can tell you it all in a couple sentences, and it's free. Find yourself a metronome set it up swing to the clicks and you have 100% of the CD. Practice at the pace you like and then start to speed it up. This is the whole book and CD. Save your money, unless you want to waste time reading something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tour Tempo","review":"Simply put, don't waste your money. The author basically says that your backswing to downswing ratio should be 3 to 1. The CD provided is basically a metronome with tones set at a 3 to 1 ratio. The author claims to have measured the backswing to downswing ratio of many tour pros, and he claims when they are winning they have a 3 to 1 ratio."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best golf books I've ever read, and so simple too","review":"Great product as everyone else points out. Such a simple idea, yet so remarkably capable of fixing your swing. I didn't realize just how mush I was trying to muscle the club, rather then let my natural tempo and fluidity carry it. I'm the kind of person who needs a swing thought, but at the same time they make me stiff and awkward. But if my swing thought is tempo, i.e. proper speed back and through, I become much more free loose and less timid, the club glides along rather then feeling like I have to reroute it and muscle it back to the ball. Truly a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour Tempo","review":"I would recommend this book to any golfer. My results were fantastic! The great thing about using this book is it provides certain tempos to use during practice. One problem I believe all golfers struggle with is creating the same swing throughout your round.

My index has moved from 16.4 to 11.2."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.....","review":"Tour tempo is easy to read, the concept is very simple to adopt and more importantly works!

They claim to have discovered through video analysis, \\"golfs final secret\\". What secret?In his book \\"Four Magic Moves\\" Joe Dante says of the backswing and downswing, \\"These two segments of the swing can be accurately timed by a motion-picture camera, by the simple process of counting the number of pictures the camera takes during each segment. Such a count shows that the backswing of a good player takes almost exactly twice as long as the downswing.\\" This book was published in the early 1960s.If you have never heard of this concept, this book will help you.

He's a narrative storyteller tapped into the trials and tribulations of the working class.

Also, sentences are repeated and sometimes cut off altogether (see the end of page 16 and the beginning of page 17; the sentence at the end of page 17 is incomplete as is the final one on page 124.) Perhaps the British edition by Spellmount Ltd. is free of these flaws, but I haven't seen it.

It's not that I mind reading large books (Neal Stephenson's \\"Diamond Age\\" left me wanting more) but I found nothing to hold my interest here.Set in India apprx. 50 years in the future, each chapter is devoted to the point of view of each of several characters- a gangster, a cop, a politician, journalist, scientist, etc. None of the characters seem very likable.

Writing India can be next to impossible, and he uses Sci-Fi effectively (albeit heavy handedly) as a way of commenting on a region fractured in ways too numerous to count. The book is at its best when McDonald uses Stephensonesque tech concepts to exacerbate this tension. Mcdonald's prose fluctuates between the prosaically matter of fact, and the oddly lyrical. It's a sprawling, occasionally messy, jubilant juggernaut of a book. It's refreshing to encounter Science Fiction that is not firmly rooted in an American or European setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I liked this story and really felt immersed in the world McDonald has created. I was also very intrigued by the difficult relationship between humans, the artificial intelligences they've created, and how conceptions of God inform how either sees the other. This is well worth your time.My only complaint is that there are a few instances in which I felt the commentary on current politics was a little too overt. It is possible to say something in fiction about the real world without it distracting the reader from the story the way a speedbump distracts a driver from a nice drive. On the up side, these distracting remarks were few and short so not too much of a bother.Check it out.

I don't need to be hammered with the idea ever third sentence. You're clever and use a lot of Hindu words. I GET IT. I like a challenging novel as well as anyone, but this was too often like doing a crossword.As it happens I just finished a fantastic execution of the same sort of idea.

However, it is a good reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonard Maltin's 2007 Movie Guide, Plume Paperback Edition","review":"Bad buy. I have been getting a cheaper version - also sold by Amazon - every year. My biggest complaint was the extremely small type. As far as I can see this book is the same thing with bigger pages and larger margins but still the tiny type. I'm sending it back to get the cheaper edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie reviews","review":"Good reviews. Reviews listed in strict alphabetical order which makes it easier to use than some others. Also, it is slightly more complete than some others in that it lists a few more cast members than other guides. Doesn't always tell what the MPAA rating is based on (e.g., is it an R due to excessive violence, nudity, etc.?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for a world of movies...","review":"If your world is bounded by the borders of America then this guide will be just fine. It patronisingly relieves you of all decisions as to 'suitability' and completely ignores a wide genre of movies. As an example (I can give you more) try looking up the world-reknown Italian Director Tinto Brass. Maltin thinks he released only one movie - Caligula - and he doesn't rate that as worth watching! No, its not his best movie - but neither is it his only movie. Anything vaguely 'sexy' gets trashed and I wonder which monastry Maltin grew up in.So if you want only the Mary Poppins and sugar sweet, and don't care about the wide range of movies from serious directors and producers abroad, then - go for it. But if you really want to know what is and has happened in the wide world of movies then don't waste your time or money on this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard Maltin's 2007 Movie Guide","review":"We have Leonard Maltin's 2003 Movie Guide Book and we really like his books.

I have a collection of over 1200 movies, both video & DVD style, and Mr. Maltin's Guides help me keep them organized! He also has a section listing each Actor's and Actresses movies through-out their careers!It is well worth the money each year to get ahold of this guide!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DOES IT SMOOTH AND RENEW SKIN?

Art is, of course, in fine voice as usual, and contrary to some other reviewers I think producer Louie Shelton pushed all the right buttons on this project. Far from being sappy, the arrangements compliment Art's beautiful tenor voice. While I am hard pressed to pick a favorite song on this CD, gotta go with Miss You Nights. While I respect Cliff Richard as a vocalist of great repute, Art really hits this one out of the park, and coupled with the inclusion of Bright Eyes, Since I Don't Have You, Beyond the Tears and When Someone Doesn't Want You, this CD is a treasure and a must for any Art Garfunkel fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous....","review":"Art Garfunkel has a beautiful voice and a word needs to be put in for this album, which is his best I think. And I Know, Sail On A Rainbow and When Someone Doesn't Want You are standouts. Interestingly the listings here include Bright Eyes, another classic Garfunkel piece, and that wasn't on the original album.I have a huge collection of all kinds of music, but I'd be hard pressed to think of a more beautiful album.

The cartridge that came with the pen didn't manage to write even a word before it failed, and the replacement cartridge that I ordered (from Lamy) was similarly terrible.

Once set up, you just slip a card into the scanner and watch it convert the graphic information to text. You do have to be careful in this process as the character recognition is not perfect and will often mistitle a field or just read the data incorrectly, but overall, quite accurate. When you verify the information as correct, it keeps the card in the desktop program, both graphically and in labeled text fields.

I will replace the cover with Sunbrella covers, but the cotton ones that come with are fine for a summer or two. The cushion/foam is really good, (surprisingly so) that there is no need to replace the inner foam, just the covers.

It evokes the romantic beauty of the Sonoran Desert like nothing else I've heard or seen.And if you have a soft spot in your heart for old tunes and the old west, hearing Willie & Leon harmonizing on Sioux City Sue and Don't Fence Me In will make you smile.I had this album on tape many years ago, but somehow lost it.

As for Willie Nelson of course everyone not living in a cave somewhere is well familiar with the myriad of songs he's written and certainly the many he's recorded. Leons reputation should also at least be in the back of any ones mind that's over 30 or so, from his early career through his association with Joe Cocker and still playing that backyard size piano as backup with various notable bands.

The only real mystery is exactly how many typos you'll be able to pick up throughout this book. (Is it just me or has proofreading at publishing companies gone out of style) The proofing is so bad here the protagonist's name actually changes at 2 different points in the story. Even ardent soap fans will find little inside humor in this offering. Every soap reference is to The Edge of Night, a soap that went off the air years ago. (This author must have worked for the show).

Using a piece of technology, she links to the TARDIS, but one much changed from her time there: the Doctor has lost his memory and Benny is in hiding for her own safety...This book is a bit of a worry. It's purpose appears to simply be to return Ace to the TARDIS crew and to tell a mildly Dalek-related story (odd, since Virgin didn't have the rights to use the Daleks in their books...). It also features Absolom Daak, a charcter from the Doctor Who comic series, who is a Dalek Killer!Despite all these Dalek-related issues, the story has little to do with them. Instead we are served up what amounts to a generic Who opponent, who is defeated in a generic Who way.A lack of true creativity dooms this book to being, at best, a second-string novel in the long line."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mess","review":"The Virgin Doctor Who novels allowed the writers to do something that couldn't be done on TV--they could bring back old companions. This is mixed blessing; on the one hand, it's great to see Ace, on the other, Ace is now a jerk! I know she was upset at the Doctor at the end of her last appearance, but that doesn't make it any more appealing.The other problem with this novel is it's vagueness. The Doctor et al land on your typical generic planet, with typical generic people. Nothing about the setting is terribly interesting. While it does turn out there's something significant about this, it doesn't really make this a very gripping read. The reuse of the maze scene from \\"Horns of Nimon\\" is a bad idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Train Coming","review":"Slow Train Coming being Dylan's 1979 release and his 19th studio album and it is very good album. Dylan's lyrics are laden with his at the time new found faith. Gotta serve somebody is a great track and he sings with such conviction that one can not help but to be moved his faith. The book-let is a mixed bag with an ok cover, very sparse information and an ok photo of Dylan. To my big surprise this was a record that included Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits playing guitar. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"i wish to bring up an issue no one else has or will...","review":"and that is a point made by a friend and dylan fan on a coke binge the year it came out.it regards the cover drawing.the closest feature to the viewer is the workman's arm which eerily (or ween-eerily) resembles a flaccid circumscribed unit!my friend's theory related to bob's having had potency troubles, as he and many a loverman will.and the woman who'll love you through it...G'day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUNDS good, but...","review":"The music is good, his voice is still that lovable, scratchy drawl, but there's something different...the lyrics are awful.

Arghh!Go to Blood on the Tracks, or Blonde on Blonde. Some older stuff. Leave this alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the rails","review":"I remember buying this album the week it came out in 1979. I also remember how disappointed I was with its banal lyrics and Christian message, which seemed so much at variance with Dylan's free-thinking genius. Mark Knopfler's irritating guitar playing is particularly intrusive, making all the tracks sound very similar. In retrospect, this album marks the end of Dylan's great period. He would continue to record great songs (including some religious songs, such as \\"Every grain of sand\\") but no more great albums (not even 2001's much touted \\"Love and theft\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it seriously","review":"What irritates me is that so many people won't take someone serious when that person is/becomes religious. Dylan became a Christian and believes in God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost, so what ? Of course, the music on this album is awsome, Knopfler's guitar is amazing, but let's take the lyrics serious as well. They are beautiful and full of fire. Maybe you don't agree with his opinions, but that's no reason to ignore and laugh at them. The song \\"Slow Train\\" must be nominated for his best song ever (what an anger !),as well as \\"Precious Angel\\" , an unbelievably beautiful song. \\" I believe in you\\" tells the story about all the insensitive people that will laugh at you when you believe... Fans who dropped Dylan during this time, were no fans to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"SACD volume low?","review":"The cd is great.Wondering if anyone else has noticed the volume on some of the the Dylan SACD hybrid cds is mixed low.

Eventually they did barely start coming out - but only on one side. Yes the motor is indeed quite loud.

I wanted the water to really stay very warm. This didn't do it. It would feel like there were strips on the bottom of the bath that kept my feet warm as the water cooled. Also, when you put the air jets on it is very noisy. I questioned how good it could be when we bought it for around $20 at Walgreen, and I was right. I should have just plunked the money and a bit more into one decent foot bath rather than wasting $20 and now having to go find a better one elsewhere.

The 'smart heat' did not keep the water warm at all, even though I made sure the water was very warm when I filled the spa. With or without the bubble action, the water cooled immediately.

I had it one week and it began to leak. It did not keep the water warm even though it stated it would. You had to start off with hot water, but the heated feature did not keep it that way.

First disappointment: you cannot add any foot softeners to the water, it will \\"clog\\" the air jets. It advertises 'smart heat' but the warm water cools off right away. But WORST of all, the air jets quit working on one side right away, which you don't expect with a Dr Scholl product. There is also no \\"massage\\", I guess the air-jets that don't work do the massage? It does have a 2-year warranty, BUT you must MAIL it to the Co, postage paid PLUS enclose a $15.00 check to cover handling! So are you s'posed to pay as much to get it fixed as it originally cost?

First day, i enjoyed it and it helped. Sort of kept the water warm (did not heat it, which is what the instructions inform you), but I loved the bubbles and the nubby things on the bottom for manual massage of the feet. Next day wanted to use it again and the bubble stopped working on the left side. Not happy, and it's been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Product for the Money; No Bubbles","review":"I read the other reviews, but I was hoping I would get lucky and get a working foot spa at a low price. Maybe I'll have more luck next time. The right side of the spa does not bubble. A very disappointing discovery right out of the box, especially since I was planning to give it as a gift. I know this is a low price, but I think that regardless of price, products should work as advertised by the manufacturer. I recommend you buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite useless","review":"Just like a lot of other people who have written, it had a problem with the right side not producing any bubbles. Even with the bubbles that were being produced by the left side, it was just a whole lot of noise and very little substance or movement of water. In short, don't buy this product. It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great foot spa","review":"I like this foot spa. I soak my feet for 15 min and then elevate them above my heart for 15 min. All of the extra fluid drains out of my feet and they feel much better.The bubbles and massage add fun to what is an ordinary job of soaking your feet in warm water. I keep an insulated teapot of boiled water next to me, and I add another inch or so of hot water every couple of minutes since the water cools rapidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of plastic","review":"You might as well save yourself the money and buy a bucket instead. Poor hot water in that a stick your feet in. If the bucket is metal, then im sure it will retain the heat better then this peice of junk. Also this thing does not massage. You have to scrub your feet against the floor of the thing, cause the \\"vibrators\\" do not move a wink.

The author tried to invoke intuition all the time by treating the subject in issue in an unformal way. Simply examples are called upon to show the motivations. Strict definition and proof are given later to make the text complete. This is exactly what I would need if I were studying calculus for the first time.Overall, The writing is clear and consistent, thus make it a good textbook for both classroom use and self-study purpose.

The worst part of the book was the solutions manual, which often bore little, if any, difference from the answers in the back of the book and was therefore largely a waste of money. In some cases, the back of the book provided more detailed solutions than the solutions manual. I originally took the course at a major institute of higher learning. I repeated calculus at a community college that used a different book. The other book was about twenty bucks cheaper and provided better examples and solutions in the solutions manual.

One person even said that we should read Children of the Lamp, or The Hobbit instead, and I think those are both pretty terrible books.

I agree with other reviews in that there is a Harry Potter type theme here. There are four friends that get together to play an innocent roll playing game that turns into taking on the task of saving their town of Avalon, MN.The characters that these four friends run into on their quest are very cool. From the mysterious and fearful Shadow King, down to one of the crew's school enemies that turns out to have joined the bad guys, each character brings something different to the table.The journey takes each of the four friends to a new level, challenging them to step outside of their \\"comfort zone.\\"I can't wait until the next book comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite - don't bother - Here's some other recommendations","review":"I pre-view books for my neice, nephew, and my frined's sons (ages 4, 7, and 10).Don't bother with this book. The story has potential but it's writen for a reader that is assumed to be completely unintelligent (and so are the characters).Example: Kids are told not to do something...in the NEXT SENTENCE they go and do it. No story build up, no circumstance that forces the kids into it.Example: Here's a common writing method in this book...\\"I don't get it\\" said Ernie. He was confused.-Obviously he was confused. The writer doesn't have to spell it out for the reader because the character says it himself...but to make the book longer, the author does.Spend your time on better some better series:The Children of the LampThe Last ApprenticeChronicals of Ancient DarknessHarry Potter (of course)The Hobbit"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is awesome","review":"this book is awesome. it has so much suspence i had to eat salad wile reading. by jacob age 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical wallpaper","review":"The movie contained a Latin musical group performing during a dance scene who were outstanding.

Where are all the epic songs, their real gems \\"Rhime of the Ancient Marriner\\", \\"To Tame a Land\\", \\"Mother Russia\\" and so on? These songs are the real essential songs.

This is their 13th greatest hit package (okay 4th). I wonder if they'll follow it up with a live release (later this year actually)? Anyway, disc one relies heavily on modern Maiden; from 1990 to 2003, to include the Blaze Bailey years. Despite a few catchy numbers, this disc is...let's say not the best.Disc two is pure, unadulterated, classic Maiden at their best; from their debut album to Seventh Son. The energy and hits never stop (well, until the CD is over). You also get two live cuts from the upcoming live album that cut original vocalist Paul Di'Anno a little more out of the picture. Now when the hell can I get the studio version of \\"Far of the Dark\\" on a hits package?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Hits?

This is a great starting point for someone just getting into Iron Maiden. Having said that, it is nothing that the long-time fan really needs as he or she probably has all the albums. For the die-hard fans like me, it would have been nice to see songs that were not mega hits but were terrific such as Another Life, Genghis Khan, To Tame A Land, and Back in The Village, amongst others. Nevertheless, it's hard to argue with the selected song list here as they really are Maiden's most famous songs. I can even appreciate the Blaze Bailey stuff being there as they did not forget any portion of their career, even that very dismal one. I give it 5 stars because you really can't get a much more comprehensive greatest hits package than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Iron Maiden's best","review":"Most of the band's best songs are on this set, although they let off Sea of Madness.

What you will find in this (much too) thick volume are meaningless anecdotes that are followed by more meaningless anecdotes. To be exact, the book reads like a transcription of slapped together interviews. I guarantee that you will be bored to tears after just 10 pages. For a better, more interesting look at Zanardi's life and accomplishment you would be much better off checking HBO's Real Sports documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I tried this CD after reading it's wonderful reviews but get very disappointed.

I am not one of them. Cabbage Alley is the best LP the Meters made for Reprise. The songs are well written and compact, which differs from Rejuvenation which relied more on the groups musical dexterity. Cabbage Alley displays the writing talents of guitarist Leo Nocentelli. He creates songs and arragements that really dig into the soul of a person. The Meters, who are known for their funk tunes, show a conscience and tenderness on this album without sacrificing the funk they delivered on there three Josie albums. Cabbage Alley is artistry at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"How was Tomorrow","review":"What a nice surprize they turned out to be!

This book brings to mind the wonderful, ethereal, dreamlike quality of a Turner painting - so apt, with Sanshiro's focus on the textural qualities of clouds and sky. The humour is carried beautifully through the translation. And the sudden ending - initially surprising, but with hindsight, perfect.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Important Work","review":"This album is where I first became familiar with Pharoah's work-besides Coltrane's Ascension. This is important stuff because it is an excellent departure in the spiritualist merge of three different civilizations: Occident, Orient, and African. All are intertwined within the genre of jazz. This is a movement that can be located in the works of other folks who played with Coltrane such as his wife. The music is a powerful statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"What continues to amazing about Pharoah Sanders' late 1960s work is its almost deliberate contrast fromn the tenor man's work with John Coltrarne a year eariler. With the master, Sander's pressed through the music like a angry safe crcaker's angry drill.Sander's own music is airy: full of chimes, percusson, tastefully light drumming, and an overall neuance of quiet rain gently crawling down a window.Sander's soloing has not entirely changed: he still uses his shreiks and swarks, but is playing into the music, almost around it, not punching through it.Any of his 1960s-early 70s Impulse albums provide templates for new age, spacey fusion, world music, and the ambient hum of acid jazz. Lonnie Liston Smith began with Pharoah, and soon created a whole new sub-genre.Get 'em all. Start with this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very endearing and excellent","review":"I LOVE this book.

The last novella has Carl and his friends exploring a Contruct that contains the many different alien species and their home environments.Although Joe Haldeman does briefly revisit his favorite topic of a conscript soldier this books is nothing like his award winning novels \\"Forever War\\" or \\"Forever Peace\\".

I read a lot of opinions about the seals before I bought this set... no, they won't be waterproof if that's important to you (they're not that tight), but they do seal well enough to keep your flour/sugar fresh. My only disappointment is that I was hoping the largest one would be big enough to hold a 5lb. bag of flour, but that isn't the case.

There is a power button next to where you attach the power cord to the LCD monitor. Remember to turn THAT power button on or you may find yourself looking at a dead monitor.

It narrates all Canadian history (almost up to present days) in a humorous easy-going way. However, there is one consequence to reading this book - most likely you will need some visuals (which the book lacks entirely - for a good reason), which will prompt you to use more serious works on Canadian History.Summarizing: this book is very nice for an overview, for ppl, who don't want to just touch on the subject (raising my hand), and for kids!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction.","review":"I find this volume to be very informative while not being to cumbersome.

The story might be very silly and indecent for those that are not into this genre... but if you're a fan of epic stories and fan-service driven anime, you will find it very entertaining all through out. Truly a must-buy of the genre because of the blatant over-the-top animation. Even with all the nudity and sillyness, they still manage to deliver a solid touching story, the score helps this quite a bit because it has that very heroic-feel... which makes it very emotional.

Nevertheless, some of the names and quotes I found in this book were startling. Practically every major intellectual figure over the past 2 milleniums represented themselves as a skeptic or disbeliever in this book. I think Robert Ingersoll summed the entire book very well when he said, \\"The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of infidels.\\"It's such a shame that the majority of children are taught the sugarcoated history which leads them to believe that there heroes like Twain, Jefferson, Edison, and Lincoln were 'good Christians.'This book is a powerful source of quotes from most of the greatest minds to ever cast their genius upon this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for defense!","review":"I bought this for having a source of well known intellects' opinions on the existence of a God, Humanism, Agnosticism, Atheism.

This book is both a work of art and a work about art. It's equally recommendable if you are doing serious research on Poe - Mr. Hoffman offers psychoanalytical criticism of all of Poe's major works - and if you like imaginative writing as much as Poe's beautiful dead women or simply want to read an extremely amusing book. Of course this is only possible if you don't take Poe, Mr. Hoffman or yourself too seriously. Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get Itr","review":"I can never figure out why people who seem to hate Poe's work insist on writing books about him.

You'd really be better off reading Poe himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"early 90s acid jazz compilation","review":"This is a good complition of soulful and funky acid jazz songs that was first released in 1991. Other than the track listings (which I'll post below) you get nothing in the way of liner notes, songwriting credits, or info about these artists. But I assume they were all \\"new\\" recording artists when this was compiled in the early 90s. In other words, nothing old or vintage on here, although there is a very cool cover of \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" by the Apollas. Overall, these songs have a pleasing uptempo vibe and are on par with most other acid jazz recordings of the era.1. Let it Out - Joe Mason2.

It is small enough that I was able to fit into lengthwise into my backpack and carry it on to a flight with me to Las Vegas. It has a lot of padding but luckily I didn't have to test that out yet and hopefully never will.

She's very frank, without being at all taudry, she speaks plainly and honestly about what life was like as a star in the silent era. I have since \\"youtubed\\" her and really can see what her appeal was. Great photos in book and references to so many stars and even the likes of F Scott Fitzgerals. Nice to know she wasn't a scandalous wreck, destroyed by fame. She remains a very confident, smart woman into her old age.

Ronald Isley singing \\"Let's Fall In Love\\", \\"How Lucky I Am\\",\\"You're Beside Me\\",\\"Let Me In Your Life\\",and \\"Love Comes And Goes\\"-the progression of balads is UNMATCHED by ANY R&B artist.If you have to pay less than 25 US dollars then you have gotten away with more than a bargin, maybe a crime.

Back in the day people must have been turned off because it was a double album and it was the height of disco. Well even the tracks that have some disco nuances are still funky. The first 3 songs, 'I Wanna Be With You', 'Liquid Love' and 'Winner Takes All' are pure funk while 'Life In The City' clocks in at 8 minutes and has an extended breakdown with some serious guitar riffs from Ernie. The album slows down with the mid-tempo groove of '(Can't You See) What You Do To Me?' and slows down even further with 'Let's Fall In Love' one of their best slow jams. This isn't one of their more well-remembered albums but it's just as good as '3+3' or 'Go For Your Guns'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A undervalued classic","review":"While other Isley Albums get better notice, this is a hot album.

Considering that the masters for these recordings came from four seperate companies, there's a nice uniformity of sound from cut to cut. It sounds as though most of these come from the safety masters, rather than 78rpm copies, and that makes it as good as it gets. It ain't hi-fi, but it's better than most.There's other CDs that present a more in-depth coverage of these bands, both Lunceford and Thomas, and for those with an ear and a heart for that sound should seek those out. However, if you are interested in an overview, and don't want to buy several CDs just to get some good cuts on one and a few on another, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich fantasy","review":"\\"Tribute Trail\\" is a thought provoking read, not a mere \\"sword and sorcery\\" novel. A rich fantasy setting provides the backdrop to consideration of Goddess Worship, male bonding, relationships (and many of the hurt/comfort variety) and Family groups, along with action and adventure. Rythian struggles to become - and remain - Sun Stallion, while Kherin seeks to redeem his honour, and fulfil his destiny in the service of the Goddess. This book does not shy from difficult, intense or intimate imagery. The characters are well drawn, from Kherin and Rythian, to Merse (and his gradual redemption) and Voran; from Syth, Rythian's loyal wife, to the three Priestesses - young and fiery maiden; practical and honourable mother; and the devious crone. The threads of the two men's lives, one in service to the Goddess, one in honour of the God, are woven together, binding opposites and equals into a fierce, loyal love and an incredible power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great american pop and latin mix","review":"During the late 60's as america looked for an escape from the the news of war and violence they turned toward latin music.Artist like sergio mendes and herb alpert came out with music that mixed latin music with american pop.This album came out in 1969 when the interest in latin music started to wane and was not as popular as earlier albums by Brazil 66.My favorite songs are Wichita lineman with it's great vocal arrangment and YE-ME-LE.Both of these songs were performed on the tv show music scene and are available on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eisheilig is great","review":"Although Eisheilig is as good as Rammstein, the style differs greatly.

What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy. This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga. Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent. In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell. Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modaji - Modaji","review":"Modaji leaves behind a long line of superb broken beat releases for their self-titled debut album, where they embrace a more R&B vibe. Though it might seem like a shock to those expecting more killer future jazz, fear not, the same careful attention to rhythm and craft are plainly evident. More than anything, the addition of vocals helps give the tracks focus so that they come across as actual songs. The romantic and sensual \\"Shook Up\\" is a slow burning groove; \\"Rush\\" slinks along in a similar vein. The tempos vary as well, so the house heads can shake to \\"Into Something\\" while the head-nodding jazz enthusiasts can turn to \\"Outside from the Inside,\\" \\"Sanctuary,\\" or \\"Shocka's Joint\\" for their fix. Just the thing you need for putting your feet up after a long day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcomers we are","review":"Very comprehensive view of the complexities of the book of Revelations.

It is very difficult to avoid applying an excessively thick layer of the cream when working with a professional level instrument such as the King 2B. This results in a very sluggish slide response.

Although the central conflict revolves around the main character's desire to have a baby, the movie is really more about relationships and maturity. After Grace (Lisa Eichhorn) meets Peter (Stanley Tucci) under a staged pretense and a relationship begins to blossom, you know it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out. That suspense, although simple, is powerful and pays off in a very tense, realistic scene that Tucci makes his own. With a child's future at stake, you find yourself rooting for Grace and Peter--sometimes in alternation and sometimes simultaneously. This rhythm allows the comedy to come through over and over again as we witness the inevitable fallibility of earnest people. The light-hearted comedy against the backdrop of a serious, provocative conflict definitely makes this film worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"The plot is very slow, and not in a good way that lets it unwrap and draw you in.

Two New York women spend their time being condescending and denigrating toward men. One decides she wants a baby so opts for artificial insemination. Then through stealth finds out who the doner father is and stalks him. The film overall proves that women do not know what they want nor what they are doing and that they pretty much resent the fact that they actually need a man in their lives. More of a disillusioned chick flic than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The early Mehldau","review":"I highly recommend this Cd for those who are already Brad Mehldau listeners! You will discover wonders of his music that were still just beginning to emerge at the time, at the beginning of the 90's. Mehldau was already in complete command of the piano, but wasn't yet creating those wonderfull soundscapes that he creates now. You can listen an astonishing improviser, with complete assimilation of the jazz vocabulary of the past, taking risks and beginning to free his left hand from the tirany of comping'!Another interesting point is that Mehldau since 1994 has been directing his virtuosity in another way. He could and can, for sure, play at incredible speed, swing hardly and manage the bebop heritage at its best, but nowadays his efforts seems to be more toward group interaction, music development and texture. If you are new to Mehldau's music I suggest you listen his Arts of The Trio first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of younger years...","review":"Loved this album when I was in my late teens.

The acting is beyond cretinous, the camerawork shoddy, and the picture grainy and wobbly.Sound is also chronic in parts with voice sound volume decreasing abruptly when actors walk away from the boom mike.Although the gore is plenteous and quite well delivered, it seemed that Mr Cavalline was just direcing a series of horrific scenes to shock.There was no cohesion and it came across like he was trying just that bit too hard. There is not much (if any)storyline, so all in all not a success.I'd recommend this film to horror boneheads who can understand gore when they see it, but would be confused by any semblance of plot or realistic acting.

It's about human trafficking, which might not be a brand new plot device, but Stockholm delivers it in a way that grabs hold of the viewer and shouts in your face that this kind of stuff is happening in your own backyard or neighborhood.

If you do like Dylan, ask yourself this: Should Blowin' In The Wind really have been rewritten as a cheesy Las Vegas anthem? Is this Bob Dylan?

But it's hardly an album to run out and buy, unless you're very interested in how Dylan reinvents himself in all his stage shows. This time out, the big sound obscures the lyrics, without the glamour and myth of the Rolling Thunder shows.

I decided to finally pick this disc up recently and am very glad I did. If you are into Indie Rock that doesn't feel too Indie, then you will enjoy this disc. The songs are catchy, but don't ever cross the line into cheesy radio-type rock crap. The vocals are solid and the musicianship tight. If you're into some good chill stuff I would give this disc a spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indie Rock Goes Bad","review":"This record is dull dull dull.

And yet I'm a little cold on this new full length CD. I saw them play twice in Seattle before the launch of \\"Universe\\" and was spellbound. Yet the high production value, studio sound of the same songs seems awfully homogenized. It's a little depressing, really to think that a producer could strongarm a band of this extraodinary talent. If you're new to Creeper, get Watering Ghost Garden. The self released EP, it's a much truer peek at what this band is capable of. That is to say, brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"Thanks for writing this record. I don't care what those solitary loners care about.

After the catchy/quirky Become Small & Go and the beautiful, lush Watering Ghost Garden, I had high expectations for Creeper Lagoon's new album. Well somebody (Dreamworks?) sucked the life out of it and it is a boring, tepid, weak stab at commercial top-40 stardom. Wrecking Ball should be a 'big hit' on MTV and commercial radio, but none of these songs have the bite of their earlier material. They have so much more talent and potential than is reflected on this coaster. I hope they get their mojo back for their next outing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ever feel cheated?","review":"i can't believe i waited 3 years for this!!! this doesn't even deserve one star. it sounds no different than the watered down junk that's all over modern rock stations right now. whoever wrote that this sounds like lifehouse and dexter f. and smashing pumpkins is totally right. you just forgot one thing: those bands suck and so does creeper lagoon. and what about those lyrics? better watch out bob dylan 'cause here comes some winners like \\"i don't believe in cool, i went to summer school.\\" sounds like you need to go back to high school and take a poetry class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a great CD, could be a five star album...but there are a couple songs which aren't as good of quality.

Their much anticipated major label sophomore effort \\"Take Back the Universe and Give me Yesterday\\" finally was released last month with a mixed reception and varied applause. Although many indie purists maintain the band has sold their dynamic and emotive guitar driven pop noodling to the Everclear's of Hellfire and corporate damnation, these San Francisco darlings no doubt have created a solid, beautiful mix of intricate guitar fueled melancholy. Mature beyond their years Creeper Lagoon is still a force to be reckoned with in the years to come even if their musical chops are laced with more corporate sheen the songwriting is still ripe and tasty in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fan-Friggin'-Tastic","review":"The equal of their first release, I BECOME SMALL AND GO (love the titles this band comes up with). Sure, there are some moments that are a little too \\"college-y\\" or indie, but those moments of incredible pop bliss more than make up. This band should be huge. Damn it all, the runaway of success of marginal talents like Britney Spears and Staind has me thinking there's just no justice in the music biz. I know, that's crazy talk. Buy this thing and prove me wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must- Listen...","review":"I've been following Creeper Lagoon's music and this CD is certainly a departure from their last CD. It takes several twists and turns stylistically, ranging in flavor from the radio-friendly alternative pop sensibility of Oasis with \\"Wrecking Ball\\" to more unique, other-worldly stylings of David Bowie with track 11. Definitely a must-listen for music lovers who have become weary of the cookie-cutter pop formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE BLUES....THA'S RIGHT!","review":"PURE BLUES IS A GREAT MIX OF BLUES ARTISTS, FROM THE OLD TIME BIG MAMA THORNTON AND JIMMY REED, ALL THE WAY UP THE BLUES LADDER TO THE MORE CURRENT KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD AND JOHNNY LANG.

So is Veronica diAngelo, and she's already deciding where to display her next blue ribbon. But Veronica may be in for a shock. The Saddle Club has a secret weapon: Samson the natural-born jumper. He and Lisa Atwood could steal the show.As Lisa competes, she realized that Samson is even better than they thought--and a lot better than she is. And the other riders are mean-spirited and seem to think winning means destroying competition, not just trying your hardest. Do Lisa and Samson have the right stuff to take the blue? Or will they have to settle for less than the best?"},{"rating":"1","title":"LIsa is ssooooooo unprofessoinal","review":"Although over all the book was good, I can not accept what Lisadoes at the end.

SHe should be comforting them on her DUMB mistake! NOTe that I called her mistake dumb, not her. I really like Lisa but she wento over the edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"lisa in the spotlight","review":"This book is told mostly from Lisa's viewpoint. She is going to ride Samson in her first A-rated show, and she is understandably nervous. She further loses confidence when she discovers that some of the competitors are spoiled brats and her mother buys her an inappropriate show coat which causes gossip. Although I felt that the other riders at the show were caricatured, the author did a good job of capturing the show atmosphere. Lisa doesn't win, but in the eyes of her friends and those who know her, she is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"This book was pretty good, although I am getting tired of Miss lisa the perfectionist! She gets so upset over a B+ and gets upset over getting 2nd at an A rated show! If you have read Summer Rider, you will see that it is like that in that book, too. Lisa gets anorexia, but her friends help her.

I was reading the book and I got to that part and almost screamed with annoyance.I had to put the book down and slap it repeatedly with a stuffed animal just so I could control myself from going out to the mailbox and shipping it of to Timbuktu.PLEASE Bonnie,let Lisa lighten up a little.Other than that one particular part,I liked the book.Especially when Stevie told that yucky Margie girl off.That was funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record.","review":"This is a great album. From the Opening track to the closing it sounds great. This is the follow up album to a 1970's hit \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" (BAT)The production lacks in some places but over all its still a great record. BAT had a sound like no other record. \\"Dead Ringer\\" DR is a sound thats different as well. The opening track is a bit weaking pending on opinion. It could have bit alot better if the whole album was produced right. The songs of course are all good, they were written by songwriter Jim Steinman! The sixth track is just a 38 second piece that provides alot of imagery in just voice, similar to \\"Hot Summer Night\\" on BAT, only it is on a seprate track. It is different than BAT, the passion and the lyrics and every thing are all great. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh","review":"This album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane. Every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world. The end of 'I'm gonna love her for both of us', when he keeps saying the title with different inflections...don't you just picture Rainman rocking in a corner somewhere? And if she doesn't love him back, he'll kill her! Unless she's in bed with a group of his best friends?? No wonder 'Everything is Permitted.'This is bad. The production is bad, the tone of the guitar is godawful, Meat's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far (I know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back. I don't hold it against him, but I'm the one that has to listen to it.) The band is fine, and I like some of the actual music. It's the song titles and lyrics that are awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"For the most part the stories are extremely boring (let me hasten to add that i've been an avid Batman fan for the last 10 years), i only gave this book 2 stars because it had batman's name on it. the stories were childish bordering on moronic, not to mention out of date (1 story had bruce wayne ordering vacuum tubes for the bat computer). another flaw is that the book focuses more on bruce wayne than on his alter ego. for persons looking for good batman prose try the further adventures of the joker by the same editor or no mans land by gregg rucka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Childish","review":"I found this book in my personal collection, since it is an anthology, and I had already finished most of it, I decided to finish it.

The tales told in this book are very formulmatic and childish. As I was finishing the book I would read aloud to my wife the most ridiculous passages just so I was not the only one who had to suffer.

Water came out. That's the kind of flask you're looking at here. It's not even the threading on the cap, either; it leaks where the neck meets the body. When I squeeze the flask a little, water bubbles out from there. The box it came in was undamaged, so the leak must have been due to plain old shoddy manufacturing. That's what I get for trying to be too cheap. I'll be recycling this one and spending a bit more on the next one.Update: I bought a replacement flask on eBay for about $10 that appears to be identical to this one. This new one, though, doesn't leak, which leads me to believe that these particular flasks are probably just hit or miss and you'll either get a great deal or a worthless paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This is cheap for a reason.

Although it's not exactly a page-turner, since modern Icelandic life isn't all that exciting or weird, this would be excellent reading for someone planning on visiting Iceland, who wants to go beyond the hackneyed tourist sites and learn something about the people.

And having read the original papers of the correspondence between \\"Bulgaria i Tretiat Reich (Bulgaria and the Third Reich)\\" that were published in two extensive volumes in Bulgaria 1992 I have to say the author has not done his homework.

It's really, really bad. I'll never get anything from Crawford again. I don't care that the hooks are made of thin wire and don't hold much weight, that's plenty fine for most tools. It's that the hooks refuse to stay on the board. The little plastic retainers that are supposed to hold the metal hooks in place don't. They are difficult to get in place, use up holes that could have been for other hooks, fall out of the holes after a few uses, and get stiff and break in half with age. Overall, the whole package is a waste of money. Every time I try to remove a tool from the board, the hook comes with it and falls on the floor. I was putting them back up, now I just throw them in the trash.

The product description states it will work for both 1/8\\" and 1/4\\" pegboards, and while the accessories will fit in the holes of 1/4\\" pegboard, they are ridiculously loose (to be expected) and the biggest surprise is that the plastic locks they include to keep the accessories in place don't work at all in pegboards with 1/4\\" holes. All in all, the product's price was low enough to make the cost of returning it a moot point but the bins and jars, while flimsy, are usable.

They also don't come with the 2nd peg (not sure what you call them) that keeps it stable. As stated by a few others too, the plastic bin and jar pegs are very flimsy, I was very apprehensive even putting them on afraid they would break.On the other hand, the longer tool brackets and multi-tool hangers were pretty decent.

The new drummer, although not as tight as Stanier, sounds ok. What lets it down, as with the previous album, is the vocals. This is just painful and embarrising! Page seems to be trying to sing in the style which is trendy at the the time. Size matters vocaly sounded like Blink 182. This one vocaly is whiney as hell. And Page is also snarling now!!.

I don't think so but it's an effective sample of Loggins proficiency as an entertaining pop musician/performer/composer.The nine tracks range from upbeat dance songs to tender heartfelt (somewhat schmaltzy) ballads. THIS IS IT and KEEP THE FIRE are the two biggest hits and are still listenable today. JUNKANOO HOLIDAY and MR. NIGHT are notably infectious and NOW AND THEN is a beautiful ballad. The remaining tunes are passable though not truly remarkable.Released in 1979, its really the last in a series of radio-friendly discs that exemplified Loggins commercially focused works. Soon he would beome a little more bolder and eclectic in upcoming releases. KEEP THE FIRE is a probable inclusion in any Loggins fan library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"This waist trimmer is a good addition to my exercise program.

My plan was that as the old globe bulbs fail, I would replace with the CFL design. But while the incandecent bulbs would continue to work, the two replacement CFL from Feit had failed. They first started as quick on and near full brightness, but as time went on, the bulbs would be dim, then increase in light over a 45-60 seconds time until full bright. Finally, nothing. Dead.

It is the same method used to teach languages to U.S. diplomats today.The book presents colloquial, everyday language and teaches forms that appear only in conversation. It is not as useful for learning reading. It is an effective and very enjoyable way to learn languages.However, the student should also consider Wheeler Thackston's \\"Introduction to Persian,\\" which is more recent, and has, in my opinion, caused \\"Spoken Persian\\" to drop to second place. Thackston has nine sound cassettes available--if not from the book dealer, then from the publisher (that is where I got them); it teaches spoken and written Persian, lacks the defects of previous textbooks, and is more thorough, effective and enjoyable than any of its rivals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Forest Romance and Adventure","review":"This book was very good!

I have looked through Jeff Garrett's Encyclopedia of Gold Coins at the local bookstore, and strangely, I find that this book is way better. The Encyclopedia feels more like an oversized Redbook, while this item feels like a great work of art.I am looking forward to receiving the new 3rd Edition.

I know your not supposed to judge a book by it's cover and you souldn't but the drawings/paitings were much better and the girls in the real pictures look way too young and the girls are acting a little younger too.

I bought this book in Calcutta so that I might have a more in-depth history of the place I was visiting. Instead, I got a book full of opinions and one-sided propaganda. This is definitely an Indian's nationalistic view of the city of Calcutta and not an objective history lesson, as the book's title advertises. Whereas Krishna Dutta is indeed a gifter writer, she, or her publishing company, should have come up with a less-misleading title. Next time, pick up the \\"History of the Republican Party\\" by Rush Limbaugh or \\"The Cultural History of Russia\\" by Josef Stalin - just kidding of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!!!","review":"This movie is about a woman who goes to Madrid to write about \\"machismo\\", and believing in the old stereotype that all Spaniards are machistas she embarks in a futile search for the ultimate macho. It was a horrible movie with horrible dialogue and force acting. The main female character lack desirability, and in the scenes that were suppose to look or be sexy, she failed miserably. The translator, a macho Spaniard and an Antonio Banderas aficionado, only looked well with his mouth tightly seal.

The differences are enough to make you want to sit back and marvel at her unbrideled gift. She has a\\"new age\\" sound in some of the tracks.

Keiko's piano playing with Kazu's shakuhachi flute and Derek's synthesizer truly enhances the subtle beauty of each musical note. There have been many reviews in which criticizes Keiko for not sticking to jazz. The new direction she takes with her music to me is very unique and bold. Keiko's uniqueness in her music and message is what makes her such a truly gifted and talented artist. Deep Blue is another addition to her collection of treasures.

It is very difficult to discern how tough the various deer fencing products are based on the pictures on Amazon.

They just leaped right through it. We patched the holes with zip ties and put reflective flagging up, hoping the deer would see there was a fence, but every couple of days, they would just tear another hole in it.After two weeks, I took it down and replaced it with a Square Mesh Barrier Fence product I found online.

Split it in half to go around a 20'x60' ground level garden. Just step over to get in and out of garden. It is sort of hard to handle because it is rather light weight, unruly, and snags easily on things. I used tee posts about every 20' and tied with tie wraps. I left about a 6 inch \\"skirt\\" on the ground, turned it to the outside of the fence and weighted it with bricks. Dogs run into it. Grandkids run into it. Two snakes and a Texas spiny lizard got caught in it and died. One cottontail found an unsecured spot but it was generally effective in keeping rabbits out. I plan to buy more this year.UPDATE: I bought more. Had to take it down. Rabbits just cut holes in it (and the patches I made)and came and went at will. I've watched them come and go. Did catch and kill another spiny lizard, however. It was not effective for me and kills things I don't want killed.

Last year we bought some of the deer block netting and laid it down with stakes over all our perrenials. The deer would just move the rocks and push the netting aside. So this year we extended one side of our deck higher and had a tent over our gardens. It has been two days since our project completion. The first night the deer tore the areas where we twistied the netting together. Last night they not only tore holes through other areas where there were twisties, but they also chewed right through several other areas as well. This product is worthless and will not prevent the deer from eating your gardens. Wish I never bought it for my garden project. Now I am researching for something that actually will prevent the deer from chewing through it in order to save our garden. (P.S.

We have 2 cozy coupes so he pretends to be the gas attendant while my daughter is driving and also tops his own tank off before taking off in his police car.

Unfortunately, a lot of the humor seems timely, as in: it wasn't funny to me because this isn't the sixties. I think a lot of the references and humor are based around issues of that time or characters of that time. Our concepts of folk singers, of artists, of actors have all changed--perhaps not terribly much, but the cultural landmarks have shifted since this album. The 2000-year-old man is pretty good, but not even that was as hilarious as I had been led to believe.

After listening to his warm voice and sharp wit,it soon becomes apparent how he could almost effortlessly attract and win most people over with his words. The collection of commentaries contained in this CD, were recorded from his radio days prior to becoming president and provide insight into some of the issues and concerns of the American public during the 1970's.

His advice to visit them regardless of the fact that the National Park Service has asked for the sites protection to please not publisize or visit so as they may be preserved and cataloged is extremely disrespectful, on a number of levels.

He must just be laughing at us complaining about it. I would not purchase the book because if you have hiked for decades and know how long a mile is and know how much ground in miles you can cover in a day and how much water you need for a lets say a 9 mile hike you will be totally frustrated by this book and if your wrong in your 7th grade conversion computation you could be for example out of water before you reach your destination.

Although this book is full of detail about every inch of the lake, it is absolutely NOT user-friendly. The print is minute and the writing is atrocious.

Although there is a metric conversion table at the begining, it was very frustrating to have to keep refering back to it.

His hikes also include dates and lake level at the time as this has a big effect on what you will find when you go. I had his Second Edition of this book, which was written when the lake was near full (3700 feet above sea level). The Fifth Edition was researched in more recent times when the lake was around 3600 feet. His maps also show the water line in some of the canyons at these lower lake levels, in addition to the high water mark that you will find on any other map of Lake Powell.

We use it to walk to and from the car (when your carrying things like groceries), to do housework/cook, or just to walk around the block with the dog.

Andrews books are a far cry from the originals (Heaven, Flowers in the Attic, My Sweet Audrina). I remember reading those books in junior high, which was about 13 years ago, and I can still remember a lot that happened in each of them. However, the Shooting Stars series has been so bland that I can't even remember what has happened within an hour of finishing one. Also, the books are so formulaic, that a halfway decent junior high student could probably read a couple of them, and then use that pattern to write the next one in the series. I am really glad that I borrowed these books from someone else, because I wouldn't even want to waste 25 cents on one. Actually, I am sorry that I even wasted the time I put into reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"I didn't think it could possibly get worse after Rose, but I was wrong. All the characters in here are so flat and one-dimensional that it's hard to care for any of them, even the poor nearly-retarded uncle. The family revelation in this book that comes near the end is nothing more than yawn-inspiring. Grandpa Forman did what? Oh, REALLY? Too bad that I'm bored, otherwise I might care. I found each chapter a chore to plod through, honestly. I'm sad that the man who penned the enjoyable Cutler family books wrote this junk.Honestly, this book was rather cliched and contrived. Back then when this series first came out, i was still excited because I still had hope for Andrew Naiderman. I don't know why he stopped writing the usual mulktigenerational family drama thing anymore, these family sagas (Flowers in the Attic through Melody) were far better than this dredge he writes. Honey was only a tiny bit better than future books like Gemini or Heavenstone Secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may be from Ohio, but I'm no hick!","review":"I have to agree with the person who said this book contains horrible stereotypes of Ohioans. I live in Columbus, which is one of the 20 largest cities in the United States. Other large cities in Ohio include Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Dayton. There are very few farms here, and I've never seen one remotely similiar to the one described in this book. Ohio is actually best known for the Ohio State Buckeyes (the 2003 NCAA Football Champions), and its ever-increasing crime rate. You would think that after an extremely inaccurate portrayal of Londoners in \\"Lightning Strikes\\", the ghostwriter would be a little more careful with this type of stuff.I've also noticed this trend in the other Shooting Stars books. Ice is from Philadelphia, so she's a poor ghetto black girl. Rose is from Georgia, so she's a somewhat inarticulate beauty queen. Cinnamon is from upstate New York, so let's make her some sheltered social outcast. Let's grow up a little, Mr. Ghostwriter, okay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back Heaven!","review":"I wish that V.C. Andrews was still living - I won't lie about that. At least the series would have been phenomenal. I bet that these miniseries would have been intense and strong! Just think what the Cutler Series would have been like, not that it wasn't good enough already. ;) But I hated everything since the Wildflowers. We need another Heaven. Not an exact duplicate, mind you, but a strong girl with a backbone. How about one about a male lead for once? I thought that Tom Casteel should have had a series, along with Jimmy Longhchamp and Troy Tatterton. Their stories would have been interesting. I would have liked to see how Troy and Jillian were with each other from Troy's point of view. ;) But these new books just FRUSTRATE me! They're dumb and boring!

I am from Ohio and am very upset by his stero-type of Ohioans. Not all of us are farm living bible thumping backwood morons. Also there is no such amusment park in Ohio so get you map out peabrain. Beyond that Honey was just stupid. It's like she fell out the dumb tree and hit every branch and then the roots. I think most girls from Ohio would know enough not to go to New york then run off to any unkown aparment with the first man she meet.

Also, the ending was a little too pat for my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typical VC Andrews book","review":"This book is pretty good, it has a lot of romance, and mystery. It's the story of a young girl, Honey, who comes from a family with dark secrets and a very religious grandfather. She loves to play the violin and her teacher thinks she has potential and has her and another student get together to practice and of course they fall for each other. Then the typical Andrews storylines take over. Secrets come bursting out, family members go crazy, students tease Honey and Chandler for their relationship. Not the best book in the series, that belongs to Ice, but it does make me anxious for 'Falling Stars'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting party jams that don't hold the listener","review":"I picked this cd up based on a great review in Jazz Times magazine. The first two tracks are ok, but after that the cd became very repetitive and IMO boring. Each tune has pretty much the same canned drum beat and the bass player hangs on to one note for dear life. Shilts is a pretty good sax player who seems heavily influenced by Maceo Parker, but he's not someone I'd go out of my way to find out more about. None of the tunes stood out as being particulary good (or bad for that matter) although track 4 \\"Down in the Village\\" stayed with me because I swear the opening riff is Whitesnake's \\"Slide It In\\" (which doesn't surprise since Shilts has played with Jimmy Page, a contemporary of David Coverdale).I recommend passing on this cd unless you're just looking for background music for your next barbecue w/hip-hoppers and folks with some interest in jazz.

For a number of years we had no deer visits. In other words, we do not have what one would call any type of pressure by deer. They are rare but when they happen, they eat up your garden!

The dates I thought were kind of funny, he meets all these losers but maintains a humor about it that was funny.

I soon realized that I really love this perfume. It's a great everyday perfume - you can wear it during the day or at night.

All the other labels that spew out Tribute albums have the worst production on them. I could not even listen to this album. This album is so boring and tedious that I literally fell asleep half way through the CD. The songs are so mismatched too. When you start putting out a ska or polka version of a Smashing Pumpkins song, then you know this idea is completely wrong. I'll wait for a true Tribute album to come out for Smashing Pumpkins.

Today- What is that, Polka? And Rhinocerus-Huh?Some of the songs were ruined by the people singing. Bullet With Butterfly Wings and 1971 could have been okay but then the droning starts.

The plane also has a high stall speed, which isnt to good comparing speed is what you need to climb.

Home to glue it back together and recharge battery. Next day it \\"flew\\" for about 20 seconds before nose diving again and doing more damage to the nose and knocking the wing off again. Back home to reglue and recharge.

I originally picked up the original powder blue/white version of the album, but that got jacked so i can't rock the original style anymore. This is hip hop. No matter what everyone says, this is the album to get. Deep End was Sic, slightly more rebuffed, MiC had moments of mainstream, and, unfortunately, Heavy, the newest one is straying even more from the path into the overworld. This album, however, has got strait up some of the tightest production and rapping ever. Prev 1 is one of the best MC's I've heard in awhile. Pair that with Madchilds writing converted to rap and you've got yourself a a disc you will not bring out of your player.

The midtempo \\"Here We Go Again\\" is one of my favorite songs from the 3+3 era, with Ronald Isley's calm voice melding well with the song's polished production.The rest of the album has the familiar silky-guitar-laden funk, but with a smoother, more danceable arrangement. Ronald Isley's vocals are more restrained and Ernie Isley has only one guitar solo, on the mellow \\"Say You Will.\\" \\"Say You Will\\" and the dance-oriented \\"Pass It On\\" are the other highlights on an album that was a good rebound from the (IMO) disappointing \\"Winner Takes All.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"go all the way","review":"the boys were running out steam on this track not some of their best work,but if you are atrue fan buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS the \\"REAL DEAL\\"","review":"I have been searching for this album on CD for years and up until now all that's been available is the cassette version.

This one is not very heavy, folds into a carry sack and stores on a closet shelf. It inflates quickly, deflates easily and holds air. Any vinyl mattress will lose some air due to the nature of vinyl, but this one holds up through the night and requires less than a minute to add a little air before bed the next night.

I have owned other air mattresses in the past, low profile instead of the high profile of these two.

It's a shame, really, because it was extremely (and surprizingly) comfortable.I tried to get a replacement, thinking I may have just got a defective item, and I see now that the item is under review.

But things went worse, until last week, it automatically deflated when I heard \\"bang\\", I was so scared,i could not figure it out what was wrong with it.

However, on the second use, the top compartment (it has two), deflated within about 15 minutes of inflating the mattress...without anyone even lying on it! I took this as the product having some fault, so I returned it to amazon and had a replacement sent. Mattress #2 acted the EXACT same way. First sleep was a comfortable success. Second sleep...well there was no second sleep because it partially deflated before it could be used. Unfortunately, considering an air mattress is not an item that is used all that often, my return policy has run out, so I'm stuck with an unusable product. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intex Queen air bed with built-in pump","review":"I have purchased two of these air beds and with both of them the pump began losing air after just a couple of uses. The first one fell within the 90 day amazon return policy and the second one went unused for about 6 months.

He's a 230 lb. guy and this air bed fared well. Very little loss of air if any. The built in air pump was a clever thought. I've had a lot of air beds in the past and I can't find their pumps or the cord to their pumps. I won't have a problem with losing the pump for this air bed.follow-up review:Purchased 4/13 and today on 6/3 one of the ridges burst. so I now have a giant hump in the middle of the bed. still inflated but it's now uneven as the seams of one of the ridges just burst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 3 months","review":"This bed only lasted nearly 3 months. It blowout internally and it shows a big cylinder from top to bottom of the bed. It has no holes. Now, I can only send it to trash. I contacted Intex and they said they do not provide warranties for this product. However, they said they are very proud of their products on their website. Looks like they do a kind of misleading advertisement. How can they be so proud of their products if they can not have warranties for them (at least not for air beds like this one). I wish Amazon and companies like Amazon could stop selling products like this that came from China and are so bad that I felt like they are stealing my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted Chambers","review":"I bought this bed to use for one month while I save up money for a new bed set. After about a week one of the chambers burst while I was at work. I came home and saw a bubble under the covers of the bed. I left for a weekend trip and when I came back 2 more chambers were busted and I decided to return it. It was not over inflated and I still cant for the life of me figure out how or why the chambers would burst when I was not even sleeping on it. This time, I'll buy another bed from a place that I can return it locally since every review for the air beds seems to have a lot of different kind of complaints. Bottom line: if you want a raised air mattress you might have to be ready for it to not work after only a few uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder the other ones are so much more expensive","review":"At first this airbed seemed great. It was comfortable for about a month but then the baffles on one side came undone and it's too lopsided to use. It might make a college room sofa since one side is SO much higher than the other, but since it's a guest room bed and can't be slept in, it's going in the garbage. It doesn't appear that Intex or Amazon stand behind this product after 30 days of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"We've only used this once so far, as it's meant to be a spare bed for when we have too many guests stay over.

I used it for my friend that stayed with us for a few weeks. It fills up within seconds and she said it's very comfortable.You have to add a little air to it every few days, but I think that's to be expected with any air mattress. Standard Queen sheets fit perfectly on it, and it's pleanty high off the ground.My only complaint is that it's soooo difficult to get the air out of it so you can fold it up. I'm sure that's how all air mattresses are, but it wasn't fun reguardless.I would definitely recommend this to someone needing one and wanting to save money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good bed for the price","review":"Have only used this bed a couple of times.

It was very comfortable, fast to inflate. But with time I noticed that material of the bad gets stretchy. Mostly on the sides. After that I decided to return it (and Amazon kindly accepted it coz I didn't have any guaranty from the manufacturer in the box). But I decided to keep it since I didn't have time to ship it back. And few days ago when I came from work I found that the bed got the big hole underneath. Seems like the reinforcing rig just pulled the surface material so strong so the material broke.

You need the built in pump because the bed loses air and you need to add air to the bed at least once per night. I have been sleeping on this airbed for 2 weeks; I have a neck ache and a back ache. My short sofa sleeps better than this bed...I guess you get what you pay for. I thought the price was too good to be true and it is!

When I contacted the company they refused any help and said \\"go through the store\\", which, in this case, was Amazon.

But, after only two really gentle uses, two of the chamber seams gave out (the pillow seam and one side seam).

You'd be better off folding up a comforter and saving your money for a real bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this product mainly motivated by the price of the product. As I should have expected, previous reviews were correct in that this mattress does not last at all. I looked for a leak and while the plastic was fine it was actually the motor which was letting air out in the night. This perfectly encompasses the inferior quality of the mattress as its not even tearing plastic that's typically an expected issue but a fault in design from the very foundations of the product. I don't really have another product to suggest, just don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"first nite losing air","review":"already losing air after sleeping on it 2 hrs. inflated it again, will try i more nite. think i will return. will update review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks.

Went on vacation the 1st week of August and the 1st night it was slept on it did not make it through the night. The poor girls woke up on the floor every morning. When I got home I checked my return options and found out that my return window expired on July 20, 2012. My husband checked the air mattress and found that it is leaking around the built in pump.

Otherwise, the product was great. It is super comfortable, especially with a mattress topper.Hope that helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"Every air mattress I have bought over the last few years has started losing air almost immediately. We only use them when people visit, so only 1 or 2 times a month. I bought this a few months ago, and so far it still holds air like a champ. The built-in pump is easy to use and works well. The double-height is comfortable and feels less like you are sleeping on the floor.The one drawback is that there aren't any clips to hold the sheets and the indent between layers isn't really enough to grip a fitted sheet. But the felt top grips sheets fairly well, so we just use a flat sheet and it doesn't come off in the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyday use","review":"I purchased this in January 2010 to use as an everyday replacement for my old bed.

It's not unusable.I bought it because it was a great price for a queen with free shipping on Amazon prime. That was a mistake.

I wasn't lucky.Hoping for some good tips and examples, I got beginner level of samples that kids even would be bored with.BTW Played not very precisely as somebody would expected.Also not a one even complete song was presented.You won't learn anything from that DVD unless you are in kinder garden.If you want to learn something buy great Dr. John instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video is a waste of time","review":"With all due respect Mitch is a quality player but this video does not showcase that in the least. In fact, the video is a complete waste of time. 99% of the information on here is for complete beginners. There is very little insight in to what makes this style. Most of the information is common knowledge for anybody that's even remotely attempted to play blues. I didn't need a 10 minute conversation in the middle of (60 minutes video) on how a blues progression works. I would imagine if someone is attempting to play boogie woogie they already know how 12 bars blues is constructed.Here is the worst part for me. I bought this video off of Mitch's site for $35 (with shipping and handling). It's about $20 cheaper on Amazon. I was ripped off. I'm hoping I can prevent others from the same. Skip this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"chatty, disappointing","review":"For heart and soul learning to play boogie woogie this DVD has too much commentary that isn't helpful in this directiion. Mr. Woods comes across with an air of quiet, self satisfied arrogance that is off putting - plus a reluctance to his revealing his boogie woogie expertise. A student wants to feel the teacher is enthusiastic about his learning the subject. That feeling isn't here.To be fair, Woods does carefully demonstrate a number of left and right hand patterns. And there is a booklet of sheet music enclosed. However, from this reviewer's experience, some of the how-to-teach-yourself blues/boogie woogie books WITH A CD are a better value and more fruitful for the learner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I had high hopes for this DVD, being both a fan of Mr. Woods' CDs and an intermediate-advanced pianist.Unfortunately, this DVD is very basic and introductory- it's for beginners only.Mr. Woods doesn't share any of his signature right-hand licks, and so, anyone with even a basic knowledge of boogie-woogie is unlikely to learn anything new.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Lesson!","review":"I can't believe all you the people rate this piano lesson so low. I think it's fantastic. Mr. Woods gives you a demonstration of many different styles then you use the booklet to learn to play that style. Honesty, it's the best $15 lesson I ever had and I use it over and over. If you want to learn boogie, this will get you going; and if you are gonig to get good at it, you will spent a lot of time playing! I always buy on Amazon and never rate, but because of the other ratings for this item, I didn't want someone who really wants to learn the boogie and who will spend the time on playing each lesson in the book and watch it on the DVD, to overlook what this man has to offer! There really is something good here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Lawd have mercy!","review":"Mariah has completely lost it! What happened to her signature pop gems?

I thought \\"Heartbreaker\\" was bad but this takes the cake. I'm sure her reason for doing this to appear more \\"black\\" like the other awful rap artists that she strives to be like. Rumor is now that she is resorting to surgery similar to Michael Jackson, except she wants darker skin instead of lighter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Song of her Career","review":"This song is simply terrible. I can see why it is bombing on the charts because it has no melody or any other redeeming value. Since she is not being guided by her ex-husband at her old record label, the quality of her work has sunk to an all time low. Now we know who was really pulling the strings all along....What a dud...This song justifies a 0 star ranking being added to the rating selector!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You are a disgrace to woman!","review":"You are nothing but a no talent ho.

Horrible! Horrible! I don't find an other word to describe this song. I always thought Mariah was a bluff (she sings the same song since 1990!), but now, without Mr. Mottola beside her, is the game over? I hope so. I love talented singers, and Mariah is not one of them. I rated this song with 1 star just because I couldn't rate it with O!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"What a waste of time. Mariah Carey needs to look inside and find something-anything at all. This has got to be the worst song of the year. It is a crime. Not only only does this song cement Mariah's unreal ability to release the same song over and over again, it pushes her farther and farther away from any respectablity. The song is tired and weak. Mariah \\"sings\\" in that sing songy tramp voice she seems to love so much. The music is nothing new(or even good), and Da Brat doesn't do it for Ms. Carey. Unfortunely as time progresses Mariah's talent decreases. What once was a truimphant talent is now a nothing but a waste of air space."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest sell-out joke in history","review":"I heard this song recently and my God I felt so insulted by this tripe of a song. It's so sad that the her hip-hop-rap direction has been dragging her down ever since the Butterfly album which was amixed bag for me. But God this song is so idiotic. It sounds like some juvenile noise that some 8 year old could easily surpass in artistic quality. Mariah sold out big time. I can't believe that this tasteless, embarrassing garbage song came from the same woman who did Dream Lover, Hero, Someday, and Vision Of Love. It's really sad that her hip-hop direction has ruined her sound completely because she has a great voice and deserves to sing real music. She might be proud of such mature, sappy songs like Vision of Love, Love Takes Time, Can't Let Go, and Dream Lover but will she be proud of such juvenile, childish songs like Sweetheart, and Heartbreaker?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I'm a fan and was eagerly awaiting Mariah's new project. Unfortunately, the first single \\"Loverboy\\" is hands-down the worst song I have heard in ages.

Hopefully, this is not representative of the remainder of the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"scraping the bottom of the barrel","review":"[....] Anyway, this non-song indicates that Mariah's lost it completely.

It's not my kind of music. All I knew about her was that she was another female singer with a great voice singing pop tunes, in the same vein as Celine Dion, Houston, etc, etc. One day before, I was changing the channels and by chance I stopped on MTV. It was showing the clip of the song LOVERBOY, by Mariah Carey. I could believe what I was hearing. I thin maybe it is the worst \\"pop\\" music I ever heard in my entire life. Everything bad taste. And, as for Mariah, she doesn't even sing, she just screams and wails and put short clothes. There's not even a coeherent line in the entire \\"lyrics\\"...!!! What is this?

Buy only this CD single because the all album is only bad hip-hop with no melody. Why should I buy Glitter -even if I'm a Mariah fan- if this work deserve one star? Save your money and BUY JESSICA SIMPSON album *Irresistible* if you want to hear a GREAT VOICE and good songs. I think most of Mariah fans will be very disappointed for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taste Of The 80's","review":"From what I understand, Mariah wanted this song to sound fresh from the 1980's, and she succeeded in doing that. I would say that \\"Loverboy\\" is one of the best dance tracks I've heard from Mariah in a while, but the only problem is, while it is great and all, it isn't too original. In my point of view this song sort of sounds like \\"Honey\\" without all the hip-hop elements. But aside from all of that, this song features Mariah's shining vocals as always hitting those high notes near the end. Pick this single up today, and don't listen to what the critics have to say, because they are so wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's return effort","review":"While I must admit as a long time Mariah Carey fan, Loverboy is not her best song ever but it is a fun and funky track. Mariah is getting a lot of backlash from the public on her racier videos and new image, but fact is she has always been this way and it is so sad to see people turn on someone with such talent. If you liked Heartbreaker you'll love Loverboy, I recommend you buy the single. Worse comes to worse, you don't like it it's only like 3 bucks, in my opinion, the song rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it...","review":"I'm shocked, I'm stunned... I just listened to this thing called \\"Loverboy\\", by Mariah... Then I watched the clip... Then I saw some people reviewed this five stars.... That was too much for me. Mariah, you beat me. If you release garbage like this and keeps on selling millions, then you must be a real \\"musical\\" genius and I am the one who is dumb..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great single!","review":"This is a great lead off single from Mariah. It's real catchy and I love the remix. DaBrat and 22's parts are my favorite. The song is cute her voice is great! I couldn't ask for anything more. In fact I haven't loved a Mariah lead off single this much since \\"Dreamlover\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah's gone off the deep end","review":"This single is proof of how far Mariah has fallen: Sampling, using rappers, oohing and ahhing with unintelligible lyrics to boot. And throw in a video that is a disgrace to someone who is capable of so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad music from Mariah","review":"I only give this song 1 star because it is a poor song. Mariah used to be so good. Her music gets worse and worse with each new release. You can't even understand what she is saying and it's so overproduced. The remix isn't much better either. [....] Ah well, it'll make a good coaster. Don't waste your money unless you're looking for a cheap set of coasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All That, Lovergal","review":"It is hard to believe it, when an artist does try to make themselves into another kind of sound, it doesn't really have a feeling all the way anyway. That was the case with Mariah Carey. She began to stretch herself out with a Hip Hop style in the late 90's, and experimented her way to the top. Unfortunately, it wasn't in this song. Loverboy, the first of only two singles from her movie, Glitter, really isn't as strong or as upbeat as any of her earlier songs, when she was a down to Earth diva. The song also includes Cameo as a guest appearance, which really wasn't the right mix from the Funk band of their day. Anyway, Mariah did improve with Through The Rain, but not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Credit to The Cars?","review":"It is suprising that no credit for the cover concept is given to The Cars album \\"Candy-o\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The Hell???","review":"I've liked Mariah Carey since 1995 when she came out with Fantasy and those hits. So when I heard that Glitter will be based on music of the 1980's, I was real excited since I love 80's beats and Mariah's voice, but Loverboy was a disappointment. Cameo's Candy(the sample in the song) is a great song, but it didn't go well with Loverboy's melody. Instead it sounded like a musical mush of Dreamlover, Fantasy, Honey and Heartbreaker thrown over a beat. Mariah, I love you, but this is not your best work. I'm still looking forward to seeing Glitter the movie, but I doubt that I'll be updating my Mariah CD collection this year. Hopefully hearing the other music will change my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sample queen reigns supreme!","review":"More PopSoul from the diva of PopSoul. Another \\"hit\\" single featuring yet another sample from a proven hit. Well I guess if you can't make good music, sample it from someone who can. This time the victim is \\"Candy\\" by Cameo. \\"Candy\\" is a true classic and Mariah jumps on Cameo's back to the top of the charts just like she did with \\"Genius of Love\\" and \\"Hey DJ.\\" Blame Puff Diddy? Naw, place the blame on the sample queen supreme herself, Mariah Scarey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Familiar","review":"i really like this song but i agree with people who say she's going downhill because its more of wearing the tiniest pieces of clothing she can find, getting trillions of rap artists to feature in each of her songs and making her image that of a tacky pop star then actually getting some serious diva style singing done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah does it again! Another great hit!","review":"This song has all the right things: a sample of the funky 80's Cameo track, \\"Candy\\", Mariah's vocals, Cameo's added touch, and a wonderful remix featuring Da Brat, Ludacris, 22, and Shawna. This has all the right makings for a great song, and believe me, it is!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My Goodness!!!!","review":"This song belongs to the birds. I have never heard such horrible crap in my life. And it's really sad because Mariah has so much to prove and the only thing she has proven is her ex-husband is the reason for her success. Now the rumor is her new label Virgin Records is firing the people who brought her to the label. They also want to get rid of her because they don't think she's worth $20 million an album. And now, she wants people to believe that her ex-husband is the reason for her declining career. I don't buy that, she's doing that job well by herself. PS. Avoid the album at all cost!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah + Music + Talent = AWESOME!!!!","review":"Mariah Carey has been the \\"Diva of the Decade\\" and I think that she is still living up to that!

This song has a great tune and it will be number one on the music charts!!

I dont hate her I think some of her songs are good but I just cant belive that she would release this especially as a fisrt single. as for the video i dont understand why she must dress up like some [...] no name singer who needs to expose herself to get publicity. It seems that she is not respecting herself or her fans.(especially that pink swimsuit outfit) Hopefully the upcoming songs will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continues Mariah's Downward Spiral","review":"The Mariah obsessed fans really need to look at this song more objectively. I agree with the others that this song in no way is melodic or catchy. It is just a bunch of sounds and Mariah's cooing and ahhing, etc. If her intent was to completely shed herself of her pop past, then she has succeeded. She continues to aspire to her supposed \\"hip-hop\\" leanings by using guest rappers, etc. She really should leave the hip hop to the real artists. After Daydream, it seems like each succeeding album is getting worse and worse. Or maybe, it is after she left her sugardaddy Tommy Mottola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming pile of crap!","review":"I am very disappointed in this pile of crap. It may be harsh but it's true. With loverboy Mariah proves that without a doubt this is a contender for the worst single release by a big popstar in years. What is she even singing? Now I am a fan of the old Mariah, but this is just unlistenable. What idiot decided this should get released? Surely there has to be a better song on the Glitter album than this. She is killing her already rapidly eroding career, and her fanbase is dwindling down into the hundreds stateside - her career abroad has pretty much been dead since Butterfly.This is just downright embarrassing. I can honestly say that when I hear the song or see its video I turn red, and it isn't because she has little clothing on - I am truly embarrassed for her. I think it's safe to say that Mariah's successful career has come to a screeching hault. Mariah has really proven to be the epitome of the dumb blonde persona."},{"rating":"1","title":"scraping the bottom of the barrel","review":"Oh, why isn't it possible to give zero stars? Mariah's descent started a couple of albums ago and has surely now reached its nadir. And that's without the trailer trash video in which our Mariah proves once and for all that she aspires to be Samantha Fox. Back to the song - what song?

I've heard this album on LP, and sad to say, the LP sounded better.

What was the quickest way of getting some cash? Doing an album of Kristofferson songs. It sounds like he knocked this albuim off in about 40 minutes.

Not only does it evoke a sense of mystery in life and the sacred in late antiquity, but it turns an utterly bizarre plot into something totally believable. The result is a profound and inspiring meditation on life. I felt wonder, repulsion, and a desire to learn more - there is nothing more that a reader could hope for in an historical novel.The plot revolves around a banished sybil, who has lived in seclusion for so many years with her retarded son that she has become a legend in the towns nearby. An ordinary man condemned to immortality seeks her out, and they recount to eachother their life stories. The reader feels what it was like to live then, how religious beliefs shaped their lives and world view, and how in that seminal era the gods may indeed have erred.

At first listen, this record seems pleasant enough - crystalline production, good musicianship. After a few more listens it becomes clear that these songs are nothing more than lyrically weak ditties cribbed from the portfolio of Paul Simon circa Graceland. The Actual Tigers see themselves as an \\"Indie Band\\" - listen to this record and you will see what a laughable, ridiculous notion this is. They have more in common with Air Supply that Sparklehorse or the Flaming Lips. Disappointing and boring.

I enjoyed Stand Up, it features several Tull classic songs which have been reviewed very well by others here on Amazon. Stand Up is what many consider the first true Tull sounding album and is much better than \\"This Was\\". But I still found myself distracted by Ian's \\"blues\\" voice on several songs. It just doesn't have that Tull quality, which I guess didn't come about full-time until Benefit. \\"Fat Man\\" is a little acoustic number and Martin Barre's guitar work is great, the song really showcases Ian Anderson's sense of humor. \\"Fat Man\\" stands out on Stand Up, simply because it so different from all of the other songs. I would really enjoy seeing Tull do this song live. If you too like \\"Fat Man\\" give Catfish Rising's \\"Roll Yer Own\\" a listen. Both are quirky and fun and lift the overall feel of their respective albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Real Tull Album.","review":"Jethro Tull's first album \\"This Was\\" never sounded like a Jethro Tull album to my ears. \\"Stand Up\\" was the first Jethro Tull album I heard, and I loved it from the very beginning. Some many great melodic tunes, and a new exciting was of playing the flute. The classical based \\"Bouree\\" was a clear favourite in the beginning, but soon the other songs grew on me.Their blues inspitation shines through on many songs like the great opener, \\"A New Day Yesterday\\" and \\"For a Thousand Mothers\\"There are quiet thoughtful songs like \\"Look Into the Sun\\" and \\"Reasons For Waiting\\"; acoustic tunes; \\"Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square\\"\\"Nothing is Easy\\" shows them at their most rocking.\\"We Used to Know\\" is one of the great highlights - beautiful melody.Of the 4 bonus tracks, \\"Living in the Past\\" is a great song \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is also good.My favourites are: \\"We Used to Know\\" \\"A New Day Yesterday\\", \\"Back to the Family\\", \\"Look into the Sun\\", \\"Bouree\\" and \\"Living in the Past\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"after autumn","review":"For those of us who began with Stand Up, it is difficult to place the later cds in context.

So, in a way, this is a transitional album, but it is also the first album in which Ian Anderson is given all songwriting credits, as with every album there after. Blending blues with light folk elements, it's the original Jethro Tull album. This album and \\"Benefit\\" are equal to more well known albums like \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Thick As A Brick.\\" \\"Stand Up\\" features \\"Fat Man\\" with a mandolin churning inside a tribal rhythm, \\"Reasons For Waiting\\" with full company orchestration, and \\"Bouree\\", a jazzy coffee house instrumental with some of Ian Anderson's finest flute playing, clearly marking a departure from their blues roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluesy advance of times to come","review":"This one is the real forewarning of what Jethro Tull was going to become: some blues in the hard-rocking manner of the day (A new day yesterday), some flute hardly contained (Bouree), and a lot of clever melodies with nice wordplay.

Many of the assumptions made about Freemasonry are unfounded or make such huge leaps that it is difficult to accept. Many of the attempts at using scripture to back up specific claims were pulled out of context, misinterpreted, or twisted and forced into a conversation. If Freemasonry was so anti-Christian, the claims and evidence should fall into place. The evidence does not do this because modern-day Freemasonry is indeed NOT anti-Christian.I enjoy reading books that challenge my way of thinking because one of two things will occur. Either I will find a flaw in my ways and see light that wasn't available before or I will further realize that I'm on target.

A thought-provoking and re-energising read, without overt self-disclosure, false pretensions or weak, misguided self-illusions. Moore skillfully weaves his own special web of spiritual significance that stretches beyond our culture itself: by going straight to the centre of all human experience. An intellectually modest, yet soulfully rigorous book that is still highly capable of having literary and philosophical relevance to even the simplest of considerations. It's also a great interpretation of much of our long-forgotten human thought and endeavours from our past, present and the future, as well as allows you to realistically think about your own, unique cherished experiences yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for cleaning the house","review":"I got the audio book and it's great to listen to while cleaning and reorganizing the house.

So for the last year or so I've been playing around with AppleScript, mainly copying the scripts I found from different sources, but along the way I'm slowly beginning to understand how to put together scripts almost from scratch. This book has been very resourceful because it has the familiar Missing Manual style of breaking the essential features of a program so that almost anyone can understand.

This book doesn't really touch on too many of the 'hard' issues one would face when first getting started with applescript. The languages syntax, for example, is not as intuitive as its description suggests. Its english like, but its not english, and english takes a decade or so to master.The book says little about the language, and a disproportionately large part of it is just a series of example scripts categorized by the programs being scripted.This book is more like the answers to the test than the course that would prepare you for the test. I learned close to nothing from it.Im sure it has its place, but as someone pretty familiar with programming, I find that practical examples _aswell as_ some deeper, language directed discussion is nessesary to get anything other than a weak grasp on any language. Especially a language as slippery as applescript. But I guess I got what I paid for... its a pretty cheap book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for beginners, not for programmers.","review":"This book is very basic and doesn't really get into any depth. Rather than teaching the fundamentals of AppleScript, it's more of a guided tour to what you can accomplish with AppleScript in various common applications. For the average computer user, this may be helpful, but if you're a programmer and want to learn how to write your own scripts, other resources would be a better bet.I also wasn't impressed with the writing style or organization - while I *am* impressed that a high school student could write a book like this, for most technically inclined people, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK as an introduction but lacks depth","review":"\\"Applescript - the missing manual\\" is OK as an introduction to the basics of Applescript - it explains how to edit & run a script, gives a feel for what applescript looks like and what its capable of, and describes some useful tools - but I was disappointed by its coverage of the heart of the subject: the syntax of the language. To learn how to do anything even slightly beyond the examples given in the book (which are mostly rather trite) I had to go to the Applescript Language Guide, on the Apple developers site. This actually explains the language, though its way out of date and pretty heavy going.Overall, an OK book to get started but you'll need something more detailed to really use applescript. If you already know how to program, I'd recommend looking for something a bit more technical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing collectable, great read","review":"Got this after a desire to collect the 9-11 comics as my ending run in comic collecting, and I must say I am impressed with not only the size of it, but the consitent and diverse work inside. Loads of unfamiliar work that perhaps wouldn't be seen on such a public level with such quality, and at 200 pages for the price its at, its damn good.The stories themselves? Some make you think. Some make you wonder. All make you remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt Tales of September 11th and it's Aftermath","review":"There's really not much I can say about this book. The stories contained in it are poignant and touching and heartbreaking and hopeful all at once, and each and every contributor has given not only their time and talent to the project, but clearly they've also given a piece of their hearts. Being born and raised in New York City, the events of September 11th are especially painful to me, but I came away from reading this book feeling just a little more hopeful than I did when I started it. Kudos to all involved for a magnificent effort. (And all of the money goes to a good cause, too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A gimmick","review":"I tried the Hyaluronic Serugel and I feel like it's a gimmick. All it does is tighten the skin - like you have a clear, thin mask on. Maybe that's how you get an anti-wrinkle affect, like a botox shot that prevents you from moving your face. If you're looking for a moisturizer that makes your skin feel plump and healthy, this product won't do the trick.

She takes a large dose of lemons in life and turns it all in to lemonade. We have watched it 3 times so far, sharing it with friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharper than a serpent's tooth","review":"I could watch only about two-thirds of this one-woman show on DVD before quitting, and even that was terribly painful. It's awful and embarrassing to see, as she insults her father and mother (and most other family members and friends) continuously and with a foul and vile mouth. She whines constantly, even while assuring the viewer she is not whining, and her reflections on life are about as insightful as a comic strip. I suppose it's not her fault that she looks like an overweight little troll, but that too makes watching it even more distressing. Humor? Only if you would laugh at an old person slipping on a banana peel and taking a painful spill could you possibly find Carrie witty or funny. An awful DVD, to be watched only by those who enjoy investigating a truly dysfunctional personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs DOWN","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews this thing got after seeing it.

It is written in a terribly confused and jumbled way and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst KBLH book yet written","review":"If you can ignore the first thirty pages, which are really nothing much more than the author's rant against magical lodges, religious practitioners of KBLH (by any type) and the occult, there's actually some fairly decent material hidden away between the ravings.Unfortunately, its not much.Sam Weiser - we expect better from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Good Book!","review":"Peter Shandy, a botanical expert, is on a mission in Pickwance, to discover a mystery about some lupines that are growing in an area where they usually do not. All goes well until one night when a local man, Jasper Flodge, dies while eating his dinner at the same Inn Peter is staying at. Over the course of a few days the restaurant is a busy place; full of new characters discovering the past of Jasper; trying to unravel the mystery of his untimely demise. It takes another murder and a great deal of gossip before Peter and his wife, whom he called to come help solve this mystery, to settle the case. This book is one that is full of suspense and thrills. There are many mini-plots that run through it to tie the entire novel into a unimaginable conclusion. This is a must read; one of Charlotte's pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I have ever read","review":"The other reviews were obviously written by the author or his mother.

Logitech has no future plans for a win7/win8 driver so again stay away.

A movie like Titanic is a lot of work and if you watch it in the cinema you don't immediately realize that. But when you read this book,you caqn almost feel the effort people made on the set. The book is also illustrated with beautiful pictures from the movie. There is just one word for this book: GREAT!

I think this book fits that bill very nicely. It also serves as a good, general picture book for those who are unfamiliar with the difficulties of making a high budget film. This is, however, not a technical book, and is purely geared for a mass audience. To expect anything more is silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what it seems.","review":"I skimmed through the list of people who wrote about this book, and all but maybe 3 people gave it 10. Truth is...it only gets 10 because Leonardo DiCrapio is in the movie. If it was some no-name loser, it probably wouldn't have been nominated for anything. The book itself is rather lame.

I had been fascinated with the whole story and information-crazy about it since 3rd grade when I first heard of it. I remember the whole class's eyes and ears were glued on the teacher.

I just purchased the \\"James Cameron's Titanic\\" after a long wait due to backorder. I have not had time to read it from cover to cover but have skimmed the pages. It is a wonderful photographical view of the movie. Included are lines from the movie (I think I have half the dialogue memorized from the movie after seeing it four times thus far), comments from the actors and the producers. The photographs couldn't be better. This movie truly deserves all the credit it has received and more. I fully believe that this is the movie of all time for many decades to come and many that have past. Every detail of it is exquisitely done!

I would recomend this book to anyone that is a fan of the movie, the actors and the director, and to everyone else, it is a wonderfull gift and a great memoar of one of the best film ever made. I would just like to add, I congradulate James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Wislet, the photographer and the writer of this book, and to everyone else that contibuted to the book and the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strings of the heart finally pulled to open pure compassion.","review":"This event of Rose and Jack allows people to explore the suffering that the people on the Titanic had to endure on that cold April morning. Many people may, perhaps, be uninformed about the devastation that happened on April 14, 1912. If that is yourself, go see the movie and then purchase this book.

Glad that the set now available in such affordable price.Regarding the contents, most of the titles listed here are good to start your collection on Ed Wood. My suggestion if you are new to Ed Wood, buy the DVD of Tim Burton's Ed Wood, then you will get the pictures and start admiring the bad movies of Ed Wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could ask for anything more?","review":"If you love bad films, if you love horror films, then this is the box set for you. I truly enjoyed watching all of these movies by Ed Wood, and was actually surprised at how good they were. This guy, say what you will about him, had a great imagination. He had a vision and nothing was going to keep him from making these movies. It's really quite inspiring. The nicest surprise was 'Glen or Glenda'. I expected to laugh a lot, which I did, but I didn't expect to be moved when I watched it. He really poured his soul out and exposed what it was like to be a transvestite. Ed Wood didn't hold anything back. Maybe that doesn't make for the most polished product in the end, but it makes for something that was truly unique. The Tim Burton film 'Ed Wood' is a perfect complement to this set. Oh, and if you love Bela Lugosi, then I think you'll find it quite the treat to see him in these wild roles! \\"Pull the strings!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Indie Films!","review":"As a young independent filmmaker, Ed Wood brought energy, enthusiasm, and, yes, talent to his work. I find it strange that some, while enjoying his movies - or even making money from them - will ridicule Wood, claiming he had no talent. Weird! My only complaint with the product was that the sound quality on the Jail Bait DVD was very poor (I had the laser disk and that sounded fine). By the way, there's a great scene in Jail Bait where a dead person is standing bolt upright and suddenly falls flat down: scary and funny at the same time, a typical Wood moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"There is no better example of our generation's morbid fascination with bad culture than a \\"Box Set\\" of the entire Ed Wood oeuvre. This is the ne plus ultra of kitsch, which, contra Susan Sontag, has no value whatsoever. It has only negative value. It subtracts from the beauty of the world. It is spiritually debilitating. Every moment spent in the presence of shoddy, inferior cultural products such as \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" makes one less discerning, less intelligent and less fit for life. One wonders how many American kids' lives were blighted by sitting around in dark suburban living rooms on rainy afternoons consuming such filth. Go to YouTube and find one of Wood's movies. Try to sit through even five minutes of any of them without feeling nauseous. Bleh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just not possible....","review":"to offer a better Ed Wood package at such an unbelievable price.It includes all the key films, in not pristine but quite nice prints, and with a really decent selection of extras.

Kind of makes you wonder why other box sets are so much more expensive, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not be fooled by these ratings","review":"Sure, there's a kick to be had out of making fun of Ed Wood and his films. But let's not go crazy and rate them as 5-star works of art. To rate these, even as a whole set, as anything but 1-star \\"films\\" is misleading.If you want to experience the pain of watching truly, TRULY awful movies by one of cinema's worst directors, pick this set up. If you're looking for good films to watch, this is not what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"Okay, getting the films (and nicely collected in a sleeve box) alone is great. But you want this for the documentaries. They really take you inside the area and time it was filmed. You get alot of inside talk about Ed Wood and the making of the films. Great interviews with the actors involved and what they were doing (at the time the documentaries were made). Good interviews with people that are no longer with us (Vampira, etc). Also, the best part I thought was the locations used in the documentaries. Ed's old apartments/office, the studio where PLAN 9 was shot, etc.The films are in the best quality as you are gonna get them. So if you want to be an Ed Wood completist, get this set.

Glen or Glenda was way before its time. I must say though it might have been a very good movie had it not been so long, with so much weird stock footage. Maybe someone could edit it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for movie lovers","review":"I found this one day at a Suncoast video and HAD to pick it up.Here are Ed Wood's greatest (by his standards) Masterpieces in one easy collection.I've only gotten through three of the movies so far, as I'm re-watching them all over and over and over again. Plenty of hidden features, documentaries, and other fun things. The haunted world of Ed Wood even include the original Laredo print, his first official directing debut.This is a wonderful gift for movie fans, people into cheesy or classic theater, or those who have newly discovered the man who was Ed Wood Jr.Now all we need is a nice big box collecting of his book released. And yes, Ed Wood did write books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"no captions or subtitles","review":"I bought this box set from Amazon.com. Despite the \\"Product Details\\" section stating that this DVD set is closed-captioned, there are no captions or subtitles. Other hearing-impaired viewers need to decide for themselves, before purchasing, how important or not this feature is.Having said that, I've so far watched \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" (missing bits of dialogue) and got quite a laugh out of it. This movie is a bungled execution of a rather bizzare story - aliens bringing Earth's dead back to life to prevent an even more scientifically implausible event in the distant future. Effeminate aliens, cheap special effects, continuity problems, cemetery grave stones made of cardboard, vampire characters in a movie that really isn't about vampires - the list goes on. And just how did Criswell (narrator who opens the movie) get his hair like that???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whispers that that demand attention...","review":"When I put on Patti Witten's cd Land of Souvenirs, I knew I was in for a wonderful listening experience. I knew I was in for a treat, because I've heard Patti's music before and her lyrics immediately drew me in. However I was not prepared to feel rooted to the spot where I was standing - struck still by the immediacy, the urgency of the first track \\"Whispers\\". From that moment I knew I wanted to hear the secrets that this track implied - the personal stories that would reveal themselves in the rest of the cd. I was not disappointed. \\"Walk A Mile\\" with it's Joni Mitchell like vocal, and \\"Land of Souvenirs\\" with it's great descriptions are just two of the tracks that I enjoyed instantly. You will too. Next listen will be \\"Prairie Doll.\\" Keep it up Patti!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough History of the Wall and its Pele Towers","review":"I convene a Border Clan tent at various Scottish Games throughout the year, and was pleased to find this book.While most works on Hadrian's Wall are mainly for hikers, this one paints a detailed history of the wall back to 30 A.D. I especially liked its thorough timeline explaining the influence of the Scoti, Picts, Romans, Saxons, et al. on the Border region.Also included are a nice assortment of b&w; photos and diagrams of Border castles and pele towers, although I was disappointed that the Dallycastle Pele tower in Hexham and other smaller ones were not mentioned.It's nice to skim through for the photos, and the writing style is a reasonably fast read as well.So it's a 'keeper', and should be found in the library of anyone who professes to know the shadowy history of the Scottish Borders and the Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"kill your cr*p compilation","review":"Don't go near this misleadingly titled (many of the tracks were *not* singles) sloppily put together (no Grey Cell Green?!) disc which was put out by S**y with zero input from the band.Instead, buy the excellent Ned-endorsedSome Furtive Years: A Ned's Anthologybest-of collection which was released this year (2007).

I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a quirky sense of humor and this book has some moments that made me smile and laugh out loud. Romance novels are a genre that can become bogged down in tired old plots and poorly constructed writing -- the good ones are those that can rise above the norm to provide the reader with a feeling of enjoyment and having been entertained. This book definitely succeeds at that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful story","review":"A fun and entertaining read.

One so strong nothing could break their love and devotion to each other and the honor they held for past loved ones, another that had shattered through the corse of time and left them grasping onto memories and dignity that had worn and faded away through mistakes and loses, and the binds that brought them together. This book is a classic love story and reminds people of the value of family and the simple things in life. This story shows that there are still people in the world who care enough to defend others and to hold on to faith and hope, because when that's lost, there is no more reason for living.

Needless to say I was excited to start reading this book. Well I kept reading and reading.....saying to myself \\"It will get better\\"! I read all the way to page 133 and said enough is enough!

It's OK if you are just starting out in life and have the luxury of buying things that naturally go together. In that case, the premise that you can cut clutter by displaying your possessions (because they're all the same color) works. Unfortunately, most of us own and love a variety of objects, such as gifts and family heirlooms, and those things don't always go together naturally. So, Ithink the authors cheated a bit, making it easy on themselves by showing us how to group those things that do, of course, go together. The book seems to be more a statement of a certain style (white, white, white) instead of delivering what it promises in terms of storage help."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Place for Everything","review":"Taking tips from Julie Morgenstein I recently completely decluttered my life.

I was hoping for a book with pictures of before and afters, of cleaning supplies, cosmetics, etc. stored several different ways (wicker, plastic, boxes, on the door, under the sink, etc.), and tips on where to buy the storage supplies. 'A Place for Everything,' unfortunately, seems to be just a photo journey through one victorian home which I thought looked quite cluttered! The moral seemed to be if it is antiquey looking, by all means leave it out, because that is art, not clutter. I agree with the other reviewer who said \\"save your money\\" and use it to buy organizational supplies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really helpful","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is a big, big disappointment.The pretty picturers don't reflect the real stuff that most of us live with and must organize.

The photographs are very well done and the book would be a pleasure for anyone to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is neither practical nor helpful. The authors made it easy on themselves by focusing on ideal circumstances from the start.For instance, they show a lot of \\"organizing\\" of all-white stuff, and their idea of \\"organizing\\" is simply stacking and displaying. It's easy to do that if everything you have is white. There also is the ridiculous situation of the big walk-in closet which they \\"make over\\" by adding a table and other stuff. If you have a big closet like that in the first place, you don't need much help. And who has a closet big enough for a table? If you live in the real world with regular closets and ordinary (anything but all-white!) stuff, you will not find any help here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic idea book","review":"This is a good idea book.

Bought 30 bags. The CDM was not good, with an extremely bitter taste. Well now I'm in Dallas with 29 bags of coffee I don't like. What to do? I decided to \\"water it down\\" a bit by mixing one bag of the CDM with an equal amount of Folgers. That didn't work either as the bitterness still came though.

What happens is that any root obstruction larger than about 1/8\\" causes the edging to give way rather than cut off the root, as one might expect. Turns out you have to dig a trench 2 to 4 inches deep, cutting off all roots and removing stones. You also end up with a zig-zag line, because the sections don't lock together well, even those with unbroken tabs. Ten feet of that and I gave up.

It got a little bit better but was in such an obvious spot that it still looked horrible after all that.The day after the spill I started googling and found Wine Away, so I decided to order it. It only took a couple of days to deliver, but obviously during this time the stain set itself into the carpet and I was thinking all hope was lost. Not the case!

There's lots of history, lots of character development, and we get to see more of the recurring characters we all know and love--Tesla, Druitt, Ravi--even Watson and Griffin make an appearance!

Fuzzy, out of focus, digital artifacts, and lacking in detail. Also, I guess it was the day after the party at the packing plant as every disc was scratched.

It's basically about a goup of kids (the Midnight Society) who meet out in the woods every Saturday night & tell scary stories. The cool thing is that there's a message behind each story.

This cake plate is quite delicate, so you will have to be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Glass","review":"Well, I'm not sure how I would rate the item because it arrived in pieces. The box had one flimsy piece of brown paper, otherwise no packing material--to ship a glass covered cake dish--was supposed to be two pieces, arrived in about two hundred. It's hard to fathom why someone would think packing a fragile piece this way would ever make it intact. Not sure I will order anything fragile through Amazon again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great cake plate","review":"This cake plate and dome cover look very nice, and the combo arrived intact with good packaging. However, there were two problems for me. One is that there are a few small bubbles in the glass, so it is not super high quality glassware. Two, and most important, is that the cake plate has a raised center where the cake plate meets the top of the stand; this makes the cake plate not level so that the sides of a cake may droop -- not high quality for a cake container. I've returned the product. For the price, looks were not enough to overcome the two problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"I registered for this cake dome as a wedding gift, and just received it. Buyer beware: it may say \\"designed\\" in Italy - but this cake dome is made in China. Had I known this, I would NOT have registered for/bought it. The description is incredibly misleading.In addition to this, and as is the case with most things mass-produced in China, the quality is no superb, certainly NOT worth the $50 price tag. It has several little flaws, some bubbles in the glass (I suppose the only indication it was \\"hand blown\\"?) but the worst aspect is that the rims are not finished. The rim on the bottom of the dome and the top of the stand are unfinished and therefore SHARP. For $50 I would imagine it should be smooth all around.It's still very pretty, but for me the bottom line is: if you're going to get something made in China and of inferior quality, save thirty bucks, and go for the $20 dome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi Bormioli Michelangelo Cake Plate/dome","review":"I ordered this product and when it showed up the Glass Cake Plate was shattered in a hundred pieces.This was mainly due to poor shipping without bubble wrap.

The UPS guy luckily let me open in front of him because he heard the broken glass when he picked it up. It's crazy that this just ships in the box without any sort of protective packaging. I reordered another one hoping for the best, but honestly don't see how it could arrive intact with the way they package it. Not sure if this is the manufacturer's fault or amazon's fault, but at the end of the day it's poorly packaged and not worth the risk if you need it in time for something. I'd suggest purchasing another one, or probably just finding one at your local shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"Very poor quality the glass is very thin and cracks easy for the money they are asking you can get much better then this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Put your hands here","review":"This is a great summer read for the beach.

All my references, ticket writer, extra cuffs, back up to my back up weapon..... there's room for it all and just about anything else I could even THINK to stick in there!! The adjustable strap fits around the back of the passenger seat and holds the whole bag in place and detaches easily for fast removal...... It even holds my drink and a stash of snacks!!

For the price I wasn't expecting it to be very durable. But I was wrong. It feels extremely tough and durable. It's also much larger then I was expecting as well. The top, once open, folds over the side and stays there which is nice because you can access the pockets and it wont move. Also, the zippers are large and very heavy duty. This is larger and feels better then my 5.11 bag for a fraction of the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected.","review":"This bag has a lot of compartments which is great. I wanted something to hold all my gear for work. Didn't like this bag at all. Actually sold it to a guy at work for 20.00 who liked it. Go buy a decent bag at your local store. Even a gym bag is better than this bag in my opinion. Was too stiff and narrow. Zippers were hard to utilize. Had to basically hold the bag down while zipping or unzipping.If you want something you wont need to get in and out of on a constant basis throughout the day then it is a great bag. If, like me, you needed a bag that was accessible whenever you needed it then I would look at getting a 5.11 tactical backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality bag!","review":"This bag is made of good quality material and the seams are stitched very well.

While they love Backyardigans and the characters in it, this chair is the hardest thing to get working. An adult literally needs to beat on the arm rests to get the unit to start playing music. It obviously is not very comfortable either as my twin girls prefer to try to beat the chair arms with a hard plastic toy while sitting on a stuffed animal and rarely sit in it even during the Backyardigans show. Unless you have a boy who may like to hit things very hard and loves this show, I don't recommend this chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tuck Genealogy book","review":"If you have ancestors in or related to the Robert Tuck family, this is the book for you!

While the Founders persuaded the minds and the souls mankind with lofty ideas of life and liberty, these lunatics want to cajole, threaten, and create victims. There is nothing original here.

Starting from the position of most adolescents, (the assumption of absolute moral and intellectual authority based upon little knowledge and no practical experience at having to actually make a life in the real world), Mr Alinsky goes into great detail how to organize a 60's style counterculture movement. Productive? No, not really. But perfectly reasonable to a rebellious adolescent dabbling at cultural revolution. After all, any real damage done will be to the working middle or lower class, and daddy will still be happy to bail you out if anything goes wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"Right or Left--this book is essential reading. As a young (conservative) political activist, I was required to read this book by my boss. I loved it! Alinski teaches how creative thinking and attacking your opponent's weak areas can magnify a small organization's impact. Some of his anecdotes are unforgettable!This is an easy read full of real-life demonsrtations. Think Sun Tzu goes in to activist politics. You may have to hold your nose at some of his politics, but you can still learn from this man.And, yes, I did enjoy beating the Left with their own tactics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for chaos and confusion","review":"Disturbing, but illuminating - like shining a flashlight into a garbage pail.

I love his sense of humor, his pragmatic situational ethics (which I presume President Obama learned from him), and his awareness that it is in one's self-interest to be your brother's keeper. The book is dated in some ways, but the general approach rings true. As he told his young colleagues who faced strong opposition in their attempts to get their country to live up to its democratic ideals: you can do one of three things: feel sorry for yourselves, start bombing (which will swing people more to the right), or you can organize."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Enemy Within","review":"If you want to beat someone bigger than you it is foolish to take them head on when you can easily win the war from the inside. This is clearly the way radicals can force change by assimilating into the status quo. If they fit right in you will not even detect their intentions to turn control into their favor. While I detest many of the radical ideas of wealth redistribution and \`government as caretaker' I have to admit they are using the tools available to make change while the rest of us sleep. To beat the enemy you must understand them. That is what the radicals do to be successful and the rest of us need to understand that or we wake up to a world that is foreign to us.

Don't get me wrong-I am conservative politically, but I recognize genius when I see it. Alinsky was a brilliant and ruthless tactician. As a book of strategy for social change, it can have no equal. He is honest about using dishonest & unfair tactics, manipulating people and the dirt nature of his game. He explains why it is OK-and makes a good case for it. The book was supremely readable. I finished half of it in one sitting (which is a real accomplishment for a dad w/ 2 young kids). His stories about particularly memorable tactics, both actual and planned were VERY funny. (Let's put it this way: You will NEVER go to an orchestral concert again without thinking of Saul Alinsky.)Unfortunately, it was interrupted by typical left-wing rants.

I use this book and the AP Stylebook as well for all my references. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernie P Moose","review":"Still the standard for editors and copy editors. The 15th edition is much more geared than previous editions for those working on a computer and doing research on the internet. However, do not throw away your copy of the 14th edition, for to make room for new material in the 15th edition much of the detailed advice on punctuation and and usage in the 14th edition has been omitted from the 15th edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"But where is the thing I want to know????","review":"I love reference books and I had an editing job that required me to have \\"15\\" so I had the perfect excuse to buy it. But what a difficult book to use. I checked a few relatively easy things, and one or two obscure things. If the answer wasn't where I logically expected it, the book directed me elsewhere, to an elsewhere so difficult to find that I wasted prescious time. It sure looks good, but...."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's all in the premise","review":"Any book which prescribes \\"style\\" for you, has proscribed the attainment of it.Get this book. Read it.

Maybe it was the post office - I don't know. I dried it out as much as possible.Not a good experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads remarkably well","review":"I expected a rather dry composition of rules. Instead, the examples are usually both somewhat lively and useful. In addition, on occassion the deep structure of our language peeks thru, providing insights into the way English compositors think. The utility of the tome is limited, however, by the exhaustive depth and breadth of the subject: finding a relavent rule for a particular topic can be confusing. There is definite lack of emphasis on the fluidity of language as a mode of communication. Finally, the book lacks a sppell checker."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE with Windows Vista!","review":"This is ridiculous! CMoS wrote in an e-mail today:\\"[...] The CMOS CD Rom is not compatible with Vista. We recommend that customers using Vista look at our online product [...]\\"Thus, the CMoS CD-ROM of the 15th edition is NOT COMPATIBLE with a system that has been on the market for more than three years now. Other publishers launched recommended patches for Vista as early as in 2006!I get the feeling that CMoS just wants to sell their overprized online version.

I would definately order here again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"I bought this book because my university relies on the Chicago Manual of Style's formatting for dissertations and such. It's a good reference for writing dissertations and papers. In areas where formatting is still somewhat not standardized (such as audio recordings, websites), this manual provides general guidelines of what information should be included. The section on electronic resource is quite applicable although more examples would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"CMS disk","review":"I have found it helpful. I work from two different places, depending on my assignment. I have the hard copy in one place and the CD-ROM in another.

Great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Sure You Buy the 14th Edition, First","review":"The info you want and need is in the 14th Edition -- stick with that one and you'll never go wrong. This is like the \\"new coke.\\" The 15th Edition seems to be an edition made different if only for the sake of being different (and, of course, to justify making money after a certain amount of years have passed since the 14th was published). I fear for the next generation if the 14th Edition were to become unavailable. I'm willing to bet the 16th Edition will very similar to the 14th, and only include the truly useful from the 15th (of which, I think, there is little)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Inaccessible","review":"Having primarily worked in academics with APA and MLA style I was recently forced to use the Chicago style for an essay. This book needs to be completely overhauled. The layout and format is completely inaccessible for first time users. The APA and MLA manuals are FAR easier to navigate than this one. There is a distinct lack of information regarding common problems. Only buy this if you must, and if you must, then plan on spending most of your time navigating the pages for things you won't find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important but confusing","review":"This book is necessary for understanding how to cite works using Chicago style, but it can be confusing and unclear.

Steinman had been responsible for Meat Loaf's \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" as producer and songwriter. On \\"Bad For Good\\" he sings/growls/screams/performs his own songs (many of which ended up on \\"Bat Out of Hell II\\"). Steinman's producing style is very distinct. For fans his style is unmistakeable. From Air Supply to Bonnie Tyler, he's helped them create some very memorable songs. On his own album, it's timeless. Although originally released in 1981, the entire album is listenable from beginning to end. Backed up with the talent of Todd Rungren and Ellen Foley, Steinman's \\"Bad For Good\\" is a welcomed addition to any CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Meatloaf ? - get over it!","review":"OK, I'll admit it. The first time I listened to the album I thought \\"boy if only Meatloaf did this\\". After about the third time through I was thinking \\"geez Jim sounds pretty damn good to me\\". Had Meatloaf done this album I think it would have been to much of a \\"Bat out of Hell\\" clone; Jim's vocals give the album a slightly different feel. I would have given this album five stars, but \\"Dance in my Pants\\" is awful - it tries to be \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" but sounds more like a cheezy 50's style show put on at a theme park.P.S. - I have heard Meatloaf versions of many of these songs and I consistantly prefer the tracks of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminder of a misspent youth!","review":"Loved and adored this album in '81 when it was released, still do today! Steinman a genius, all the tracks bring both tears of joy and sadness when I recall the happy days i spent listening to them.
