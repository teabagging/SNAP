The story, dialogue, acting, pace, background detail, direction, lighting, music, the lot, are virtually flawless in all three cases. Although Casablanca has more humour, it leaves you, like the other two, with a better understanding of the way life really is. Particularly if you have anything romantic in your soul. Romance is partly a desire for love and glory, but also a sense of loss. It's facing up to the loss that is character-forming. Maybe the subtlety of The Hustler is that the Piper Laurie character is shown as needing a dependent figure she can feel superior to. When Newman is himself crippled, she recovers from her booze addiction, and her flaw is that she doesn't in fact want him to be strong. In a way, this is an unresolved element in the plot. Perhaps Chinatown is the better and even more perfectly rounded film. But The Hustler is still a very great achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Classic","review":"Excellent writing and acting. A must have for any pool/billiard person. There is much to be gained by reading the book and watching the movie again. I normally prefer one or the other...in this case I keep going back and forth. One of the best B&W classics ever. You will find many subtle things in the book that pop out in the movie once you notice them. The DVD is much improved over the VHS. I wish they still made movies this rich with depth and drama without having to resort to visual effects/violence for entertainment value. This has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hustler-Great Movie.","review":"The movie is a timeless classic.

As you watch Fast Eddie develop, he goes from a good player and confident man to someone who has no respect for himself. He soon devlops the courage and strength to go on with a little help, but has he sold his soul to be the best?

Each song on the album is catchy and has a cool riff, and Newsted is a great addition on the bass. I must add that each song is in a different key, possibly in the style of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Thus, the album has great replay value, due to the non-tedious nature of the keys.I heart the Moss Bros, and sincerely hope they get back together soon. I wonder how Reuben is doing.

Secondly, the actual conjugation pages are almost impossible to read. The text is tiny and the size cannot be increased.

I for one don't want to thumb through page after page looking for them. Even worse there is an appendix that lists 2,100 other verbs that conjugate like those in the book; in the hardcopy each listing is followed by a page number, in the Kindle version there is no reference back to the text!

The 501 Verbs does not work on the Kindle. The pages with the conjugated verbs function like a picture on the Kindle, so you cannot increase the size of the type (and it is VERY tiny) and when you search for a verb it only gives you references that are in sentence use and not the page that the full verb conjugation in on. The Kindle may be good for reading a traditional book from front to back, but it is frustrating to use with reference materials. I returned the book, as I have it in paperback, and I may end up returning the kindle as it is not going to meet my needs.

Finally the tables for each verb are rendered as images with illegible minuscule characters and some characters missing on the left margin.Basically, I'm just repeating what all previous E-version reviewers have said.

I first experienced cake like alot of people with Prolonging the Magic, loved it and went and bought the previous cd's and loved them. Ive been a total cakehead ever since. I love the lyrics esp. pretty pink ribbon (brilliant and hillarious) you hear something new everytime, sometimes it makes you laugh sometimes it makes you cringe but it always makes you want to listen to it again. While it is full of the familiar cake trademarks like the rattle snake sound and the \\"oh yeahs\\" and \\"all rights\\" this cd was refreshingly new with a whiff of guitar influence from the cars on love you madly and a little more harmony in other places. LOVE IT!BUY IT FOR SURE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic is on vacation without a passport","review":"This album is two-dimensional compared to what came before it. Before, we had drifting lines that would be slightly behind or before the lead vocal, poetry from simple things and complex music made to sound simple; in short, it was what every music writer hopes for: unique and inspired music.This effort is just common and uninspired and fairly disapointing. I even hear some of the old lyric subjects! (Short Skirt/Long Jacket). When an artist becomes self-referencial, it means that it is time to move on. I really don't know who could not hear the difference but I certain do. Unlike the initial reviewer (Bill Forman), I don't get paid for writting nice things about this CD. I did lose money buying it though.I liked this group effort and hope that they recharge their batteries and not put out more stuff like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthems of Chilling Precision","review":"The apocalypse is underway, and Cake has written the soundtrack. To listen to Comfort Eagle is to experience standing in a coliseum, surrounded by the chanting he-cheerleaders of doomed gladiators. The walls have been crumbling; these are the trumpets of acknowledgement. It's as if Cake collectively hails from a culture in which the end times are heralded by a roller disco parking lot cookout.\\"Eh,\\" you say. \\"It's just more of the same old Cake.\\" The formula goes: megaphones, religion, handclaps, echoes, handclaps, and carefully moderated vocal tones betraying only the barest hint of a deep and fundamental sorrow. But the icing on the...album is a venture into classic guitar rhythms reminiscent of The Cars. \\"Shadow Stabbing\\" is so unspeakably beautiful in its sheer rocking simplicity, one can only dance and cry, as we are all dancing and crying toward inescapable mass destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest effort since the first","review":"Too bad half the band went and formed Deathray. Each band is half as good as the past. Buy \\"Prolonging the Magic\\" and skip this one. Totally uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have your Cake and listen to it too.","review":"If you're new to Cake, give it a shot. The band is unique in its innovative use of the music. The sound is smooth and eminently listenable. Best of all, the lyrics are clever, ranging from simply odd to a time-tempered cynicism.If you're an old fan, this album holds up well. The lyrics are a little more comprehensible than usual, and the stories they tell are also perhaps more interesting. Some might call the album more pop-y, but I think it's still marvelous. Another difference is the that there's less of the southwestern tinge.Good stuffs. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what you would expect","review":"This is exactly what you want and expect from a Cake CD...Simple, catchy songs. They just keep churning these dittys out and I will keep buying them. Favorite tracks are: Comfort Eagle and Short Skirt, Long Jacket"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best effort, but still a great CD.","review":"I don't think this is the best Cake CD to date. The title track, Comfort Eagle is spectacular - ironic and interesting lyrics. The radio play cut, Short Skirt is OK, but not fantastic. But, for a true Cake fan, this is a must-by, because the evolution of the band is obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A More refined album from the last..","review":"This album is much better that the last, but not as great as Fashion Nugget. This album was written by the same writer as all the other albums (John McCrea), but now has to conform the new members to his style and it still comes across great. The combination has worked in this latest CD. Cake has kept its \\"sound/feeling\\" and vocals even though the original guitarist has left the band. There are fantastic parts to this CD and what a relief to the cookie cuteness that I have come to expect in today's music. If I had to say though, \\"Love Me Madly\\" is very POP and so is \\"Pretty Pink Ribbon\\". So far I only listen to the first 8 1/2 songs with faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Sound","review":"Although nothing quite struck me as brilliant on this album, it's refreshingly unusual sounding. There's something about the guitar, the drums, it's a little more rock-y, a little more (dare I say?) hardcore, a little less twangy, a little less funky. Not to say that Cake's going mainstream, oh no, far from it. It just sounds a little...different from the first three albums. Although nothing after Fashion Nugget will quite measure up in my eyes, I'd definitely recommend this album to anyone...Cake fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake kicks booty","review":"Great lyrics, love the horns and the vocals. This album doesn't have the pop-y appeal of their other records, but the songs are catchy and I've found myself singing them in the shower regardless.I'm in desperate search of another band with lyrics as witty and melodies as jumpin' as Cake's, but so far I've come up short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake fans won't be dissapointed","review":"I'll admit right away that I had high expectations of this album. Cake is one of my favorite bands, and I listen to their previous 3 albums religiously(especially the second and third albums). So I had high hopes that Comfort Eagle would be just as good, or better. And it is! I once again like every single song on a Cake album. CE is full of head-boppin tunes and the music still has that \\"vintage\\" feel that many of the band's other songs have. My only gripe with the album is that there doesn't seem to be enough trumpets in it, and the trumpets are a Cake staple. But other than that this album is excellent and worth every penny, and then some. Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prolonging the Magic on Comfort Eagle","review":"How can a band change it up but still keep it the same? Ask Cake. This album is full of the same infectious rhythms and melodies that hooked you in before on \\"Prolonging the Magic\\" and \\"Fashion Nugget\\". The only difference is this time, they've expanded from falling in and out of love songs, to simply great storytelling. Whether it's the story of an \\"Austrian nobleman commissioning a symphony in C\\" or about a too hip record exec in \\"Comfort Eagle\\" or the \\"Opera Singer\\", Cake have found that there is a neverending supply of lyrical material. Put down that Staind CD now, and find out what good music sounds like. I said, please put down the Staind CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Cake CD!","review":"This is an amazing CD. Even though the band has changed its roster, this music is pumping. It is lacking the overall profanity that Cake's second album had, which I think is a good thing. The repetative use of the F word was too much. I had the chance to see two of the members in concert in Eugene, and they were quite good. They are the ones that spun off into Deathray, but the band is just as good without them. While the new album doesn't have any immediate hits, except for \\"Short Skirt, Long Jacket,\\" it's a smooth disc that you can listen to again and again. That's one thing that Cake can do. Their songs sound consistantly good. You can really do housework and listen to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake's Worst...","review":"As a Cake fan ever since Fashion Nugget,i have to say that this is Cake's worst album above all previous albums!Their best album in my opinion is Fashion Nugget!I think the loss of talented members took it's toll on the band.Comfort Eagle lacks what other past Cake albums had,good lyrics with an awesome bassist and guitarist not to mention drummer(now gone)!So if your a old Cake fan,you might be disappointed with this latest offering.So lets just hope their next album will be way better than this.And hopefully next time they'll try and choose a less of a Mtv commercial route!Like why two Short Skirt/Long Jacket videos?I've heard better Cake songs than that one,big deal..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quasi-Intellctual Rock","review":"They no doubt have a unique sound, but the lyrics characterize what I call \\"hyper-Rock Intellect.\\" Which is the quasi-intellectual expression of rebellion that contains no strong intellectual insight. They are rockers, therefore they rebel against conforming society; but to sing simple lyrics mocking a classical composer and opera singer sounds nothing more than childish and annoying- leaving me to believe there was no real intellectual thought put into these words (\\"Comfort Eagle\\" being the only slight exception). They are one step above singing about how parents are so uncool. Sell on Cake, sell on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"I love Cake, the quirky poetry in lyrics and unexpected musical phrases, the freshness of things simply said -- but this CD does not take the Cake. Most of the band had left at the time the CD came out and it shows. The songs are rehashings of the previous Cake-ness and no more. The feel is so pedestrian and mundane, the musicians are boring at best . . . skip this one and get the earlier ones; they do \\"prolong the magic\\". I know many rabid Cake fans will disagree and dis me because they are so star struck and wouldn't know cola from ink but this CD is not happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dung","review":"I think that Britney Spears must have collaberated on this project.

The song Short Skirt/Long Jacket has to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. The lyrics are terrible. Anyone could have written such ridiculous lyrics. Where is the talent in such a song?? The singer has a horrible voice. He's constantly singing off-key. Do not waste your money on this CD. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album","review":"Cake's sound, while remaining unique, has steadily improved and gained more of finished quality to it from album to album. \\"Comfort Eagle\\" continues that trend. While the album does not stray from Cake's general style, the music produced is possibly the band's best to date. With a handful of the classic, deadpan \\"white-boy rap\\" songs Cake has made famous and a number of smooth melodic tracks, \\"Comfort Eagle\\" continues to raise the bar for Cake's stylings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe that Elvis is dead, y'all","review":"Wake up and smell the melting candle wax.

Do not despair in these times of dismall regurgitated music. Rejoice, for there is Cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something is amiss","review":"This album is great, don't get me wrong. But there is something missing from this album. There is no immediate favorite track, there is no track that grabs me by the neck and spins me around until I'm dizzy.

They were an outstanding band then and they're still amazing. I've bought all four of their albums and I think this is their best to date!!! Every song is great, particularly the last three tracks, \\"Love You Madly,\\" \\"Pretty Pink Ribbon\\" and \\"World of Two.\\" Cake stands out from most other bands because they truly have an original sound that's the right mix of fun pop and edginess. Buy this album!!!! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great undeer appreciated band","review":"Great band from teh 90s, still making good music.

It is wonderful in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Band!","review":"Cake is so great because they have their formula written in stone and they don't mess with it. People who enjoy bands that evolve throughout their career probably won't appreciate Cake that much. This disc offers the same kind of upbeat, clever pop songs that Cake has been putting forth for years. As one reviewer put it, \\"more of the same, and that's just fine with me.\\" I agree entirely. The songs are pretty similar to all the great tracks on Motorcade of Generosity or Fashion Nugget, but the way this band puts together songs, they're really just so rocking and well-constructed, I don't see how anyone can get sick of them. The best songs on here are probably Opera Singer, Meanwhile, Rick James... and Love You Madly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake has done it again","review":"Cake has done it again...another AWESOME album. It is so refreshing to see a band to continuously produce good music and never falter. The songs \\"Short Skirt Long Jacket\\" and \\"Love you Madly\\" are amazing..I predict that \\"Love You Madly\\" will be the next single they release since it calls for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This 'Cake' Takes the . . .Well, You Know","review":"I discovered Cake quite by accident and probably several years after everyone else who really loves the band. But, I adore this album and really can listen to it again and again and be amused anew each time I hear it. If an album can make me smile and dance at my desk at work, it is a keeper and this is certainly one of my favorites. While I really appreciate good music, what really catches my attention is clever lyrics and this album is full of those. Great, fun songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"If there were a sixth star up for grabs.., this would get it","review":"I love Prolonging the Magic, but this actually strikes me as better. I liked all the songs immediately and I couldn't get enough of the song \\"Comfort Eagle\\" at first and ended up listening to it about ten times again and again. It's so funny and so Cake-like!! \\"Symphony in C\\" is great for someone like me who's into pop and classical. I love the references. Plust there's the \\"Opera Singer\\" song. =) Plus, again, a great Cake-sounding hit. The whole album is good. It's great. I just listen to it again and again. I love it when all the songs are good. Perhaps one of the best songs, though is the instrumental \\"Arco Arena.\\" It's got the distinctive Cake \\"yells\\" in the background. I love it! If you like Cake, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake's long awaited CD is well worth it...","review":"Cake's Comfort Eagle is another gem to add to their treasure chest already present. After almost three years of waiting for all Cake fans as the band lost the drummer and changed record labels, Cake is back on top. This song is great for listening and having a great time singing to. \\"Opera Singer\\" opens the CD by warming the listener up for a wild ride. \\"Meanwhile, Rick James...\\" and \\"Shadow Stabbing\\" continue Cake's beautiful funk domination. \\"Arco Arena\\" introduces the use of a banjo in a instrumental funk tune. The title track shows Dylan influence. \\"Long Line of Cars\\" and \\"Love You Madly\\" will put you in a fabulous mood. And \\"Commissioning...\\", my favorite track, shows you how beautiful punk rock can be. A great CD. A must purchase. Ideal for driving down the highway in your convertible on a summer afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Face it","review":"Well ladies and gents -we must admit that being Cake must be a difficult job. Especially if your previous musical attempts were nothing less than fantastic. I've heard a lot of flak towards Cake because of this new CD. \\"They've lost the western sound\\", \\"out of good ideas\\", etc. You can do one of two things - you can buy this album and listen to the ever-evolving musical whole grain goodness that is Cake, or you can listen to the \\"others\\". We MUST admit that being Cake must be a difficult job. We Must. But they've done it again. Do you think YOU could create long-lasting musical success as they have? Why argue? Buy this CD, check it out. Unless you're afraid of the evolving genius. Rock on, Cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake","review":"I find it very interesting to see how Cake evolvs from one album to the next. Way back to Motorcade of Generocity to Comfert Eagle, Cake hasn't sold out to yearly fads, although Prolonging the Magic and Comfert Eagle use more synths, Cake has still made sure to build a strong basic Rock and Roll foundation.I think the reason I like Cake so much is that, on every album of theirs there's only been 1 or 2 if any 'skip songs' if you listen to a Cake album you'll find how refreshing it is to actually have 50 minutes of good songs instead of a crappy cd with 1 radio hitIf you are a Cake fan, you'll absolutly love this album and buying it shouldn't be a question.If you simply like good solid music, you'll defenetly wanna buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cake!!","review":"Judge this CD on it's own and try not to compare it with other Cake CD's. Things change and John McCrea has done a great job adapting. Who cares if they use a drum machine or there's not more trumpet solos? These are well crafted songs. Cake may be formulaic, but their formula is like no other. \\"Short skirt,long jacket\\", \\"Long line of cars\\", and \\"Pretty pink ribbon\\" alone are worth the price of admission. Worth buying and listening to over and over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"have your cake","review":"this is a great album- one of the best, i think. cake is so wonderful- their lyrics are most often hilarious and if you'd rather not listen to them, their rhythem is outstanding. this is one of those cd's i listen to over and over... without actually getting sick of it within the first month of purchase. if you're into funky, fun music- maybe some cranberries or weezer's green album, this is a great one for ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Combo Hammer","review":"This tool is priceless.

For $300 you can buy it and it will stop working and be obsolete inside of a month. Check out the Harmony One and throw this POS out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"Mine actually lasted 4 years before the buttons stopped functioning, I guess I should consider myself lucky. Total waste of money. No way am I buying a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good product but low reliability and bad business practices","review":"This is actually an excellent remote. It is easy to use and works very well. That said, like almost every other reviewer it stopped working after about 18 months. Then you are faced with horrible business practices. No advanced replacement, $180 fee to get the remote replaced, and the need to get an installer to reprogram. All-in-all, unless they change their policy of only working through installers, I would recommend against this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not programmed to work properly!","review":"Had excessive difficulty getting the program from the company to program the remote. It took close to two weeks to get the program with multiple phone calls and emails. It would only work with a PC computer and not our newer Apple computer. As of now it is programmed only on off and volume and does not change channels properly! We got no help from the company to fix the problems with programing the remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This remote works great and we have not had any trouble with it. I cannot comment on ease of setting it up as we had our TV guy configure it for us to work with our TV, speakers, Apple TV, DVD player and airplay. So far, so good! It is nice to just have one remote that works everything. Another nice feature is the fact that it doesn't have to be pointed directly at TV due to the radio frequency."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Software! DO NOT BUY!","review":"I have a home system that was set up three years ago by a professional installer. I purchased four of these remotes, now one doesn't work. Since my installer is now out of business, I figured I could just buy a new one and set it up myself. Wrong! After spending over $1k for this company's products- they decide that I can't be trusted with the software needed to program the remote! Why allow it to be for retail sale if you're not going to let retail customers use the software?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning URC will not update Software for Consumer!!!!!","review":"I purchaed this remote in August 2007. I installed the software and did a live update all was fine. In October 2007 after purchasing some new equipment I did the live update and got a message saying URC was no longer supporting this software. How can this be. URC stated when I called them that if I purchased it from and Authorized Dealer to contact them to get the updates. Well I did and Amazon sent me to 6th Ave and 6th Ave sent me to URC.Why? Well they will only let PRO Installers have the updates what am I going to hurt myself?I feel that AMAZON and 6TH AVE should not be selling these unless they inform the customer up front that they are purchasing an expensive piece of soon to be obsolete equipment seeing as you can not get updates.I guess I should have checked on the live update before the thirty day return policy expired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key board failure","review":"Too much money for a keyboard that fails within two years. I have two of these expensive remotes and both have failed with two years for the purchase date. Going to try Logetech. I am now back using three remotes. NOT GOOD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keypad fails after 2 years","review":"For a remote this expensive, the keypad should not wear out after 2 years. A quick search of the Internet shows that others have complained about the keypad failing. This isn't a cleaning issue, instead the actual contact pads wear out on the most commonly used buttons and eventually fails completely. The manufacturer will replace for $125, but when beter remotes like the Logitech Harmony One exist for $199, it's mnot worth the effort. I would stronly urge people considering this remote to do research before making the investment, as a remote of this price should last."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs additional software","review":"I purchased the MX-900 from Firewall LLC, not realizing that the remote control needed additional software to program it. According to the directions in MX-900's pamphlet, the software needs to be downloaded from an \\"authorized seller\\" as it is not available from the remote control's manufacturer's website. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a place to download it for free. Amazon's response was to send me to a website that would program the remote control for me for even more money. So, long and short of it is, I was never able to see if the remote control worked properly because I was not able to program it. Other sellers may have the software available- make sure of this before you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MX-900 a rip off","review":"All bad reviews are 100% accurate and the manufacturer propagates this bad product with high prices and no support. I think it's time for a class action lawsuit since it says it's programmable and you can download software and you can't. Buttons are designed to fail. These clowns should go out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons fail after awhile","review":"The buttons eventually fail, and the problem is that it only takes one or two buttons to fail for the entire remote to be useless. We are on our second remote in 4 years, so about 2 years is about the lifespan of a remote, which is terrible considering the price of the device. Further, as others have described, they've stopped supporting the software to program it. Luckily I found a version, but in general they want to have you spend $$$ on an authorized dealer, if you can find one, to come out during a 4 hour window during the week to spend 3 minutes updating your remote rounded to the nearest hour and site visit cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced and poorly constructed, poor support","review":"I have had this product since 2007. I paid $1500.00 which included programming.Pros:when it works, it works fine which was rare after 2.5 years of useCons:buttons failed after 2.5 years of use, neither URC nor their dealers provided support for a defective productbatteries are changed quarterly.technician cost for reprogramming every time a new component was added or deleted.Do not buy this product. There are better products from Savant or Control4 now, while I cannot speak for Logitech, I have seen some good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally useless","review":"I purchased the Golden Earth Pilates/Yoga Exercise ball kit, so I don't have all of the pieces of this kit, but I felt obligated to warn people away from this if they want to use the DVD. The ball is fine - that's not hard to do. The video is useless and more than half of it is advertising for other products by the company.The exercises on the video would be fine except that with every single move the narrator says \\"hold for x seconds\\" or \\"repeat 10-20 times\\" and then they immediately go to the next move. This requires one to STOP what they're doing, pause the video, count it out themselves, and then restart the video. Difficult at best, and very annoying.Fortunately, I purchased the kit at a discount store for a lot less money and didn't really plan to use the video. If I had, I'd have taken it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know what I expected!","review":"I can only express my true sentiments with one word - JUNK! I know different horses for different courses but this is mindless garbage.

They are a bit on the smaller side. Somehow, I was thinking that 4 1/2inch scissors would be a bit larger. The blade portion of these scissors is very short. The quality is good but I wish I had ordered a pair a bit larger with a longer cutting blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical for use","review":"I am a nursing student which means that when the opportunity arises, I am there with full gear!

The game looks really good thanks to the power of the DS, and having the 2nd screen makes you wonder how you ever got along without it. Several of the characters from the Urbz turn up in this game, which is cool. Controls are fairly intuitive, but sometimes you get hung up in a doorway and the graphics bleed over into the next room. Aside from that, there is a lot to like about this game. Lots to do, as well. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Buggy","review":"Fun at first but freezes at the worst time, and just before you save after complete a chunck of the game, very annoying.

I purchased it used, and it's frozen up on me a couple of times, so I've learned to save my game frequently. I like the challenges that are presented and you never know what or when they will happen. I created two Sims and both games were different to a degree on when things happened during the game. If you purchase it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I am. I also purchased one for my daughter-in-law, and we are both addicted to Sims games."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter wrote this.....","review":"Alright, I just baught this game and it rocks!!!!!!

That's it. I'm 11 my sister's 15 and my brother's 9. We all love it.hope this helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"This game is not even close to the other games in the franchise. There is little customization and the only real way to make money is to play a stupid card game. All the other ways require you to wait a few days. Which brings me to my next point: the time system. This game uses the DS's real time for everything you do. If one of your customers is staying until Friday, you have to remember to play your DS on Friday. Otherwise, you don't get as much money. There are additional rooms you can add, but the only ones you need are the extra three bedrooms. All of the others let you make miniscule money by performing various jobs that require the skill of a 5-year old. Basically, this game is not worth the money you will spend. You are much better of if you spend 20 bucks on the PC version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"My 10 year old daughter received the Sims Complete Collection for the computer for a birthday gift and loves it. The Nintendo DS is what she takes along on vacations or long drives and The Sims2 is a real hit with her! She can play it for hours on end. She started out with the Nintendogs, next bought Mario Cart, then Harry Potter and finally Catz. The Catz is definitely a little young for her. The Sims seems to be something she really enjoys, perhaps even more than any of the others. I highly recommend this game, especially if you're planning a vacation with a lot of travel time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"This game is a ton a fun. You get to create a caracter(not as many choises as the computer games, but what do you expect?)Then you go to this town were you have to chase off robbers and help people in order to keep a hotel from going out of business.You can paint and buy a whole bunch of cool stuff like a rat suit.This game doesn't have great graphics but I give the game a 10/10 overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't a sims game","review":"I played this game for three days and noticed it isn't a sims game. You cannot create sims like before and those sims can't get married and have babies. All u do is manage a hotel in a town with one road and 5 buildings. I feel sorrry for u if u bought this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun At All","review":"This game is not very fun. It's okay, but what I hate the most is the new sanity meter. It dosnt show your needs seperatly, and when you have a need it goes down like crazy untill you fufill it but you don't know what you need untill it pops up over your head. The place is very small, not many places to go to, but a plus is the remixer where you can sample your voice into a song. There is not very much interactivity between people. You could make out with someone you just met, it's not realistic like the past sim games were. If you want a fun sims game, I'd suggest Sims Bustin Out for GBA or The Urbz for GBA or DS. This game was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could get my money back...","review":"I enjoyed playing this game a lot even though it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. Like other people said, it would freeze a lot. I was probably a little more than halfway through the game when it began to freeze everytime I opened up one screen, which I had to do in order to progress in the game. Basically, I bought a game that doesn't work and I can't win. It was a total waste of money and I wish I could send it back. I see that I'm not the only person who experienced this, so purchase with caution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sims 2 for DS","review":"This game is fun in the beginning, when you have missions and different needs to accommodate.

Our four year old loves to create with Legos so is very interested in following the rules to this game. And for the grownups it's much more fun to play than Chutes & Ladders! I like some of the other reviewers suggestions about decreasing the competiveness for the younger players and will try that the next time we play. While the box says for ages 7 and up a much younger child familiar with Legos and able to follow the visual directions should be able to play without frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice game for young Lego fans","review":"This game would be the masculine equivalent of \\"Pretty Pretty Princess.\\" Go around the board collecting pieces to build the Lego creation on your card.The game is well designed so that you don't have players competing for the same pieces, it is simply a race to acquire all of your pieces. However, for older players you could play so that the possibility is there.At our house we don't like the spaces which say \\"take a piece (or 2 pieces) from another player\\" since it just seems mean-spirited as you don't usually need that player's piece, it simply prevents him from completing his creation. When we play those spaces \\"wild\\" so you can pick a regular or special piece.As others have mentioned, the playing pieces are small and hard to see but this is easily remedied by using your own markers.My kids (4 and 7) love it and the 4-year old really enjoys just putting together the Lego models because there are so few pieces that it is very managable for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than just a board game","review":"I purchased this for my son's 5th birthday. I'm delighted at the concept of the game: move around the board and collect pieces to create the figure on your card. We make it less competitive by playing until everyone has their pieces. While we finish collecting our pieces the \\"winner\\" puts together their figure. We've all enjoyed playing it over and over(mom, dad, sister-7, included). Both my children have spent many hours putting the figures on the 20 cards together with the pieces of the game, and it has inspired both children to get out the Legos and make imaginative creations. The only challenge is NOT getting the game pieces mixed with the regular Legos at our home. When we put away the game we count all the regular bricks and specialty pieces to assure they're all there. If we're missing some, we can pick a card set and place all the pieces on that set to determine which piece we're missing. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very uneven novel","review":"The New York Times review was right. I found the first third of this novel dull and plodding, the middle section quite good, and the last third poorly edited and at times unreadable. It was if the novel had been written by two different authors--one who was in command of the subject matter (the middle third) and one who desperately needed a strong editor to help shape her writing (the rest of the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"I lived in Korea in the late-1970s and still possess affection for its people and interest in its history. I read this book to update my knowledge of how a 'modern' Korean looked at the world. Unfortunately I found it full of stereotypes, characters who were barely alive on the page. Only the dissolute brother held any interest. I found the descriptions of the family relationships were awkward and superficial. It's a pity because the scope and theme of the book is fascinating, and the mother's narration of historical events of interest, despite the blandness of her character. Overall I thought the author was too prepared to accept what Koreans think about themselves at face value, and not explore the differences between perception and reality. With the exception of a few pages, the final section reads more like a travelogue than a search for identity. Nice try but not quite there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing Novel","review":"I can't believe this book managed to snag any favorable reviews.

Now THAT'S class! You get the lp's seven original tracks remastered, plus four (4 )bonus cuts. Do keep in mind this record was produced by Pretty Things guitarist Dick Taylor, plus it's got some charter HW members that are rarely heard from anymore, like Dik Mik on electronics and Terry Ollis on drums.

The newer Epson's might be better at handling \\"other people's paper\\".I did get to use a Epson 777 about a few months back, and it was better than this model. So Epson has made improvements that should help alleviate the complaints about this model from other owners.I'm looking at buying another one of these Epson just to get a faster print speed on my high resolution photos.

Now folks, I didn't use this printer a whole lot in those few months; I know these are cheap electronics, but this is a ridiculous, unacceptably poor level of quality.

It was connected to a Mac.)3) The Replace Battery alarm cannot be shut off. You MUST put up with the annoyance until you replace the battery or turn the unit off - turning off your equipment.4) I hate it when moron designers think they know better than I do on how I will place my equipment.

In a normal situation, the beeping would be a good indicator to get things taken care of.Now for the con that drops the Ease-of-use rating: APC uses a proprietary cable to interface to USB, rather than a standard port.

There was no alarm or warning of any kind before it turned itself off. Works most of the time, but for something that is suppose to provide uninterrupted power, it definately doesn't.

I had one computer system that was wireless and it's only link to electricity was through an APC battery. Lightning struck and it died and started to smell burnt.

It's too much of a simulation. It's hard to do things that didn't happen in real life. It's very time-consuming and complex. Micromanagment is critical to success. If you have the patience for that, you might like the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stratagy Game, But Simple Graphics","review":"The game takes a little time to master the functions, but it has endless possiblities. By far one of the best WWII games I have played. The editor doesn't really work though. I have only one complaint about the game, for anyone that has played the axis and allies computer game, you will notice the graphics are almost identical which is a little .... But game play is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"This game had great possiblities but the current version is unplayable. I don't know who wrote the reviews at the very beginning but they must not have opened the game (perhaps the publisher?). AI is so bad that a 3 year old could beat it. It is possible to take over the world playing Spain. Real let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best WWII sim yet","review":"This is an amazingly comprehensive and detailed WWII sim. The game picks up where Axis and Allies left off. This is a detailed stratagy game, not a shoot-em-up graphics game. Anyone who enjoyed old fashioned book case games will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor attempt","review":"While I am a fan of complicated strategy games, and would love to recommend this game, I found it to be extremely buggy. I am using the latest patch (1.02) and still experience random crashes and broken features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving - Complex - Unexciting","review":"I played this game avidly for two days then, permanently uninstalled it from my computer. I am an avid wargamer, going back to the days when most games of this genre were boardgames. The old Avalon Hill title \\" Hitler's War \\", would be a much better choice. Considering that this is a wargame, combat is unexciting and it is very difficult to predict the outcome of an individual battle. Given all the complexity, one has to either slow down the gamespeed to a slow crawl or pause it constantly as events unfold. As a single player game, Hearts of Iron is not the best choice out there. It might do better with mulitple-players but, I'm not willing to give it the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"TOOO many gliches and inconsistantancies to be anything but frustrating. Freeze downs on movement of any factor to the others is not consistant with any software like this..just shows despite the \\"packaging\\" which is impressive that little effort was put into the battle sequences...an awful lot of program blow offs and aborts are present which shows lack of debugging..rush it to market and let the user beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless garbage!","review":"Paradox took a great concept and ruined it completely. Their obsession with real-time gaming made what was a promising idea into a mess. There are simply too many things to manage and the flow of the game is ruined by having to think about issues like technology and resources; why can't the computer look after these, I only want to plan a war! And then the combat interface is a joke: imagine sending an army to invade a territory while losing the territory you invaded from being itself occupied by an enemy force - ridiculous! It couldn't happen in real life but it does in HoI. My advice: save your money and buy Strategic Command."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NEW MEANING OF THE WORD \\"DUNG\\"!","review":"This game gives the word \\"DUNG\\" a new meaning, very sloppy programming, out of the box this game was horrible, five patches later, almost six now, it's till horrible. The AI has no AI at all worth playing against. Unless you like slaughtering the whole board that is and playing an ahistorical game all the way around. I took a minor like Brazil and crushed the Germans and Italians, BRAZIL!! woopee a real major power overwhelms the world in WWII and single handedly destroys the Axis powers with little or no help at all from the so-called computer allies who's greatest endeavor was sending a division at a time to be crushed by the 20 to 40 divisions guarding the coastlines of France. Pathetic game. I agree with another poster, save your money and get a quality game from Battlefront.com \\"Strategic Command\\", you can bet it will at least be challenging and not a \\"toddlers toy\\" like HOI."},{"rating":"1","title":"so few owe so many an apology...","review":"This game is cumbersome and sluggish. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I havn't spent weeks trying to figure it all out. For people who loved Axis and Allies but wanted more, sit back and keep on dreaming. This game does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"try another book","review":"This is a minibook and fairly flimsy at that. Most pictures use 2 pages so you really don't get many different pictures. At $3.99 this is a bad deal. Especially since you can get \\"My First Truck board book\\" which is bigger for small hands, sturdier and has about 2 pictures per page (instead of 1/2 picture per page), more pages and is only $5.99. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great value","review":"For the TINY size of this book, it was not worth it.

I thought it had something to do with the prophet Abraham from the Bible. After reading the first story about how this man Abraham, who is dead, possessed Esther's body to pass on these teachings, I just didn't get a good feeling about it and didn't want to keep reading.

It may be just that I didn't understand the language, but I found it to be an extremely boastful book. I prefer \\"It Works\\" by R.H. Jarrett instead. Although it's small, it cuts out the filler and gets to the core of these principles. I believe too many people try to put the Holy Spirit's ways into their own politically correct hypothesis and explanations without God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical tools to manifest and focus","review":"I found this book really helpful in helping me expand my power to manifest what I want in life. I really helped me to focus and see what I was creating in my experience. There is not alot of digging into your past or dealing with your reasons for being focus on what you don't want. There is a clear focus in this book about getting what you say you want for yourself. At some point on the path of manifesting what you want in life you may find that the flow slows down or the thing you want doesn't seem to be showing up...this book allows you to identify where you are focused that is stopping the flow and gives you practical processes to move you in to a higher state of being or energy vibration. This is a great reference book to keep around and work with on a daily basis. Its a fun book to play with and see what works for you.

It is the third book I have read by the Hicks about the teachings of Abraham. It explains why I have succeeded and why I have failed. It tells me now how to succeed in every area of my life. It makes more sense to me than almost anything else I have ever read about life and how to live it. In order for it to make sense, one has to be at a place in life where he/she is ready to receive this wisdom. If this doesn't work for you, you either don't get it or don't practice it.

I almost have to for this book because it is one of my favorite books ever. This is my second copy of since my first one has been worn out, not sure if that says anything by itself.

The Abraham material has been in my consciousness now for about 3 years, I can't get enough of it. Thank you, Esther and Jerry Hicks, for bringing it to my awareness.

The best tool I benefited most from, is the \\"Emotional Guidance System\\". I am keeping more positive than ever before, and manifesting better than I ever have.

For a time I believed that \\"Abraham\\" was the real deal. I bought their books, CD's and DVDs. I attended one of their workshops. But after discovering contradictions in the material I began to ask questions. After having done my own research I have come to believe that \\"Abraham\\" is nothing more than the re-packaged, spiritually-dramatized version of the Amway motivational seminars that Jerry Hicks gave in the 1970's and 1980's. Yes, it is wonderful, positive material that is lovingly, wittily delivered. It makes people feel good. And if that's all you need - I highly recommend it. But I, for one, need more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awakening","review":"Very good read. I couldn't put it down. I particularly loved the examples and the processes that I can use. However, I wish they would have been listed them again in a resource section. Right now I have them marked by a piece of paper for easy review to see where my emotions are currently at; hopeful, anxious, excited etc. Who knew that our emotions were the key to manifesting our desires. I especially liked the list of emotions used as indicators of my vibration. It's so easy to look at the list, see where I'm at and then look up the process that will raise my vibration/emotion. The follow up CD included in the book is also nice to have because I can just pop it in and listen to it while I'm driving to get inspired again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changing read!","review":"I had purchased this book on Amazon several years ago but it sat in the bookshelf until recently; apparently I wasn't ready for the message held within those wonderful pages. This book is well-written, easy to comprehend and has the ability to help you change your life in the moment you pick it up.I have since gone on to read 3 more books by Jerry and Esther Hicks and they have all added to the gift of knowledge and understanding that Ask and It Is Given offers. As a Certified Personal Life Coach, I try my best to continue my personal quest for who I really am and what I really want and, with this book, my path became brighter and much easier to follow.Thank you Jerry, Esther and Abraham.

The strength of the Abraham-Hicks approach is that it is set in the bedrock of the most basic mental/spiritual law. What you attract, you attract if you want it or don't want it, as long as you think about it and \\"want\\" it. They say it a bit better in the book. But then this is just a short review so I can only give a \\"snippett\\" of what I got from it. And it is proof that the truth runs through everything. Some of it is more obvious and obvated than others, but no matter what, somehow it's there and it works. Thus, is this a channeled version of The Master Key by Charles Haanel?, I don't know, how many wise spirits are a part of Abraham?, I don't know. But I do know this. It is proof.Captain Josh"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've learned so much!","review":"I have really learned so much from this book, and it is all truly amazing. The ideas are not self-serving and selfish because you can only change, believe, and feel joy for yourself. Once you do that, others will want to learn from you. That is the way you help. If you think you help others by looking at their miserable conditions and feeling sorry for them, it won't work because all you are really doing is flowing negative energy to those bad conditions by focusing only on the bad and thereby expanding the unhappy conditions. If you focus on what you can find good or can appreciate in those conditions, then good positive energy will flow and expand, and conditions will improve. That is helping others. It also works the same way in your own personal life - and this is where you should start - with yourself. I also recommend reading the book more than once and with an open mind!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Over the years I have come to understand that we do indeed create our own reality.

All have 'felt right' from the depths of my soul and I had those amazing 'light bulb moments' with each and every one.Ask and it is Given, made me experience more than a light bulb moment...it is like the sun exploding it's massive bright light into your soul. All I could do when reading this book was just sit with my mouth agape, thinking, \\"I GET IT!, I really GET IT\\"This will be the last book of this type you'll ever need to read.I am only about half way through it right now, but I know that this book will wear like no other I own because it deserves to be read over and over and over.

It was well worth the effort.Velikovsky endured scathing abuse by the scientific community for his unconventional theories merging cosmology, geology, archeology and mythology. Despite his serious research to support his theories, he was proclaimed unqualified to discuss subjects outside his field of medicine.Well, the ideas set forth in this book cannot be dismissed by similar claims. Velikovsky was, by training, a psychoanalyst trained by a student of Freud, eminently qualifying him to discuss the possibility that our species has repressed the memories of earth-shaking events too terrible and frightening to acknowledge.It gives one a new perspective on the vicious denunciations of Velikovsky's unorthodox theories by mainstream scientists. Just why did the scientific community find Velikovsky and his ideas so threatening?

The editors have taken pertinent selections from ancient writings and grouped them into subjects involving the New Testament. Examples of the sub-groupings are The History of the Jews; The Religious Life of the Jews; Jesus Outside of the New Testament; and Romans-Galatians. The selected writings include authors such as Josephus, Philo, Suetonius, Origen, and Justin Maryr. I agree with the book's editors that this collection of readings will enable those with a limited background in ancient literature to obtain a sense of those times and the New Testament. In addition, this anthology is an inexpensive way of possessing a good selection of ancient writings. This book is perfect for new students and personal theological libraries. This book would not be of interest to the advanced theological professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introductions Great but English Difficult","review":"I have used this as my standard NT Backgrounds course textbook at Singapore Bible College for many years.

Winslet tries, but Keitel is embarrassing to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kate Winslet movie","review":"When i saw the TITANIC i was of the opinion that Kate could onlyperform a secondary role.I by chance saw this movie on the cableand i could not believe the character she portrayed there.Thedirector deserves all the credit for Kate's performance.The sexappeal was so profound that i logged in to amazon.com and secureda copy.The video is a must have for Kate Winslet's fans.The moreyou see the video,the more you enjoy.It is advisable to have acouple of spare copies handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a \\"cult\\" member...","review":"I don't have time to write much now, but wish to comment. I had to see this movie because I myself have a living Indian guru. The writer and director of this story was quite successful in portraying the emotion of the experience of receiving shaktipat from a guru, and indeed, it can be a transformative experience if it is from a true guru. My husband and I cried when Ruth's third eye was opened, recalling our own experiences. Although Ruth does not end up returning to her guru, she does return to India, with her mother, no less, to continue on her way. This suggests that the guru in the story was not a cult leader. She received true shaktipat and healing which not only sustained her through her ordeal with PJ, but also transforms and heals PJ from his own personal traumas. The end was truly beautiful example of divine forgiveness. Thank you Jane, what a pleasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"I LOVE this movie. First, Kate Winslet is one of the most amazing actresses of all time. This film solidified her superb acting ability. Second, the story was very interesting and entertaining. The pace flowed smoothly and the plot thickens as Kate's character shows Harvey K.'s character how easy it is to be thrown into a cult mentality and not even realize it's happening to you. I don't want to give anything away, but the revelations that unfold lead to a lot of speculation about cult mentality even after the film ends. The minor characters were fabulous actors as well, and I was very impressed. This is a keeper and I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Artsy-fartsy","review":"Jane Campion is the reigning queen of artsy-fartsy movies, and Kate Winslet needed a quick antidote to her too-high-profile mega-Hollywood role in \\"Titanic\\". All of the characters were shallow; the romance got annoying and unconvincing; there was not enough background and context to tell us why Ruth was searching for herself and how the family seemed to manage to have all the reveling and laid back lifestyle while no one seemed to be holding a career or full-time job. Some of the colors appeared to be computer-enhanced and exaggerated, as in scenes of India in the earlier part of the movie. Except for zoomed in shots of the moon rising and the sun setting, and some panoramic shots of the outback in fiery late afternoon light, most of the shots were exhaustingly and boringly typical of Jane Campion."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"It is depressing to me that such a potentially rich, interesting premise could be so atrociously wasted. Holy Smoke is a dull, incoherent mess. Unfunny quirkiness is poorly balanced with abstract, confusing dialogue (coming from abstract, confusing characters.) The themes of the film are intriguing, but they are not so much explored as they are inanely, unhelpfully flirted with. In the situation Campion had set up, there was room for some real sparks to fly, room for some intense philosophical steam. Instead Kate Winslet pees herself and Harvey Kietel wears lipstick and a dress. The script is boring and flakey, and the characters make no sense at all. They didn't feel real; and yet on the other hand, they were not particularly interesting as fictional entities. It's a no win situation. This movie was a genuine disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE!","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. I love Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet so I thought this would be a good film. The story is a very interesting one and could have been developed into something great. Visually it is stunning. However, after a fairly good start developing some eclectic characters the movie degenerates into something nearly unwatchable. Don't think I am saying this because the nudity or profanity (of which there is a lot) offended me. It is just that the story line goes nowhere. Characters seem to behave in ways that are contradictory to their development. Storylines go nowhere. Keitel's character makes no sense whatsoever. If I were any of the people associated with this film I would leave it OFF my resume."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest turn-on ever","review":"I bought this movie because I simply adore Kate Winslet. I didn't know anything anything about it otherwise, but I knew it had gotten great reviews through the past. So I did, and I must say I found my place in heaven.This movie is one of my favorites, it's sexy and hot and director Jane Campion has gathered a few of the best actors in the world (Harvey Keitel and Winslet) which makes it a hit. I don't know why, but I feel so excited everytime I watch it, and every scene is such a big turn-on for me...Try to take away my \\"Holy Smoke\\" and you'd be watching it above..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashes to ashes","review":"Rarely does one have the privilege of being so humiliated by one's own preconceptions.

The plot is an attractive young woman goes to India. She joins an ashram but her parents in Australia are to lacking in sensitivity to understand the beauty of her choice. They lure her back to Australia and have Harvey Kietel try to deprogram her. She is the stronger as she has experienced beauty.The portrayal of the parents is simply grotesque. The script one of the most leaden with dialogue that is embarrassing to listen to. See something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Stink","review":"Wow, what a truly bad movie. I was shocked to read the critical acclaim over this film after suffering through it. A surprisingly bad movie considering the top talent: Director Jane Champion, Actors Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet. Unless you have some deep desire to see Harvey Keitel in a dress I'd recommend you steer clear of this awful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly an Ugly Movie","review":"I've sat through more than my fair share of pretentious films in my attempt to escape Hollywood's drivel. Based on the cast and the strength of the film maker, I thought Holy Smoke would have a good script, strong performances and something to say. Indeed, the film began with much promise, only to bogged down by what I would call an awful second and dreadful third act. How the characters get from point A to point F is beyond me and certainly not motivated by what was shown on the screen. If this movie was designed to question the roles of men and women in religious circles, question physical vs. mental domination in relationships, or question choices vs. others' perceptions of those choices, it would have been a worthwhile use of kodak film. In the end, the film suffers from too many ideas, too little cohesion and too much self-importance.I would suggest avoiding this film, almost as much as I would avoid Gigli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off to a great start then ran amok","review":"Maybe I'm a prude?I thought the idea of a family kidnapping their daughter back from an Ashram in India and having her \\"deprogrammed\\" by Harvey Keitel was great and the movie started out great but it really derailed as the sexual relationship between the deprogrammer and deprogrammee developed.I found the last 20 minutes uncomfortable to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I only gave it 1 star because that's the lowest point you can give. This movie is a total waste of time; questionable plot, shallow depiction of Indian faith / culture, lame characters. Only for hardcore Winslet fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't say where the smoke is being blown...","review":"This film starts out so promising. It could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief, and the legitimacy of the concept of free will. Instead, the characters dribble into infantile sexuality, and the film becomes a travelog. I can't believe this film found financing...a real waste of obvious talent. The effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise, hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thursday Diva, Follow Me.","review":"This disc is recorded and mastered totally digital, offering great acoustic listening.The second cut on this disc is liked by everyone I've invited for a listening scession.Chain of Fools, the 2nd cut, has rythum and words many can identify with.

Most computer equipment now are vampires (draw power even when turned off).

Under a 200W load it only lasted 3 minutes while the Back-UPS ES 500 lasted almost 12 minutes. The ES 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime. In my opinion this UPS is only good for very small loads (less than the average computer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"APC 350ES - Very poor UPS","review":"I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005. I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker. Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long. Only load was computer, monitor, and router). At any rate, the shut down was successful. But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so.Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it every day","review":"I thaught this game was awesome, I wish I knew how to get more areas to play in, but it is really realistic, if you shoot the animal in different areas it reacts in a different way, it is just a well put together game, I recomend this game to everyone who plays hunting games!!!

How could it have won a Pulitzer?On the plus side, it has a pretty cover. That's the only good thing about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for...","review":"I picked this up at an airport, hoping it would be a light, entertaining chick lit/beach read. Although it is well written, I found myself confused by the complex web of characters (a visual in the very beginning would've been very helpful), and often bored by the political ramblings of breakfast discussions. Good concept, but just poorly executed, and definitely not what I was expecting. I have yet to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am sorry that I spent the money to purchase this book.

I know it was supposed to be a satire, but aren't satires supposed to be humorous? It took me weeks to slog through it...I should have visited this site after the first chapter to save time, because I kept thinking, something has got to happen, right? I could have found out from the reviews that nothing ever would. Lots of deep (boring, inane) dialogue from a gathering of artsy, vegan boores...somebody in Hollywood will probably write a screenplay and make a movie out of it, which would be the next logical step, because it would fit right in with most of the garbage that Hollywood serves up these days. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I have read just about every word of fiction Jane Smiley has published (even read the Greenlanders!)--except the last 2/3 of this book. It felt claustrophobic and forced, way too talky and the sex was, um, ewww. I feel bad because I look forward to a new book by her the way I look forward to sweet corn in August. But, to stretch this food comparison a little farther, I found reading 10 Days like eating a bowl of wasabi peas, as opposed to her other books, which are like biting into a fresh peach. If you are new to Jane Smiley, may I recommend Horse Heaven, surely her most underrated book. It's epic and funny and entertaining and informative. Let's hope her next book is big and juicy and satisfying and not like some thesis topic gone awry."},{"rating":"1","title":"did jane smiley really write this?","review":"I love Jane Smiley but this book was insufferable. A bunch of characters that you cannot relate to, a really crappy version of soft core porn and just boring, boring, boring. Very, very weak. For me to give up on a hardcover AND just throw it out.

Fooled me once........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Like It","review":"I really gave this a strong shot. I wanted to like it. I liked the idea of it -- and I thought the way she layered stories was terrific. Movie people telling plots of other movies, recounting their own tales, discussing possible film scripts. And I also think Jane Smiley gave herself a real challenge of basing a book on 90 percent conversation. Also on the plus side were some vivid and excellent discussions on the war in Iraq and the Council on Foreign Affairs. However, it just drags. There is no mounting sense of tension or arc to the characters' lives. Some characters are well drawn and very 3D; some seemed flat and thin. Only for Jane Smiley completists, I would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing effort","review":"You know how you're required to go somewhere you really don't want to go, and you meet a group of people who are all fairly inane, but they think they're cool, and they talk incessantly to each other about inconsequential things in their lives they are just positive will fascinate you, but all you can do is think about possible ways to excuse yourself from their presence?

I would not recommend it to anyone...boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to hold my attention","review":"I agree with previous reviewers that this book totally failed to hold my attention. About 150 pages into it, I am completely bored. I have rarely put down a book without finishing it, but this book will likely remain unfinished.

Oh well, now I know I should have read the reviews before I bought it based on \\"A Thousand Acres\\" and Smiley's overall reputation.

The verdict appears to be no. I know it's intended to be tongue in cheek, but the characters were so full of themselves and smug. And, um, would anybody really go see a movie called \\"My Lovemaking with Elena\\"? Ick.Also, it was published in 2007 and the way they were talking about Iraq just felt so tired. Yes, it's a senseless war and a shameful waste, but they had nothing new or interesting to say about it. I like Jane Smiley but I'm not going to waste any more time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"I read voraciously, and was prepared to devour this novel, but it is painful in the extreme.

Wish I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Too Hard to be Hip","review":"I have loved Jane Smiley's books, but in this one I feel that she is trying to prove she can write about sex with authority and thereby join the In crowd.

I just finished page 200 and I'm checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten Days in the Hills","review":"I have been struggling to figure out why an author of Jane Smiley's stature would write a book like this. I find the characters to be the most vacuous bunch of people and I couldn't care less about any of them. I find the sex to be completely gratuitous and while I share Ms. Smiley's political views, they seem like an anti-war rant. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten Days in the Hills","review":"Don't waste your time or money. The book was painful to get through. I felt no connection to the characters, the dialogue was annoying and tedious. The text was all over the place, giving me the impression that Smiley just wanted to air various grievances or express opinions on any number of topics so she used this book as an excuse to do so. This was my first Jane Smiley book and it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pewlitzer Prize Winner (it stinks)","review":"A book about shallow fictional people with money and fame.

Someone lent it to me, and although I thought it wasn't my kind of story, I had read two other books by this author, and thought, \\"I'll give it a go.\\" It's hard to believe this is the same author that wrote the Greenlanders, one of my top ten books. I also read A Thousand Acres, and thought it was just OK. But this book was really the end. More importantly, I'm beginning to doubt that she writes her own books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overtly smug, boring, waste of time","review":"First and foremost, I must say I did not finish this book. I couldn't. It sickened me. After 150 pages, I felt my time would be better spent scrubbing a toilet than reading this trash. Smiley obviously and profusely hates Bush, the Iraq war, and possibly the American military. That much I understood. Everything else, well it was too embedded in obsurd sexual stories and other filth for me to recognize. I loved Smiley's \\"Horse Heaven\\" and read \\"A Thousand Acres\\", and so I decided to read another novel by her. I will not do that again. I believe there are too many other great works of fiction waiting to be read to waste another second reading her propaganda. My only regret is reading the first 150 pages. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I picked this book up in hopes of an intelligent but entertaining summer read. It failed miserably on all counts, and after suffering through \\"days\\" one, two, and three, I am heave-hoing this into the recycling bin, regretful only that I wasted my money on this misguided diatribe (certainly not that I missed out on days four through ten). As other reviewers have noted, the characters are dull, the lonnng political/naval gazing conversations even more so (think you've been cornered into painfully boring cocktail party conversation? -- you haven't seen anything until you've read this), and for Jane Smiley fans -- this book in no way delivers on the promise of her earlier books. It's not even a guilty pleasure, as it is absent both qualifications.

I certainly gave it enough of a chance though, only throwing in the towel on page 304.

Now I'm a bit gunshy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there were a zero rating, this book would earn it!","review":"Oh, thank you, Amazon readers, for confirming my suspicion...that this book is not worth slogging through. I have been listening to the audio version. After ALMOST finishing the first disc (out of 20!), alternately squirming from TMI (how can a sex scene be so TEDIOUS???) and sighing with boredom, I gave up. What a disappointment from the woman who wrote \\"Private Life\\" and \\"A Thousand Acres.\\"Back to the library it goes, right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the trash","review":"Jane Smiley does indeed have a keen ear and masterful touch with dialogue, but....449 pages of eavesdropping on the rambling conversations of these assorted Hollywood stereotypes does not add up to an engrossing read. Like many others, after 150 pages of hoping for some redeeming quality in this work, I threw my copy in the trash. This book evoked the same visceral reaction I have to people carrying on cell phone conversations in public places - the instinct for fight or flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptional for the wrong reasons.","review":"Much as I hate to, I have to cast my vote in the negative column. Usually, a book written by a writer as gifted as Jane Smiley would garner an automatic 2 stars just to start. Her way with words is masterful - usually. But this novel is so mind-numbingly slow, and the characters so egocentric and shallow, that it would be difficult to spend 30 minutes in a room with them in person, never mind trying to spend umpteen pages reading about their every physical sensation. It seems none of them have very many intellectual sensations. Seinfeld was the show about nothing, but the characters and conversation were quirky, honest, and funny. This book about nothing has none of those advantages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have loved everything Jane Smiley has written, but this book was tedious. I skipped entire passages because they were repetititve and added little the story. If you haven't read any Smiley, skip this book and go directly to The Age of Grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I just got to page 177 and gave up. I was hoping it would get interesting, but it never did. Strange characters, long dull conversations, nothing doing.

A small detail, but still...get serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I love to read. I will read anything, but the back of a cereal box is more entertaining than this book. I had to force myself to continue reading. The dialogue goes on and on until you want to scream \\"stop!\\" and the characters are predictable, right out of central casting. Not only could I not finish this book, but only one person in my 12 member book club finished it, not because she enjoyed it, but because she is a little OCD and felt compelled. This is so unworthy of a Pulitzer Prize winner--I felt duped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Trite","review":"I gave this book 200 pages to hook me and it failed miserably. I had to stop reading it and ask my husband (who had just finished it) to tell me if anything actually ever happens. He said nothing happens. So I put it down. I'm all for meandering, stream of consciousness conversation but this story had no plot and if you're going to blather on please make the blather interesting. I loved \\"My Dinner With Andre\\" and I'm not an ADD teenager. In fact, I'm the spitting image of Max's lover Elena and even that fact wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading. I'm very disappointed. It was so pointless that even the sex left me cold. Ho hum. Big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes Nowhere Fast","review":"Jane Smiley is an enormously talented writer. I loved \\"The Greenlanders\\" and \\"A Year At The Races\\", both books stayed with me long after I finished reading them. She can crank out very high quality work, but \\"Ten Day's in the Hills\\" is a loser. Yes, maybe it's experimental, but mainly it's just boring. All the characters sound the same, over privileged, affluent, droning on, far too much interior dialog and musing that goes nowhere. It seems more like a study of rarified academic types than Hollywood. Where's the fun, the desperation, the irony, the treachery? I can't imagine Hollywood is populated with people this dull. You will also be treated to Smiley's political views, early in the novel she pontificates about the Iraq war and the evils of Bush.

It is connected to the computer lab where it is the only printer that the students use. It is extremely fast and reliable.

I used this printer for home use-- mostly text-- for about 2 years. It is very fast and has good layout options. On the down side the replacement cartridges are expensive and the system that tells you to replace them unreliable. (You can fool the computer into thinking you've put a new one in by lifting up the old one and quickly putting it back in, I learned) The other day (after using it that morning) I turned the printer on and it turned itself off. I have fooled with it to no avail. Epson does NOT have an 800 number and was not very helpful-- even about providing a place for me to bring it for repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"heath/zenith barn light","review":"would not recommend , very cheaply built , product made overseas and very cheap quality , socket broke on installation of bulb"},{"rating":"2","title":"How it all began","review":"This is Part 1 of two fascinating and exciting filmizations of Jacques Mesrine's autobiography. He was a real-life master criminal, a hotblooded Frenchman who beat both the penal and judicial systems. He became a career criminal at a young age; as he tells his father in one scene, it is his choice, it's not his father's fault that he turned out the way he did. Mesrine started his \\"career\\" with petty thievery, moving up to bank robberies, kidnapping, extortion, and murder. No prison could hold him, and he mocked the judges at his trials.

I found that the book describes what parents should look for in a karate school. It is against flashy uniforms and young instructors and for retired teachers teaching peace in tattered belts. Where do I find such a teacher? My son's teacher is young and in good shape. While the book makes some good points, I found this book to be a bit self serving as it recommends the author's school and his affiliates as the only people who teach martial arts correctly. I signed my son up for self defense against bullies. What this book teaches is running away, agreeing to be humiliated, and lying to boot. I want my son to stand up with confidence and use martial arts if necessary.Instead, the book advocates a quaker like approach. Please!!!!

For the Love of Money just lacks any kind of substance. Next time I'll check out the reviews first before I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly Girl Again","review":"I started this book and I actually began to like what was happening to Tracy.The book began to make sense as well as get good then wouldn't you know it THE END.I believe Omar could have done a better Job I was a little confused as to who was the author also.I know Omar's work and this just did not seem like the work that I was familiar with.Please Omar do yourself and your fans a favor try again call it Fly Girl again and this time give us what we paid for.Don't take your fans for granted.You know we will buy your books because of your history of making great books.Give us something to read and we will always buy your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"This book was the worst! I have been trying to read it for almost two months now. I've read several books in the meantime and I only plan to continue reading \\"For The Love of Money\\" because I started it. Omar Tyree has left a bitter taste on me when it comes to his books now. I have read Flyy Girl in a matter of no time and I wish he would have just left well enough alone. I am very dissapointed with this book, and what is up with the sorry poetry that Tracy was trying to write. I was just not feeling anything about it and I am sorry I brought it. Sorry Omar, but you've bombed this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"I read flyy girl when I was younger and loved it. This book is horrible, Omar needs to be slapped for this book. It was not the same Tracy that I loved from flyy girl. Her becoming an actress, we cannot relate to that. That little part with Victor in it, was horrible. What happened with timmy,bruce,etc. I still think you need to do this book over again, you owe it to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars Really","review":"I really liked \\"Flyy Girl\\" and was looking forward to reading this one. I was convinced that someone else wrote \\"Flyy Girl\\" because I thought that book's writing style was up to par and \\"For the Love of Money\\" just was not. This book is nothing for me but inspirational b/c I want to be a screenwriter, but the story is not realistically told. The only parts I was pleased with was hearing about Raheema and Tracy's other friends. Tracy herself was rather self-centered and conceited and made reading the book hard. I read a \\"Do Right Man\\" and was disappointed by that. I will not be buying any more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the love of the money I threw away","review":"As an African American I am always seeking out African American authors to support. It pains me that Omar Tyree won't be one of them. For the Love of Money was one of the worse books I have read in a long time. It was difficult to read more than a few pages at a time. The characters in the book were unbelievable and without any substance, especially the main character. The poetry was juvenile and did nothing to add to the book's credibility. The main character wrote poetry in five minutes. Needless to say none of them will be winning any literary prizes.Hopefully this author will improve. Somehow I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund Please","review":"I really tried hard to read this book. However, I was unsuccessful. After forcing to reading several chapters, Tyree did not develop an interest in his character for readers to keep turning pages. I guess after reading books by Rochelle Alers and Eric Jerome Dickey, you have high expectations from the next author. For the love of money was a major turn off from Omar Tyree. My recommendation is that an excerpt of the book should be available for readers so they won't be as disappointed as I was if they decide to purchase a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLYY GIRL SO GOOD THIS WAS SO BORING","review":"IM 13 YEARS OLD THIS BOOK IS SO STUPID IT DIDNT HAVE YOU FLIPPEN THE PAGES LIKE I DID ON FLYY GIRL. IM 13 YEARS OLD AND TRACY WAS BETTER TELLEN US YOUNG GIRLS DONT JUST CARE ABOUT THE NEW FAION TRENDS, MONEY AND GOLD. IN \\"FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY \\" IT DOES NOT HAVE YOU FLIPPEN THE PAGE. IM SORRY OMAR TYREE THIS BOOK WAS NOT GOOD. I RECOMMEND YOU TO READ \\"THE COLDEST WINTER EVER\\" IT WOULD HAVE FLIPPEN THE PAGES SO FAST. I DONT RECOMMEND ANY ON TO PURCHASE THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN BORROW IT THE BORROW IT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVED \\"Flyy girl\\" and I was sooooo happy when I heard about \\"For the love of money\\". But, boy was I upset at this book!!! I wanted my money back. This book was bad as was \\"Sweet St. Louis\\" and I was scared to buy \\"Just say no!\\" because of my last two books by Omar Tyree. This book is nothing like \\"Flyy girl\\" and the poems in it ...too. This book feels like he just threw it together because everybody wanted a conclusion to Tracy and her life. He could have kept this book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETIMES A GOOD IDEA SHOULD STAY AN IDEA!","review":"WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS OMAR THINKING. I RAN OUT TO GET THIS BOOK THE MOMENT I HEARD IT CAME OUT AND THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. I WAS ALWAYS THOUGHT A SEQUEL INCLUDED ALMOST THE SAME CHARACTERS AND THIS BOOK MENTIONED MAYBE 3 OF THE SAME PLUS HER FAMILY IT WAS AWFUL. I REALLY THINK HE SHOULD REWRITE A SEQUEL THIS TIME BEING MORE REALISIC THE WHOLE THING OF HER BEING A MOVIE STAR WAS ROO UNREAL TO BE THE SEQUEL. AND EVEN IN THE END SHE STILL DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY. AT LEAST, IF SHE WASN'T GOING TO BE WITH VICTOR LET HIM HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN THE DUMB BOOK. THE BOOK DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST AT ALL I WILL NEVER BUY ANY OF HIS BOOKS AGAIN WITHOUT IT BEING A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I'm less than half way through this book and I'd like to stop reading right here, but I'm anxious to see how much worse it gets. This is my first book by Omar Tyree and if this is an indication of his work, it will be my last. I think that as a man trying to write the character of Tracy, he has made her come off as spoiled, self-centered and bitchy. He obviously does not like her. In the real world, none of her \\"girlfriends\\" would have put up with her. They would have told her off, dropped her, or more likely, both. Thank goodness I did not buy this book but only borrowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The first thing I want anyone whose reading this review to know is that Omar Tyree is an AMAZING writer. However, this is NOT the book to read if you are just forming an opinion of his talent. \\"For The Love Of Money\\" is not one of his best. I will go as far to say that it is probably THE worst novel by him I've read so far. After reading \\"Flyy Girl\\" This follow-up was very disappointing. I suggest if you really want to read this story you check it out of the library because you will feel your money was wasted if you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Love Of Money","review":"I was introduced to Omar when I was a freshman at collge. At first I thought it was a little juvenile until I continued to read it. I loved Flyy Girl and had great expections for this book. It's been over three years since I read about Tracy and I was eagerly awaiting to hear about her current lifestyle. My best friend and I were so anxious to buy it the day it came out, but waited until we heard the reviews. Boy was I glad, I rented the book from the library and could barely get the first chapter. Then I listen to it on tape, just to give it another try. I thought listening to it while driving would get me past the first chapter. Tapes later, I still found the book to be boring and could not complete it. I am sorry to say that the story was weak. I understood that Omar wanted to make a mature story geared to an older audience, but his way of going at it was not right."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"After reading Flyy Girl (which I thought was very good), I could not wait to find out what happen to Tracy and the others. I started reading For the Love of Money more than one month ago and I am only on page 88. The writing was so poor that I had to go back a couple of times to be sure of what I had read. I don't usually like to put a book down before finishing it, but I could not even read this book while standing on a long line waiting for service - BORING. The more I read, the more I grew tired of this book. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BOOOORING\\"","review":"Oh my gosh, who even let this book be published? This book just had no plot, it floated from boring to even more boring. I was very disappointed in this book. I can't explain it any better than this. It was just BORING. I didn't bother finishing to read it. I think I stopped at page 200 and it has 400 and something pages total. That just goes to show you the book never picked up, even after page 200. There was no need for me to read any further. Now I'm not sure If I even want to get anymore of Mr. Tyree's books. For fear that they won't be any good either. But what the heck he's got to have a good one out their. So I think I'll continue to read his books. Hope I wont be disappointed again :( If you decide to get this book please check it out from the library . Remember I warned you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"I highly recommend that you borrow this book from someone. It's not worth the money!!! I really wish that I could get my money back from this one. The story flip-flopped too much. It lacked substance and had no real purpose other than to make money because; everyone wants to know what happened to Tracey. A lot of the characters had no real purpose. For one, Tracey's young cousin. What was the point of her being mentioned? Not to mention that he threw himself into to the book as a character. That was just plain dumb to me. It was unrealistic and lacked focus. I have been a follower of Omar's work but this one was a waste of good trees. Fly Girl and Capitol City are definitely my favorites. And in my opinion his best work to date. Next book that he writes, I will check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, omar","review":"did not feel it.i understand that you wanted readers to become reacquainted with tracy and what made her so fly (i'm not spelling it flyy) in the first place. that, i commend you for.what i did not appreciate was the fact that she was still acting like the same spoiled 14 year old that she was in the first book.i know people knocked the first book because of its melodrama, but it was supposed to be marketed towards teens, anyway. (any fool could see that) but the second book, tracy at 28 years old, is a rehash of tracy in 'flyy girl' (before she got afrocentric on me)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you value your money, don't buy this book","review":"In a word, VAPID.If you just have to find out what became of Tracy: borrow the book from an uninformed friend; borrow it from the library; or peruse it in a bookstore because,in the final analysis, you will not care."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Knew it","review":"I just had the funny feeling this was going to be a bad novel. It's bad to say but I hate Omar Tyree as a writter. All his books are too dragged out, I only bought this one becase I read Flyy Girl. And once again I was dissapointed, this book could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly Gril Returns?","review":"Omar, why didn't you keep her in hidding????? You have a lot to learn about sequels! I hope you read this review...I don't know what the hell to review! This story SUCKED big time. Thats the bottom line here. PLEASE people SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you check my review history, you'll see I've reviewed a lot of books. I have nothing to say about this crap. The book is over 300 pages of nothing! I have never been tortured like that before in my life.Omar, you amused us with Flyy Girl. I loved Tracy back then and I could identify with her...I have no idea of who she is now! What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really Bad!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Okay I usually don't write reviews for books but I had to save somebody from buying this book. First of I loved flyy girl but this book was so boring. First of Tracy goes to holly wood and supposedly comes famous unrealistically fast. It doesn't tell you what happens to any of the other characters of the book like Carmen, Bruce, and Timmy. Rahemma is only mentioned once or twice and tracy is the same selfish spoiled 15 year old only not as interesting. Tracy only see's victor once and they're not together they don't even get any closure. Also Omar throws in lame poetry that isn't deeper than an episode of sesame street and mentions his self too many times. It seems like omar wrote this book while he was high. If you had to find out what happened to tracy get this book from the libray do not waste yo money or yo time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book [is bad]!","review":"I wish I could find Omar Tyree, so I could hit him upside the head with this book and ask him for my money back. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!! It moves so slowly, back and forth every other chapter between the character's life at one point in one chapter, to another point in her life maybe 5 years later in the next chapter. It got confusing and stupid, so I gave up after a few chapters. I just couldn't give this book a chance. It was so bad... that I don't think I'll ever buy another one of Omar Tyree's book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Love of Money","review":"I was real excited when I heard about a part two of Flyy Girl. But this book was very unrealistic. I mean, how many people do you know would go from being a school teacher to a screenwriter-actress just like that? And Mr. Tyree made Tracy's rise to fame seem so easy. Plus, I saw this novel as an opportunity for Omar Tyree to pump himself up by placing himself in the novel as the writer of Tracy's biography, Flyy Girl. Sorry, Omar, but you really bombed out on this one. And it's funny, I read an interview of his in which he was complaining about how he felt that people didn't take him seriously as a writer or something. This book gives you the reason why."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Love Your Money, Don't BUY This Book","review":"I will not bash Brother Tyree as a writer. His skills are not lacking at all. There just wasn't anything else we so feverishly needed to know about the main character. Some things are better left unsaid, or in this case; unread. Not everyone can crank out a masterpiece everytime they go out for one. I have to say that I have never been so disappointed. The dialogue was strained. The characters, including Raheema (my favorite from Flyy Girl) had no depth. The main character almost made me hate her completely with her numerous self-contradictions. It was almost as if the writer couldn't decide if he wanted her to BE fly or PLAY at being fly. Nonetheless, I will continue to be on the lookout for more of Brother Tyree's work. Best of luck, always."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Love of Money...Dont Wastse Your Money!","review":"I consider myself a big fan of Omar Tyree, and when i purchased this book i thought that this would better than the Flyy. It was a big yawnnn! tyree does not have any edge in this book, and does not do justice for the original Flynn Girl. No excitement, no real disappointments for his character Tracy, and no Man!! Omar...go back to the old days and find those true writing skills that you possesed in the past!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time","review":"Mr. Tyree's latest book just didn't add up for me. I kept on reading because I hoped to find something redeeming or worthy about the characters, but to no avail. Somehow, I just did't see what the point was. Next time, I'll wait for the next book to be released in paperback (and donated to my local library)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected(2 and a half stars)","review":"I was so excited when I knew For the Love of Money was going to be a sequel to Flyy Girl. I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This book was missing something. I found that the Tracy in this book had all the money and fame but was lonely and bitter. I mean I was expecting Tracy to at least find a man to share the rest of her life with in this book.(and I do not mean Victor) Another thing that bothered me was that Tracy went from teacher to big Hollywood star with no bumps in between. Omar also should not have mentioned himself in the book so much either. The poetry could have been excluded also. There was a part in the book where Jill Scott is mentioned but Tracy says that you know what to expect from her. Was that a dis to Jill Scott??? Anyway, St.Louis was horrible but please get A Do Right Man. I still have faith in you Omar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed It!!","review":"I've read a lot of bad book lately, A LOT!, this is not a bad book. Omar Tyree is a very creative writer and didn't bog us down with another \\"brother do sister do brother wrong story\\". It is a story about Tracy Ellison from \\"Flyy Girl\\" fame who grew up went to college and got educated. After teaching for a couple of years she moves out west and becomes a screenwriter and get the opportunity to write and star in a movie. The author does a good job of writing about Tracy's experience past and present and weaving in his previous novel \\"Flyy Girl\\" in to the story. The poetry is a refreshing change.There's room in the bookstores for all kinds of stories, this is just one.Much props to Omar, everyone I've talked to about this book enjoyed it.I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it.","review":"I loved Fly Girl, so when I seen that a new book came out called For The Love of Money based on the same characters only grown up I was thrilled to read it.

I own the book and never even read it through."},{"rating":"1","title":"-1","review":"i give this book a negative one because it was so boring, fly girl was so good you would expect for the sequel to be better, omar tyree i am so disappointed in you and so are the majority of your fly girl novel fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you are dying to read this book, I suggest you go to the library. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... This book is long and drawn out. It keeps you waiting for something good to happen, but it never does. Usally if I'm interested in book it takes about 3 to 4 days to read it, but this book took me 6 long miserable months. I had more fun pulling out my wisdom tooth, than reading this piece of crap. I don't want to give away any details, but Mr. Tyree shouldn't have made a sequel to a fantastic book like Flyy girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"NNNNooooooooooo","review":"I did not like for the Love of Money because for me it went too slow.

I would suggest reading this book is there is nothing else to read. But don't spend your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"It took me so long to read this book. This book was a total waste of time. It was not close to as good as FLYY GIRL was and it was supposed to be the follow-up to it. He kept throwing me off with the past and the present for each chapter and those poems. It was not even close to what it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very big disappointment","review":"I love Omar Tyree, and although I am a loyal fan, this book disappointed me more than a little bit. I dont think that Omar Tyree gave the Flyy Girl fans what they were looking for with this sequel. He should have never written a sequel, and my advice for anyone who is considering reading this book, DONT!!! It was a waste of time, and I was highly upset with the way that things turened out for Tracy and her first love, Victor Hinson. Im sure that a lot of Flyy Girl fans want to find out what ever happened with Tracy and Victor as wll as I did, and I wont tell the story, but I will say that Omar Tyree cheated fans on the whole Tracy and Victor ordeal, and I was so disappointed, that I regretted ever checking this book out from the library. The book was also hard to get into, boring, and all in all For The Love of Money was irrelavent to Flyy Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"I disagree with the previous reviewers. I thought the book was as good as Flyy Girl. I especially loved the incorporation of poetry throughout the book.Tracy was not boring as an adult; she just grew up!

TO SUM IT UP IN ONE WORD, IT WAS \\"BORING!\\" I PUT IT DOWN AND PICKED IT UP SO MANY TIMES, BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THERE. I HAVE EVEN TOLD PEOPLE NOT TO BUY IT IN THE BOOK STORE. YES, THE AUTHOR'S REFERENCE TO HIMSELF WAS ABSOLUTLEY ARROGANT. THERE WASN'T A PLOT. HE TURNED A FABULOUS CHARACTER WITH A VIBRANT PERSONALITY INTO SOMEONE NOT WORTHY OF MY TIME AND ATTENTION.

Flyy Girl was off the hook and I was so sure that the sequel was gonna be even better. I was wrong. If you want to read it for yourself, borrow it from a friend.

Omar could've put that story in a magazine and saved me some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THE MADDNESS","review":"I read FLyy Girl, which was a pretty decent book.So when the sequal was being released, I had to get it. This book was horrible. Tracy is boring and wack. As for Omar Tyree, I am a unoffical fan of his. I sent him a email talking about my desire to be a writter. He sent me a nasty email that I surely did not appreciate he is cocky and for no reason because every review I've seen is negative. He could of done better. Oh and his latest book, Just Say No. is stupid too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know about this one.","review":"I had read flyy girl and i thought it was the best. When i found out he had wrote a sequal to it I was excited. I work in a library ( thank heavens) and i ordered the book. I couldn't really focus on the book. It wasn't as suspensful or realistic as flyy girl. I'm still tryin' to finish the book. If at some point it becomes good i'll let you all know. but for now, i would rather read my psycology book. Sorry Omar Tyree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dull and boring","review":"I had heard that Omar was a decent writer, but I am so glad I got this book from the library instead of spending money on it! The storyline was poorly developed, the main character's life was completely unrealistic, and the dialogue -- almost laughable in some places (where it really wasn't supposed to be funny). I think Omar should have experienced living in Hollywood before he wrote this book; I'm sure the black actresses who really are trying to make it there would like to believe it's as easy as it was for Tracy. Also, did Will Smith have an investment in this novel? He must have, with all the references to his Philly roots. Bottom line: you have to care about a character to want to read the book. Tracy was so shallow and egocentric that I didn't even care how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Well Enough Alone","review":"I had a very hard time reading this sequel to Flyy Girl. When I finished reading Flyy Girl. I closed the book laughing and crying at the same time. By the time I finished the novel I felt as if I grew up with Tracy and her friends and family. There were lessons taught in the book. For The Love Of Money did NOTHING for me. I found myself putting down the book every few pages. I had NO emotional connection with any of the characters. I even found it hard to remember some names. This sequel was very empty. So much more could have been done with Tracy's evolvement into womanhood. Omar should have just either thought about it more. Or simply left well enough alone. (The repeated reference to himself in the novel was at an annoying level all by itself.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Now I'd like to consider myself an Omar Tyree fan, but For the Love of Money and his latest offering, Just Say No!, were way below par. I hope his subsequent books are a better representation of his earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read Flyy Girl, and I was so impressed. It reminded me of my younger days (not as promiscuous though). I couldn't put the book down. So when I saw \\"For the Love of Money\\" a sequel to Flyy Girl, I was excited.

It seemed like everything came to tracy to quick, and everything came to her, she didn't have to go to it and NO BODY's Life is like that. It was like a fantasy Novel, and most of the people i know along with me like books where there are obstacles and problems. WHERE WAS THE PROBLEM!!

I couldn't take it....I put it down.I had bought the books prior to the time period where I started reading reviews on Amazon. Now, I read the reviews faithfully. I wish I had read them before I wasted my money on 3 books. I don't see me finishing the 2nd book or even picking up the 3rd. The worst thing is I don't even want to give them away as gifts.

I made it through half the novel before I decided that I could not continue to torture myself.The content was bland. As I perused the novel I began to feel like Omar Tyree could care less about his readers. I mean FLyy Girl was magnificent! I recommended it to numerous people and I was all too excited to see there was a sequel. I was horrified when I opened the cover to review a content so emotionless that the pages may as well have been blank!

That you could throw a bunch of silly mix-matched words on paper just to call it a book? Or maybe you were on a tight dead-line for the publishing company and they had to put something/anything on the market. Whatever the case, you did yourself and your fans a serious disservice in penning For The Love of Money. I don't have to be a playa-hater to call trash exactly what it is.

This book didn't seemed to have a focus or plot. It just flowed from one uninteresting chapter to another. Tracy, the focus of both \\"Flyy Girl\\" and \\"For the Love of Money,\\" charactor was well developed on a personnal level in the book but other than her thoughts there wasn't anything else to hold your attention other than the hope that you just haven't got to the good part yet.

I read Flyy Girl and had very high hopes. I purchased this book like 6 months ago and still haven't finished it. And I probably won't. I mean [dang], This [stinks]! Whatever happened to Bruce??? And the way Tracy met up with Victor was terrible and she looked like the same [girl] she was in Flyy Girl. Why is she still making the same bad decisions she made at 16? I mean gosh, it's supposed to be a sequel. And the Hollywood thing was freakin far fetched...We're just supposed to believe that Tracy became a millionaire? Either Omar Tyree is stupid as hell or he expects us to be. The only characted I appreciated in this novel was Rashida (sp). She was the only one who made real growth. All of our other characters were left behind, and Tracy was still as shallow as she was when she was 16.

I gave this writer the benefit of the doubt and decided to read another one of his books, \\"Sweet St. Louis\\", but I just couldn't get into the story. I found \\"FTLOM\\" to be a more of a book for teenage-ish readers. For one, I found main character, Tracie, to be a bit too unrealistic. I thought it was a good thing of her to go back to her hometown and show others that they could make it out too, but the story line was a weak, and the plot even weaker. I hope that Omar's new book, \\"Leslie\\" does better, but I will have to go to the library to read that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book by Omar Tyree","review":"I rate this book no stars , it was the worst book that I've brought in a long time.

I wouldn't waste my time, energy or money buying this book (and to think I bought the book when it was hardback!) And while we are on the topic of Tracy, Flyy Girl is a book that will seem good to you as a young teenager, and I guess the plot of the book is okay but as an older teen/adult you will too realize this book was horribly written. ...I apologize for my previous review and anyone I may have caused to buy that terrible book!

After reading and loving Flyy Girl, Just Say No, and Leslie, just to name a few, this book was a major disappointment.

It was a VERY big disappointment to me, especially what happened with Tracy and her first love Victor Hinson.

Why?","review":"Have you ever heard the saying that when something is good, leave it alone? Well Mr. Omar R. Tyree did the exact oppisite, \\"Flyy Girl\\" a perfectly good book, and he destroyed it, completly missed it up. Sometimes things don't need a sequel just leave it alone, yet he did it anyway, Tracy growing up is not what people wanted to read about, especially when she lived a life of 30 grown women when she was younger in \\"Flyy Girl\\" so what more could she have possibly experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to say that the sequal to Flyy Girl left me feeling dissapointed. FTLoM seemed to go way too slow for me. In all of the chapters that take place in 2000 you already know that she is a sucess where as in the 1996 chapters she still hasn't gotten her success yet. It just seems to take too long to get the points of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Tyree?","review":"I was really excited to know that the Flyy Girl had turned into a woman, but once I read the book. I wish all that I had was the image of the Flyy Girl. I was very disappointed. Mr. Tyree seemed to even be cocky, by putting himself in the novel as a writer. The whole plot was just too unreal. It was an OK book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that loved Fly Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"time wasted","review":"IT WAS TERRIBLE, THE WORST PART WAS THE POETRY!!!!

Flyy girl was off the chain. For the Love of Money - not so good. If you feel you must read this book then borrow it from a friend. When you finish, you'll be ready to pay them to take it back. For those of you are curious about this book because of the reviews -- don't be. Re-read Flyy Girl. You aren't missing anything.

I then decided to check out other novels he had written. I read \\"Flyy Girl\\" first which, I liked as well and followed it with \\"For The Love of Money\\", which was a Big Disappointment! They always say sequels are bad and this novel proved that theory. The novel starts off with the end of the story and in the middle of the novel right when it is going to climax you realize the connection between the beginning and the end and loose interest because you already know the ending of the novel. The novel did not keep my interest and seemed rather long. This novel could have been summed up in one chapter and used for the Prologue to \\"Boss Lady\\". After reading \\"For The Love of Money\\", I am not interested in reading the sequel \\"Boss Lady\\" at all!

Most of Cooney's books are very good, but this one was extremely boring. It's hard to feel sorry for the herione, Meghan, and even the climax of the book doesn't pick up the pace. Not only do you not care what happens to the villian of sorts, Lannie, you couldn't care less if they all dropped dead. I found myself wondering why they didn't just get it over with.

Again, everything you'd want in a big band is here. And the horses playing on it! Michael and Randy Becker, Peter Erskine, Don Grolnick, Marvin Stamm, and the list goes on!

But like the previous reviewer said, the lid doesn't fit well. Also, the silicone ring on the bottom of the cup is hard to work with. It's meant to keep the cup from sliding around on the counter (was this a problem?).

I do not print that much (maybe 300 sheets a year) and this printer has gone through 6 sets of cartridges during the 1.5 years I've had it. The heads clog easily as well, since they are fixed within the printer. HP Printers replace the heads each time you replace a cartridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Can Be Spent Better Elsewhere","review":"This printer is not worth the hastle. It eats ink cartridges like there is no tomorrow, breaks often, and does not have 1/8th the print quality of the newer inkjet printers on the market.

This movie is VERY enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Others' love stories have much wisdom to offer","review":"This is a great summer romance of sorts with nervous bride-to-be Winona Ryder spending her time writing a master's thesis on a relic American Quilt. As she weaves her paper, she also weaves together the thread of romantic patterns from all the women in her life. There is much to be learned when hearing the life stories of those who have loved before us. It's a simmering multi-layered story of how deep loves, even when lost, never truly leave us. The worst thing in life is to die without your own love story to tell ... even if it didn't end the way you wanted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie.","review":"I purchased this movie for the simplicity of it and all of the beautiful women who were featured in the movie, notably Maya Angelou, Jean Simmons, and the other beautiful ladies in this film along with Winona Ryder.

Unfortunately, it seems to be grossly misunderstood by reviewers, who tend to be - and sorry for the generalization - male.

Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at a sadly lost art form.","review":"This book is absolutely fascinating, enriching, absorbing, and rewarding on any number of levels. Nobody I have read has ever explained any art form with more clarity and intelligence than Mr. Kerr in THE SILENT CLOWNS. It combines a heartfelt love of the form with meticulous research and a tough minded analysis of what exactly made people laugh at silent comedy then and what in those films could translate to modern audiences. The book is accessible, written in plain language but so astute on what makes people laugh AND what makes some laughs better than others that it sometimes seems it should be required reading for all writers, filmmakers, storytellers, et al.I was not a silent film fan before reading Walter Kerr's masterful dissection of silent comedy, but, as a blurb on the back of the book stated, it had me laughing at routines I had never seen and made me want to track down every single Buster Keaton film I could get my hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one","review":"If you get any book or combination of books on silent film, this one is a must have. Incredible research, great examples of each master's style, technique, and persona.You don't have to be a film buff to enjoy this book; the author obviously loves his subject, and his enthusiasm is infectious...I find myself coming back to this book repeatedly, and each time find something new.When written, Kerr proclaimed that he had a predilection for the work of Keaton, read why and check out \\"The General\\" or \\"The Navigator\\" and you'll know why he's doesn't seem as dated or quaint as Chaplin.Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 times disappointing","review":"Sorry, this book is a huge disappointment. Very little is learned about trade entries and trade exits from the 16 interviews conducted for this book. I'm afraid this reeks of marketing. The only entries and exits that this book can describe are apparently the 16 entries and exits the good doctor made coming and going to these trading rooms. This book is simply not for those traders hoping to garner new trade techniques from other professionals. I suggest anyone expecting that to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is just another great book of the author, Alexander Elder. I recommend the book to both experienced and inexperienced traders.By the way, the author's \\"Come Into My Trading Room\\" is one of my favorite books on trading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking to traders in the US and Europe","review":"Reading this book and working through its charts I felt like a secret observer, following Dr Elder as he visited and interviewed his trader friends here and abroad. I especially liked the feature where each trader showed two trades and I had to figure out which of the two will make or lose money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled by the reviews","review":"I bought the book because the reviews were good. When I received the book and started to read, I realized I've been duped! It's another one of those trading books with some trade examples and analyses by Elder on those trades. Everything looks perfect after the fact.I personally didn't get much from reading it so I returned it for refund. This is the first book I returned a book to Amazon. At least I now know how to return a book back to Amazon. They paid for the return shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Your Trading Collection","review":"What a fantastic book! It is one of the most interesting and insightful revelations into the minds of actual traders that I have ever read. Elder gives us an up front and personal look into trades executed by 16 different select traders. Each section describes actual trades, the methodology behind the trades, and the outcomes...both wins and losses. The trades are explained along with color charts and color photos of the traders! This book has provided me with the stability of an incredible \\"yardstick\\" to measure my own approaches to trading the financial markets. I highly recommend this book. It is Elder's best so far, and it is most definitely top shelf educational trading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Gives real insight into what it takes to become a full time trader.

This book makes a wonderful gift for any person who loves to spend time in the kitchen.You can spend just a few minutes whipping up a delicious sauce or side dish or decide to spend the day in the kitchen and make your guests a four course meal they will never forget. The desserts are amazing, I have never seen anything like this. The directions are easy to follow and the result makes you feel like a professional chef.The flavors are unique and mouth watering. I recomend this book to everyone who loves to cook and of course eat. It truly is a piece of art and a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is one of the most expensive cookbooks I have (and I also have Millenium). I love cooking and will do whatever it takes to make great dishes. However, when the recipes don't turn out, it's not worth my time or effort. I have found this to be the case with Artful. Two recipes completely did not work, even though I followed the directions exactly.I will try a few more and write an update if I come across some decent recipes, but I can't help but wonder if these were even tested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - THIS is a gourmet cookbook!","review":"As many other reviewers have mentioned - this is not a beginner's guide to vegan cooking. I have never seen a cookbook like this one. When I make a recipe from this book I have to plan a shopping list ahead of time and read through the recipes before I start preparing them. It takes quite a bit of effort but is worth EVERY SECOND I spend on it. The flavors are downright tantalizing and the dishes plate so beautifully you feel like you are dining in a 5-star restaurant. If you love to cook and love wowing your dinner guests then this is a definite book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"More from Millennium","review":"The ARTFUL VEGAN is just what it says - beautiful vegan food that tastes good and is good for you. It is the second book from the wonderful Millennium Restaurant in San Francisco, and does not disappoint. The recipes seem a bit involved, and complicated, yet easy to manage once you break them down into their various components. And the resulting food is so good that it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck - these aren't easy","review":"Great inspiration in the recipes, but many of them have ingredients you'll have to work hard to find, or have more complicated processes involved (like smoking something) that simply make this book too difficult for the regular home cook. I got it as a gift and started looking through it excited to make some of the dishes, but then when I got to reading the ingredients in detail I started giving up and turning the next one. And then the next one, and the one after that. Halfway through I think I got maybe 2 or 3 things I'd be able to do without spending a fortune just to make one meal. We aren't in the restaurant business, the authors jobs should be to set up a recipe to be made at home. Even in the intro they say that they don't typically even write these things down, but just wing it through inspiration. From this it doesn't surprise me that some people say that some recipes just don't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this book!","review":"Ausubel's Restoring the Earth is vital, inspiring, and unique. In reading it, you will see the future of agriculture, design, medicine, and much more. For once, a book that fluidly merges and illuminates both social and environmental realities. For once, instead of simply depressing you or just screaming \\"somebody do something!\\"--it addresses these urgent realities with exciting solutions that are *already* tried and true. This is more than a lucid, intelligent outline of our planet's most pressing circumstances, it is a series of well-written stories about today's visionaries: innovative, real people that have come up with almost magical solutions to save biodiversity and money at the same time. Reading Ausubel's book is a great way to be educated and uplifted at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A roaring good read","review":"Key West secedes from the Union, declares its independence -- and it's not fiction, it's history. King captures the quirky heart and spirit of Key West and reports from the insider's view the events that led to revolution. I was in Key West to celebrate the secession anniversary a few years ago. This book brings the story to life with a lot grins along the way. It is fun to learn the strategic thinking and ingenuity that went into the battle with the US government -- a credit to Key West islanders and a tribute to the American way! Pick it up, put on Jimmy Buffet and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Product!!","review":"I loved the MP3 player, it works fantastic, and its small, small enought to fit almost anywhere.

The top knobs fell off of two of them from casual practice over carpet in a matter of weeks. They are completely hollow and have no balance to them.I'd go for the clubs made by duncan, they're about the same price but of a better quality, mine have lasted years of abuse and held up fine, minus minor scratches from drops over concrete.

When I first put it in my player I could not believe how good the songs were, and how powerful Cher's voice sounded. Every song turned out to be great, even the ones I was skeptical about like Bang Bang, I Found Someone and Dark Lady. But I loved all the songs, especially I Got You Babe, Just Like Jesse James, Bang Bang, Heart of Stone and The Way of Love. All of the songs on this CD are classics. My only complaints were about the song Don't Come Cryin' to Me which was the only song I didn't like on the album. Its too bad that Cher's biggest hit Believe wasn't included on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO YOU \\"BELIEVE\\" IN CASHING IN?","review":"This \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation was only released in the wake of Cher's most recent comeback.Make no mistake, the lady is more a presence than artist, as this collection of songs, which span 25 years, painfully demonstrates.Geffen Records turns in an odd, unbalanced set of tracks. The bulk consists of Cher's stab at rock and roll, eighties style, with a smattering of her early ninties half-hits.Most fun are the handful of early seventies \\"classics\\": \\"Half-Breed\\", \\"Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves\\", et al. Pure kitsch, pure Cher.This disc is only for the true die-hard Cher fan.

Her early solo hits are missing and she had a considerable run of chart hits on Imperial Records in the 1960s. If you stop to think about it, Cher is a phenomenon. She's been a successful performer and recording artist for 40 years!!! That she is more successful today than ever before proves that there is some justice in the world.So, this collection is not definitive, but it is fun. And that is worth five stars in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cher's best hits","review":"This is a first class album, it has most of Cher's top hits on it. I just like laying in bed listening to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special in her own way","review":"These songs are as slick and over-produced as you could expect for any Cher collection,be it a hits package or some effort of hers that tries (cries?) to get lesser known songs by lesser known artists a piece of the rock n' roll recognition pie.But can you really complain much about the results here? I sure cant.No gimmicky editing was done to any song,and should she be scorned for making \\"its in his kiss(the shoop shoop song)\\"bigger than the original? Hell,she had the vocal and groove to carry that baby,and the overly-critical need a head soaking for being that way.Some of these are her originals,the others are ones she carries home the way others simply couldn't-well...most of the time.If anyone can truly turn back time it is Cher.May the forces be with you-as long as you do it all right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sensational Skillet cookbook order","review":"The Sensational Skillet Cookbook.

All the tracks are well written and performed with a unique combination of instruments, but I like tracks 4, 5 & 6 especially.

I like traditional jazz but LOVE contemporary jazz and Rhyme or Reason fits in perfectly with my collection. I'm a jazz enthusiast and I play CDs on my PC at work and have them repeat throughout the day. That means a CD I like, I get to know very well, and it will often travel with me from office to car to home and back again.

Newman's character is a broken man, who finds redemption by the film's end. It's not easy - he's up against the Catholic church here - in one of the greatest courtroom dramas on film.I love how alone Newman is throughout this film & how David Mamet writes it without one false move. Hey, at least David had a slingshot. An American classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Verdict","review":"A searing, moody courtroom drama masterfully directed by Sidney Lumet, the film earned five Oscar nominations in 1982, including one for writer David Mamet. As Frank Galvin, Newman shows a rare vulnerability as a man struggling to redeem himself before it's too late. This film represents both courtroom and human drama at its finest, with veteran player Jack Warden superb as Galvin's only colleague and friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Verdict","review":"Paul Newman should have won the Oscar for The Verdict. Big blunder by the Academy. He was brilliant in this film as was James Mason. One of my all time favorite films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable and not entertaining","review":"It seemed that they wanted to make the whole movie based on the \\"summation\\" speech at the end. It might be nice for some people to think that all you have to do is make a nice speech and you win a case and you get handed a check for millions, but if that is what the movie is going to be, just cut all the other stuff and show the speech and the jury awarding a huge sum of money. The movie was boring and downright unbelievable. It is totally ridiculous that he would have won the verdict based on what happened in the movie. It was a waste of time to watch. Here's the synopsis: drunk lawyer gets a slam-dunk case, nothing goes right in the case for him and everyone can tell he should lose, he makes a heartfelt closing argument, and finally, the jury awards him and his client millions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Actor","review":"This was a great role for Paul Newman.

David Mamet's script has enough holes in it to drive a bulldozer through but a superlative performance by Newman and equally great direction from Sidney Lumet put this one over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Newman is great.","review":"It features Paul Newman in a very unique performance. It also carries a theme through out that underscores an individual's fight against conformity. Sidney Lumet's direction is flawless. I loved it and you should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting melodrama, not very logical or plausible","review":"The theme is stereotyped: wealthy doctors can afford to hire the slickest, most unscrupulous shyster to cover up their mistake. They are helped by a corrupt, cynical judge, who makes the most incredible rulings against the victims. On the other side is an unsuccessful, boozing, fumbling lawyer with all kinds of irritating mannerisms. There is the usual courtroom drama, with the impoverished victims winning against the evil rich people. It's all about class warfare--ordinary people against the \\"system\\".This is a political caricature. Except for the class-warfare claptrap and irrelevancies (such as the personal shortcomings of the attorney for the plaintiffs) a very thin, predictable piece of nonsense. Too bad such a good actor as Newman got involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Nemans The Verdict was Awesome","review":"I got this not knowing what to expect. I didn't watch it when it came out but glad I got the chance to see it. A down and out lawyer takes on a case that is surely a loosing one. No witnesses and everything is on shakey ground. What's in it besides money is pure pride and Newman is not going to let them get the best of him. He turns down offers to end the case early even without a hope or prayer and going up against a shrewd opposing lawyer. As the movie unfolds several characters develop and the movie has a supprise ending. A great ending to a great movie. I was really supprised. Hard to say if this was Newman's best performance but he couldn't have done any better for the type of movie it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST See Movie !...","review":"For fans of lawyer, courtroom type of movies, this is a real \\"Must See!\\" Paul Newman playing the role of an alcoholic, \\"has-been\\" lawyer, Frank Galvin tries one last case only to face so many obstacles, like his key witness, all of a sudden \\"taking a vacation\\" in one of the Caribbean Islands; the girl(Charlotte Rampling) he meets and gets to feel for and trust turning out to be actually a mole planted by the \\"all powerful\\" opponent lawyer(James Mason); the judge who seems biased against him etc. Yet despite all these odds, Frank was very persistant and keeping to his principles to do what is right, he went ahead to try the case instead of settling out of court. With the end result that he won the case overwhelmingly and this gives a real good feeling to the viewer! So get this movie.

But if you really want to dive into the pool, you should at least acquaint yourself with the books most of this joke was borrowed from, i.e. anything by Dennis Cooper, some of Mary Gaitskill, and more than a dollop of Flannery O'Connor.

They invest a lot of energy to \\"re-invent\\" themselves as young males (who never really become adult men) and at the same time reduce their envy by putting boys down (just like in the case of \\"Anthony Godby Johnson\\"). Make them suffer all kinds of abuse, turn them into some weak and miserable beings so that you don't have to envy them anymore (it's therefore only logical that Jeremiah has to wear girl's clothes) - that's it, there's nothing more to say actually.

Best used with Field Guide to the Birds of North America which DOES fit in your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birds of Mexico","review":"Several good books on the birds of Mexico have been published but this is one of the best and most detailed guides that is currently available. It covers all the extant species, with good range maps and distribution information, comments on food habits and habitat preferences, and brief breeding behavior. Extensive references are listed, including sources outside the United States and Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Excellent","review":"This book is excellent for a trip to Mexico; however be warned, some of the most common birds are not pictured in the plates. While all of the species not found in the US have colorful plates, there are no plates for waterbirds such as gulls and no plates for the warblers or flycatchers other than endemics; however, there are descriptions and location maps for all birds found in Mexico. If you visit during migration, and have trouble remembering fall plumage distinctions on migrating warblers, be sure to bring a Sibley or Peterson guide along with you as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously heavy & pictures are small inset in center","review":"I really don't like the pictures-separate-from-the-text format in birding books. It's tedious and silly. Also, the sheer amount of text in this book is staggering. I needed a take-along guide with pictures adjacent to text, not this behemoth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not pack again","review":"We found the book difficult to use as the color plates are centrally located and separate from written discriptions. Further it's size filled too much \\"valuable real estate\\" in the minimal luggage we travel with and the weight did not justify it's helpfulness. We saw several birds in the Yucatan - verified by our Mayan guide - that were not included in this book. Even had we listened to one recommendation which was \\"tear the book apart and take only the parts you think you may need\\", I would have been left wondering if the birds we saw (but not included in the guide) had been left in the portion of the book we didn't take with us. I'm still seeking a better bird book for this region."},{"rating":"1","title":"author should have hired a professional indexer","review":"The index is not usable and takes away any serious utility of this book.

Bad idea on both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Ambient Masterpiece","review":"I was fortunate enough to find this CD at a little CD shop in Austin, Texas. Unfortunately this was in 1993. This is Stearns' best in my opinion. I use this CD for meditation and relaxation. This is a defenite favorite among my vast music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I absolutely love several songs on this album. And I think this album is one of my favorite purchases this year --- the instrumentation is so diverse and interesting and the songs are lyrically brilliant and full of wonderful melodies. My only reservations have to do with the Christian subtext to some of it --- though even that is really tasteful and original. And after all, there are many many brilliant artists that incorporate religious ideas into their music...Dylan is the first to come to mind.Glad I found this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ask yourself one question . . .","review":"Musically, I would say that the thing that many reviewers like most about this album is also what some might like least about it. If you want to know if you are going to enjoy this CD, ask yourself one question:How much do I like the banjo?If you love the twangy banjo sound and don't mind predictable / repetitive chords, than you are really going to like this album. If not, and you are used to listening to imaginative, layered electronic music, check out Illinoise by Stevens - which has a lot more instrumental range and complexity, and 22 songs - so you are more likely to find something you like. That said, there are a few gems on this album as well, such as Abraham & To be Alone with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"What else is there to say? Surjan Stevens is a genius. Certainly a musical genius, but possibly an all around genius. There are moments on this album that make me shake my head and want to cry they are so beautiful. The line \\"I have a sister somewhere in Detroit\\" emerges like a great black hawk at dawn, sucking us in, and dropping us down. (I have the vinyl and this comes at the end of side one.)I must add that I listened to this album about half a dozen times on faith before it began to work its way under my skin. It's subtle and rich in its effect. Don't give up on it!! After listening about a dozen times I sat down one day and played it loud. All of a sudden it was as if I'd been hit with a hammer in the chest. Magical, truly magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"This isn't my favorite Sufjan album, but it's still freaking amazing. For fans of Iron & Wine and the like, this is a really good choice. If you want something with more of a variance of instruments and which can draw no comparisons, go with \\"A Sun Came\\" or \\"Illinois,\\" both of which I would grant six stars were it possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Incredible","review":"Sufjan Stevens could calm even Chuck Norris down with the sound of his voice. Folk will never die, and Sufjan will always be the blood flowing through it's heart.Sufjan's most personal album, this is a deftly written and skantily yet masterfully written and performed album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is the Sufjan album that matters","review":"For all the hip-raving that has met his later, showier albums, it's in this quiet, modest album that Sufjan's best work is to be found.The songs are gentle, intimate and haunting. The best comparison I can think of is early Bruce Cockburn: this has the same sense of humility and wonder in the face of both the natural world and the spiritual.Don't expect long semi-progressive jams or experimentation - just brilliant songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, folky album","review":"Seven Swans is a stripped-down, very folky CD. Heavily laden with banjo and acoustic guitars, the songs are some of Sufjan's most beautiful, emotional work.The only reason I give this CD 4 instead of 5 stars is that it doesn't have that certain aura of experimentation I would expect from Sufjan's work. Instead, Seven Swans is a solid batch of folk songs for a mellow mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was my intro to Sufjan Stevens, and it was a wonderful place to start. I was at first a little turned off by the Christianity themes, references, etc., but I couldn't deny that I loved the music (and oddly enough, The Transfiguration, perhaps the most blantantly Christian and certainly most Biblical, is my favorite song). Perhaps not as... impressive as Illiniose, but if you enjoyed any of his other albums, you should certainly get this one, too, or if you're just checking it out, at least listen to the samples so you know what you're getting into, or rather, just get it. You'll be pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little League - too much pressure on the Kids","review":"This is an excellent book on the inner happenings of Little League Baseball. I really enjoyed the candid assesments of how parents and managers go overboard. The book though is not a bashing of the little league faults - it gives inside looks at what happens at williamsport and the teams...I really enjoyed the stories about the ugly rivalry between California and Florida and how Dante Bichette Sr. got out of control - also the stories about Curacao and Japan and how serious they take the game - the stories about the pitcher's not resting their arms and getting major injuries is a wake up...Finally, the story centers on Hawaii and how they built their team swithcing from Pony to Little League - and how they practiced so hard - 6 days a week! Great stories about Little league baseball and how Travel teams are so much better and talented (cooperstown baseball)...if you enjoy youth baseball - you'll love this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Hold my Attention","review":"I'm not a big fan of non-fiction, but I am an avid reader and have been coaching Little League for a number of years. Normally, I think most non-fiction texts can and should be shrunk down by 90% and placed in a magazine so their narrative doesn't run dry. This book is a solid case in point. I got bored after four chapters and had to put the book down. It's not that the writing was bad, it's that the book went into too much detail about people I didn't care about.If only this were an article in Sports Illustrated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Few sources.","review":"The Adam of the Bible lived in Mesopotamia. That is not Africa. That is the Asian continent. The Fertile crescent. And, even if Moses lived in Africa, that doesn't prove his race. He was born a slave of the race of Hebrews descended from Abraham of Ur. Abraham was from Ur of the Chaldees, a Sumerian city-state. The Sumerians depicted themselves with light skin and often with blue eyes.This book claims the feathered serpent of Meso-America was \\"a black man with woolly hair.\\" Of course, the American natives never said this. They never depicted him this way in the few codices that have survived. They never wrote of it. The only place you will find sources of this authors mistakes is in the works of other revisionists and afro-centrists.Sadly, most people do not research source materials. Some people see a bibliography in the back and think that this guy must have done his homework. But, sadly, it's not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"The deluded misconceptions of the African race are exemplified in this book. Oh, sure the Africans created EVERYTHING: all of the major religions, all of the gods are black africans, mathematics, the alphabet, philosophy, etc. The Egyptians were originally black. The Greeks stole EVERYTHING from the black Africans. How very sad indeed.Then we have to hear that not only were all the great philosophers black, but the gay community has put in their claim as well; all of these philosophers were homosexuals! But wait, to be precise, all of the great philosophers were gay black men.EVERY race has contributed to civilization and our society as we know it. Nobody knows definitively if any of these people mentioned were actually black Africans, but it seems that racial/sexual/gender groups are always trying to glom on to some sense of misguided, egomaniacal insolence.Be proud of your race, whatever it may be.

I got this Santoku for him as a gift, because I know I use my Classic Ikon Santoku for almost all cutting jobs while preparing food. He now does the same. Whether it is chopping, cutting, or slicing, this knife is so versatile that it can do it all. It is so sharp that it actually cuts up my sponge when I try to wash the blade. So be careful!

The lead female character, Eliza, became quite unlikable as the story progressed, and frankly, annoyed me. The lead male character is written as a strong man with deep convictions, yet he seems to have no reaction when betrayed over and over again by the women he supposedly loves. Eliza's uncle commits a horrific crime in front of the sheriff and apparently is never even arrested. My opinion, pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obvious enthusiasm for his repertoire!","review":"Lyric tenor Richard Heard, accompanied on piano by Pamela Howland, performs with a fresh, clear sound and an obvious enthusiasm for his repertoire, which features diverse composers including William Grant Still, John Work, Margaret Bonds, Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, H.T.

This is full of refreshing covers, and his voice is as good as ever. I loved Save the Best for Last the best. Everything is good here.

I just hope his next album has all new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are they real singers???","review":"It is sad :-( to see all those GOOD singers waisting their time.

I was looking so forward to this album but now? Sorry I don't buy it (after I saw the tracklist) I have all those vinyl albums with thee original songs.Seems like all the singers are just out to make a fast buck but not please their fans anymore----------sad but true"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts too much to really be stainless steel","review":"When I purchased this shower caddy, it claimed to be stainless steel, but it now has so many rust spots I highly doubt if it really is.

Not only does his book cover the basics of dioramas, it also has chapters on weathering and painting, including a superb chapter on painting figures. The book is well organized, covering the stages of design, layout, materials and presentation, and his style of writing is clear and informal. Nothing too technical here yet will still appeal to both expert and beginner modelers. If you have built models, this book will help you put your model where it belongs - in your own diorama."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful for modeler","review":"somewhere in the world it is hard to find books for modeler, so this can be more useful. personally i like his diorama because of his ability of imagination. they would give you pleasure. thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, highly recommended.","review":"Sheperd Paine has developed the hobby of modeling and diorama building to a high art form!

They are exceptional!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe worth more stars if military interest","review":"I rated this a one to get your attention. This book is not about building all dioramas but is only military focused. It may be good for that aspect but it is not about builiding any other theme. There is nothing I could find in the description that it was mainly military themed. I returned it free with prime.

This will tell you just about everything you wanted to know about making dioramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical approach","review":"This is the standard work on the subject and it deserves to be. Well-written and illustrated, Shep Paine avoids the rather overdone results that are typical from another famous master of the diorama (such as painting eyeballs and lips on 1/35 scale figures). Recently updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"This book is flawed. In an attempt to write a gender-based history, the author actually offers a limited, gender-biased view of the past three centuries. Much of the book is a history of the feminist movement. Men and conservatives are villanized, while feminists are glorified. This wouldn't be so apprehensible if the book at least revealed historical trends in the woman's movement. Instead, the reader is forced to infer and piece these trends together from 560 pages. Furthermore, the author overly-references historically isolated and irregular figures and portrays them as representative of all women during the period. Needless to say, I was unimpressed with her product."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEY...IT'S TONY!!","review":"what can I say about the great Tony Williams that hasn't been said before? One of the all-time great drummers. I love this CD because it swings and I love the straight-forward jazz on it. Oh yeah, the players aren't too shabby either! As a big-time fan of rock music I've always liked the way Tony would sound like a rock drummer at times, and I don't mean he sounds like a rock drummer trying to play jazz, far from it. He doesn't seem to tune his drums as tight as most jazz players and his playing can be quite forceful. His catalog is too extensive for me to rate this album with his others but this is a real nice jazz CD and thoroughly enjoyable.www.electriceyes.us"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball Coaching:48 Championship Basketball Drills","review":"I don't know a whole lot about basketball, but my husband coaches at the local community center.

Get it now, dammit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grinspoon is F***in sh** up","review":"From hard core rythmic, to phat and funky. This extremely tight cd definitely brings out the best in punk and metal, from hardcore power cord riffs to extreme and fast guitar solos. Great vocals and lyrics round it all off. Whether you are into Coal Chamber, Snot, and Incubus or if you like Green Day, The Offspring and The Living End. It doesn't matter. Once you hear the hit single POSTENEBRIATEDANXIETY, you'll be drawn in. I first heard Grinspoon in the late night hour and bought the cd because they were featured in Warped Tour. Do yourself a favor and buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars from all their friends","review":"This band always interupts my festival experience with their talentless dribble.

Picture a young, crownless James Hetfield fronting a more melodic Cannibal Corpse and scowling at barracuda record executive types as in \\"NBT\\", or 'next big thing'. If this sounds a bit pompous, it comes across as a genuine love of metal in familiar thump and grind structures that often slip into quieter, more thoughtful angst, as in the nearly apologetic, metal defending, \\"Bad Funk Stripe\\", and the fluid, bar-gazing, \\"Repeat\\". The band's individual roles aren't credited on the CD, but the vocals, scowling and lung busting one moment, meek and vulnerable the next, give the band both a youthful zest and wizened maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"I've been looking for this for so long!

At least with this cereal, the clear portions of the bag allow you to actually SEE how much you are buying in addition to having the weight of product information. I give this cereal a high rating due to taste, high amount of protein, and convenience. This is probably the best tasting cereal with this much protein out there.

It appears to combine the aspects of Taoist Yoga with Buddhist Qigong. The detail is such that makes a very deep subject easy to understand and practise. These books are rare and the only one that appears to be similar but also very involved to practise is the recent Stuart Olson offering.Practioners of this form of Qigong have to be real serious about why they want to follow this as the subject is very deep and impacts the physical, mental and spiritual outlook of the practioner.

While I've really had good success with the camera (though its photos in dark places are lousy), when the batteries start running low, the CCD takes progressively worse photos.

Andrews' through everything-including her death! However, this book finally pushed me to the limit. As a fan of V.C. I'm clearly a fan of the grotesque and macabre, but this exploration of a seven-year-old's sexuality went too far. My stomach was churning the whole time. Yes, I understand that this is a real phenomenon-early puberty-but something as disturbing as someone who not too long ago was wearing diapers menstruating is a medical issue, not one that should be put in gothic hack fiction as \\"sexy\\". Psychologically a child of seven could never handle such an event and I found the addition of a character who wanted to \\"introduce\\" the child to her \\"new feelings\\" so upsetting I decided to give up the ghost, literally (the ghostwriter) for good.

To a degree the characters are the same as in Flowers. Last night I read Ian who molested his sister is going to be a doctor. How many times can this story be rehashed?The mother's grief over precocious puberty is so over the wall it is pathological, especially in this day and time when it is common.

I have bought every single one of her books and will more than likely continue to do so. But this book was poorly put together and the characters' reaction to Jordan's early development was simply overdone. Perhaps if I knew nothing about early puberty, I would simply accept it, but since I do...let's just say I did not care the book and I agree with a previous reviewer that these books have gone downhill. Early puberty is startling and frightening for little ones, but I could easily name ten girls in my grade school that began developing at early ages and no one treated them like some horrific mutant. The writer made it seem like she magically grew a tail or a third arm that had to be hidden from the world.The premise was lacking and the writing poor and yet...I keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing mixture of comedy/tragedy.","review":"I was also reminded of the movie \\"Miss Congeniality\\" when I read this book--beauty pageant world turns nasty.

What bothered me about the book was that the mixture of silly romantic comedy and psychological thriller didn't work.

The book is 387 pages long (large print edition) partly because of the large print, but also because the author was so detailed.

I feel as if I've learned some useful Hindi and gotten a good start toward becoming proficient with the language. I really like the Pimsleur approach and I'm considering trying some of their other language courses.I have only a few criticisms:First, as other reviewers have mentioned, some of the Hindi phrases that these CDs teach are quite formal. I've had Hindi speakers tell me that the way I learned to say certain things is technically correct, but that NO ONE would actually say it like that.The other problem is that when you're done, you're done! While this course is referred to as \\"Hindi 1\\" throughout the CDs, there is currently no path to continue learning Hindi with Pimsleur. If they released a \\"Hindi 2,\\" I'd buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial Hindi","review":"The language presented on the Pimsleur Hindi tapes is not ordinary spoken Hindi. It is an artificial Sanskritized version. These tapes will teach you many words that Hindi speakers will recognize but would not normally use in their own every-day conversation. Very disappointing. It seems as though someone took the transcript of the Pimsleur French or Spanish tapes and attempted a word-for-word translation into Hindi. Hindi speakers do not normally use separate words for 'please,' 'thank you,' and 'excuse me.' These sentiments are normally conveyed in Hindi through the use of verb endings, particles, etc. Hopefully Pimsleur will produce another set of Hindi lessons using 'real' Hindi sometime soon. I have used the Pimsleur tapes for Spanish and thought that they were excellent. I would like to see the Pimsleur method applied to a 'complete' Hindi course that uses normal spoken Hindi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for pronunciation - overly formal speaking","review":"I thought this was a good intro to Hindi but lacked much of the basics. For example, you only the learn the numbers 1-5 and then 8 and 9. Also, a little too much time is spent on pronunciation and not enough on content. In comparing what I've learned with Hindi speakers, they thought the conversations were overly formal and not completely realistic with awkward phrasing for colloquial use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I don't think that the Pimsleur Hindi course teaches you very much when compared with the money invested. To their credit, they will help you learn a few phrases very well. But they don't go into much detail, and the vocabulary that you learn is very limited. Also, you learn practically nothing about grammar. I think the Pimsleur language courses are cut from the same mold, so they don't go into specific things that would be helpful for a particular language. Teach Yourself Hindi by R. Snell costs half as much and is ten times more useful, especially if you get the audio edition that comes with cassette tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This was just a terrible product, and you'd be better off trying another Hindi conversation guide (or watch a bunch of Bollywood movies). It's laughable how many times they repeat the same useless phrase over and over again. How many times can you hear them repeat, \\"Do you understand Hindi? Thodi thodi\\" The grammar they are using is also very stilted and formal and I've never heard anyone speak that way.Another incredibly annoying thing is that the teacher can't even say the word \\"Hindi\\" properly and uses a hard \\"D\\" when he says it.

The result is, you get enticed into their playing, and then suddenly, the band becomes the background while these \\"journalists\\" sit on comfy couches and babble about the band. I say, \\"shut up and let me see the band perform\\". I don't need anybody telling me what they're doing while they're doing it. These people are as annoying as radio \\"personalities\\"!

There is none of the plot richness that exists in other films in the genre. It plays like a checklist: got magical bit #1, on to #2. The screenplay/directing doesn't allow the audience to make a connection with any of the characters, and as a result it is incredibly difficult to invest any emotional energy in what is happening on the screen. Adding to the train wreck is the poor acting, but it' a toss-up as to whether its the fault of the actors or the script. I'm easily amused and this movie just didn't cut it.

It was like taking a line from every book and making a movie of it. It was truly terrible. Read the books! They are TOTALLY amazing!... and I am in my late 30's.. never too old for these books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I have waited nearly all my life for someone to make Susan Cooper's \\"The Dark is Rising\\" books into a film(s). Now that there is one, I wish it was never made. Why can't producers and screenwriters just STICK TO THE BOOK??? The books are SO much more interesting than this movie. Even just by watching the trailer, you can tell that they practically changed at least 50% of the story. And the Rider's horse is supposed to be BLACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent mess of a movie","review":"The book this movie is based on is an absolutely wonderful work of children's literature, probably one of the top 10 works of fantasy for children of all time. Couldn't the folks who made this movie have at least chosen some other (not good) book to base this movie on? This movie is a work of bad, not-fan fiction, by people, it appears, who did not bother to read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies This Year!","review":"This is a wonderful movie. It was beautifully filmed and made. It is very different from the book so don't expect even a comparison, but outside of the book I would recommend it to everyone; it is a great family movie too. Go watch it and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, even for those who didn't read the book.","review":"Even without reading the book I knew things weren't right with this movie. I felt like there were holes and important events left out, and the entire movie just felt rushed. The special effects were good, and the story itself seems like it would be good enough to invest in the book. But the movie was poorly done, and I am sure that we can blame a majority of that on a poorly written script. I imagine, had I read the book before hand, I would have been left with the same unsatisfied feeling I had after watching Eragon. I was rather disappointed. But on a good note, this movie has sparked my interest enough to buy the books in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING!!!!","review":"This movie was an absolute piece of rubbish!! Not only did the \\"plot\\" - although it is an insult to the term \\"plot\\" to describe this pathetic film as actually having one - not make sense (the contusion at the end was so completely ridiculous as to make audiences wonder about the mental health of all those involved with production), but it started with a truly incredible story (Susan Cooper's \\"The Dark Is Rising (The Dark Is Rising Sequence)\\") that was original, complex yet understandable, beautiful, creative, and utterly amazing on every level and then dumbed it down into what was for the most part a predictable, pathetic, and completely asinine \\"story.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"sad to see a wonderful series end up on screen this way","review":"I sincerely hope Susan Cooper got a good deal on the rights to TDiR, as they've now sledge-hammered the spirit of one of my favorite series of books in the name of updating, relocating and modernizing...and ended up with a flop anyway.I can't really see how this would attract any of the audiences they were probably hoping would see it - the readers of the books will no doubt be disappointed and those who haven't read the books will have better-executed movies to choose from (see: Harry Potter, Spiderwick Chronicles, even The Golden Compass).To remove the story entirely from its lush UK settings and Arthurian plot devices is to deny child viewers a lot of credit that they honestly are due.Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined a wonderful book","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a huge fan of Ms. Coopers books and was excited to see a movie based on one of her books. Unfortunately, it was pretty much unwatchable. This review is on the first half of the movie, which I managed to force myself through. After that, I turned it off. From what I can see in the other reviews, that was a good choice.The movie has made unneccessary changes to the plot of the book. None of these changes improved upon the book; in fact, just the opposite is true. Further, the story was so condensed that it was almost impossible to follow. Special effects were over-the-top and completely distracting.I hope some day a good movie is made from the Dark is Rising series. Unfortunately, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seek No More","review":"This is without a doubt one of the worst film adaption of a book I have ever seen. Its like they bought the title of the books simply so they could create a crappier version of the story.

The movie isn't really even going to appeal to people who haven't read the books, as it seems very derivative at times. People who have read the series and are fans may develop violent feelings towards the screen play writers; I know we did! Just avoid this movie and perhaps \\"they\\" will consider it a bomb and not make another...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Worth the Watch!","review":"On a whim, I bought this film from the \\"Previously Viewed\\" rack at Blockbuster--and I wasn't disappointed! I have not read the novel, so taking it on its merits as a film alone, it's an enjoyable and well-crafted piece of work. The score is beautiful, the characters are well acted without exception, the story is engaging, the action is gripping, and the production design is intriguing. This is well worth the watch, particularly if you're a fan of the fantasy-meets-real-world story. And stories about the battle of good and evil (in this case, light and dark) never get old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The seeker...","review":"Went seeking an adventurous kids movie and we found one. It is a modest adaptation of a series of books by Susan Cooper. Of course the books are better but for entertainment sake it gets the job done.A decent movie the whole family can watch together. There are a few scary parts for younger children but even they aren't toooooo bad. I am just judging this movie for the movie itself. My son read the books and told me plainly that the movie doesn't really go by the books and should be called something else. So if you have read the book don't expect much from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE FLUSH","review":"This movie's script was banged out by howler monkeys and thrown in your face on the screen. The film is okay, but when you realize they clipped and cut the heart and soul out of six novels to produce this vaguely forgettable film, moving the wonder the humor and the heart out of it and left very little behind to wonder what motivates and propels the story along.The books are better. Read them. Ignore this cinematic travesty. If the film were any good, it wouldn't be found dumped heavily in the discount bins after its DVD release..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAHHHHHHHHHH!","review":"I watched the previews for this and decided I didn't want another disapointment, Like Blood & Chocolate was. I loved the classic book series, it is one of the best, right up there with Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Prydain, and the Chronicles of Narnia, but all I can say from what I saw is, \\"AH, IT BURNS!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you see","review":"This item was purchased as a gift as my husband worked on the film. The condition it comes in is of course perfect and the film itself is what you would expect. It is a childrens film and it meets all of the set criteria for a children's film. It is a little more serious and directed at the slightly older more developed child, but an enjoyable watch for the entire family."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING like the books so don't hold your breath!","review":"Aside from some of the character names ...there is nothing to link this movie to the Susan Cooper series. At least with Harry Potter the storyline was somewhat followed - even if some things were left out.Having read \\"The Dark Is Rising\\" series, this movie was a sore disappointment to me. The books were fantastic, action-packed - hold on to your seats wonderful! The movie is a tiny shadow of the books. You find yourself being frustrated with Will and his teen whine and self-pity instead of hoping he finds the signs. Really important characters to the story were tossed to the wayside and some were left as a side-look instead of the real character. Sad disappointment of a movie. BUT, if you've never read the books - and you are a really young kid (or kid at heart) - you might enjoy this sad adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seeker","review":"I found that the purchase was easy and I recieved the movie in a timely maner.

The single most boring, sleep inducing, confusing and silly book ever; the movie was definitely an improvement over the book. I only went to see the movie because Eccleston was in it, not enough, as it turns out, but I enjoyed the movie enough to recommend it to friends and see it again. I keep hearing it compared to the Harry Potter movies, as any movie with children-centered stories will be for quite some time to come, but I admit I didn't notice anything Potter-ish about it, except that it has a young boy as the lead. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Still Have Not Received This Shipment. This Is My Second Time Sending This Message.","review":"I Still Have Not Received This Shipment.

It's all good. This CD provides about an hour of cocktail jazz, background music with an occasional bite to it. Most of the numbers were recorded in London in 1967. Mr. Wilson, who won fame playing piano for Benny Goodman, here is accompanied by Dave Shepherd on the clarinet instead of BG (but then, it's Teddy's turn to be leader!)

See the locks that Master Lock recommends (and their anti-theft guarantee) here:[...]Lesson learned: don't cheap out on a bicycle lock, especially if you have a nice bike. Junkies WILL steal it because cable locks are so easy to cut, and expensive bikes are easy to sell for a quick $20 or $40 in cash. I would give this lock zero stars if I could!!

It fits my D90 and two lenses perfectly, I can also fit in a few other small items. The bag has a little less padding then I expected but works for my casual needs. The velcro closure can be a positive or negative depending on how you look at it; it's like superhero velcro, it takes some muscle to open the bag and it can be a quite loud (so if you need to be stealthy this could be a problem) but I never have to worry that it will come open. There is also a closure clip to really make sure it stays closed. I love the red color and the sporty look, (note to those who are used to having a padded strap this does not have one) it is a messanger type bag made to carry your camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunnign Images","review":"This is a veyr clean looking book of Varga.

Half of these prints are of Vargas' best work. The cover image in particular is one of my favorites; playful and sexy, it's very reminiscent of Veronica Lake. The real charm of a pin-up girl is how fantastical she is--we know she doesn't exist, but we really don't care when she's rendered by the hands of a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was so great! Gia is one of my favorite characters even tho she's pysco. YOu have to read this book. I can totally see how Leslie became Gia and changed everything about herself all for a guy. I would never do that but I know girls at my school who would do something like that. This is a great book for showing you that even if you really like a guy, you shouldn't change everything about yourself to make him like you because if he didn't like you before he probably wont like you changed. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting and thrilling story!","review":"This was one the greatest thrillers!

It is one of the better blues albums I've heard. Going to buy one for my Mom right now, that's how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're joking, right?","review":"BB King is a legendary bluesman, without question.

Yes, you have \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" and \\"Paying The Cost to be The Boss,\\" and even \\"Let the Good Times Roll,\\" but there is so much more.I think the most surprising (and aggravating) omission is \\"How Blue Can You Get,\\" which is one of his signature tunes, and \\"Rock Me Baby\\" which was always one of my personal favorites. All in all, you can simply not truncate a 50-year career into ten songs.BB deserves better than this. You do too.

For example, it is the first one to cover Truste (which is becoming a very popular registration for many Web portals). Its section on affiliate program is particularly refreshing. It also warns against the use of cybermalls by offering several compelling reasons. Now, you don't even hear about cybermalls anymore.The coauthor, Peter Kent, has also co-written the Story on CDNow.

The sound is good and for a movie that was made in 1982 the picture looks extremely rich and beautiful. The only bad thing about the DVD is that it doesn't really have to many special features on it, but that isn't why you should but this. The movie foucuses on Cheech and Chong living in Chicago and working for two Arab brothers (played by Cheech and Chong). When a money deal goes wrong for the Arabs they send Cheech and Chong to take the money to Las Vegas. Overall the movie is very funny, it is probably the second funniest Cheech and Chong movie after Up in Smoke.

I saw this movie at least twice in the past, and it was fun to see again.There are good guys and bad guys in this movie, and Cheech and Chong play both parts.

Only problem is, they leave without any cash for gas along the way, selling off car parts as they go.After the shell of a car is delivered, the Arabs that own the car go hunting for them, looking to kill them.

I highly recommend getting a 1/2 size larger because your toes get scrunched at the front, although the heel fits perfectly. They fit very oddly, so get the 1/2 size larger and use cushions and heel grippers. I spent nearly 30 minutes walking around in the store, debating between my normal 7 1/2 size, or the 8.

To a child, they all come out of viewing the video noticing one another's skin color. For the first time, by and large. My children are mixed race, and they have come home terrified that their father will be assassinated and wondering why their white mommy hates their black daddy. All they remember is that MLK Jr get's his head blown off by a white man.Teach my children how to spell, play dodgeball and basic math skills. Leave it to me to determine when they are old enough to learn that there are people who will judge them based upon the most superficial things, and that prior to 40 years ago, it was legal to do so.

I especially enjoyed the macabre view Mr. Wilson took of several characters from the literature of my childhood. \\"The Sea Was Wet as Wet Could Be\\" seems like the sort of fairy tale the would result from joint writing between Robert Louis Stevenson and Steven King.

The background compositions the editor uses for transitions without dialog and occasionally under dialog. The absence of such music is what distinguishes an \\"English Movie\\" for people my age. It's pleasant music, and occasionally lively as befits the film, but not worth the trouble to buy as a separate CD.The CD \\"You've Got Mail\\" (as opposed to \\"M@il\\" in this title) provides the eclectic mix of vocals from several performers that complement the actors' performances so well in this movie.

While I enjoy it, it is less enjoyable or accessible to American ears than her more recent work like Hagiga (Celebration), Child of Love, or her latest Miss Music.I love her music and Sarit is worth a listen, but I would not start with this album as an introduction to her music. Because she uses middle-eastern styles and vocalizations on most songs, this particular CD can sound odd or out of key to people primarily used to American pop.Try Sarit regardless, but unless you are used to middle-eastern music, start with another of her albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Complex","review":"\\"Effie Briest\\" is an 1895 German novel that is a fine example of artful thinking and worth reading if one can appreciate leisurely detail. Like all good stories, it not only presents an interesting set of events, but comments on life and thrills the reader a little with the mystery of things. The main character is a pleasure-loving and secretive girl who is briefly unfaithful to her gentle but neglectful husband with sad consequences for everyone around her. The entire course of her marriage is described, from her acceptance of the marriage proposal to the misery of her separation from her child and death, but sensational moments (such as her liaison with her lover) are skipped over and attention is given instead to psychological matters that explain the events. The author had read Shakespeare and, like him, presents a theme that keeps appearing in a variety of forms, which makes the thought pleasantly complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effi Briest, a more realist book than Madame Bovary","review":"A very good book which confronts many issues about gender roles and the roles that youth plays in relationships. The characters are more realistic than many of those in such novels as Madame Bovary, which has been declared the prime example of European Realism. Overall a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed look at the German aristocracy","review":"This book has the distinction of having very few characters that's not a member of the German aristocracy. Set in Prussia in the 1870's, it is a story about reactionary aristocrats trying to reconcile with their declining political and social importance in the wake of rising industrialization and sudden unification of the German states.On another level, it is a story of an unhappy marriage and ruinous adultery, written with fastidious details. The pace of the plot is very slow, and Fontane uses no less than half of the book as his exposition to the meat of ths story. Unfortunately, this will turn off a lot of readers, and remains Effi Briest's most glaring shortcoming. But for the more patient readers, this book is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dull","review":"I recently had to read this book for one of my classes and the only thing that grew out of me reading this book was a very deep hate for it. The story itself is very dull, there is very little exitement, some one who might like authors in the like of the Brontes or Austin might enjoy this book, but other than that, it is very hard to get into the story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Beware of ordering the Kindle edition of \\"Effi Briest.\\" It is not the same translation as the Penguin Classic edition, has sections missing, has no introduction and no notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail edition","review":"This \\"edition\\" was literally typed up by hand by someone and NEVER went through spellcheck.

I was NOT happy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without doubt, Zelazny's BEST...","review":"Okay, so I've got a biased view-point. I love Zelazny's work. His \\"Chronicles of Amber\\" series was one of the first science fiction/fantasy works on an \\"adult level\\" that I read (I was maybe 12 at the time), and his twisted, convoluted style of writing had me turning page after page, unable to put the book down.\\"Unicorn Variations\\" represents much of that style. It examines man's failures under pressure, (and ironically) man's ability to perform extrodinary feats under that same pressure. It uses an oft-humuorous touch to describe a serious subject. It draws upon fantasy to explain reality. Get the picture? Rarely does Zelazny ever come right out and say what he means; it's much more fun to keep the reader guessing the whole way through.The version I have of the audio tape is read by Star Trek/Deep Space 9's Odo (Rene something-or-other -- sorry, his last name escapes me at this time); I enjoyed listening to it almost as much as reading the story for myself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good enough","review":"It's not a groundbreaking book, sorry.

I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel","review":"This book is the sequel to \\"Bright Captivity\\", which began the saga of Anne Couper Fraser, her marriage to John Fraser of England, and her years spent in London. This books opens with the return of the Frasers to St. Simons Island. If you are have read other Eugenia Price books, you will be re-acquainted with the McKays of Savannah, the Goulds of St. Simons and others. The Coupers were one of the noble families of the Georgia Coast in the mid-1800's. Anne's life is one of great love and great sorrow. I came to love her as a sister throughout the trilogy. Sometimes I wanted to shake her -- mostly I wanted to sit and have a long talk. You will also enjoy her relationship with her \\"Eve\\", whose devotion to Anne is complete. I highly recommend this book, and the entire Georgia Trilogy, to fans of Eugenia Price and anyone else who enjoys fiction based on real-life people from our past. I hated for the third book to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"luke-warm","review":"This book skips around alot in my opinion. Although Anne has finally gotten John to return to her childhood home and settle down she is very troubled by his restlessness. John on the other hand is plaigued through the entire book with inner conflicts- his love for Anne which keeps him on the island, his immense longing for the military, which he adores, and his hate for having to be a slave owner. These troubles keep up with John and, in my opinion are never really solved. I think Anne and John's immense love for each other is the only thing good about the book. And even that is shattered at the end. I was very disappointed when I finished this book. Some advice-Don't read the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book was a major disappointment. Volume 1 of this series, while somewhat fantastical, was ultimately engaging and left me hanging for this volume.

By the end, you are left simply not caring any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dresser","review":"Was pretty easy to assemble but would suggest having another helper when assembling it.

And after reading (or at least skimming) 30-ish books, this one has proved to be the most helpful and informative by far.Asher's book will not only show how to better figure out what your values are so that you can choose a career to meet all of your \\"threshold needs,\\" but also help you figure out how to conduct an effective job search once you've made your choice.This book is the total package- if you're only going to buy one resource to help with your career choice/job hunt, make it this one!

Unfortunately the rental place only had this piece of drek available. This movie is totally off the mark from the epic story of Exodus as related in the Torah. It seems like a goyisha attempt at making the Israelites look bad. Moshe Rabbeinu was the most humble prophet who spoke directly to Hashem. The portrayal as a maniacal bumbler did not do justice to Moshe at all. Several of the scenes deviated from the Torah including the portions of Yisro and the story of the Golden Calf. It would have been considerate for the screenwriters to have at least consulted a half-way Torah knowledgeable Rabbi about these issues before it tarnished the image of the greatest prophet ever known.I dont recommend this movie to anyone, please steer clear of this trash. It only desecrates the name of the L-rd and leads people astray."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE STINKS. INACCURATE.","review":"THIS MOVIE IS A GARBAGE. MOSES IS A LUNATIC IN THE MOVIE.

IT IS AN ATTACK ON MOSES AND THE FREED ISRAELITES. MOSES NEVER ORDERED THE MURDER OF CHILDREN. IT ACTUALLY SHOWS CHLIDREN BEING STABBED."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: DO NOT BUY","review":"I am surprised that this movie has any positive reviews. We watched it as a family and could not even finish it. The movie totally misses on what Bible says about God, Moses, Israelites. We were grieved to watch this movie.

Indeed, this was well done.The acting, direction, and the script was an absolute abomination from the reference point of any reasonable level of inspection.Now, I know that artistic license is usually taken in the production of such a movie, but if one wants to make a movie that involves some made-up items added to the actual story, then he should at least make it interesting and meaningful.You want to see a good movie?

Cooney is enthralling when she tells a story, but throughout the entire book, I was bored, bored, bored. This book is actually three books in one, and all three were equally dull.

Sensational feel, full of synths, sound generators, hippy vocals, all backed by solid drumming and Rickenbacker bass (Dave Anderson,-whatever happened to him?)-superb line up! A must have for any Hawkwind fan. Forget about the rip-off compilations and live stuff-get this, and the later 'Electric Tepee'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Re-recording Done for the 1996 Remaster :-(","review":"The album was remastered and re-released in 1996, and much of the drum and bass playing was re-recorded, as well as additional vocals added. Three bonus tracks were also included. The merits of the reworkings are debatable; personally I don't like when things are messed with like George Lucas and his mucking with Star Wars, or the use of autotune on Let it Be. I want the original work of art, not the new and improved one. So I think the original 6 track cd or the LP are the ones to search out. The '96 mastering is excellent though, and there are no problems with the music except that it isn't the same music from 1971.This album shows Hawkwind moving away from the folk based sound of their debut to a heavy guitar, SF themed lyrics, spacey electronic sound. In addition, one can see elements of psych, prog, trance, and free jazz. It's quite the witches brew. If you have any interest in psyc/prog/space/stoner/70's rock, this in an essential album."},{"rating":"2","title":"MECHANICAL TRIBAL","review":"VERY HYPNOTIC, ''ADJUST ME'' IS A LITTLE DISJOINTED,STUTTER, THAT INVIGORATES AND MAYBE WE ARE THE MACHINES AND WE NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.BUT THIS IS A WONDERFUL LISTENING EXPERIENCE THE AUDIO GENERATORS HUM OSCILATORS SOOTHE TOO, LIKE HAPPY BEAMMING STAR CRYSTALS.

I am absolutely baffled at the criticism that it is receiving! It is a blend of innocence and sensuality that had me hooked on it from beginning to end. Finished it in an hour! The heroine, Callie does sometimes grate a bit but that is easily forgiven because this so brilliantly written. The sex scenes are steamy,the dialogue is charming and the chemistry between Callie and Micah is explosive. Plus, the secondary characters actually have story, not just there purely because more characters are needed.

The whole romantic aspect of having a bodyguard/protector gets totally trampled by Micah's overbearing, insensitive, arrogant attitude. He, like the book, unfortunately, does not have any redeeming qualities. Don't waste your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please, please..","review":"I am a big Diana Palmer fan but I am getting tired of reading about the same old dowdy dressing, \\"virginal\\" heroines who give timid a bad name. It is unbelievable to me that a woman (Callie)in her twenties could act as if she doesn't have a clue what sex is and in the next breath have feelings for a man who I felt bordered on the abusive end of the totem pole. Micah came off as an arrogant jerk which only made Callie look worse for the wear. I seen no romance or build up in this story at all and it took me a month to read it after putting it down many times in disgust. I hope her newer books hold more promise than the past few she has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"After having read \\"Lord of the Desert\\", which I really loved, I rushed to buy this book.

Eric Froelich, to my knowledge, was a friend of Finkel's and was a very young winner of a WSOP bracelet, and I believe got a slight mention in the book.The author is clearly trying to force a connectin between two things that have enough in common that people automatically assume more than the author says.

I was never a big fan of this group and after giving this cd a listen, i know why, because I feel that their music really wasn't that good. For the most part they were part of the drug culture of the sixties, but their music fails to express the true essence of the era. The doors, traffic, the turtles, the animals and/or the zombies were much better bands whose music captures the culture of the time. Dylan and Melanie were also part of the folk scene but were much more creative than this band. I don't understand why so many people liked this group, i think they were avarage at best.

The Kindle price was < $9when I bought it, so for the price it wasn't too bad of a read.There was one thing, though, that made reading the Kindle edition difficult: there were HUGE spaces between paragraphs. Now, I do have the typesetting on my Kindle one size larger than the font that came pre-set, so this may have had some impact, but it really broke up the flow of the storyline to have a total of 3 paragraphs, each only 1-2 lines/sentences, on one page in many places.

The authors give step by step instructions for one or two DIY projects that will be a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, almost all of these include contact paper, paint, or an incredible imagination.The recommended updates are a little out-dated -- particularly for the kids' rooms. The projects are all very superficial, and while they could be done cheaply, they would always appear to be just that: cheap.

You'll be sweating after 5 minutes of hoisting this thing up in the air. It's messy, leaks, doesn't spray popcorn nearly as well as my old Homax did (and it cost over twice as much), and in my opinion totally NOT worth the money. The little electric air turbine is underpowered for ceilings where you have gravity working against you. Save your $ and get a Homax or Marshalltown if you are spraying popcorn.

Pretty much a piece of crap. Consistency of texture material has to be just about perfect to spray anything decently. Won't spray if a little to thick or to thin. Won't spray premix sand texture (blows back through hopper). Would be darn near impossible to get a uniform texture. I,ve spent many hours trying different things to make this thing work decent only to be wasting my time. I should note that we have 2 truck mounted texture units with about 30-50 thousand invested in each. If you want good consistency hire a pro with this kind of equipment. Probably half of supposedly pro drywallers only use hopper guns or small equipment.They either don't know what consistent texture is or don't care. Needless to say, we stayed with the Homax aerosal.

Get yourself an air compressor, hopper, and some sand paper. My first complaint about this product is the fact that air is forced out the nozzle the moment you turn it on regardless of the trigger. This only smears the plaster all over the wall the moment you spray it on. Secondly, the texture it makes is far from being consistent. In short... if you like things done right and care about detail, I recommend you avoid this product and probably anyone like it.

Some say the consistency of pancake batter, I say even a tad thinner. When you think it's too thin, it's probably about right. Also do yourself a favor and buy a small mixing paddle - $10 will save your arm for the later work of holding this beast when the hopper is full of mud.Also, while spraying, stop every so often and clean out the nozzle of dried mud. Heat from the blown air will cause a 'crust' to form around the nozzle, impeding the spray action.If you follow these few tips, the end result will be very satisfying.Been there, done that, wrote a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I was skeptical when initially buying this cause I didn't think I had the skill to use it.

I used this to spray knockdown on a 9x12 room and it worked perfect. I read most of the reviews posted on here and felt fairly comfortable doing the job. I definitely agree about ensuring the whole room is covered before spraying it. My mixture was a little thicker than people suggested but it still turned out great. Make sure you lay plastic on the floor and tape and weight it down. Mine kept coming up. Wear a pair of old shoes and safety glasses. If your doing the ceiling, a lot will get on the floor and cause your feet to stick to the plastic. I will be doing the rest of my house with this gun. Prep time takes the most. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool for DIY","review":"This is an easy-to-use and inexpensive tool for homeowners to do texturing on walls before painting. Use pre-mixed joint compound and add water, some say to pancake batter consistency but even a little thinner seems to work better for me. I used a \\"knock-down\\" knife (like a wide putty knife) to lightly skim across the surface before it dried, in order to make the overall texture less \\"lumpy\\" and more consistent looking. It seems to work better if you fill the hopper up fully rather than half full. Practice a few times on a cardboard box before spraying your walls, varying how much \\"throttle\\" you give it, the distance to the target, and the lightness or heaviness of cover. The only thing I wish they had was a nozzle with even a little finer texturing. But overall, it is a really good tool and I'm quite satisfied with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great texture gun","review":"What you do not see in the picture of this sprayer is the motor comes off and will twist and lock back on. It breaks down to 3 parts. Motor, Sprayer body, and of course Hopper. This makes cleaning after use a breeze. I use a garden hose and will have mine clean in 5 minutes, looking just like new. The hopper has handgrips and may be turned from wall to ceiling use while full. If you are not use to holding 25 pounds out the weight is a factor but most of the weight is the filled hopper. Bright side, once you have completed texturing your ceiling your biceps will be strong enough to flip a VW bug. All in all it works great, makes its own air and uses only 3.5 amps to do this.

Finally broke down and bought the Wagner to do some work in a friend's kitchen. I was happily surprised by the performance of this product. As with any texture sprayer it is extremely important that the mixture is of the correct consistency for it to work properly. I suggest anyone who had poor results also had a poor mixture. Test your mixture by pouring the hopper half full over a bucket and see how the product runs through it. Too fast and it's too thin, too slow or not any and you guessed it, too thick. Like anything it takes a little experience. One useful tip I learned on this particular forum is to not buy the small bags of texture close to where the sprayer is sold. Go to the drywall area and buy a large bag, it seems to be better stuff. I don't use a texture sprayer all that often but I will still be money ahead if I had to rent one a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product but there was a surprise in the package!","review":"I love the product, great taste with great value.

Also, what's with the blurry double images and the spinning around the room camera shots? It's so bad it makes you want to puke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Category 7 End of The World","review":"This movie is good I liked it but there is one thing wrong with it the ending is cut short the last thing that you see is the Torch ofThe Statue of Liberty coming down on two people and that is it.

The characters all talked in stock \\"pithy\\" dialogue which is not how normal people speak to one another - it wasn't even clever pithy dialogue. Secondly, it took more than half of the book get any sort of plot going - mostly the characters rode around in the duck boat and met up with other deliberately whimsical characters who served no story purpose whatsoever.

Unless you have monster hands, you're going to find them too big to be useful. Also, if you get two uses out of it like I do, you're going to need a back-up pair as it only comes with one set.

I'm determined to finish it no matter what - but I have to say that the way it is written makes that really difficult. I was drawn to the book by it's subject matter, however as I go through the pages I feel that Clea focuses entirely too much on her relationship with her team mates and I just get a small glimpse into the lives of the victims she excavates. By the end of each chapter I know more about what she ate that day, the condition of the place she slept in and what the team morale was than I do about the circumstances of the genocide and the victims.

The 10Mbps only limits your connectivity option wether or not you NEED the speed or not. For instance, you might have a 100Mbps only hub, or a 10Mbps device might make your 100Mbps segment less efficient. Also, this device is not Windows 2000 compliant which makes it useless in my organization.

Unlike the punk of its time, Buzzcocks embraced the love song with gusto, as on the classic Ever Fallen In Love. Just Lust is quite a tour de force, and Sixteen Again is a catchy little number with intelligent lyrics. I love Walking Distance's chiming guitars, while Love Is Lies with its prominent acoustic guitar is an engaging bittersweet love song. Late For The Train with its strong guitar onslaught sees tham going heavy on a rousing instrumental conclusion. This a brilliant album of melodic powerpop that impresses also with its literate and poetic lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"free electric band a great album","review":"I don't know why this album gets so little attention.

Every song on FEB is a winner - I can't speak for Southern California,and to be frank have never particularly gotten into any of Albert Hammond's music other than FEB.

Nothing really wrong with it. So why didn't I give it five stars instead of four?? Because there's a wee bit of oomph or something else I can't put my finger on missing that just doesn't take it all the way up to the Louis Armstrong or Sidney Bechet level.

They can sit for weeks without going dead but a Duracell or Energizer will be dead in 1-2 wks.without use. Some will be completely dead in 1 wk. I also have had some name brands stop charging in a short period of time causing charger to flash showing defective batt. but have not had any Chicago Elec. do this yet. I have a 15 min.

There are no leaks and no apparent damage, yet these batteries will no longer charge and even after a full charge cycle, the power output is not even sufficient to power my flash. Checking them with a battery tester indicates the power level at just half the level of a full charge, rendering these defective batteries useless.I should mention that I advised Energizer via a cordial message. Assuming it's rare for relatively new batteries to fail, I provided the manufacturing lot identifier and offered to send the batteries to them for testing. But, no, they didn't ask for the batteries.

At first I thought the reason why, after charging the batteries a couple days before, the first pair was at mid charge while the spare batteries could not even turn my camera on, was due to using a Sony charger. After that I bought an Energizer charger with another four batteries.Guess what? the same thing.

If I use one-time non-rechargeable batteries, it lasts 30+ hours. This is a big surprise to me because I have to recharge these batteries every 3-4 days in the Energizer charger for at least 4 hours and it is very inconvenient.

I will say that the second charging did better in the camera, but the optimal mouse eats them like candy. They won't last more than a day in my mouse, and that is after the third charging now.Save your money. I recommend you purchase the lithium batteries more than these.

Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times. I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part. It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.

But as the months went by, the drain cycle got shorter and shorter. Now, I'm at the point where a fully charged set of AAs, will drain themselves completely empty sitting on the shelf, in less than 1 day. They will not hold a charge. While being used, they won't last more than 2 hours now....compared to 20+ hours when new. From my experince, these batteries cost WAY too much to have such a short lifespan. I will not buy more.

The abstract, almost expressionist staging is stripped away in favor of an unfortunately literal reading of the characters' claim to be ghosts. Much of the meat of the play, including virtuall all of the depictions of the culture of the physicists in Copenhagen is absent. The play's wandering and fruitless searching becomes an overly direct beeline to Frayn's eventual conclusions. These cuts are especially inexcusable considering that Copehagen is far from a long play.All of which is a huge pity. As I said, I firmly believe Copenhagen to be among the greatest plays of the 20th century. But this is a woefully inadequate adapation, and it's downright criminal that it's the only filmic adaptation we have. One can only hope that a better one will come along some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pseudo-live feel","review":"\\"Cliff\\" is great. The album is recorded with a live audience, but the album has a studio feel to it. I thought it was a great concept. Every track is listenable. \\"Cliff Sings\\" is alright.

This means, instead of the rough & tumble action of fighting cars, they just race around the track in a line on a preset path. Its not fun.

I expected the same fun of crashing and racing but either the graphics hardware on the ds is sorely lacking, or the programmers shipped the game way too early because I've given up on the game after two plays.A key component of Burnout is the matrix-style bullet time slow motion after a crash, when you do \\"aftertouch\\" crashes into other cars for points. On the xbox, this is an amazing slow motion spiralling camera sequence, but on the ds, my car would either not move at all (while magically crashing into others) or just jump from one location to the next.The slow motion aftertouch stuff is key for the crash sequences, when you have to bounce off one car to hit others.

It surveys the relevant research and combines it with many practical examples to demonstrate its relevance. The abundant case studies serve to drive home each major point.

Given the fact that mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructurings are now an international phenomena, we need a book which covers the topic from such a focus rather than just focusing on a U.S.-oriented treatment.The other major advantage of this book over other merger books is its chapters on valuation.

I've never heard of \\"Crunchy Granola Suite\\", and it never really charted either. The title even sounds dumb and it was on the flip side of the song \\"Stones\\" which charted #14 in 1971. If they would put \\"Walk on Water/Theme\\" (#17) from 1972 instead of \\"Crunchy Granola Suite\\", this would have been a perfect MCA collection for Neil Diamond.I can see now why people just download individual songs to just make their own interpretation of someone's most essential songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Neil","review":"This has a nice mix of Neil Diamond songs, especially good for those who don't like everything he has done but prefer select tunes.

I installed Logitech software but it turns out to not detect the joystick. SO, Windows 7 can use it fine with the built in drivers and calibration works, so I'd recommend against the Logitech software.This is wireless, and has it's own USB dongle - it doesn't use the universal USB dongle.

I am on my second joystick now because the first one lost two buttons to failure and the twist jumped around all over the place making my jet fighter fly really poorly.

In fact, the group Sea Level started when the piano player from the Allman band left to get into jazz fusion.

From the production quality to the historical content, this disc is a full blown keeper!! Take it from someone who's banged his head to these brutal Brits since he was only twelve. If you fancy yourself a fan, buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed. I cannot wait until the next installment of this series hits the shelves. This disc made it all the more clear that it'll take a lot more than the abuse these guys suffered at Ozzfest in California this year to put them down for the count. The beast that is Maiden is a class act that just won't quit! Up the Irons!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for all musicians","review":"It is very impressive how determined the boys were back in the day and what they have achieved.

I got into Maiden about 1982 (when Bruce came aboard) but I always thought Paul had something great about him.

Ellen Sandbeck gives the readers some attention-grabbing headings, which lead the readers to her informative information. Being homemaker, gardener, and graphic designer, Ellen Sandbeck is experienced in the know how of what works and doesn't work in our homes and gardens. She tells us how to use the right things in the correct method. She gives us up to date statistics and tells the truth about the chemicals we use in our homes and gardens to fight everyday common problems.I loved the way she captured my attention with these captions: Explode Cockroaches with baking soda and sugar; Petrify a mouse with a plaster of Paris cocktail! Honestly, this one is a keeper and I highly recommend you buy it. It's will be money well spent! Brenda @ MyShelf.Com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ox","review":"Wow. First off, El-p's production on here is nuts, matter of fact this has to be the best produced album of the year so far. I have never heard such drum placement like on \\"rasberry fields\\", and the production on \\"iron galaxy\\" is amazing as well. Let's not forget Vast and Vordul. Both paint vivid images of the hard city life in NY, as well as \\"soaring above higher things\\" (check pigeon, and the classic bonus cut, phoenix.)

Its too nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Bites - Razor Sharp.","review":"Another fine example of how Hip Hop is rapidly replacing Rock as the de facto mouthpiece of contemporary life. \\"The Cold Vein\\" conveys the usual barrage of lyrical insight, ably supported by hard-edged synth instrumentation that revisits our current infatuation with '80s pop with a newfound clarity. Smart production techniques achieve a simultaneous technological and organic feel, providing the ideal backdrop for a lyrical grappling with the realities of urban existence. As real as your life, as vivid as your nightmares - \\"The Cold Vein\\" is essential listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE..ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE","review":"Wow!! This album is out of this world. The production is flawless, and the most unique that I have ever heard. The lyrics range from street battle raps to sci-fi fantasy. Incredible word play and great metaphors. Very impressive vocabulary. But the beats just are beyond words. I can not tell you how good this album is, you gotta just go out and pick it up. This is a must have for all the undeground heads, but I recommend it to anyone that likes great music and great lyrics.

I bought it for my office where it doesn't get much use (until after business hours). I am constantly fighting with static and station reception and have had to hang the antenna wires all over everything for a clear signal. Now, at about 8 months, the CD player has completely stopped working. This unit no longer reads, recognizes or plays any CD's not matter what I do. So, now I own a nice looking, static playing radio that if you're not careful will trip you up in it's antenna wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I received this stereo as a gift a few years ago. We rarely use it because:-The remote stopped working after a month-Radio reception is poor-CD's skip constantly or there is the \\"No Disk\\" error-Volume #2 is way too loud for quiet meals or falling asleep to ( we've moved with it may times) and volume #1 sounds like it is no longer playing in stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"you don't even get what you pay for","review":"This unit is not very good at all. I purchased it because of the sleek design and fact that you could hang it on the wall. This system is only 10 watts. If you are a casual radio listener and don't have to crank it up, then 10 watts may be enough player. The CD player skips a lot. It doesn't handle slightly scratched cds well. It will freeze up and stop if you try to scan through the tracks too quickly. I've continually had a problem with the remote. The power button on the remote does not work. And of course my unit is just over a year old, right out of warranty. I've changed the battery on the remote already. A new remote off the site costs $45. I paid only $80 for the system. Save your money and do not buy this system. You will not be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless in the dark...","review":"Great look, good sound - so if you are just using this as a radio and/or CD player then fine. But I was trying to use it also as my nightstand CD/Clock Radio - but the clock is only displayed when the unit is in \\"Standby Mode\\", which is fine, but in Standby Mode, the blue LED light turns off, so using this unit as a CD/clock radio is pointless. You can't see the clock unless it is daytime or you have a light on in the room, so what's the point of having a clock on this unit. Stupid flaw. Tried to talke to the 888-Philips helpdesk - their even more useless and stupid. Like talking to a bring wall.

During the time it was working it did very well. Sound quality was very good, it is easy to operate, size is very convenient, I was quite happy with the MC235. Unfortunately I now have a monophonic unit. Apparantly the right stereo channel is not working. This unit was only used for a few hours daily. Consequently I must now send the unit off for repair.

On top of that the nearly microscopic screen at the top came broken, it only displayed portions of the track numbers & time which drove me nuts. I couldn't get the AM/FM player to work at all, even after bringing it in to Circuit City and getting another one.The look is gorgeous & its very compact which makes great for storage or lack of space, but its embarrasingly awful.

Well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"I bought this unit despite the warnings about cd playback, what a mistake! the first 2 cds into the bay came straight out of their celophane (never played before) and they skipped.

What a waste of time. I have noticed that some big chain electronic stores have quit carrying this model; no wonder. Another cheap piece of crap which is more trouble than it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 years later...you get what you pay for.","review":"We got this unit 4 years ago. The antenna does not work very well, never did (we like to listen the radio). The cd works but a lot of disks that play fine in the new truck skip on this unit. We don't use the remote feature. The sound is quit decent and has a couple of preset modes like \\"jazz\\" \\"rock\\" etc. The mounting hardware was terrible, had to rig it so that could be mounted. Weird. It is not \\"thin \\"like they show in the photos, it is about 4\\" deep. The speaker wire is very short, so had to splice on longer wire. The speakers do not have a way to hang them, so I rig them by attaching a hook and hung them from the ceiling. But it still works after 4 years so I guess its ok.

Sound is solid, and although bass and treble adjustments are limited to several factory preset mixes, one of the presets seems to work well for everything from talk radio, to jazz, to classical, or rock.The product looks more expensive than it is, with a rich precision finish that is quite striking. My only real complaint is the LCD display is quite small and hard to read when not illuminated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should actually cost more!","review":"I still can't believe what a great system this is - especially for the price! Everything about this unit is great! The sound quality is VERY good - can go loud and stays crystal clear. Speakers can be attached or set apart. Can program up to 40 radio channels in memory, has a sleep function. Great little remote (comes with the battery) that works from almost every angle so you don't have to be exactly in front of it.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sexy Flat Stereo","review":"This is a great piece of stereo system I have ever owned.

It works great right now and that's all that is important. The electric powered door looks strong enough as long as you don't hit it or push it with your hand.The Aux-in works great.

Where can I get this kind of information? Is anything written - in English?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major letdown.","review":"I've now read 3 books by Caitlin. The first, Silk, was a blurry, scattered mess. It was also her first book, and read like it. The one I had recommended to me was Daughter of the Hounds. I read that, and it was so good, I even thought about giving Silk a little more leeway. Then I read Threshold.It starts out favorably enough. It keeps on going steadily, sometimes more interesting, sometimes less, but mostly building up tension towards what seems more and more like a good payoff.Then, in either a lack of ideas on how to end the story, or in a desire to be really ambiguous (I would vote the first one), it descends into surrealist nonsense. Some of the earlier story makes little sense, and some of it is actually cringe inducing. Then, it ends. Just like that. No explanations. No resolution. Just a vague attempt at implying that something important happened. I felt cheated. I spent my time, and invested my interest, in a book that ended up going nowhere and wasting my time"},{"rating":"1","title":"some stories never end","review":"When I ordered this book I was quite looking forward to what sounding like a very interesting read. Then the book came and I read it. Even if you don't mind the constant present-tense (which I am not comfortable with) there is still the major drawback that it essentially doesn't end. After 240 or so pages of build-up it appears that some form of time travel is used to negate 90% of the story leaving the central problem untouched. The characters tended to be rather shallow, the story its self was haphazard at best and the ending highly unsatisfying. I would only recommend this book if you have no other option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really brilliant","review":"As a fan of almost everything else that Caitlin Kiernan has written, I have to say that Threshold absolutely did not disappoint. Her writing is crisp and powerful, her characters astoundingly poignant, and this is one wonderfully scary novel. Few horror writers today have such a superb command of the English language, and fewer of them write such intelligent books. The ending left me breathless. I cannot praise this work highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gothic Gem","review":"Anyone who believes American literature is in any way in decline must be looking in the wrong places.

With Threshold, Caitlin Kiernan puts my fears to rest, by delivering a second novel that is in fact far better than her exquisite, award-winning first novel Silk. In many ways, Threshold is a much more traditional horror novel, alluding to the works of such past masters as H. P. Lovecraft and Ramsey Campbell, yet the book stays true to Kiernan's affection for characterization and stunning prose. This book is a triumph and a must read for any horror fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiernan's Best Yet","review":"I was very impressed with Caitlin Kiernan's second novel. It is a worthy successor to Silk, though it's a much more fast-paced book. Threshold reads a little like an M. Night Shamalyan movie written by H. P. Lovecraft, it's that powerful and that weird. I do not hesitate to recommend this as one of the finest works of supernatural horror in a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Dated","review":"A rather dated look at Japan's JET Programme.

But dont get me wrong, thats the only thing thats missing. This one is another fun adventure in time. This film is said to have a complicated plot, it does but if you pay attention its not to complictated. This film takes from Part 1's end in 1985 to 2015 to a hellish 1985 and then back to 1955 to try to fix the future. Its fun and like the first has a great design, with all the different times.

Not only did it lack the humor and heart that made the first movie so great, but the ending simply recycled the climax of part one, which I thought was one of the most suspensful moments in movie history. Also, Leonard Maltin said it had ' considerable inginuity ' HA! The future hill valley is a rip-off of blade runner, the awesome way the wheels on the De Lorean flip up is another bit of recycled footage, and the jigsaw-like plot will turn your brains to pudding.

The thing is that the movie, although being good is 143 minutes, over 2 hours and it does seem longer if you watch all at once. Some great things are done in this film, it is truly amazing how they did this film. Both beginnings of part 2 and 3 were shot during the filming of the first movie, because Zemeckis always had a trilogy planned, that takes a lot of guts and talent because something could of happened to Michael J.

Here in Brazil these 3 movies, released in VHS versions, are still rented a lot and they have recently been re-released in VHS versions. I've bought all three movies, but I'd rather have them all in DVD, even better, in a single DVD combo (all 3 in one single DVD). Well, I hope it happens someday.

It's bad, with just awful loser characters and a plot so thick and confusing that it's like trying to walk in pudding up to your knees. It's a foggy plot with too many twists and inventions to be enjoyable. It truly is a generic sequel, with bad effects, bad acting, bad directing, and a hopeless screenplay. It's as if the filmmakers just kept adding and adding to the hopeless story without any rhyme or reason. It's boring too. Nothing at all is appealing in this film.

I cannot believe they use this book in a sophomore or junior level class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I use this book as the standard text of my RF course at Cornell. Honestly, this book is only for casual reading.Though it covers many topics, but all of them lack in details. For instance, it use 10 pages to explain class A and B amplifier. After reading that 10 pages, I still didn't understand why they are named class A and B. While dealing with modulation, no mathematical details is provided (Does the author assume that we already understand that?) After all, I don't feel this book to be a textbook. The way it treats RF is like a computer magazine treats computer architecture. You learn there are CPU and RAM in a computer from the magazine, but you never learn how to build a CPU or RAM. You can't even learn how to build a full bit adder from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"broad, but not deep.","review":"I used this book when I took the RF Circuit Design class at Cornell. The experience with this book was devastating. It did not give me any good detail of any single RF circuit. I am not sure what kind of background the author expected, but I am sure that this book is not a good choice for a beginner. And if you got a Ph.D. in RF design, why do you wanna read a magazine version of an RF design?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, its that bad","review":"This is the second book I have ever reviewed, and only the second book I have felt the need to. You look over the reviews some good some bad, and think, hey I'll try it out. Well let me tell you don't. The book just has no real coherence. It has horrible illegible graphs, no schematics of circuits it actually talks about, and no explanations of the circuits it discusses. It is more a useful tidbit book, if you already knew everything in the book, it might give you a little extra. But man, the amount of information given is near zero if you don't know what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio-Frequency Electronics","review":"It seems that the author trying to show how knowledgeable he is on the subject RF electronics. But on a reader or a student's point of view, I had learnt little from this book. The book gave only superficial views, although it covers a wide area of subjects of RF. It's not a good book for students. So don't buy this book, buy others. Or even a dictionary of electronics would give you more things to learn about RF electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst textbook ever","review":"This is the worst textbook that I've ever read. It has totally utterly destroyed my interest in radio frequency circuits. If you do not have a doctorate in this area, then you shouldn't even consider this book. It doesn't explain a lot of stuff and most of the time you become more confused after reading this book. Avoid it like plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to add to your library","review":"Found this book very easy to read and enjoy.

I didn't want to go on a fad diet, and I wanted to read something in an interesting format. This book teaches you to eat healthy for life and most importantly it helps you understand portion sizes. Unlike so many fad diets, it gives you the knowledge you need to make wise choices in the real world of food and drink (what to do when faced w/a plate of cookies?).The format is easy to read and understand. Again, I am not a teenager, but a young Mom. It has helped me already lose 1/3 of my goal post-baby weight. It teaches you to eat healthy, eat healthy amounts, and have a healthy lifestyle (excercise, etc). I love the fact that it has several pages that give actual sized, color examples of the serving size of pizza, muffin, fruit, mac and cheese, etc. I have definitly used the pizza cut out several times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book about being heathy/fit for teenage girls!!","review":"I bought this book for my 15 year old that was trying to get fit and eat healthier. She read the whole book in 1 night and she actually taught me some stuff. She has been following the book for almost 3 weeks now and I love it. She has learned about portion control and how many of each food group she should consume a day and it's about being fit!!It's a lifestyle. I could tell her stuff until I was blue in the face but this book was key for us. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iv'e read better","review":"This book was pretty interesting and i liked the talk about how we should love our bodies. The only problem was that some of the information was off. The BMI charts were not accurate and did more harm than good. Also, the recipes were not as good and just didn't make much sense. I really did not learn anything from the book. It says it is okay for someone who doesn't want to lose weight and just wants to be healthy, but that didn't seem to be the case. It all seemed to be about weight loss and not so much as just being healthy and maintaining a solid weight. All in all, I was not particularly pleased with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I don't live in LA","review":"While reading this book I'll admit I got a bit excited. But when you get down to it, they really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. I felt the diet plan was very \\"LA-esque,\\" the requirements of which I couldn't always meet in my NYC suburb. On top of that, a lot of their meal suggestions go against the new and updated food pyramid, and many of their recipes have A LOT of fat in them. Bottom line, there are better choices out there to learn how to eat healthily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I purchased for my daughter, it is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone.

This one has magic as a theme, with a human hostless Spectre going all medieval on a whole pile of magic users arses, seeing them as corrupt and bad. He is looking at bringing in a new age of magic.It is up to a motley band, The Shadowpact, ,to try and stop him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the magic?","review":"Where is the magic? This book is less about mysticism and magic and more about comic talking monkeys. It reads like Friend's episode! David Blaine offers 10x more magic than this universe. Even Marvel comes closer to touching the magic with Dr. Strange than this poorly thought out drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logic would help","review":"I read this because it was a Prelude to Infinite Crisis, but the story defies logic. The Spectre is known in the DC Universe as the spirit of Vengeance. He is all-powerful, and can see into your soul and view the evil person you are. So it defies logic that he decides to destroy all magic because Eclipso (the very definition of evil) tells him to.In truth, I never really understood why Eclipso wanted to destroy magic...other than to create chaos. I enjoyed reading about some of the lesser characters in the DC magical universe, and for me that includes the wizard Shazam and Captain Marvel. But the book is light on understanding those characters, and the ending definitely leaves you with little understanding as to what has just ocurred.I have not yet read Infinite Crisis, so maybe in retrospect it will make more sense. Unfortunately, I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horny Spectre","review":"I had high hopes for this series. I am a big fan of God's Wrath, but to make the Spectre a horny nut in 2 panels? and then go buck wild and destroy all magic without much reasoning in an instant was ludacris. I understand that the Spectre without a host is pretty much untamed, and that the human host is what helped him make judgments, but come on.....Eclipso took a female form and made Spectre go crazy once aroused. The only thing saving this book was a chimpanzee.....shows how exciting this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts out.","review":"This seemed to be really cool, but ever so often the sound cuts out from anywhere from 1-6 seconds at a time.

It works really well for recording lectures in a large lecture hall.

I opened the box, plugged it into my iPod and started recording. Then plugged in the USB cable, let it sync with iTunes and my recordings were imported into my library.Good quality sound, too.

No discernable distortion so far.Haven't yet tested it in a larger group setting or for recording a full band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for memos","review":"This item is for memos and recording conversations in fairly quiet environments with great quality.

I can record them directly onto my iPod! I used it for a few lectures, playback was totaly fine, and I was satisfied. Then, all of a sudden, my iPod (30G Video Black) completely died! It was an old iPod, so I gave the Belkin device the benefit of the doubt and bought a new 30G iPod Video Black on eBay. Started using the device with my newly purchased iPod, recorded a few lectures, and then BAM! The same exact thing happened to that iPod! It was then that I discovered that the Belkin was the problem, not the iPod, and I threw this piece of trash out and bought a digital recording device separate from any iPod. This is so typical of Apple products. They are such a proprietary organization. They only want Apple products to be used in conjunction with their Apple products. Try to use any third party application with any Apple product and the whole thing goes up in flames."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Microphone with auto-gain","review":"This is one of the best add-ons to the iPod that I've used.

And when you are trying to record music that can get annoying because sometimes it skips right at a part you really wanted to listen to.

It has exceeded my expectations. I began by recording a song and a rythem track to practice leads with. When I linked the I-opod to the computer they downloaded. I then could practice with the i-pod, the computer speakers, or burn to CD. Using Garage band I was able to edit and multi-track.All recording is push button sipmle. I have used it to record a wedding, concerts (with the musicians permission), and lectures in addition to recording guitar and voice for practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power hog","review":"I bought this recorder module for the purpose of recording classes at a music symposium I attended this month. There were 5 daily classes from 9:00 - 5:30. I was surprised on the first day to see the iPod shut down halfway through the first class with a drained battery. I assumed that I hadn't charged the iPod fully, plugged it in during dinner and prepared for the next day. Sure enough, after less than 2 hours my battery was dead again. I went out during dinner and purchased an Olympus solid-state recorder which lasted the final 3 days on a single AAA battery, including recording all the evening sessions typically lasting into the wee hours of the morning.If you have short things to record, this is a nice option, but it's hard to justify when my Olympus recorder weighs LESS and lasts FAR longer with no hard drive noise. My only complaint about the Olympus is that it records in WMA format which needs to be converted to play on iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"either defective or bad design, soon to know which","review":"Pro's: the quality of the recording is very good. I bought it to record meetings and it does a good job at that.Con's: Max hour and a quarter recording time. Unit did not save the recording before the battery went dead. Would not charge while recording, even though it was sync'd with computer. Also, without the unit attached to the iPod, there doesn't seem to navigate to the stored files to listen to them.Belkin service turned out to great. I had bought this on ebay, had no receipt, they didn't care, authorized an exchange for a new one. I will followup this review to say whether it was the particular unit that was defective, or just a lousy design."},{"rating":"2","title":"microphone is excellent, iPod skips","review":"Every so often, you lose some time in the recording. Some Googling indicates that this is a problem with the iPod, not the microphone, so maybe it'll be fixed in some future update of the firmware. To give an extent of the problem, a 58 minute recording only turned out to be 52 minutes.However, the quality of recording was excellent, and I will find it very useful despite the skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Recording Quality","review":"As a classically trained musician, I tried several different means to easily record rehearsals and practice to augment my feedback. I was excited about this option, particularly because of it's extreme portability. The recording quality was sufficient for my needs (practice, not performances), but after a few months it stopped working properly. It would skip a second or two of the recording, often at inopportune places. Though, I see now, if I had read other reviews I would have been alerted to the possibility of this problem!Perhaps, mine was a fluke. As I purchased the item after using a colleague's with great success. Eventually, however, I tried another product and have been satisfied with a slightly less portable option. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception & not very durable","review":"Title says it all - reception wasn't that great.

I bought it to replace my Griffin iTalk, which I lost and is really hard to find for my older model iPod.

He let me play with it and we tested it by playing music on youtube and taking a cable from speaker out on the PC and speaker in on the Belkin. I was amazed at the quality. It was as if we did a digital download of the song. He takes this to class and says that he had no problems recording lectures to review later. It makes a file and labels it for easy sorting. This has been a good solution instead of a hole new recording device. Since he carries his IPOD everywhere he is able to listen on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage poorly made","review":"Within 15 minutes of attaching the tune talk, while trying to adjust the gain the little plastic widget fell right out of the tune talk thingy.

I then bought one online, and have loved it. It is very easy to plug into the bottom of your iPod and it automatically opens everything you need to start recording. I love not having to install more software. The sound files also easily transfer to your iTunes to listen to, upload, etc. When the person being recorded is in close range, the sound quality is pretty good.

I am so happy with this product! It is much better than having a separate hand-held recording device. I don't have to carry anything other than my iPod...And, best of all, all of the recordings, voice or music, are stored right into iTunes and they can be easily transferred onto my PC, where I can sinc them into my iTunes library on my desktop or send the files via email.

It reminds me of His Name is Alive, but with an artistic sense that is more rooted in nature than in synthesizers. The songs differ from each other, while sharing the same somber theme. Think: a lo-fi version of Dead Can Dance with a better sense of understated melody. I just stumbled across the thing. If you're listening, I like Your Honor, with the bell percussion, the best. Second, Feed a Fire gives you Jerwa's voice overdubbed in interesting ways during the chorus. Each song on the album includes some inventive component.

Leigh lived too short to get acknowledged for his ideas. Instead designers like Westwood, Gaultier and van Beirendonck use his ideas.

I put her name on the side along with a poodle and the fuzzy dice and the records and the music signs. It was so much fun to design it myself for her. She absolutely loved her very own pink car.

It has a really wide turning radius and you need a driveway to be able to turn it around.

She is a little too short to pedal it herself yet, but she loves sitting in it. The one thing I am disappointed with is the decal package. They only include two of each letter of the alphabet (no lower case letters). This was not enough to spell my daughter's entire name. I called In-Step to inquire about purchasing an additional decal sheet. I was told that it would cost $10 (including S&H). I thought this was a little expensive for a sheet of stickers, especially since I only needed a total of 3 letters. So, we opted to abbreviate her name (and still only had enough letters to do it on one side). Also, when the car arrived it was missing three of the wheels. Rather than go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon, my dad opted to call In-Step. They sent out the missing wheels which we received two days later. So, it proved not to be a major problem, but still kind of a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"ERIC STUART BAND - BOMBSHELLSHOCKED","review":"Praised early on by rock legend Peter Frampton - who also produced his 2001 album Blue, Dressed In Black-NYC singer-songwriter Eric Stuart has finally released his long awaited new album. Packed with ten powerful tracks, the release of BombShellShocked on the newly established RevUp Records is clearly among the major CD releases of 2003. A winner of the coveted John Lennon Songwriting Award, Stuart stakes out a unique musical terrain of his own BombShellShocked.

Being Mexican American seems like it's always harder just as Richard witnessed as he was growing up. The reason I feel this is true is because if one is mixed with American they have to please the Americans as well as their family backrground. This is why Richard believed that he was American as he was growing up, but he wouldn't discriminate any other ethnic background.

Linz does a good job ofmaking this potentially dry topic accessible by introducingthe least amount of formalism necessary to further thesubject at hand. Math purists will bristle at his 'outlines'of proofs, but students who are interested more in gettingthe concepts will appreciate the light style.

I have a test coming up next week and I can't believe I find myself searching for another textbook or study guide to help me understanding automata. If I knew this book doesn't fit me, even if it's required, I wouldn't have bought it. Because class is basically based on notes, not the textbook.

More explanation in English of what is going on would also help the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Textbook","review":"This is an excellent book on a subject that I find very interesting. I think the problem some people have with this subject is the level of abstraction and rigor as well as the fact that in advanced theoretical computer science (as in mathematics and formal logic) one must formally justify their assertions. This separates the programmer from the researcher. Unfortunatley, the class I took had mostly undergrads who were either not motivated or just not interested in this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"The book was required for a course, and I found it to be pretty straightforward, if a little dull. It's written at a simpler level than Sipser or Hopcroft and Ullman, which might make it appropriate for someone who is a little apprehensive about the topic (although I think both of those are better books). My biggest complaint was that after finding the first two errors in the text (in an exercise solution and an example), I wasn't comfortable trusting the book to tell me what it meant. The errors were listed in the errata, so if you're using the book, print out a copy of the errata, and mark your book up.

I urge teachers and students to avoid this book. If you would like a great book covering this material, get Dexter Kozen's Automata and Computability. That book is so well written and elegant that it puts most of the other books to shame. It is one of the top CS books on my list along with SICP, CLRS, and a few others.

Don't think that this is the only answer like this, most of the answers in the manual are similar. No one even knows who the author's audience is...

I have a nagging feeling that the book was simply too advanced for several, though not necessarily all, of the reviewers.Look, most undergraduate computer science majors might not need a book as formal as this one. It really is best suited for computer scientists with a strong maths inclination. Many CS students study specific languages, some algorithms, and [hopefully] the hardware of an abstract Neumann machine.But concepts like the left quotient of a language are really only used by those who want a grand view across all computing languages. And who possibly want to design a new language. This is beyond the capabilities of most CS majors. And so is this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a text","review":"I am not an instructor in the course, like some of the other reviewers. I am actually a student working at an undergraduate level, as a Computer Science major. The poor explanations with the sectional exercises prompted me to write the review.In my honest opinion, the book is poor. It seems like it rushed for publication. Not only are the explanations poor, but the solutions for the in-book exercises are as well. I mention this, since all of my homework is lifted from this text. The book lists back-of-the-book solutions. Sometimes it will list solutions for the wrong problems. Other times it will have incorrect solutions (especially with grammar productions.)My advice is to avoid the text. If it is required reading for the course, then look for a used copy at best to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Paperweight","review":"Like many reviewers, I too had to buy this book for a cs class. It is one of the most worthless books I've ever owned. The treatment of the material was flimsy at best.

Most of the examples are easy, but the homework exercises are cryptic and difficult. It would have been helpful to include some difficult problems in the examples as well.

Fans must've rejoiced when he got the part of Perry Mason.Perry Mason was one of the best crafted television shows ever. For Paramount to release this \\"50th Annniversary Edition\\" with drips and drabs of episodes from various seasons is tantamount ot defacing artwork at the Louvre!

I thought that maybe Paramount was trying to pull a \\"cheap one\\" by giving us a release that provided some of the remaining episodes that were published on VHS and DVD by Columbia House, but I found only three of these episodes were previously released by Columbia House. So they have taken the time and expense to release 9 episodes heretofore not yet released. Why not just continue with Season Three?!!!

That said, I could forgive them if they would release the regular seasons a little more quickly. Season 3 is long overdue. By the time they get to Season 4 DVD players will probably be obsolete. If they keep it up I might do what I did for the Gunsmoke series. I got so fed up with waiting for them, I stopped buying them and just rent them from Netflix when they come out.

So I was ecstatic when it began being released on DVD.But can't we just get on with releasing the series in serial order? Please. Don't encourage this cash-tease tactic by buying this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please release all the Seasons","review":"Please release all the seasons before I lack the money or mental capacity to enjoy them.This pricing - dribble out model will probably not build momentum with the core fan base who will buy all the episodes if the other reviews are a fair sample, and will definitely not create new fans who view it as a differentiated, luxury product, which the Anniversary edition is attempting. Those of us who grew up with the series will buy it if the current DVD producers use the volume strategy while there is volume there.

After viewing about three quarters of the extras, I do recommend this to fans.I am however miffed at the dvd producers for not giving us more. I have heard Season 3 vol 1 is coming in August but why the slow pace? The series sets have no extras and no music right issues. It is frustrating to see some lesser know series come out in rapid succession while Perry Mason releases dribble out. It leaves the comsumers to wonder if the production will continue.

I'm suggesting that the first four half-year sets may not have sold very well, so the producers have killed plans for any more in that series and instead pushed out a compilation of episodes from seasons 3 through 9 (except season 8) as a final volume. It wouldn't be the first time producers bailed on a series. The first two seasons of Too Close for Comfort are available on DVD, but that's all. I will be madder than the proverbial wet hen if they don't carry through with the entire series. I would have preferred full seasons, but I'll buy 18 half-seasons if I have to to get the whole series.

You can relate to every ponderance sung about, come away with a better sense of who you are, and understand that other people are asking themselves the same questions everyday. The only drawback is she confines herself to ballads and very soft soft rock and doesn't expand into other music genres. Despite that, it's still a very good album and the lyrics are better and more thought-provoking than previous efforts. Is it worth the cost? Definitely, you can't really hate anything about this album if you like a sense of depth in your musical tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-Uh Uh-Uh Baby!!!! 0 Stars.","review":"How can Mariah release such a scary, horrifying song??

The object is to put the little fish on top of the big fish, there are many, many cards and a few of the fish are so close in size that it is hard for a small child to tell, quickly, which is larger. Also, the shark is used to change the color selection, but the shark looks just like some of the other fish. I had a hard time determining which one was the shark. My son was so excited when he saw the commercial, but we only played this game 2x since Christmas.

I stacked them in a nice pyramid and the kids seemed to like them. The ones that my boys and the neighbor kids brought home did not last very long at all. They warped or leaked. Good idea for a party favor, but not these particular balls."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"We used it once at our church youth group. The balls are strong, bouncy, and it was fun. I love the colors. All the kids really enjoyed about 2 hours of play. I'm looking forward to taking them out again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrade quickly","review":"These looked good out of the box with good colors. Unfortunately, now I only have 1 that will actually hold air (after 1 1/2 years). The rubber starts to crack and then they won't hold air anymore. I have some other balls that have been much better quality. I would recommend looking for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came with cracked skin, lasted three weeks.","review":"What seemed like a good deal turned out not to be so. The ball arrived with cracks in the red skin, but it had a black inner membrane so I thought it would be fine.

Kids are sad, and I'm out several dollars and ourChampion Sports 7-Inch Red Playground Ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"All six are leaking and unusable after 3 months of light use","review":"I had high hopes for these! We home-school and so I wanted some tough, school yard type balls for the kids to play with. It made a great present for the kids because these look like giant gum balls. But after only playing with them a few times - here in California it rains most of January, February and March, they are all useless. Perhaps these were sitting around in a shelf and the plastic or vinyl dried out?I wrote to the store but had no reply. These are headed straight for the landfill, so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Out of the 6 balls I received, not one of them are round. Even when gently inflated, the oblong nature of these balls is immediately clear. After use on the playground the warping/bulging is even more pronounced. My students can no longer use these balls after only 2 months because they do not bounce straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last even a month!","review":"These are NOT playground balls! Playground balls can handle... um... the wear and tear of the playground. We bought this set for our kids to use in the backyard - not even the daily use they would get in a school playground. Well, after less than a month's time (probably less than a week's worth of use if they were at a school), two of them have holes, and the others are splitting. No, we didn't overinflate either. We have other balls that have lasted us years. Don't waste your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for outdoor use, did not hold up.","review":"I was encouraged to purchase these balls by the high number of positive reviews. Unfortunately, our experience was in the one-star category. They simply did not hold up to outdoor use for us. They quickly developed cracks, the colors faded, and they became unusable. We were careful to put them in a ball-bin after use, and so it wasn't like they were left outside for weeks in the sun. We live in a dry, moderately high-altitude climate, and it seems like they have about zero UV resistance. Maybe okay for indoor use, or use in a humid, shaded environment ... but we won't be buying them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great wires","review":"I purchased these to replace the worn stock wires on my civic.

The book presents a large number of standards for study, focusing on thinking from the harmonic structure.

This is her first album, recently re-released. Based on the sound of Manzanita, I was really expecting a pure, simple, melodic album from an emerging talent. Instead, I found most of this a little hard to take, and a little weird (and it takes a lot to weird me out). She's trying really hard to avoid songwriting conventions, but she doesn't accomplish much in the process, in my opinion. Check out Manzanita or Golden State instead; buy this one only if you're really curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific music--it's even worse performed live.","review":"mia doi todd's music would best be enjoyed by people who think inaccessibility and quirky musical mannerisms equal meaningful genius.Give me Catpower, Kristen Hersh or Joni Mitchell any day (incidentally, the reviewer who likened Todd's music to Mitchell's is obviously a moron).Be advised, steer clear of her live shows as well--unless you are mean spirited enough to find the (inadvertant) humor in her performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first time camera","review":"I bought this camera a few months ago and love it.

The first thing I disliked was the battery life -- I'd run out by the New Year. Plus, Polaroid didn't keep up on writing drivers when Windows 2000 came out (though there is Linux/FreeBSD support via gPhoto), and the green view-finder light is annoying. Now I have a white iBook and there's basically no hope for compatibility, as my camera only came with a serial cable (not a USB cable). Polaroid's recent Chapter 11 filing probably means I won't get Mac OS X drivers any time soon (though Apple may come through in the next versions of iPhoto). If you work only work on a supported platform and like giving Energizer money, this still isn't the camera for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"The camera does not work and it did not come with any of the attachment wires which is the main reason for the purchase.

It is not that simple to use. The camera comes with no instructions. In order to troubleshoot the set-up you must visit the Polaroid website.

These were the steps I took to begin taking great pictures: (1) Take the stuff out of the box. (2) Put the batteries in the camera and set the date. (3) Install the PhotoMAX software in the PC. (4) Take pictures. (5) Load pictures into PC using software and save images as .jpg files. (6) Send friends and family pictures through e-mail. It's that simple!The only downside I see with this product is the annoying green indicator light in the viewfinder. And this camera doesn't really do well with close-up shots. You have to be at least three feet away. Also only use the video screen when you are using the AC adapter. If you don't, then your batteries will drain fast.Bottomline is I am happy with this product and I got my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first digital camera for non-photographers","review":"I've had my camera for two months and I love it. I am sure not a professional photographer but I took some great pictures from the very first. I have taken over 500 pics using all three focus depths and they turned out beautifully. Of course, I took some that were too dark but that was not the fault of the camera. I wish that it would take the 16MB and the 32MB cards, but I get over 90 pictures on the 8MB card in the three star mode and they are of very good quality. Price was right, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy Customer Unhappy","review":"I previously wrote a review of 5 stars, I was wrong. This camera drains batteries so quickly it is a joke. In less than 30 minutes you can drain 4 AA batteries, so you must buy at least two sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, however those take 5 hours to charge. The picture quality is not so good, it produces grainy pictures. But don't get me wrong, it does serve it's purpose, on email/www the pictures look fine.The LCD screen has a slow refresh rate but is very usable. In darker places, the viewfinder is blocked by a green \\"ready\\" light.

I have programmed many z80s, but I wanted to learn how to program an \\"all in one\\" microcontroller). The authors does explain the basics of digital theory, microcontroller layout, and integration with the microcontroller quite well, but he totally blows it in the project/programming section. It's like he simply copied someone elses code without any guide to why the code was written in a particular way. Also, if this is a beginners guide to microcontrollers, he needs to change the projects in the book or change the name of the book from beginneer to advanced. There are only three or four projects and they are entirely to complex for the begineer to comprehend.

It's not a book I would have sought out on my own, and I'll admit I started it with a less than stellar attitude, but I'm actually glad I read it and I feel like I learned from it. The commissioner on our case said he often recommends it to \\"high conflict parents.\\" I think the best thing the book did was to point out that, if you have kids, you'll never be rid of your ex, and to look at the relationship almost like a business partnership. If you were in partnership with someone, even if you didn't like them you couldn't competently run a business by not communicating or bursting out arguing all the time. It tends to get a bit repetitive, but it's a well-written book, very accessible, and even if the person you're in conflict with doesn't read it, I still think it's worth it. I haven't read any others on the same topic so I can't compare to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broader and better than the title","review":"I agree with the other reviews saying this book more than lives up to the title.I do want to add that the rules and guidance in the book can be applied in most situations with inter-personal conflict.Buy it if you're fighting in your marriage and you just might avoid the divorce.And not only is it relevant to healthy marriages, it's helpful for raising healthy children, and possibly even in your career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource.","review":"I have read many books on co-parenting with a less-than-ideal Dad.

It was nice to get a book about conservative women, in their own voice vs. those written by those who do not understand, or respect the movement.

So when an old buddy shows up with a deal that could spring him from his hell behind bars, he's ready to listen.To gain his freedom, Jesse must infiltrate a dangerous and reclusive religious cult that has been stockpiling weapons and eliminating those sent to investigate.From the moment he arrives in the Idaho mountain town where the cult is centered, Jesse finds every aspect of life dictated by the group's eerie, imposing leader.The plot is clearly modeled on the Branch Davidian disaster, and while the reader was very good, the story was fairly blah and a bit predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks sense of place","review":"Correctimundo that this would make an excellent movie, per other reviews, and it's a suspenseful \\"good read\\" as they say. A real page-turner, it has plot-twists that keep the reader wondering. However -- it also make you wonder if the author has ever been to any of the locales Jesse Warden and other characters visit. Although catalogued as having an Idaho setting, the country around the fictional locale of the Aryan Universe is nothing like that described, and you get no feel for Idaho at all. Cult-members fly into Tacoma's Narrows Airport, which IS NOT on one of the \\"many small islands in Puget Sound.\\" When Jesse Warden flies commercial to Washington DC, he has business in College Park Maryland and then a quick return to \\"Idaho.\\" But he uses Washington National and Dulles airports, which are in Virginia, while College Park is just 25 miles down US Route 1 from Baltimore-Washington International.

The plot line was interesting, but I had this feeling I had seen all this on the nightly news.

As such, he's too comic book for real life, but I like reading about people of such heroic inclinations and abilities who also like Beethoven. The book however does not live up to Jesse's form. It is a typical infiltrate the evil Nazis in the hills story, the kind of thing I'd expect from television, and is quite similar to a book by Lee Childs. In fact, I think this story is so cut from stereotype that it's fairly tedious and reminds me of the kind of bad television that's on late at night and you watch because you're sick and bored and feeling sorry for yourself. Woods writes well, but not compellingly. Read the first four chapters to learn about Jesse, then head for the hills, because after that it turns into saccharine candy and cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat is Hot","review":"Another great read.

This was one of them.It started great. I was excited that it seemed so good in the beginning. The woman's story of the nazi occupation was what got this two stars. After that, however, it just went downhill. Actually, I take that back, it didn't go anywhere. There's more pointless dialog in this book than a soap opra. Maybe it's just not my taste, but I found this book untollerabley boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely moving","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. The authors ability to evoke emotions through amazing imagery was wonderful.I found myself thinking about this novel and the questions it raised long after I put it down. The twists were beautifully executed(mostly due to the fully formed characters) always raising the thought in my mind about how peoples actions can be misinterpreted when we don't have all the facts. In my opinion this novel is not really in the spy genre but rather a look at human beings and their action in crisis and how preconceived ideas can cause misunderstandings of tragic proportions -absolutely wonderful novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Gem","review":"As a rule, I don't give five star ratings that often. I feel they need to be saved for the truly spectacular works that truly deserve it. This book meets the bill for me. It is easily the best book I have read in ages.

My mom liked the book but ended up skimming through the middle. The first time I experienced this story was as a book on CD in the car. I was tortured every time I had to get out of the car. I loved it so much I read the book in print soon after. My only issue was that the story was so rich and deep and intense that it could have easily been a series. It left me wanting more details. I wanted to get more involved with some of the characters, to 'know them' more, 'understand' them more. I bought a copy for 1 cent because I know I'll read it again sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heart Wrenching Tale that Draws the Reader in to Its Moral Dilemmas","review":"This book is out of print but Amazon still found a copy for me. I picked it up because I liked the author's second book enough to go back and read his first. The important thing to understand is that Brodrick is not writing whodunnits. It is not an action/adventure mystery. No doubt I like his writing because I, too, am a lawyer who sometimes wonders about the spiritual aspects of what I do. Brodrick presents us with difficult moral choices and traces the outcome of decisions. The heros are not always as heroic as we think they are and the bad guys may have redeeming virtues just like in real life, and, like in real life, it is difficult to figure it all out. There is a lot of meandering made necessary by the examination of the moral questions. One of the satisfactions of detective fiction is that the bad guys get caught. That usually happens here too.

The armor for the body is well designed and helps the D60, which is smaller than a normal SLR, feel more comfortable in my large hands. The lens armor is VERY POORLY designed. It slips off the lens easily and, most importantly, whoever designed it, never tried using it with the flash.

Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good protection for camera body","review":"The camera body armor is great - but kind of painful to put on. You have to remove the straps, then contort the rubber onto the camera - be sure all the button marks are positioned right - then get the straps back on. I swore the first time I put the straps on I would never do it again, but it was worth the hassel even so.The camera is now encased in good looking rubber armor that has already saved my camera from a few bumbs into objects. You can access all the functions - IF you were careful getting the armor aligned. Small buttons are sometimes a little hard to press but I rarely need them so not a problem.The rubber lens protector? After messing with it a few times I tossed it into the trash. It was pointless. It may have been the lens size but it just would not stay on, kept getting in the way, and made the camera difficult to store. If you pull it on too far it interferes with the zoom. Easier to just not use it then to fight it while trying to get your picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, a real winner ...","review":"I usually wipe hard drives on old computers and then donate them.

I put the great looking hard drive in its case and put it aside for my next backup.Long term use will, of course, be a good test.

Best of all, is the gusto with which Thompson tackles each tune -- his delivery is vibrant and heartfelt; it may be just another goofy, cornball Christmas record, but it's lively and enjoyable, a cut or two above similar efforts by other artists. Plus, guitar whiz Joe Maphis provides a sparkling counterpoint to the band's infectious beat.

Instead of bemoaning this situation, she seems to infuse her words with an an ironic twist which brings a smile rather than a frown to one's face. It is hope instead of despair that survives; Laughter instead of tears; reason rather than insanity. It is perspective, which is comforting in these most uncomfortable of times between men and women. There are no villains in her stories, only flawed human beings who don't always make the right decisions at the right time. They try and that's what counts.

I'm afraid not. This is not hard sci-fi, or even good fiction. With stories like \\"what if Marilyn Monroe and James Dean dated, and nothing out-of-the-ordinary happened?\\" or \\"A girl who turns people into bugs\\", the tales in this anthology consistently fail to satisfy.

Trying to transfer files over a few MBs across the LAN would cause the router to lock up and it would stop passing all traffic. The only thing that would fix it was a power cycle. The router would also lock up and sometimes drop the wireless signal every day or two which would also require a power cycle. Also, channel 6 is the only channel available to use.

The second one that I bought has been working fine for almost 5 months, but is now almost completely unusable and broke down much faster than the first one.Bottom line is I'd much rather just buy a more expensive cable that won't stop working in a matter of months than have to replace one of these every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but poor video quality","review":"I bought this cable simply to connect my computer for the monitor.

As a result, it would not allow the monitor to be configured at the optimum resolution. In fact, when I plugged it up the first time, the monitor did not even recognize the signal from the computer. I had to completely recycle the computer and reconnect the monitor before it would recognize it. I have been building computers from scratch for a couple of decades now, and this is the first time I have had a cable to perform this way. If you are familiar with plug-and-play at all, then you know that all Windows operating systems since way back in the early 90's will recognize practically every device you connect to a computer.

I had actually never seen this before on any VGA-fed monitor, because i had never encountered a cable this bad.

I use it to connect my daughter's laptop, which does not have an HDMI output, to the HDTV. It works very well and the length makes it useful, allowing you to place the laptop out of the way. You also need to buy a similar length audio (headphone plug on both ends) cable to provide sound, if you want the TV to provide sound for the videos.

The pins in the connector are too cheap. The pins are so flimsy that they could not withstand plugging into the connector on my PC and they bent over. I have never had that happen which leads me to believe they were already not straight. Could not be straightened sufficiently to use the cable.

Lots of experience for years both at home and at work with installing PCs and peripherals. The one I got was just junk.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I should have read other reviews before purchasing this cable. This cable does NOT work with my Samsung 20'' TV/Monitor and HP laptop. The TV/Monitor does not recognize that it is plugged into the computer, but the computer sees it as a \\"Generic Monitor\\" when it should be picking up more information than that. Other reviews suggested that there is no plug & play capability with this cable (not all pins are wired), so that could be it. Either way, it did not work, and I am disappointed.Furthermore, the cable was damaged when it arrived but not in a way that would impede function. The metal was bent on one end but it still plugged in. It's just poorly made in general. Don't waste your time (or money, but I feel I spent more time than money on this right now). I've purchased many cheap cables before - there USUALLY is no difference in quality.

Unfortunately, I was vastly disappointed.Any monitor used with this cable has a horizontal \\"smear\\": all colors appear in lighter horizontal lines to the right. This isn't noticeable in fast-moving images such as movies or video games, but it's irritating for text editing and makes image editing impossible, since you don't know what you're seeing.While I was removing and re-attaching this cable to different monitors and ports, one of the screws on the cable came loose and fell out of the unit. This was just under normal use, with absolutely no unnecessary stress placed on it. A few reattachments later, another screw had fallen out.While not completely useless, I would never recommend this product to anyone who had another option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, works","review":"Feels flimsy and cheap (Because it is), works as advertised and i now have plenty extra to use for clients.all 5 i purchased work perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't connect well, there's a short or something.","review":"When I first opened this it seemed sturdy, well built and a good length.

Every text box had a shadow of the text blurring to the right, and every white box on a black background, generally media playback controls, was blurring about 1/4 of the way across the screen. I asked around and learned that VGA cables can't be longer than about 6 feet before the signal starts diminishing, and since i was running a 1440x900 resolution, the drop in quality was even more apparent.

The authors create false categories of \\"bullies\\". The book is riddled with contradictions that makes one wonder if it was actually edited. The entire value of the book is that it does inform the reader that (1) bullies need to harm and control others, (2) that's just the way they are - don't try to understand them, and (3) do not suffer because there are ways to deal with it. I suggest you find those ways in another book. I was recommened \\"Jerks at Work.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Policy over Practical","review":"The book begins very slowly and really does not offer significant information until the last few chapters (mostly the very last chapter). The authors, throughout the entire novel, have a bitter attitude towards business in general and seem to be blaming capitalism for the problems surrounding bullying. They have several interesting points throughout the novel, but unfortunately, it is mired down by a slightly veiled political agenda against \\"big business\\". I would like to have seen more about the practical methods an individual can undertake to control bullying rather than the overhanded solution to engage in legal discourse.I would have also liked to have seen more specific case studies. The authors mention many times of having their web site with hundreds of stories on bullying. Where are they? I would like to have seen more. Keep the politics out of the issue. It is serious enough of a problem without smacking of a hidden agenda against business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you need to feel validated","review":"There a couple of useful pages that discuss how to deal with a bully one-on-one, but most of it discusses how it is not your fault and tells you how to walk out of the bully workplace environment. I was hoping that it would give more guidance in how to disarm a bully and avoid becoming a Target at all. The first sentence of the Introduction is \\"A simple truth: to stop a bully from turning you into a Target, \\"just\\" coldly and unemotionally announce that the irrational, unwanted conduct you are experiencing is unacceptable.\\" I wish that the book had elaborated on that very topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"After waiting over fifteen minutes for the program to load, I discovered that in order to open most of the advertised manuals, one needs to own the hard copy of the same.

Beran, the story's main character, is a cardboard cutout who doesn't really have a soul to sell. If there'd been more to the writing than Beran did this, then this, met so and so, wore fine/ratty clothes, did this, met a nice/evil/indifferent man, did this, went out on the road, and did this, The Juggler may have received more than one star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! Exellent!","review":"I loved the book! I don't think it moved too slowly, it went over details. It has tons of details of when Beran is on the road and such other moments where it would be important to have detail because it's not something your average citizen commonly does. If those people didn't like it so much, than why did they give it a high rating? (just wondering.)The book draws you and makes you feel like you are Beran or his invisible friend. I like how the book focuses only one particular charecter and his ordeal. It lets you better get to know him, kind of like in 'Catcher in The Rye'. I'm not an expert, but I think it depicts what it was really like back then very well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the out of ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a drop of pomegranate","review":"This is a pretty bad immitation of real grenadine. Very mediciny taste.

Chapter after chapter and vignette after vignette end with virtually no result or conclusion. A bunch of Naval Intelligence guys running around Vietnam hoping to gain some intelligence or to solve some criminal act by U.S. Navy or Marine Corps personnel -- only to have most of the situations they describe end up with \\"we wrote a report but it never went anywhere\\". For example, numerous fragging incidents are describe, but few if any culprits are caught -- as if it made a difference in the outcome of the war.The book is long on the difficulties of getting around Vietnam as a single operative, but short on any insight on what these men did or what they added to our forces there.This is just another group of people trying to get their sliver of the war out there. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bar Harbour","review":"The item purchased from the retailer never arrived.

There are examples of controlling relationships from real people, with the various forces at work clearly explained. Finally, the book helps you apply all this information to your own individual situation. Far more than just theory or discussion, \\"Stop Controlling Me\\" is a practical, useable roadmap to better, more honest, and more fulfilling relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book does a very good job of defining what it means to be controled by a loved one.

Despite severe health problems and a premature obituary, he's still making magnificent music today. But he's rarely been on finer form than when he recorded \\"Lift the Lid and Listen\\" in 1978 - and his own playing is matched by that of his friends: Scottish harper Savourna Stevenson... the wonderful lyrical pianist Beryl Marriott... Simon, Peggy and Bruce from Fairport Convention... From the exquisite \\"Lark in the Clear Air\\" and the stately \\"Nonsuch\\" to an effervescent Morris set and a blistering \\"Kate Dalrymple\\", this is Swarb at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost As Good as the First","review":"Most authors just can't make the sequel as good as the first book, but Nicole Luiken has managed to do it with Silver Eyes. I was extremely happy when I saw this book sitting on the bookshelf of the local bookstore. I've been waiting for this book ever since I finished Violet Eyes more than a year ago. It was well worth the wait.The heroine, Angel Eastland, remembers very few things of her past, which is why she is so confused when she finds a hidden message that reads, \\"Violet eyes lie.\\". On her first mission, she meets up with Michael Vallant, who claims to know her, but she can barely remember him, and can't comprehend on what he tells her.Although the novel is quite confusing at the beginning because it kicks off nowhere near where Violet Eyes ended, everything becomes clear as the story goes by. I really enjoyed this book. It should be a movie or something, or at least, Ms Luiken should write another novel about our favorite violet-eyed couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun to read (again and again)....","review":"This book is so much fun to read!

The pictures are exceptionally appealing, the story is engaging and the rythm and rhyme great for involving young children.

We have been on many picnics where we have taken along 'chocolate marshmallow fudge delight' and 'razzleberry, dazzleberry, snazzleberry fizz'.

The interior is not large enough to fit a regular sized cookie sheet. It's a pain in the neck to clean. You need to scrub really hard with steel wool to get the grease off. It's stainless steel and the company says not to use caustic products, so I stuck with steel wool. The main reason I bought it was because of the high reviews it got on Amazon. If anyone had been truthful and mentioned how long it takes to clean the darn thing, I never would have bought it.

I usually order the Chocolate Chip ones, but decided to try Oatmeal Raisin Walnut. Now they are both my favorites. The only thing you have to watch out with is the expiration date, because mine expired within the month I got them. I eat one a day so mine was gone. If your hungry, these will satisfy you, but not get you full. Clif bars are good on the good snacks that help you from starving on the road or just like eating healthier foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Logic cases are CD unfriendly","review":"All Case Logic cases share the same flaw. The soft backing on the sleeves tends to collect tiny paricles of dust and dirt. These particles in turn scratch discs repeatedly each time you slide them out of the sleeve. I've already ruined about half of my disc collection. Many of my discs will play fine in the car (which has a great player) but not at home on my CD-ROM drive (which isn't as high tech a player).

The cases offer great protection for the CD's and they are very portable.

So far so good. What I don't understand is why there is no way to turn it on/off without going through all 3 different modes every single time.This means that if you don't want to use any of the flashing modes you have to press the button 3 times to turn it off! My almost 10 year old cat-eye taillight let me switch between settings with a short press on the button, while keeping it pressed down slightly longer turned it off (or on to the previously used setting if it was turned off).This was my first Blackburn purchase, so one of the deciding reasons for me was that it comes with a \\"lifetime guarantee\\" -- thus I figured Blackburn had put some thought into it. I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light","review":"I purchased this light based on the reviews below and have found that the issues of the mounting can be overcome by winding some electrical tape around the mounting bracket itself can secure the fixture in place. If the fixture was tight and firm as-is, this this light would recieve five stars from me.The battery installation issue is non-existant. The batteries alternate casing orientations on opposite sides of the unit itself-- that's why one user needed \\"ribbons\\" or tape to secure the batteries in place. Upon close examination of the unit, you will be able to change the batteries rather easily.The light is bright. The strobe features are indeed bizarre, but a controllable feature nonetheless. Let's see how this thing holds up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice light, poor handlebar mount","review":"I bought this light to make myself more visible during my commute, particularly at dawn & dusk, and on overcast days.The light itself is fine. As other reviewers have said, it is a \\"be seen\\" light, not \\"to see\\" light. I like the fact that it has multiple flashing modes.However, the handlebar mount doesn't work. It not possible to tighten it in such a way that the light will actually stay in the position mounted. The thumbscrew cannot be tightened any more, but even the slightest bump will cause the light to rotate downwards. I'm not convinced that having my front tire lit up is making me much more visible than no light at all.I do not recommend this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate mounting","review":"The LEDs are quite bright, and will last longer than either conventional incandescent or halogen bulbs. They also conserve battery power to an amazing extent. Unfortunately thet clip that holds the lamp to the handlebar mount is so small and weak that after attaching/detaching the lamp a few times it will begin to detach itself at every bump in the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"LED headlight","review":"This light is bright to oncoming traffic, but not the brightest for you to see with. It has three modes; solid four lights on, two on and two blinking, and all four blinking. I use the two on two off, until I come to intersections, then I switch to all four blinking. People really notice this. My only complaint is that it could be a little more focused so you can see the road in front of you better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LED = Long battery life","review":"If you often travel unlit roads or trails at night, this is NOT the light for you. It simply doesn't light up your surroundings well enough. LEDs are good for seeing them from a distance, but they are not good flood lights. However, if you're like me and simply want to be seen by traffic, this light is perfect. I ride at night on streets that are at least partially lit, so I wanted a light that would allow me to be seen by traffic, and be easy on battery life.The partial flash mode (where the side LEDs flash and the center ones stay constant on) is very visible by oncoming traffic. I wouldn't use the full-flash mode (all LEDs flash) at night; ever try to ride a bike in a strobe-light? I think that's used more for that dangerous time around sunset, where the sun is low on the horizon and it's hard for drivers to see anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Allow You to See the Road","review":"I bought this light because there are so many positive reviews I found here at Amazon on this product. Most reviews mentioned that this light is very bright, and it allows you see and to be seen. I beg a different opinion. Though I don't necessarily disagree that this light allows you to be seen, it definitely does not allow you to see far and clear enough to drive more than 10 miles/hour on a dark road. Certainly, the light is not as bright as a 1 watt luxeon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving...","review":"My bike is my main source of transportation, day and night. I bought this inexpensive light hoping it would make my night commutes safer and brighter.This light doesn't provide enough light to see in urban areas or pitch black paths. The beam is very weak. To see the path ahead of me I have to tilt the light towards the ground, than the bean is brighter. But than the bean is just two feet ahead of my tire - giving me no time to swerve out of the way of any obstructions on the road.If you want a light to be seen, than yes, this is a good light (it has a nice blinking mode). But if you want a light to see, forget this one and invest in a safer, brighter light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light","review":"I've had this light over an year now, only had to replace the batteries once so far. It is very bright and gets good distance. I ride in San Fransisco and there is tons of traffic. The light does help in showing that I am near by, I feel naked when I don't have it on. It has taken some beatings but has managed to function properly without any problems. Aesthetically it is a bit bulky, but pretty, slim lights don't make me feel safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nursing, the finest art-- great book!","review":"I had to buy this book for a college course. I have been buying my books through Amazon for a while now because it is a lot cheaper than getting them at the college bookstore. At first I just thought this was going to be another one of those books that I was going to dread reading... but I have found it really interesting! The material is interesting, the pictures are gorgeous, and I will actually be keeping this textbook for my coffee table rather than trying to sell it back or trade it with another student.

My Lemons ancestors came to live in the Watauga Association during the time of this book. I wanted to read about what it was like for my ancestors. The story was well told and gave me a good feel for what life was like. I was drawn into the story for the story sake though, as it was interesting and compelling. I would feel comfortable letting my 15yr old read the story but not my 12year old. The other part of the story that has me thinking, is the treatment of the Native Peoples during that time. It was brutal on both sides, and reminds me of the Arab/Israel conflict we have present day. Brutality met with greater brutality can be a never ending cycle. I wonder what part my ancestors played, in the brutality of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherokee Frontier","review":"This is an interesting story of the frontier life in Tennessee.

I also reviewed the Crosse and Blackwell Branston Original (much better, IMO) and would recommend it over the Heinz.I noticed that this is packed in Holland. Don't know if that has anything to do with anything but seems odd. The crunchy bits are not quite as crunchy as I like, and it's soupy, rather than being thick. It's not a terrible product, but I believe the Heinz is higher priced than the C&B;, so I'd recommend that for more flavor and crunch and less drips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book since 1980 !","review":"I read this book for the first time in 1980, for a class on the Middle Ages at Michigan.

But what I can't look past is the fact that I didn't get any directions and they didn't send the correct hardware to put the tetherball set together. The set comes with two poles that you must bolt together to make one long 10 foot pole. I didn't get a bolt to connect the two sections (they sent a bolt but it didn't fit and was useless).

I bought a 1mb flash drive with ReadyBoost technology and was using 880mb of it for \\"additional\\" random memory. I was pleased with the improved speed that I was shopping for a 2gb model. When I saw this, I was very impressed! It's small and doesn't \\"intrude\\" on the appearance of my computer. I'm using the recommended 1830mb for ReadyBoost. I'm extremely pleased.

The transfer times are faster than mentioned in previous reviews and you can't beat the portability. I keep it in the holder on my keyring and despite my concerns, it has never popped out, even when been swung around and banged up.All that is good and well, but last week, it just stopped working on me. I think the reason is that the copper contacts and the plastic surrounding them have worn down just enough that the contacts don't touch the contacts in a computer's USB port properly. I've tried inserting it into at least a dozen computers (I go to school, so there's no shortage of computers to test it on) and it hasn't been recognized on any of them.The product is great, but if you insert it and remove it too many times, it may croak on you. I wouldn't recommend this for the constant transfer of important documents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Value in a tiny package","review":"I bought mine over six months ago. I use it nearly everyday at my job as a Systems Administrator to sneakernet files from one computer to another. I keep about 500 mb of music on it so I always have tunes that I want to hear when I have the chance wherever I am. That still leaves plenty of room to transport other files. I even used it in a rental car that had a USB port for the sound system when I was on travel. I keep it in my little fifth pocket in my Levi blue jeans, and that means that I have forgotten about it a few times. It has gone through the washer and dryer three times (that I know of) with no data loss and it keeps on working just as well as the day I bought it. I will be sad on the day when I loose it (my only fear for this flash drive). I am never without this little guy. The rubber holder is still with it as well.

Finally, Staples had a sale and I bought it for $20.The rubber holder is smaller and much softer than a key. It has a plastic ring that fits on your keychain, so you can toss the floss.

I can usually tolerate most books, but this book was so horrible. So unbelievable, that I struggled to keep reading it. Peachy would be the most ignorant 'heroine' I have ever encountered in any book. Her ignorance went beyond ludicrous. I couldn't even laugh I was so stunned by how bad this book was.There needs to be some semblence of reality in a book, something that makes a reader think that this could possibly happen - but I found nothing like that here.Even after reading the glowing reviews, I'm wondering what planet these people came from. I was completely turned off the lead and to imagine a prince falling for her... well, not in this lifetime.This is the first and last Paisley book I will ever read.

I originally purchased this book for a college poetry writing course but I found the poems pleasurable to read on my own time, not just to read for critical analysis. Collins' intro contains some insights as to how a poem forms for a writer and also a good story about a poetry reading. The anthology features many contemporary writers and the poems range in length and subject matter. If you are looking for a good poetry anthology to learn to read and/or write poetry, I heartily recommend this book. I think readers of any ages will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mediocre collection","review":"Collins states in the introduction that he hadn't heard of many of these poets; I think the reason is that they aren't all that good.There are a few good poems interspered with some pretty pedestrian ones.This is sort of the hospital food of poetry...try to please everyone by upsetting no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A haphazard selection","review":"There are a gazillion poetry anthologies on the market, some better, some worse, some quite comprehensive, some eclectic with a discernible slant. Billy Collins, a rather entertaining and usually smart poet (although often lacking in depth), has done himself and poetry a disservice here by hurling his name into the crowded field of anthology editors with this haphazard selection that's neither comprehensive nor eclectic -- it's just superficial. This is one book money is wasted on; for poetry lovers, I would recommend any of the recent editions of the \\"Best American Poetry\\" series instead (especially those of 2000 and 2003), or the excellent collection \\"Poetry Daily: Poems from the World's Most Popular Poetry Website\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no, no, no, no, nO.","review":"This is the worst possible way to interest someone in poetry: offering lackluster poems about adolescent topics by contemporary writers of little or no distinction.

If it sparks no fire, then poetry is not for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"If taste indicates anything, Billy Collins is a dull person.These poems are uninteresting, except for a very few.I cannot even write more than a few sentences about this volume, because it is so tedious.Do.

There is nothing remotely like democracy, as the U.S. and most Western countries embrace it, occurring in China, and in fact the regime is only becoming more and more oppressive of its citizens' personal freedoms despite the rampant capitalism.And what just happened in Egypt is bad news for the vast majority of Chinese: the government will now surely redouble its efforts to keep the people under its thumb.This is NOT democracy.To suggest otherwise belies very little understanding of the true nature of China today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best historical romance/novel I have read in 20 yers.","review":"The characterisation and intrigue built into the story is unsurpassed.

This is not that book. I had likewise hoped that there would be sufficient historical content to counterbalance what I anticipated would be essentially a romance novel. Far from it. Regrettably, this work falls into the teenage girl category which misses no cliche in forwarding each and every threadbare convention involving a maid of undistinguished background being subjected to cruelty and abuse, thereby resulting in an unquenchable passion for the perpetrator of said misdeeds. This is the usual trite \\"the more he mistreats me, the hotter the flame burns\\" nonsense. If you're in the market for a full on bodice ripper, you have found it. If you are interested in a serious work of historical fiction regarding the Neville family and associated persons depicted in this novel, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot be beaten at this pricepoint!","review":"For the price, you cannot find a better *sports-oriented* MP3 player with more storage space (128MB internal and optional 128MB via SMC).

The so-called 'conspiracy'appears specious at best. (Words of Wisdom: Never ascribe to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.) All available evidence on TITANIC points to massive incompetence and lack of communication as the true cause of the disaster. I really doubt that the White Star Line wanted to sink one of their prized new liners for the insurance! This, again, is a very modern outlook and the authors offer no proof of their hypothesis. TITANIC CONSPIRACY is also turgidly written and only has one 'fact' that appears to be original with the authors. I won't spoil it for you here. You may have already bought this one.

Alot of times, when a singer has their own style it comes with mumbling, and trying your best to understand the lyrics. Bird has a style that is all her own, and it really works. On this cd, you can understand the incredible poetry that is happening to the hypnotising music. If you put some headphones on, and crank it up, you'll be taken to another place.

You can download later versions of the Silverrun software, but they are crippled demo versions that do not allow you to create some of the larger models built in the exercises.

The support call center was not especially helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a great computer setup","review":"I purchased this unit for a desktop stereo and plugged in my Mac Dual G4. The sound quality is great. I did not use the USB input option because it is PC only, but just plugging into Aux is great. There is little comparison to standard computer speakers, but these are obvioulsly a little bigger.The only negatives I can add about this unit is that it does not allow an external subwoofer. There appears to be a sealed off port for it on the back of the main unit, but there is not an option. Also, I would like to have an extra Aux input. It would be great to plug in a XM unit or my iPod directly into the back, along with my computer.Overall I have to say that this a great system for listening to music in the office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy CD changer that just died with no recourse","review":"I purchased the unit less than 2 years ago based on some online reviews. As soon as I set it up, I wondered why everytime the unit was switched on, it went through and read the CDs in order -- even if I was just listening to the radio. This process was noisy and it sounded like the motorized mechanism within the unit was cheap. I called Philips and while they are very nice on the phone, they said the noise was normal.Yesterday I put some CDs in and the unit now has failed. The drawers do not open and the CDs are locked within. Since the unit is more than 1 year old, Philips will not replace the unit and has no method of servicing the unit. They have no instructions for how to remove my CDs from the machine and their most helpful suggestion is for me to, \\"take it to a repair shop.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prison Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"This small text is densely packed Davis' insight into the history of social justice organization and mobilization, the injustice of the prison system, and the interweaving of that system with capitalism to create an exportable prison economy with both a profit and social repression incentive. It reads quickly as a conversation develops between Mendieta and Davis that displays his intense engagement with the subject of his interview.There is a gem of an answer at the end of the interview which speaks to Davis' concern that there is an overreliance on seeking role models for social justice mobilization when what she and others of her era did was essentially experimentation. In this way, modern organizers should be more fearless with experimenting with new ways to think their way through more highly evolved forms of racism and those threats to social justice which we encounter in the present era."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This book is what every parent needs.

There are A LOT of repetitions, and a lot of the stuff it talks about is just common sense.

I didn't learn anything new from it that I hadn't already read in \\"The Baby Book\\" and his other books. I feel like Dr. Sears is trying to wring every last penny out of parents by repackaging his previous book *chapters* into book after book after book. I got much more out of 'Attachment Parenting' by Katy Alison Granju. It is the book I give as a baby gift to every pregnant friend and new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish all new parents-to-be would read this book","review":"I have just one thing to say. I wish all mainstream parents out there would read this book if for nothing else than to learn that there *are* other parenting tools and methods out there other than yelling and letting kids cry themselves to sleep and \\"sleep training\\". There are gentler, more respectful ways to parent and theis books touches on them all. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Attachment Parenting resource","review":"I found The Attachment Parenting Book by Dr. and Martha Sears to be an outstanding resource, both for myself and for the \\"grandparents\\", who are a little critical of our parenting style! The tone is not at all judgemental, so that you feel comfortable taking the ideas that you like and leaving those who don't work for you, even though a convincing case is made, in my opinion, for breastfeeding, babywearing, sleep sharing and responding to baby's cries. Clearly and concisely written, this book is a must-read for all new parents, especially those interested in attachment parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Great Information","review":"I'm a big fan of all of the Sears books, this was no different.

Many parents already do many of the behaviors talked about in this book. Dr Sears validated the decisions my husband and I make as parents. It is great to read a parenting book that approaches nurturing the way we do. I would recommend this book to all new parents and parents to be simply because it is a positive approach to parenting. I read it again and again to feel the warm pat on the back that these authors convey in their writing.

Dr. and Mrs. Sears what were you thinking? You write things like \\"Studies show that the more a mother and baby nurse, the higher the mother's prolactic levels\\" and \\"Researchers at Stanford University found that babies settle best when held by caregivers who move in all planes of motion...\\" Could you please cite your sources? Which studies? There are no footnotes and no annotated bibliography. If you are going to write a book and use research to back up your style of parenting, please tell us these studies and scientists so that we can read the studies for ourselves. That's all I'm saying.

Its a faster read, and should be read before the Mike Lawrence book. I alos like the \\"Improve your Opening Leads\\" by Hugh Kelsey (read it after the Ewen book).This book (by Blackwood)is verbose, and doesnt cover the subject well.

The problem is that the picture quality of the LCD display is horrible, no matter what lighting conditions you are in. I am sure that the actual picture quality of the photos themselves is better after you load it onto a computer or print them out.

The text is anecdotal, and it is full of not very well reproduced photographs from the filming of the movie.

I would contend that if the only issues one had with a 1000 page book is something so subjective as the PERCEIVED bias the author had towards a controversial figure, then the book was a roaring success! Might I suggest: \\"get a life\\" to those who cannot look past their own ridiculous little pet peeves, and judge the book on it's own merit.

While you can't fault the exhaustive research and the volume of information which has gone into \\"Gotham\\", the book lacks interpretative drive and personal vision. Perhaps the lack of a \\"lyrical\\" voice which the reader detects is a result of the dual authorship. The need to work through the enormous amount of facts to do with trade, legislation, social policy, financial administration etc, and the understandable need to do this as a combined effort has, at times, swamped the excitement of the subject.

But the New Albion recording is a private recording, while this CD was (apparently) recorded during a public performance. So the music shares the CD with various audience noises among which is a bird that was determined to have its 15 minutes of fame. The sound on this CD is among the worst that I have ever heard -- all highs, no lows, like a bargain basement set of microphones was used. If this performance had been done with good engineering in a good, private setting, it probably would have been something worth getting. The choir does a reasonably good job; but unless you can tune out the many distractions and the bad engineering on this CD, I would recommend you pass on this one and get the one by the St. Gayane bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great functionality","review":"The base of the towel holder works particularly well on wet surfaces.

But is it dangerous to the stability of our Constitution?The problem, as James Risen frames it, should at least be considered. Learn about \\"the Program,\\" a Bush Administration tactic used to systematically bypass all of the checks and balances put in place to protect the integrity of our republic. These fundamental protections include the due process of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Constitution.According to Risen, this administration is doing an end-run around the very structures that ensure the continuance of our democracy.This is a thoughtful contribution to the public dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Truly Happened Behind the Scenes","review":"State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration, written by James Risen, describes in details the mistakes that were made in a time of crisis. Not much is known though on how liable the sources James Risen uses are, since they were kept confidential for various reasons. Most of the blame is placed upon the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and CIA Director George Tenet; however, some blame is also placed on President George Bush. Personally I believe that this shouldn't be and even after reading James Risen's book I still believe that. Yes it outlines crucial mistakes that were made, but with the knowledge the president had at the time of his decision, those choices were the most suitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely and Important","review":"Risen has given us a good study of the relationship between CIA and the Bush inner circle, how intelligence was manipulated, and how the personalities involved pursued their own agendas with disastrous consequences. Very telling is the profile of Director Tenet, a politico eager to stay on the job, and who seemed to put his need to be liked ahead of providing accurate intelligence and running an agency that is indispensable in advising presidents. It seems that Cheney and Rumsfeld dominated Tenet, and manipulated him to help them justify their preestablished desire to invade Iraq.All in all a sad tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book!","review":"There cannot be too many books that show the true side of the current administration.

I think Risen has it right; Like most folks in power, this administration just didn't want it's preconceived notions questioned. The main problem with the book is that so few sources would go on the record. This problem has recently been lessened by a growing number of folks who have retired from the intelligence services or otherwise left the government who are now going on the record.

But Saddam's ultra-deadly mass murder of Iraqi Kurds (182,000 dead kurds in one year alone) is not illustrated by this author well enough. Nor enough of Saddam's other enormous crimes against humanity are well illustrated here either.

How can I review it so quickly? Because it is so thin and shoddy. It is full of instances where the author cites single (unnamed) individuals as his sources for supposedly important stuff. In some cases he acknowledges that what his single source told him may be wrong --but \\"if it is true\\" it would be important. You can tell who is sources are too...they are the folks who are described elsewhere in the book as \\"genial\\" or smart. Clearly many of his sources are people with axes to grind. The author plows lots of old ground ...and when he gets to new stuff...it is often the type of information which, IF TRUE, would help America's enemies. Let's pray that our nation's foes ignore this book -- as most of America will. Dust off the Judy Miller suite at the Alexandria Jail and reserve a lumpy mattress for Mr. Risen."},{"rating":"2","title":"yikes","review":"Risen gives a very detailed look into the Bush White House and the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq. What he shows is infighting and a shocking lack of competence within the various departments. The right hand never seems to know or care what the left hand is doing. It seems that at a time when our country needs leadership, we have to settle for the Keystone Kops. Tenet's incompetence, Rumsfeld's ego, Cheney's empire-lust and Condi's weakness all have conspired to undermine the national security. The most frightening conclusion to be made is that Bush is completely irrelevant in all this. He seems to be a fool motivated by his own narrow ideological and emotional impulses, and the perfect pawn for neocons hell bent on world domination.

Perhaps, But Not for Everyone...","review":"I suppose some widowed women could afford to move to Paris and live the kind of privileged life that Gershman enjoys...then again, not everyone has the financial resources to lead such a glamourous life.The above is the main difficulty I had with this otherwise amusing little book. Gershman writes as though she is telling her readers \\"how to do it\\". (\\"It\\" being moving to Paris and beginning a new way of life in a new cultural environment). But I think she writes for someone other than women of \\"average\\" financial means.Ah, well! Taken for what it is (\\"A Princess Diary\\" as another reviewer called it), Gershman's book is informative and even humorous at times. Francophiles and armchair travelers will most likely enjoy her descriptions of things French. And a few well-heeled widows may actually be able to use her book as a \\"how to\\" manual.For the rest of us, it is an enjoyable fantasy read.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris in depth, but where's the author's?","review":"As an admitted Francophile, I loved the descriptions of Paris and the Parisians and appreciated the tips. But I was disappointed in the shallowness of the author's descriptions of her emotions following the loss of her husband of 25 years. One would think that after 25 years of marriage, her feelings might have been a little deeper than \\"I did not choose for my husband to die...but...I felt tinges of delight that I had the opportunity to start over\\". Also, I could not not help but think that anyone less connected with the famous and semi-famous (Patricia Wells and her husband were good friends) might not have had as much fun and ease.All in all, fun to read about France and an American's experience with moving there, but not a less well-connected, more emotionally honest woman's guide to moving to Paris alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Big Disappointment!","review":"This book was way too superficial, very disappointing, and little effort was made to offer any real insight about what it is like to live in Paris on a day-to-day basis, which is what one thinks one is getting when they buy this book (fortunately I bought it used, so didn't really waste much money). It seems, rather, more of a self-glorification of the author who travels in elite, limited circles with whom most readers would not be able to, nor necessarily want, to identify. The chapter on obtaining an apartment was the only portion of the book which offered some kind of insight into what it can be like to live in Paris as one of the many differences between there and here.I believe the book may have achieved some worth had the author broadened her horizons and deigned to comingle with Parisians in various walks of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'est disappointing!","review":"I'll admit I'm a sucker for the living abroad in Europe books. This book was disappointing, however, as several other reviewers have noted. Portions ring true (as a woman widowed at age 40, I completely related to the grief she feels and the need to start anew), but significant portions of the book strike me as shallow. The author strikes me as disingenuous at times. She is shocked (shocked!) that her American friend professes outrage when the author tells him she's having an affair with a married man. Hey, I'm not a prude, but adultery is adultery--even in Paris! She also expresses shock when the chic Parisian shop doesn't carry her (large) dress size. She's shocked (shocked!) to learn that Americans are often fat and French women tend to be thin or average in terms of weight. Despite this, however, I did read in the entire book in an evening. If you want something light and not terribly insightful, this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO LIVE IN PARIS","review":"I agree with the review given by Juliet Grigsby.

Just keeping up with the lies told by convicted murder Tom Maimoni is enough to keep a reader fully engaged.As many other reviews have related here, Maimoni had a difficult time accepting \\"No\\" for answer when it came to women; and he was willing to tell them anything to keep from hearing that dreaded word. Yet his passive-aggressive tendencies did not make him a vicious man, only one to be feared by what was not at all expected from him.This was a great, fast read true crime. While there is nothing that really separates Maimoni from so many other murderers, his modus operandi is one that is, at times, fascinating.

Perhaps it is a matter of preferred style, but I could never get into this book. The author seems to do nothing but make a series of lists throughout the entire book. The reader is never introduced to the main thought of a passage followed by logical support of that thought. I personally felt I was reading a set of cliff notes on small groups.Once one advances beyond the writing style, the book does have a good amount of useful information. A busy small-group lay leader, who simply wants a checklist of things to consider, would probably find this book very helpful. However, the scholar who is looking to study small groups would find other books more useful.

Ana Maria Matute is a great author to use for the test; the spectrum of her works touched every emotional chord in me. The loss of innoncence, jealousy, the cruelty of society, all coexist in her stories. I highly recommend this book to anyone, high school student or not, who wants to explore the realm of spanish literature. Each of her short stories and Fiesta Al Noroeste, which is my favorite, can be applied to anyone and are a joy to read. Matute is one of the best and I personally put her next to Unamuno and Cervantes."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG! this is a horrible book.......","review":"All I can say is don't waste your money.

The full-size book is wonderful, and deserves all five stars. I just attempted to buy two copies to give as gifts. Alas, I ended up with the miniature versions, which have most of the content, but at less than a fifth of the size, are hardly worth their present cost of half the price.

It's colorful, it has unique photos of cats doing cat things, and it will make you think about remodeling your house for your own feline bundle of joy. I was given this book as a gift a few years ago (before I was able to have a cat due to apartment restrictions) and I enjoyed it even then. But after a recent move to a new house, I discovered the book again -- I enjoy it even more now that I have my own cat. Thanks to The Cats' House, my husband and I have been discussing how we can add our own piece of cat paradise to our home!One of the best parts of this book is that it encourages readers to adopt homeless cats from shelters and rescues. Shelter cats make the best pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat's House","review":"I would not recommend this book. I bought it thinking it was going to help me build my own cat's house.

As I read each section, I found myself looking up to our ceiling and around the different rooms, and imagining our five fur people hovering on their private ledge above our heads, traveling from room to room through their own \\"secret catholes\\".

It smells fabulous, strong but not too strong, and it's good if you're young and a trendy dresser. If it smelt like that consistently, it would be my favourite cologne.See, some perfumes spoil when they are exposed to sunlight or air. The problem with Colours is that it spoils that way, but it does it rather quickly, and it starts to smell repulsive. The smell can get rather strong and it gets embarrassing when you're out for the whole day. It's probably the only cologne you wish would fade away quickly.So, beware when you're trying the tester out. Don't buy this one immediately. Spray some on a tester card and wait.

My daughter is just like the sister bear character, so I think she's been able to relate to her character and not be too scared of people she doesn't know. I would definately recommend this book for parents of 4-5 year olds. For a younger child, \\"Your Body Belongs to You\\" by Cornelia Spelman, it's easier for them to understand I think. Berenstain Bears is a great series that I will follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Preschoolers","review":"I found myself having to reword many sentences in the book for my 4-year old granddaughter. She's at the age where we are trying very hard to educate her about strangers but this book is written for more mature children for some reason. I mean, c'mon, it's the Berenstain Bears but it's written in a vocabulary style that my granddaughter certainly would not have understood if I had read it word for word. Guess I'll just have to just keep making up my own stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I don't like this stupid book! It only teaches kids that \\"strangers\\" are bad people that wanna hurt you for fun, and the only \\"nice\\" people are the people you know.

They should of changed the title to \\"The Berenstain Bears Learn About Demented Killing Strangers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Way to Open The Discussion...","review":"...about the danger of strangers. I have read this book to all three of my children, and they have definitely learned the value of caution. A nice feature is that the book shows, in a non-scary, friendly way, how scary the subject of strangers can be to children, but how talking it over can help allay those fears. The book also shows how a child's excitement over a stranger showing a common interest or offering goodies to the child can override the child's basic caution. I highly recommend this book for the collection of anyone who wishes to keep their child(ren) safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for preschoolers","review":"Book was informative, had step by step \\"rules\\" for the cubs to follow, and had a story line for the reader. The analogy of the \\"apple\\" looking fine on the outside but could be a rotten one on the inside,as well as the implications from the newspaper headlines was too advanced and confusing for my 3 year old. These comparisons would work best with 5+ age group. I would recommend this book but for slightly older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addresses an Important and difficult topic.","review":"I have 2 children - a girl (2) who loves everyone and a boy (4) who is scared of everyone. How do I teach her to be cautious without having to loose her charm? How do I teach him to be friendly without being cautious, too? This book addresses it all. Sister Bear has one personality, Brother has the other. In the end, brother is tempted by a stranger and Sister steps in. It addresses stranger danger better than any other source I have seen. I really feel this is a must-have book for every parent and child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basics","review":"I have always found the Berenstain Bears a bit too \\"backwards\\" in their approach to life (very traditional male and female roles), but the point gets across. It did not seem to \\"spook\\" my three year old daughter at all, and she was captivated for a month or two by it. She rarely reads it now, but I feel the point has been made and I reinforce it every now and then when I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangers book","review":"This a great explanation of strangers and we were just addressing this with our preschool-aged daughter. It was recommended to us by another family - now she likes to read it over and over and...as a result...loudly calls out who are strangers when we go to the store. It's ok - I like that she is now aware. :)Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I wanted a book to help my 4 year old understand about strangers without creating paranoia. I think this book does a very good job of explaining about being careful around people you don't know, and about never, ever going anywhere with them, but it also helps children not become afraid that every unknown person is a definite bad guy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lesson","review":"My 4 year old loves this book. It does a good job teaching kids about strangers without scaring them. It's a little old fashioned in the sense that brother bear has interests like model airplanes, soccer, etc... and sister bear \\"has many other interests\\" but this doesn't really take away from the lessons being learned. We have another Berenstain book, \\"The Bearscouts\\", that is decades old and the whole book rhymes. I have been looking for some other rhyming Berrenstain books without success and would love to find some. Can Amazon help me out with this???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangers","review":"I love all of the books in this series because I think it teachs good lessons to children. This one explains how it is not good to talk to strangers. Although I do not agree with that lesson, some times kids have to talk to strangers, for example if they were to get lost. But it is still a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers","review":"This is a great book for teaching young children about strangers. My son is 5 and really enjoys reading this book over and over again. The content is informative, but not scary. The comparison momma bear makes between strangers and a barrel of apples is so simple and accurate. The simplicity allows the children to understand you never know what is on the inside of an apple or a stranger. A visual key kids are likely to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"I think this was the perfect book to teach my son about strangers. I tried to introduce the idea to him myself, but I couldn't explain what a stranger was without scaring him. He already likes the Berenstein Bears so this put a tough subject on his level and did a great job explaining the differences in strangers. I would recommend this book to everyone with a young child and I will be purchasing more copies for my nephews as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lesson About Strangers","review":"I bought this for my five-year-old daughter. After looking at other guides about strangers, we decided this would be the best. It teaches a basic lesson about who is a stranger and how a child should behave around them. She seems to get the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Content great, but not a Berenstien best","review":"The book does indeed talk about when and when not to talk to stangers in a way that is not too scary but is informative. As other reviews suggest the very simple writing style of the Berenstiens is not reflected in this book and the vocabulary was not indicative of its intended audience. Overall, a lesson that has to be taught and while it is not perfect it certainly is one of the better materials I have encountered in approaching the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for all levels","review":"I've bought several other bellydancing videos and even taken classes, but they never taught me this much or this well. Jillina's workout is perfect in that it breaks down the movements to their most basic levels. It also gives you several sets of moves that you can use to create your own, original dances. The whole DVD takes less than an hour to do, making it convenient. Moreover, Jillina's focus on using the body in correct ways has helped my improve my posture and muscle tone. I feel the movements in all the right ways and can tell I'm making progress.THIS IS A DEFINITE GOOD BUY! When I lost my original copy of this DVD, I loved it so much that I tracked it down online. For a technophobe like me, that's a BIG deal. Worth every penny - TWICE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jillina cannot teach nor can she inspire","review":"This is a VERY superficial instruction. Most importantly, where is drilling?! Jillina just dances at high speed, and expects a total beginner to follow along.That could still have some value if her dancing was truly beautiful. But I find it boring. She doesn't come across as enjoying herself. During instruction she looks bored, and her occasional fake smiling doesn't help. During dancing she perked up, but her perky counting only killed my already weak desire to follow her. I need to learn how to dance; I already know how to count, thanks!This just looks like a home video made by Jillina's friend (apparently after a good number of drinks) at their leisure.If you respect yourself, get a professionally made video, like Amira's Belly Dance 101."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Instruction and Choreography!","review":"I've grown to like Jillian's dvd after reviewing many others. I like the choreography section a lot. Yes, it may take true beginners a while to master the moves, but if you've had some instruction from a real teacher, it should not be a problem. In fact, for beginners with previous instruction, the combinations section might be a waste of time because the combinations in this part of the dvd are slightly different from the combinations taught in the choreography section. Dancers who are familiar with the moves will benefit most from the instruction on the choreography. If you're looking to learn a quick, sexy routine, then this dvd will deliver greatly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Beginner","review":"I am an absolute beginner to bellydance and this video was not very helpful. My biggest complaint was that the pace was very fast. There were very few repetitions of the moves, so I was constantly hitting the rewind butting to figure out what I missed or try the move again so I could do it well.Sections of DVD: Stretching, Traning, Combos, DancePros:Fast pacedJillian moves as she explains so you can see various anglesCons:Moves are not explained very wellThe basic stance is never givenThe pace is very fast, with few repetitions (around 1 minute per move)Very few stretches to warm-upOnly a few beginner moves are shown, mixed in with intermediate movesRecap: This is NOT a video for an absolute beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXcellent!","review":"Jillinas instructional videos are one of the best I own. She is an amazing dancer and a great teacher! I look forward to her putting more out! If you are into belly dance i definitely recommend getting Jillina's! Enjoy and have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This was the worst bellydancing video I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. She spends more time dancing in front of the mirror idolizing herself than she does instructing the viewers on how to perform the routine. You constantly have to rewind and rewind and rewind some more to practice the moves. She only spends a few seconds on each move.P.S. If I would have been allowed to I would NOT have given it a star but the system did not let me proceed without rating it.. I give it a double thumbs down. This was simply HORRID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow, very helpful!","review":"This is a great DVD for beginners. I bought this DVD when I had hard time to learn some things during my belly dance classes(the teacher was great, but with the DVD you can pause it, watch some parts a few times...until you get it :-))). Even my belly dance teacher could see the difference :-) I give four stars, because I don't enjoy the final choreography that much. I think it could have been more elegant and joyful, but the practice is really very good and you'll learn a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun, but NOT for beginners!","review":"I can see why the video gets such good reviews. Jillina is a very skilled woman and she repeats the dance sets enough times that you can memorize it; however, it's very, very fast-paced. I'm still a beginner, and I can't keep up that well yet, but I would recommend this for any intermediate dancer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellydance Review","review":"This dvd is definitely a workout, and you have to skip back some because she cruises through explanations pretty quickly, but it's really good if you've already learned some bellydance. The choreography is fun, and it's nice how she works through it step by step and starts from the beginning each time she's teaching you a new step so you can practice the dance up to the new moves. It's also very fun watching her performance at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD, but not for newbies","review":"Jillina is a great dancer and teacher. I would caution anyone brand new to bellydance to gather a little experience (think Neena and Veena) before taking on this DVD. She does go a little fast, and some skipping back for a repeat is bound to happen. Jillina does reference some other dance styles, but I didn't find it hard to figure out what she was getting at. Her use of the mirror is handy, and I felt she explained the moves well."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderbread bellydance","review":"I am so disappointed in this dvd. This woman has no personality in her dance or her instruction.I would have gladly endured this if she had been a competent instructor, but she seems to feel that if she shows something once with a botox smile, it is enough.This is not what bellydance is about. It is about what little isolation exercises are about. She has the body of a \\"western dancer\\", so all of the affirmation I hoped to get from a little \\"curve\\" was also ditched. I am quite surprised that so many people recommended this dvd. That is the only reason I bought it. People seemed to think that this was at least well taught. I wish it had been. I'm just glad I only bought one dvd rather than the set of three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for beginners to intermediate","review":"Jillina explains the basic moves without spending too much time on each, and has a good teaching style. She is a world class performer, but also excels at choreography. While you see some professional dancer's routines that are just really boring, the choreography featured is simple enough for a beginner to learn, but has enough movement, and variation to work as a routine for a club performance. We will look forward to getting the next DVD in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy","review":"I've loved Jillina's style since I first saw her so I was very excited when this affordable set of DVDs came out. When I started belly dancing just four years ago, all that was available from reputable dancers were VHS tapes at 3-4X the price! In this video, Jillina teaches a fun choreography to a shortened version of a classic Egyptian song. This is not a routine for a completely inexperienced dancer. Some of the transitions are a bit rapid for a total novice. It is a good challenge for someone who has already taken some belly dance lessons. My only complaint is that the camera man often zooms in on Jillina's upper body and midsection during the practice session when I would like to see what her feet are doing! Overall, it's certainly worth the price!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-c8a62efc"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/12.md","filePath":"library/12.md"}'),R={name:"library/12.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
