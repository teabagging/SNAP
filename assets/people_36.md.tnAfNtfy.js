Until now. After the stunning S/D/A/A, possibly his finest work, I was not expecting 14 MOR dirges like this. By the end of the track 13 I'd lost the will to live, or at the very least, the will to stay awake. His voice doesn't suit the songs, and the arrangements are unimaginitive to say the least. The only saving grace is Imagine, a hard song to do justice, but his version is quite pleasant. I never thought I'd be giving Rick a bad review, and I'm gutted."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!","review":"I truly did not want to believe that this was one of my beloved favorites, Rick Springfield murdering each and every song on this album, but a person can only go so far on denial. In my case delusion didn't even make it through the first track, and by the time I trudged on through to the end I only got really, really sad.I didn't know that Rick could suck.This album is a massacre. It should be taken away, hidden, and hopefully forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah NO \\"SO SAD\\"","review":"I have been a big fan of Rick Springfield for a long long time and its sad to see the one time rocker releasing a CD like this.The covers are boring to listen too although I do lile the cover of Broken Wings but even that track cant save this CD.

Right now you will not get the CD here - and I must admit - it's no big deal! I was high on expectations awaiting the new CD and very excited when I held it in my hands. I'm not commenting on every song; there are some good songs - almost like the originals; but most of them you may play to your girlfriend to impress her with your guitar skills! I was positively surprised after hearing S/D/A/A. Why didn't Rick just move on this way? I hope, he releases a CD with his own songs soon! Rick keep on ROCKING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Longtime Fan","review":"This CD is wonderful. I am a die hard Rick Springfield fan from way back, and I am thoroughly loving this current release of cover songs. His voice sounds so great that I like these versions better than their originals.

He ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mellow Music","review":"This is an album of covers from the '70s and '80s, but several of the songs were new to me, since I don't remember ever hearing them before.

Maybe I am unknowingly comparing this series to the Las Vegas series. Whatever it is, this season of CSI: Miami is missing something. The acting seems so forced and over the top (more than usual). Khandi Alexander's character has been annoying since the inception, but she is just wacked out this season. And I don't know if it's the writing, but it is as if the characters do not even listen to the dialogue of the other characters; they just kind of randomly come out with non sequiters (sp?) or something that has nothing to do with what was said before. It's as if they are all in a daze. Maybe it's always been like this and I just didn't notice, but I don't think so. What I really think is that this is a show about to 'Jump the Shark', or has done so, but we just haven't realized it yet. I guess we just need to see Horatio Caine waterski jumping a pool of sharks while adjusting the sunglasses on his face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same show, different packaging style","review":"I would have given this product 4 stars, but Paramounts decission to change the packaging style dropped it down to a mere 1.The new packaging is a thin pack, which has become the norm for most studios when releasing TV shows onto DVD. This is the second packaging change, the first one occured for Season 5, they changed from the plastic outer sleve to a cardboard one. Not sure if the interior changed, but odds are it did.The only thing I hate worse then \\"double dip\\" is inconsitant packaging for multi season DVD's. Fox started this trend with \\"24\\" when it changed from the brick size digi-packs to the thinpacks for season 5.I wouldn't be at all surprised if the packaing for season 7 is changed to one of those standard looking DVD cases that somehow hold 6 discs. Paramount must hold shares in the company that makes them, because they use them on many of their TV on DVD releaes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horatio Caine is getting old.","review":"I am startimg to hate Horatio.

David Carusso has to be one of the worst actors on TV, he over exaggerates everything and the cheezy one liners and his sly putting on and taking off the sunglasses are more funny than anything, he over plays every line he has on the show. The female actors on the show make it somewhat tolorable but the acting and the story lines are more funny than anything. CSI New York is so much better than this show and the story lines are much more realistic and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - But my son's arm keeps getting stuck!","review":"I like that the highchair doesn't require assembly.

Wait until they fix this before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARM GETS STUCK!!!!!!!!","review":"They need to recall this Highchair.

This is horrible. I called graco and I am going to send it back and get a full refund. I am going to stick with my fisher price booster seat.I never write reviews, but after this incident and all the other reviews about babies arms getting stuck. I felt that I had too. Also when I called graco they said they hadn't heard about this before, so I encourage all other users of this highchair, to call. This high chair is unsafe and I don't want any other babies to get hurt, trying to eat a meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"Other than the one issue which I am about to tell you, I love this chair! It folds up so nicely, sleek and easy to use. But....there is a space about 1 1/2 inches between the seat and the frame of the chair, just below the tray, that my daughter gets her arm stuck in EVERY time we use it! She's a little thing but her arm gets very tightly wedged in this space and its difficult to free her! Please be careful!!!

My daughter is 6 months old and gets her arms stuck every time I put her in this highchair without the big tray. She is on the small side for her age (14 pounds) but I just cant get over how easy it is for her arms to get SO stuck. She has little marks on them after I get them out. This is the ONE thing I hate about this chair. Other than that, it is a decent highchair. I am quite disappointed with the design, after using it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son's arm gets stuck!!","review":"I do NOT recommend this highchair. My son has only used it a few times, and every time he has gotten his arm stuck on the side where the top of the legs meets with the seat. It is a heartbreaking thing that my son now associates highchair/feeding time, with pain. He whimpers every time I pass it, it is pathetic. I will be returning this highchair-and try to reintroduce my little one to a different kind. I don't find the stow away model to be all it's made out to be. I will be going with a standard highchair, like my first 3 children had and enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I thought that this product was going to be great because of the slim fold. But when I took it out of the box, the tray on the highchair was no bigger than the tray on my stroller. There was no way that my daughter would be able to eat off of it. I was very disappointed with Graco, because the rest of their products seem to be very good. It just seems way to expensive for a highchair that only holds a sippy cup and a handfull of goldfish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mushrooms for Asian Dishes","review":"Dried mushrooms, many large pieces , not all broken into tiny pieces.

It plays VHS movies fine except for some annoying problems. About a month after purchase the player started squeeling when fast-forwarding or rewinding. Now this might be only annoying, but it makes me question the quality of the machine considering it started one month after purchase.Overall, the only positive feature is the abilty to watch local channels and VHS tapes.

These are the soundtracks to life.","review":"Susan Werner's songs are deeply felt without being soggy. Always crisp and spare, her lyrics cut through so much folk music mush, unless she is making fun of herself, which she does sloshingly well. A highly intelligent and smart songwriter, Susan does not just turn a clever phrase; she invents a clever concept, creates characters of emotional depth, composes poetic narratives, and illustrates them with bright, textured melodies. Then she delivers it all with masterful guitar playing and an incredibly large, operatically trained, I'm-just-a-folk-singer-intimate voice. These songs are real. Prepare to laugh and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just FolkLore!","review":"As a long time fan of live shows, and a new fan (5 years+) of her recordings, I have to hail this record as yet another stunning achievement by Susan Werner. The recording was different from other albums in a raw way, but it did not detract from the lyrical and instrumental prowess she exhudes. \\" Misery and Happiness\\" I had first heard in concert, and it doesn't disappoint me here. \\"shades of grey\\" is another that converts to disc well also. I can put this in the player, and let it go from start to finish, which is really something to say in a world where records are sold on a one-hit basis and forgotten.While I still harbour favourites from other recordings, this is a timeless addition to my collection. Thanks Susan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire from one of my favorite performers","review":"Susan's great especially when you see her live but this CD is by far her worst effort to date. Where are all the great songs she has been performing all these past years live go? And where did this country side of hers come from? Has she been living in Nashville? Two of the songs save this review from being a total bomb, Stationary and Shade of Grey, but the rest are dismal and something you would hear at amateur night at the Big Boots Bar. I'm not sure long time fans will like this disc. It all sounds rushed and put together by people who really didn't know Susan's music and are trying to cram her into a Martina McBride/Faith Hill kind of category. If this is the direction she wants to head in that's fine but she's leaving me and many people who love her music very disappointed. I wish I could get my money back for this CD and maybe I'll sell my copy on ebay. Better luck next time Suze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Susan leaves behind her fans","review":"This new CD is certainly not what you expect from Susan Werner. Most of the songs are country or even gospel sounding and even these are pretty lame by her usual brilliant standards. There are a couple good cuts on this CD like \\"Stationary\\" or \\"Epilogue: May I suggest\\" but most are truly awful. Her cover of the famous Midnight Cowboy movie song \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" has to be the worst song ever recorded. What were you thinking, Susan! Susan Werner is a great artist and this release is way beneath her talent. If she wants to move in a country direction, that's OK but she will be leaving a great number of her fans behind, including me. Based on this CD, I will not buy her next one and that is sad since I own the previous four she made.

And when your cord gets tangled up inside the enclosure (and believe me, it will) you will notice how alarmingly fragile the enclosure is.There is a spring mechanism to help rewind the cord back into the enclosure. But the locking mechanism when the cord is extended is hit or miss, especially if the cord is pulled out to it's full length. In fact, I don't think there is a any real locking mechanism at all, ZipLinq depends on friction or maybe the moon's gravitational pull to stop the cord from retracting back into the case. That sliding noise you heard last night in your hotel room? That was the Ziplinq slowly pulling your IPod off the bedside table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Cheap Cheap","review":"We bought this item and within a few days of use, the plastic enclosure had broken apart on two of the 9 we bought.

That is the ONLY decent work of prose to his credit. Reservation Blues... couldn't finish it, because half wya through there was still no meat to the plot or characters. Indian Killer? Give me a break. Now this. The Toughest Indian is nothing but syrupy contemporary prose written for critics to praise, not for readers to enjoy. \\"Saint Junior,\\" for example, meanders through various story lines before going...nowhere (in 38 pages!). The title story was ALMOST my favorite, but the sudden twist of a homosexual encounter did not fit the story -- and certainly not the writer. Gay fiction is done best when it is honest, but this is calculated for effect. Folks, buy his first anthology, and you'll own a piece of American literary heritage. Buy this and you'll own the equivalent of the Spice Girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Boldly written!","review":"This is perhaps the best book of short stories I have ever read. Typically, I am a fan of novels. When this book was assigned for a Native American Lit class, I was a little disappointed that it was a compilation of short stories. My disappointment only lasted half way into the first page. Sherman Alexie is a writer with balls. He writes bravely and doesn't hold anything back.Most if not all of the stories deal with white/Indian relations in one way or another and many deal with gay/lesbian/hetero relations as well.Alexie is hilarious when he wants to be and deadly serious when he doesn't. This is a book that is well-suited to today's fast paced and multi-faceted world...This was my first experience with Alexie's work and I cannot wait to uncover another masterpiece! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed Prose","review":"I agree with the reviewer who states that \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto\\" work is ALexie's only superior work of fiction. The latest work fails on all the levels which made the other book a succes...namely, he rehashes stories without passion and without original language...it reminds one of the dropoff that Thom Jones had with his short story writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I have enjoyed all of Mr. Alexie's books and thought the movie, Smoke Signals was great. Good enough I added it to my video library. But I was severely dissapointed with the Toughest Indian in the World. I thought the stories were hard, rude and completely uninteresting. If Mr. Alexie's thoughts were to portray today's Native American as a member of mainstream America he missed. Perhaps some are as portrayed but most are normal, hardworking, family loving, go to the movies, go out to dinner, have a bar-b-que, loving, grouchy, kind, not so kind people."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"I expected a story with alot more humor.

If you have a taste for a sexual read about Indians, wait don't get too excited yet, this is not just about sex. No, no, no it is a graphic novel that lets you the reader know every detail while describing two men having homosexual intercourse in the story \\"The Toughest Indian in the World\\" now that may be something you are intrested in, but as for me I would rather take a bath. So if you are in the mood for homosexual sex, fat naked Indian women, chump men, adultry in the worse degree (with a fat ugly man) and little boys being forced to have sex with an older woman while doctors watch, don't buy this book, you can have mine for free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A change of pace for Alexie","review":"As much as I've loved Alexie's work in the past, I'm sorry to say this book really disappointed me. There is certainly some lovely prose and a few moments that truly moved me, but overall this book, for me, simply lacked the sparkle and emotion always present in Alexie's previous works. There were moments, in fact, where I felt he was simply trying to shock us with the writing, which seems way too cheap for a writer of such talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing","review":"The writing here is absolutely breathtaking. I couldn't stop thinking about the characters long after I'd finished it. The man who holds up the International House of Pancakes, the fighter in the bar, the washed up basketball player trying to find his place in the world...there were so many times that I felt astonished and truly awed by the writing. My favorite story was certainly the first one, but they are all strong, insightful and most of all moving stories. I have read only one other story from I believe another collection and I only regret that it's taken me so long to discover Alexie's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and interesting","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and found it well written and detailed.

By turning to Him, you can turn your life around no matter what your circumstances are.

Unfortunately Wolke wrote this book with an annoying and patronizing style which I just couldn't stand after the 150 pages. I hung in there as long as I could because I appreciated the raw content, but after the umpteenth time of having some tidbit of information preceded by a volume of attempted cleverness, cuteness and forewarning, I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, straightforward and concise","review":"This book is well written in a straightforward manner and with an effort to avoid 'high tech' lingo. Very interesting info on the 'advertising' and 'marketing' part of food labeling. It also cuts through all the hype of special salts, sugars and other basic products to discuss the origin of the product, the processing and of course it's use in our food. I recommend this to anyone who likes to know the 'real' science of food and cooking. No agenda, no cause to promote. Just fun facts and interesting science about a wide variety of food and cooking subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comment on review saying the book was \\"unprofessional\\"","review":"According to the reviewer Ramanujam Rajagopal (Seattle, WA United States):\\"If you have a college education and a sense of humor that transcends pop culture, I suggest you look elsewhere for good reading.\\"I do have a college education: undergrad Cornell/grad school MIT.

Not perfect, but heck, neither am I."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do Better","review":"If you're interested in kitchen science, chances are you're not stupid, so why buy a book that treats you as if you were?The Q&A format means the book can't fully develop a satisfactory explanation; it also reads like a collection of magazine columns. Any explanation that sounds even vaguely technical is covered in as few words as possible, sequestered in parentheses and prefaced with the irritating word \\"techspeak\\". This does nothing for the book's already patronizing air.If you're a thinking cook who has taken High School chemistry, you'll be better off with Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking, an acessible classic that is used as a textbook at the Culinary Institute of America--a distinction this book will never claim.This book will serve admirably as an introduction to food science--for your nearest reasonably bright 7th grader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for real amateurs","review":"If you know absolutely no chemistry, have never read a cookbook, and have no powers of observation, you might like this book as a just-about-adequate introduction. But for a better-written, more interesting start on kitchen chemistry, try Arthur Grosser's \\"The Cookbook Decoder\\" or Hillman's book (sorry, can't remember the title)or \\"The Inquisitive Cook by Anne Gardiner and Sue Wilson.

Especially good for this reviewer were the ones on salt, sugar and fish smell.Thus, there is a literal mine of good info here for the chef, e.g. what kind of metal makes the best pots and pans, microwaving, defrosting, and even on that hottest summer day, where can one truly cook an egg?All of this is fun in its execution and recipes included, which to me were not that interesting in the entirety of the collection, but a few were winners for my growing, large collection: Rock Cornish Brined Hens; Blueberry Blue Corn Pancakes; Ricotta Fritters.Waiting to compare with Harold McGee's books on same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting stuff","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it does not have a whole lot of recipies if that's what you are looking for but it has a whole wealth of questions you may have always wondered or never even realized you didn't understand.

If you have a college education and a sense of humor that transcends pop culture, I suggest you look elsewhere for good reading. The book is written in the all-too-common short-section format, popular with the attention-span impaired, and the ideas are wedged between Wolke's loquacious commentary (which, by the way, teaches you nothing). However, there are some interesting tidbits, if you are willing to mine a ton of ore to get the ounce of gold. Furthermore, although the author is clearly not condescending, he is informal to a fault, leaving the reader with rhetorical questions where there should be answers-raising the question: was this book even edited? Take more than a cursory look in the bookstore before paying the exorbitant price for this pedestrian work, and, if you have curiosities about science and food, look to Alton Brown of \\"Good Eats\\" fame-he gets it right where Wolke just gets clueless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting and nothing to do with Einstien","review":"I usually wait until I have finished a book before I say anything about it. I am halfway through and don't think I'll finish it.I was lulled into buying this book by the title. What could be more enlightening than Albert writing about food? Unfortunately this book has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with Einstein. The book has a nice folksy tone and is easy to read but if you are a foodie at all you will know practically everything in it. As opposed to its title it is very basic. The author and I disagree quite a bit philosophically about food but I don't knock him for it, I just disagree. \\"Simply put if you don't know much about food this book is an easy read but if you know what brining is, why not to put a thermometer near a bone in a roast, etc. then this book is not for you.

I was looking for a book to explain the small nuances of how to improve a particular recipe or tweak an ingredient to bring out its fullest potential but I what I found was pretty much a garbled and condescending chemistry lesson -- and not a very good one at that. Wolke's side comments under \\"Techspeak\\" were both confusing and grating. This attitude is something I put up with while going through engineering school but I won't put up with it on my free time with a subject matter I love. Half-way into the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. This is quite a shame because Wolke is a technical consultant for one of the best cooking magazines around -- Cook's Illustrated. Thankfully for us, though, Cook's Illustrated has someone other than Wolke do the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got McGee","review":"Robert Wolke seems to mean well. He tries to present some basic science at a 3rd grade level and connect it to food. But by limiting himself to 3rd graders, his text becomes wordy and tedious. An author writing for foodies might have decided to keep the science in the background and focus on food. Wolke is better at this, but he is far more interested in what he can say about food than about tasting it.If you are interested in food and science, Wolke's book is gruel to Harold McGee's miche."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have Memorabilia for Hardcore Fish Heads","review":"William T.

Aside from a questionable list of songs, this album is a great example of Dylan at his throw-the-paint-on-the-canvas best. I might be in the minority when I suggest that Dylan's forgotten words and muffled voice exemplify his confidence rather than his shortcomings. I enjoy the \\"Slow Train\\" on this album better than its underdeveloped sister studio song because Dylan's inflection and rawness give it the muscle that it lacked. Let's not forget about Garcia either, whose solo brilliance (I Want You) shines at times. Yes, the songs are loose and Dylan and Garcia are unsure at times when a solo should begin (\\"Serve Somebody\\"), but if Dylan has taught us anything, it is that art mimics life. This album is a fine example of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really not that bad","review":"I have to say, I'm pretty surprised at all the negative reviews on here. Sure, it's no \\"Rockin' The Rhein\\", but its not one-star material either. Dylan & The Dead is really not that bad at all. I'm somewhat of a Dylan fan, I'm a full-fledged Deadhead, but I really don't think I'm biased in my review here. While a few Dead songs (Heck, a few more songs PERIOD) would've been nice, we've still got a good disc in the seven tracks that we get. I'd kill for a live version of Dylan and the Dead singing Morning Dew, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Let's conisder this album a masterpiece in that it is not marred by a single listenable track. A friend of mine saw this tour at the Metrodome in Minneapolis and he was a Dead fanitic and LOVED Dylan and the best he said about the show was it was a debacle.Muddy sound, uninspired vocals, tired guitar solos by Garcia, horrendous back-up singing-- I've got bootlegs that sound better than this official release. This should only be purchased by those who have to have ALL the official Dylan recordings, then let it sit on the shelf and collect dust until you decide to listen to all the Dylan albums in chronological order, then make certain you get up plenty of times so you don't have to listen to whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"Great cover. Unfortunately, the music is just godoffal. Like the movie \\"Hearts of Fire,\\" the release of these live recordings seems to suggest that Dylan has finally found his legend too much to bear. \\"You think I'm great?\\" he seems to be asking. \\"Well then, how do you explain this crap?\\" On \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" and \\"Slow Train,\\" perhaps the best tracks only because they haven't been done to death on live albums, Dylan doesn't even seem to know the lyrics, and what might have been a good rendition of \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" is completely sabotaged by that foolish addition to the chorus (\\"Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door/like so many times before\\"). This may very well be the worst Dylan record ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am still trying to forget it","review":"The first time I listened to it was horrible--I closed my eyes, trying to make it sound better, but it just got worse and worse. I've listened to this album three times, and I still hate it. I hate every song. There are some songs on this album that I would have no clue what they are unless I had the jacket in front of me. If we all go to Purgatory, this one was Bob Dylan's visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very silly indeed","review":"What an ill-conceived and ill-executed foray this is. Dylan is a live artist who also requires the position of orchestrator, allowing himself the possibilities of performing his compositions in new incarnations. It is only then his juices flow. With a band of the pedigree and ability of the Dead at his disposal it would seem he was reluctant to give the required direction. The Dead are a band which require space to paint on their aural canvas. The job of pick-up band does not allow this. This album sounds as though the rehearsing and sound-check were coincidental. The Dead do not get out of first gear and Dylan's voice sounds shot - and he cannot remember his own lyrics, and seems to be suffering from an adenoidal disorder. Given the studio output of the protagonists at this juncture, Dylan and the Dead offers no surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two powerful artistic forces...one terrible album.","review":"Let's just put all the cards on the table, this is probably the worst album of Bob Dylan's career...and from what little contribution the Dead seem to make here...theirs as well. I love Dylan. I love the Grateful Dead. I hate this album. All the songs here are Dylan's, the Dead only serving as his band. I haven't been more disappointed by the outcome of such a wonderful idea in all my life. The only thing that makes this album worth buying...is the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, As in \\"Slow Train\\"","review":"There's a good reason that \\"Slow Train\\" opens this disc. Record companies put what seems to be the album's strongest track first. This will insure airplay. And true, this track did get some airplay. It's the album's strongest track as far as vocals from Dylan and the Grateful Dead's performance. The rest of the record is weak on both counts. I'm not sure a remix and a remastering job would help. I couldn't get to any of these shows and was anxious to hear the results. This was an overwhelming disappointment. One track does not make a good album. I'm not sure I can pin the blame for this poor release on either artist. Maybe some things just aren't meant to be. And while I would'nt us the disc as drink coaster, maybe one could justify purchasing this used just to complete the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal, but still worth a listen","review":"The album is decent. The idea of the dead and dylan rocking out together sends shivers up my spine it is such an amazing concept. However, the music is not that great. Both bands are better than this album would lead you to believe. The sound is sloppy, some guitar slip ups, some timing issues. Engineering seems a bit off too, but live shows are always a bitch to cover. In their favor, it would not suprise me if all of them were tripping face on LSD, so one may not be TOO critical. Worth a listen, find it used, burn it for your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Meeting of Giants","review":"Many reviews here have almost caused me not to order this show. Am I glad I did!!!Great show, do not hesitate. I have no idea what people are complaining about. This Cd documents a great meeting ad cooperation of 2 giants, and this spontenious meeting atmosphere is all along this document. Only negative thought that crossed my mind was - 'Why didn't Dylan chase the dead instead of the sloppy Band on his 60's-70's tour?' He would have done so much better.The Slow Train version here is the BEST I've heard, and the rest is just as good. Sound is good, Music is spontanious and great, could not ask for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's BOB.........'nuff said","review":"I read the complaints below AND STILL WENT AHEAD and bough the CD.I got it home, put it into my PC and played it thru my Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic Card.It felt like I was there.....AMAZING.I bought it to hear more of BOBBY DYLAN,...didn't care much who the backing band was.I wasn't in the U.S in the 80's so couldn't see Bobby touring at that time. This was the next best thing.Don't know how long we will still have Bob with us (It's not dark yet...but it's getting there).... so I'm buying what's available.NICE...to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best laid plans of mice and men...","review":"If it were up to me, I would install this cd on the sound system at a maximum-security prison and play this constantly in lieu of the death penalty. Of course, the Supreme Court would rule this as \\"Cruel and Unusual Punishment.\\" I love Bob Dylan, and I love the Dead. I absolutely despise this album, and I want to use it as a drink coaster instead of a cd. The only cool thing on here is the cover. Otherwise, it's trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brilliant Collaboration 10 Years Too Late","review":"It's a real shame these Super Powers didn't have the foresight to have made this happen in the 70's back when Dylan actually sounded decent vocally and the Dead were so much tighter and explosive. I can only imagine how good this could have been. Here, however, we're left with something that could have been played live but certainly not fit for release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dylan/Dead","review":"I own just about every one of Dylan's studio albums and the entire Bootleg Series to date. Likewise - as my intermittently depleted bank account and beans/rice diet will attest - almost every commercial Dead release (love that cleaned up sound!). While there's a significant margin for subjectivity even among otherwise rabid fans, the unusual balance (that is, for ANYTHING bearing the Dead's name on Amazon) between the upper and lower ratings strata are indicative of a product that likely will require a nuanced taste. Sample it thoroughly first, either here or on itunes, to check the fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great cd!!!","review":"great for curing insomnia, that is. What a lifeless and dull album. The person I bought it from said it as one of his all time favorites...either he was joking with me or needs some help! Seriously though, this isnt to bash Bob. Its just that you expect more from 2 legendary artists! Why was this ever released? \\"Joey\\" is by far the worst cut on this record...i simply cant understand a word of what hes saying; just 10 minutes of babble (literally), and listen to how the tempo speeds up and slows down, like the Dead wasnt even paying attention! Id expect this from a garage band, not the dead and dylan! I couldnt believe they coulndt even hold a standard 4/4 beat. What else can I say, but what a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"someone with the initials ste once said that this album may very well be the worst in either artist's catalogue,but i doni't really think that's true. also i find dylan's lesser releases to be kind of charming, and i've never really understood the greatness of europe '72."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Album Next to Knocked Out Loaded","review":"It's clear that this is his finest work, as the Bard in Leather spins incoherent tales that require the listener to add the actual words learned from prior Dylan albums.

Tracks are mis-labeled!","review":"Regarding the Amazon MP3 files from this \\"Dylan & the Grateful Dead\\" album, two tracks have their labels mixed up: \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" is \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\", and vice-versa. I only discovered this problem after I had bought one thinking I had the other - then I had to buy the other one too to get the track I wanted. I would complain to Amazon but couldn't find a place to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great","review":"fit perfect in my binder, plenty of space for about four cards per slot two on both sides. great price"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Do The Job","review":"Haven't quite organized my cards yet (need to find a binder), but these seem great so far.

I couldn't find any in stores and really wanted them ASAP. I ordered these sheets yesterday and received them TODAY!! It was so fast and I love the sheets. They are exactly what I wanted - and I am always nervous about ordering online. This time I was happily satisfied, but I always am with Avery products. I will be buying more from their company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"Compared to several other manufactures, the Avery Business Card Holder Sheets are well worth the money. They are made of high quality, non-glossy plastic. They do not stick to the business cards or the pages do not stick to each other. They do not change color or begin cracking over time (I have been using these Avery pages for over 8 years, for approx. 900 business cards)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate them","review":"I don't understand why it's got such a high rating. (1) the plastic is so thin, it's easy to rip (2) the stitching are just 'dots' and they rip easily (3) the pockets are so small that there is no way you can put European/Asian sizes, or put 2 cards in back to back. (4) the pocket openings are in the middle, on the narrow sides so you're to squeeeeeze the cards in from the narrow openings which is a challenge each time. In short, I would NOT recommend these pages at all to anyone. Instead, I'd recommend \\"Ultra-Pro 8-Pocket Pages (1952-1956 Topps, Bowman Cards) - 100 Pages per box (Quantity of 1)\\" .

The point of the book is simple, yet invaluable: If you get people on your side you will accomplish so much more than if you go it alone.

As such it is a splendid text for lay formation. Danielou initiates the reader into true prayer as the task of every Christian. From there, he takes the reader all the way to mission with practical suggestions along the way. The text is very accessible, but will reward even experienced readers.There are sections discussing Advent, John the Baptist, Hope and its necessity in contemporary society, humility and corrupt humility, reflection on the Our Father, and an extended consideration of the Holy Spirit. In addition, there is a profoundly Trinitarian reflection on the Redemption.This book would make excellent spiritual reading or reading during Advent, and would be valuable to anyone interested in lay formation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was hoping for a great collection of vintage and rare Mickey Mouse cartoons.

It's the best looking of all the water dispensers, but I only wish that it had a bigger capacity. By the way, Zojirushi is really the standard for Japanese small appliances, and I know at least 6 households with some model of their hot water dispensing pot. All of the newer ones are superb and it just depends on the look, size and volume to determine which one you prefer.We use it to make tea, add water to espresso for americanos, and any other time we need hot water. It was virtually indispensable when our baby was born since we used it constantly to warm up breastmilk."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, good-looking product","review":"We have been regular users of Zojirushi hot pots for many, many years. We decided to get a new one when our old model began to age and become feeble in its water dispensing. This new model totally overcomes that problem, having a power dispenser that is easy to use. This model is also shorter and less obtrusive. However, the one problem we have is a result of its short stature--that is, we cannot directly dispense hot water into a coffee cup that has a Melitta-like plastic cone filter on top because it is too short. The 2 workarounds we have used successfully are: 1) to dispense into another container and pour it as a second step; or 2) to elevate it on top of several trivets. This feature is a shortcoming, but perhaps only relevant to those needing more height. Otherwise, we are very pleased with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings...","review":"I have high expectations for Zojirushi's products. I've purchased a similar water dispenser (CD-JSC22) for myself a year ago and I swear I can't live without it because I drink tea all the time. I wouldn't expect it to malfunction in 10 years, but I'm quite bummed by the fact that it's Made in China. I was ready to return it if it's not the best looking dispenser in the market right now.The recipient/user of this pot will be mostly using poland spring bottled water in this pot, so he'll be unable to test out the filter.One can expect to get hot water 24/7 from this pot (except for the 20min down time when the water's boiling), nothing fancy. My family has a larger water dispenser of this sort at home, which is already 10+ years old. If you keep it in one place and take care to not soak it in water, it's an extremely stable product. I'll update this review with any technical issues I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This CD delivers on what it promises. It contains well over 100 Camaro ads that have been produced since the dawn of the car's existence. The small number of third and fourth generation ads are disappointing, but GM is to blame for this, as they drastically cut back their advertising on the Camaro in recent years. The one thing that did bother me about this compilation was the fact that many of these ads appear to be scanned images of actual magazine ads, so the resolution is not that great and there is often a very noticeable line running down the center of the ad, where it is split on the pages. I would think if GM would authorize the use of their ads on this CD, they would want them to appear as clearly as possible. Then again, as GM's lack of advertising in the later years shows, maybe they just don't care about these cars anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Can't They Label Mixed CDs as such","review":"This drives me absolutely crazy and I have been bitten by it numerous times from CDs on Amazon.

Well Baker does a great job of this in the book. The main character sees one sunrise and realizes the world is passing him by and he isn't watching. We get so caught up with our busy lives that we never have time for ourselves. Most of us are to focused on work, school or families. The main character makes it a New Year's resolution to have self thinking time. This first hand account is filled with great little pieces of advice on everyday life.

Not anything truly spectacular, that's for sure, but Nicholson Baker finds a way to make these ruminations readable. Whether it was about the pet duck, the trials of his briefcase, his wish to start a paper towel collection, or his description of a stomach virus, I found myself reading with increased interest, because darn it all, I actually found myself interested in what Emmett thought.

I flipped through it several times on different visits to the book shop, each time thinking to myself that there was no point to reading it, yet inexplicably I kept picking it up. When I got it home I just couldn't put it down. It is original and well observed, and it is also deeply moving and strangely poetic. I found the subject matter and writing style very soothing-- like reading \\"Goodnight Moon\\" as a child. The pureness of emotion was amazing; who'd have thought that reading about somebody drawing the curtains could make you cry? If you open your mind to it, this book will rekindle your appreciation for life's little things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuanced, balanced.","review":"Baker's prose and topics of discussion are incredibly nuanced here, and by the end of the book he's uncovered a whole new type of humor based on soft, delicate minutiae. He has a gift for the sort of highly personal aesthetic observations I would normally associate with a new friend or a lover's uniquely individual tastes, but here these things are communicated in a short and sweet book. Baker loves to observe things with a microscope, that's his style, but here he balances his desire for a radical literary form by channeling it through a very comfortable, somewhat bittersweat, and incredibly observant voice. I still hear the voice two years after reading this work, very subtle and very powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew that a lot of random thoughts can make sense","review":"A Box of Matches is one of the most unique books I've ever read due to the fact that it consists of a man regaling us with his random thoughts, theories and advice.

This novel, however, seems more like it was written by someone else in his writing style, rather than written by Baker himself. It lacks the substantive punch of his earlier works, lacks the beauty and emotion of a narrator relating to others in his world. The pet duck in the story seems more real, compelling, and finely drawn than the narrator's wife and children. (Maybe this is intentional?) In addition, whereas past Baker narrators have described the minutiae of their lives with freshness and wonder, this narrator gets pedantic. Does the reader really need to be told how a rear-window defroster works, or how to wash a dish? I think for Baker fans, this might be a disappointment. For a first-time Baker reader, however, it's a peaceful little book that might lead to his better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this isn't nice, what is?","review":"I am twenty two. I have my doubts, I have my shortcomings, I have my beautiful moments, I have my personal fantasies and theories.

I am hopeful that I will not fall short of my dreams, but when I do I know that I will have new ones. This book has made me smile that smile for the two weeks since I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy, Enjoyable Read","review":"This book is for fans of The Mezzanine or Room Temperature, a story about nothing and everything. A book with no real plot but plenty of story. While I agree with an earlier review that reading this book is like reading somebody's writing exercises, Nicholson Baker is one author who probably journals more entertaining stuff than most writers' published fiction. These stories are random and entertaining, with exquisite details and wordplay that makes the writer in you sigh in jealous resignation. I gave it four stars because it was a little uneven, and some stories were much better than others.Be assured however, that Nicholson Baker's creative gazebo always has a great band.

Her greatness is she doesn't focus on her in this DVD, she focuses on transferring pure technique to you! She puts the Belly back into Belly Dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout and very fun","review":"I enjoy all of the videos put out by this woman. She is a great instructor and it is a fun workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I love Rachael Brice and thinks she is one of the very best fusion belly dancers. However this video she is very disconnected to the audience. Not only that it lacks a varity of creative moves. It seems as though she is not a very good teacher or she doesn't want to reveal a lot of what she knows. This video is for someone that want to learn a little something. Not for those who want to persue fusion belly dance or take it on as a hobbie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I love Rachel Brice, so it's hard to only give her 4 stars.These are drills, as stated, and they are good drills. Practicing this DVD regularly has helped my control as a dancer. I have two complaints.1.) There is only 40 minutes of instruction, not 78. Both the 15 minute practice and the 30 minute practice contain the same moves as the 40 minute practice. They are recorded end to end, 15 min., 30 min, 40 min, and her performance at the end, to equal 78 minutes.2.) This doesn't contain much of Rachel Brice's signature dance style. This is a foundation DVD. It will help you build up to the amazing control that Rachel Brice has. This will not teach you her moves, but this will help you do basic moves with wonderful precision, power, and poise, like Rachel Brice.Honestly, if I didn't feel that the repetition of the moves in the 3 practices was so cheap, I would give her 5 stars. This is a really good DVD for honing your skills as a dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspiring!","review":"Well... it's a pretty, if occasionally weirdly shot, video. Like many other reviewers, I agree that this one is a nice little extra thing to do outside of class or in tandem with other workouts. Rachel is an amazing dancer & I am a fangirl, but sometimes the best need to coordinate their creative teaching energies with a writer/director who knows how to communicate physical techniques to the masses (specialized though we may be) and can more appropriately guide the gaze of the videographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout, beginner be warned.","review":"I am glad I bought this. I have been using several bellydance and yoga DVDs and was looking hard for something that would bring them together. For a workout and for isolations, these workouts are excellent. As it claims, it is definately a fusion of bellydance workout and yoga stretching and strengthening.As a beginning dancer I find this DVD extremely challenging and a solid workout. For all that I try to keep calm even breathing and as Rachel says to \\"look and be relaxed\\" it's quite tough for me to do that and keep up with her. If you're looking for something thats a workout but easier to follow, i'd suggest one of Rania's Bellydance Workout DVDs. If you're looking for a challenge and a way to bring yoga into bellydance, or if you have some dance experience and aren't completely infelxible, this DVD is a wonderful choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST yoga workouts for any bellydancer!","review":"<font color:purple>After reading the reviews of this product, I am moved to post my five-star review of this FABULOUS! dancer's helpful video production. If you are expecting to learn a lifetime of bellydance moves or yoga postures, you need more than one hour's time- it was GENEROUS of Rachel Brice to offer the dance community her own workout, and for such a low price, viewers should be grateful! The practice sessions are not described as a workout or dance lesson, but A Practice Companion, which describes this DVD perfectly. I cannot imagine a more skilled or effective instructor, and await the day that I can pursue real life lessons with Ms. Brice with great anticipation. Until then, I will continue practicing every day. Like another reviewer, I eagerly await Volume Two!! </font>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"This DVD is a wonderful instruction for first time belly dancers. It has repetative drills that greatly help form and tecnique. It really helps me out during the week while I practice for my class. The drops and lifts are something I'm always practicing. Rachel is also an amazing performer and watching her dance is breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel's Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance","review":"This DVD is exactly what it claims to be: yoga moves, mostly \\"down-dogs,\\" with a few progressively more difficult asanas added for more advanced students, and repetitive isolations. Not very creative, but very useful when you just need a certain kind of workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a great addition to my growing Belly Dance collection!","review":"This dvd by the lovely RB, is amazing! Even though it is not an entire workout, that's ok! It's not meant to be. But it is, however, a WONDERFUL addition to any workout you are already doing. Whether it be belly dance related or not! Rachel's voice overs are clear and easy to understand and her moves really work! Some of the drills were tiresome and difficult to do but sticking with it day after day i came to find that i was getting better and better! Just takes a bit of focus, determination, and enthusiasm. I feel more confident as my moves have become cleaner, sharper, *more controlled*. I recommend this for any belly dancer *beginner or advanced!* It's a must-have for your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Tribal Instruction","review":"If you want to learn Tribal Bellydance, this isn't the DVD from which to learn.If you want tribal \\"versions\\" of very basic classic belly dance moves, this will work.You are given ~7 moves: chest lifts/drops, hip circles, undulations, hip lifts/drops, chest 8s.I already know those foundation moves, teach something I don't know.ALSO!! There is waaaay too much yoga in this DVD. I expected yoga warmups from the description...but almost the entire DVD is yoga. You get yoga intro, a few moves, and a yoga ending. This is in every \\"option\\" you have (either 15min, 30min, or 45min). You don't get too many more moves...just more yoga.And somebody needs to tell whoever records/edits the BD superstar videos to actually video the dancer...not their feet, hands, belly button...their whole body moves! We need to see their whole body and their whole dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Join In The Dance!","review":"And what you might ask does a 53 year old, white male from Orange County, CA. know about bellydancing? Good question. The right answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, which is exactly why I'm immensely qualified to review this DVD. This is a introduction to the world of bellydancing so you don't have to have any background or experience in the subject.If you're looking for an evenings entertainment hoping to see beautiful women dancing gracefully and seductively in exotic customs this is not the DVD for you. If however you have wondered about the art of bellydancing and would like to learn more about it, maybe even participate in this activity then you've come to the right place.Fine overall presentation and approach and Rachel Brice is quite lovely. I particularily like the incorporation of yoga isolations into the regiment of bellydancing preparation. Dance is afterall first and foremost a form of spiritual expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"after reading a review where the dvd did not work in their dvd player, i still ordered this, and well it doesnt work, the dvd does not work. what a waste of my money and time waiting for this dvd to arrive. so upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brice not the best","review":"I don't know what it was about this DVD but I just didn't like it. It could just be the sinuous nature of the dancer herself. I know bellydancers that swear by her, but I didn't find the instruction that overwhelmingly educational. The extras- that included a performance were defintely the highlight of the video, kind of like watching a train wreck - I just am not moved by skeletal types though, I prefer to see women more like myself dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical issues","review":"Both times I tried to play the CD on my \\"media\\" laptop it crashed my computer. I have successfully played many other cd's on my laptop but this one was a no go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bellydancing or Gothic Dancing?","review":"After watching this DVD one time (and I had to force myself to watch it all)I must say I was not happy with this DVD. I own over a 2 dozen Bellydancing Videos and out of all of them, I have only gotten rid of 2, one was to Nasty, and This one. Which is very Gothic and not what I like. I showed my copy to my Tribe and none of them liked it either. Sorry Rachel."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weird???","review":"Did not like this one at all. very bizzarr.not at all like I thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"Rachel is a beautiful and amazing dancer. She breaks down dance moves in a clear way beneficial for beginning and experienced dancers alike. The yoga in the DVD compliments the dancing very well. It's also nice that there are different lenghts of workouts so that there are no excuses to skip practice, even if you're crunched for time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUH","review":"lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame lame painful to watch.

It's a pleasure making business with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for those who are more advanced","review":"I love and admire Rachel Brice's abilities, however, this is DEFINITELY NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Had I been able to keep up, it would've been great. But, as I am just a beginner and have never been shown how to do the moves, it would've been nice if she had gone slower and explained each move in more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout for a short or complete","review":"It is a great DVD for intermediate dancers to advanced dancers. The Yoga included it helps you a lot to gain flexibility and strength. The work out are excellent divided so if you just have 15, 30 or 45 minutes, either one that you choose it will help you to feel your body with more energy and you will also be able to work out even if you don't have a lot of time.Rachel is an excellent dancer and as a teacher she is also great on showing you how to do the movements and making it easy for you to follow. I will recommend this DVD to anyone even if you are experience because i learned from them that you always can practice basics and found another turn to the movement that you didn't see before, just like with the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it but the disc only playe 2 times and then both my DVD's rejected the disc. Sad!","review":"I am really impressed with Racheal's dancing, so I really wanted to work on this disc but there it sits on my shelf. I got thru it 2 times with many restarts, begging both my players to do the deed but no. I am going to registered for her workshop maybe then I can get some of her influences. I also plan to buy another DVD player in the near future and maybe then I will see what others are talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"the very first dvd a tribal fusion dancer should buy","review":"this is the very first DVD a tribal fusion dancer should buy.... Some of the moves are hard but with a little repetition you can build the ground work for all other moves..Rachel is amazing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and repetitive","review":"I was looking forward to receiving this DVD based on the other reviews, but I was disappointed. While the quality of the video is good, the narration is clear, helpful, and intuitive, and I liked that she did the moves in front of a mirror so you can see all sides, I found it overall to be extremely dull and repetitive, just the same old things over and over.Her performance is interesting and her technique is flawless, but there is only one short performance segment. I would have liked to have seen more.I might pull this DVD out again and try to emulate some of her moves, but this DVD seems to be more for the yoga enthusiast than a belly dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did i do it","review":"i thought it would be a combo of a lil bit of this & a lil bit of dat. It was a lil bit of what & a whole lot of girl get your money back. No really i watched it before i was gona try it like i do all my other vids & i was like what is this.

A world-renowned teacher and leader of The Indigo bellydance troupe, Ms Brice shows you examples of yoga and stretching to condition your body, then guides you through physical dance movements that will become the moving essence of not just your body, but also your emotions and spirituality. The workouts and training in this DVD are certain to give you a healthier and more creative feeling of yourself! A definite choice for the new woman on the 21st century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video, good quality","review":"The dvd is in great shape, but it did take almost 3 weeks to get to me.On the other hand, it was really cheap :)We all have to prioritize."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"I am a little disappointed at what I got. from the entire CD the onlything I enjoyed was the \\"step by step\\" 15 minutes dedicated to those who want to learn to belly dance, the rest of the CD was about Rachel Brice talking, yak yak yak, then more commercials on other CDs. I would have liked to have more of the Step by Step instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a workout?","review":"I've taken yoga for several years and just started taking belly dance classes and wanted additional practice. This DVD will make you sweat. You get the yoga stretches and the belly dance cardio...nice mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am an advanced bellydancer and I love all dance styles. I was amazed by Rachel's performance in the Bellydance Superstars video and I ordered immediately her DVD. I hoped to learn the secrets of her incredible flexibility, which I partly did. But still the DVD has a very poor content, very few yoga and dance movements are shown and, I regret to say this, but the performance is ugly. I gave it two stars though, because the movements are perfectly broken down by Rachel and the position of the body is always the correct one, which is very rare in such DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I usually only review DVDs I really love, but felt I had to say something about this one, seeing as I bought it after reading the spotlight review \\"I'd give it more stars if I could!!\\"I watched the intro and it looked so promising - Rachel is an amazing dancer and her yoga form is good - and I loved the idea of having 15, 30 and 45 minute workouts. Alas, there was little substance to the actual workouts. Even the 45 minute practice was dreary and disjointed - a couple of yoga poses (sun salutations with lunge - very hard the way Rachel does them, then straight into locust pose), a few bellydance drills and then a couple of yoga stretches at the end. In the intro, Rachel is shown doing pigeon pose, bow pose and another backbend. Where were these in the workouts? I can only assume she had little editorial control over this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga or bellydance","review":"I bought this dvd for the yoga as well as the drills - i know what drills are and that is what I wanted. The blurb says for any level of dance student. However, I fond the yoga impossible (I could manage corpse position!) It's certainly not for anyone who hasn't done yoga before. The drills are good but you don't get much for your money as each section is the same as before and timings include yoga. Beginners should buy Jenna Bellydance Basics and beyond for drills and instruction. More advance students might want more content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaching or exhibit?","review":"Though Rachel is amazing, she can discourage beginning dancers with unrealistic moves that are unattainable to most. I love tribal style, however most of this teaching method was lacking and looked more like a personal workout and exhibit.The short clips of performance remind me of a contortionist. I did not gain anything from this video ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I had been anxiously waiting for this DVD since December. When I finally received it I popped it in the DVD player and was bored almost instantly. I thought that it might progressively get more difficult but it remained extremely slow. The moves are very much for the beginner student but they too might not feel challenged enough by the end of the tape. I was disappointed that I didn't learn any new yoga or bellydance moves nor will I be able to use it as a practice tape (too basic). Mostly I was bummed because I am a huge fan of Rachel Brice and I don't think that this was made with much thought.The performance was not worth the purchase of the tape. Probably better to buy the Bellydance Superstar DVD or one of Jillina's instructional DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource for the entire year!","review":"With chapters like \\"Just-me-and-mom time\\", \\"traveling made triumphant\\", and \\"Husbands have summers too\\", this book will become an invaluable addition to your bag of tricks.

This book is from a Christian stand point and mentions many biblical verses, making time for devotions, and lots of Christian music and book suggestions.

I found it a hassle to have to keep closing the hood to use the optical viewfinder and open it to check results. So I tried to remove the hood from the mounting bracket, but instead it pulled the adhesive mount off the LCD screen. It ended up tossed in the junk pocket of my camera bag. I haven't tried to mount it again. I consider it a failed experiment. Sure it would work okay with a point and shoot camera with no optical viewfinder. It opens and closes pretty quickly, and easily enough if you don't have to do it for every shot, or group of shots. For a DSLR it's just too much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Panasonic LX5","review":"I purchased this product based on Amazon's \\"what others also purchase\\" recommendation for the LX5 but it is too narrow for the LX5 and too large in the vertical dimension so the adhesive area extends over the edges and past the bottom of the camera because it is limited on the top by the presence of the hot shoe and accessory port cover.

I did find some benefit of this hood cover.I still use it on my Sony HC9. its not bulky like the Petrol brand, however they dont block as much sun either. depending on what color your camera is, just take a small strip of 100mile and hour tape and run it n the back of the LCD vertical ways.

We started watching this christmas night and we are still watching them. Whenever we finish I am planning on watching them over again until season 7 is released on DVD. Not to mention you cant beat the price, you are not going to find all 6 seasons for any cheaper then this, plus free shipping. Love it.Bottom Line - If you like CSI:Miami you cannot beat this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off good but...","review":"I loved the first two seasons of this series but after that it started going downhill. Now it's the same diatribe each week. The crime, the tag line from Cane and the investigation and conclusion. The characters have turned into automatons. Robotic people, who hardly if ever crack a smile or joke with each other or show any kind of emotion. It's boring and unrealistic. The series has now taken a slight turn to the absurd with some of the storylines. The realism has gone out the window and they've traded it in for the typical hollywood glam. Not something I'd recommend after the first two seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and compact","review":"If you want just a simple set of tools, this is a great set at a great price.

That date came and went. Then in September/October sources both here and elsewhere on the internet claimed December 2005, January at the latest. Then we get claims from January that it will be a couple of months at the latest. Tired of the rumors, I called Buena Vista Home Entertainment (the official source of the DVDs) and this item is no longer listed on their release calendar, although the CM indicated that they remembered it recently with a TBD release date.We can only guess why this has occured, and anything else is speculation. 2 stars, Disney's trouble with this disk is making hard-core fans unhappy. Right now you are better off with the Extinct Attractions Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't freak over the 2010 release date","review":"The July release date apparently came and went. Amazon says they have not been informed of a new release date, so they use January 1, 2010 as a placeholder. Hopefully Disney just had some production delays and will provide an updated release date soon. Rated it a 5 because I expect to love it when it finally comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say it's not so!","review":"2010?! Are you kidding me?! Please say it's not so!

It stands to be pretty great from the buzz about it, so I recommend it whenever it comes out... which better be soon and not 2010 if Disney is smart.

Plenty of room for everything I need to put in it, plus enough pockets to help keep things organized. I've had the bag for about two months now, and although it has never been over-filled or handled roughly, the stitching/seams are starting to come apart on the inside. This is simply poor quality. Would not recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also an EMT bag, an MD bag, a technician bag...","review":"I've gone through several bags, cases and improvised solutions to cary everything that I need to keep handy while also keeping everything organized. This bag has served well, and is still lasting like a champ. It's very sturdy, and also has enough padding to protect more expensive sphygmomanometers and stethoscopes while keeping them easily reachable. Sort of works like a medical instrument briefcase, at least for me. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was fooled.","review":"The picture for this bag makes it look like it has some structure and size to it. It doesn't. For right around $30, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. It looks and feels cheaply made and simply doesn't offer much room. Take the search for a nice medical/nursing bag elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Mickey Mouse","review":"Think twice before purchasing this DVD for your child.

In those seasons, plenty of people came and went, all of whom were amazingly talented. Britney, Justin and Christina were only on there for the last two seasons. I beleive that some poeple who have never seen the show before are going to be surprised to watch it and find that besides Christina, who had an amazing voice, Justin and Britney were pretty average. WHat I hope happens is that the tiny glimpse of the rest of the cast members will stir enough curiousity that the seasons will be released indivdually. And, lastly, while Britney and the other two are super famous, it's a pain to see Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling and JC Chasezs completely left out. As a matter of fact, those of us who watched the show back then, remember a time when the screaming girls were screaming for JC and Keri, two of the most popular cast members on the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school. I was very excited to see that Disney was releasing this, even if it were only a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show. The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the talent of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter. All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes. I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to MMC Fans","review":"Being a true MMC fan from season 1 to the end I'm very disappointed! I would rather have all the episodes instead of skits highlighting just THREE MMC'ers (who were only in the last two seasons mind you). I think if they would want to produce a product, produce one that is worth it! Or, if you want to feature the stars of the 90's MMC why not also include Golden Award winner Keri Russell, fellow NSYNCer JC Chasez, actor Dale Godboldo, and \\"The Party\\" members?? To me it's a tease, and not what the MMC fans truley want. That's just my opinion though, and you can take it for what its worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bait and Switch","review":"From a big JT, Brit, and X-tina fan: This DVD is soooo disappointing. The DVD is comprised of whole episodes of MMC- and very little of the episodes has Britney, Justin, or Christina featured. There is only one song where Brit and Justin sing (a duet), and only one where Christina sings. Other than that, all they basically show are lame \\"hometown profiles\\" which last about 60 seconds each. You get better content from a \\"Behind the Music\\" or \\"Driven\\" episode. There's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Britney, Justin, or Christina. Lame, lame, lame, and disappointing. I think the total on-screen time of real content is about 12 minutes. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I thought this DVD was going to be highlights from only them and their featured skits. I was completely disappointed to find out it was episodes involving everyone. Granted I used to watch MMC everyday so it was nice, but not when you are expecting something completely different. I don't think I saw a skit without Jimmy Fallon on his best of SNL DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment to Real MMC Fans","review":"Four epsidoes from JUST season 6? I agree with most of these reviews in that Disney is just trying to jump on the Britney, Justin and Christina bandwagon. This is such a disappointment to those who watched, worked on, and truly loved the show. The real highlights of MMC were the other talented cast members, who were not featured. Dedicated fans know that Britney, Justin and Christina were never the most popular 'teers--why create a DVD just around them?On the plus side, this DVD features two of the better Season 6 skits--Generation Gap Shoppping and Everybody's a Winner (none of which include Brit, Justin or Christina). And, it has some good shots of 'teer siblings and friends like Trace, Jamie Lynn, Laura Lynn and Rachael (if this is interesting to anyone).This DVD will flop, and it deserves to. Disney needs to get their act together and create something that would embrace what the show really was--or not do anything at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked!","review":"My Surround Air never worked with the power adapter.

I have cloth chairs with the pill pulled up by my cats. This device did not even begin to do the job. Could do better trying a hair clipper or electric shaver.

Can't believe the manufacturer ever actually tested this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty useless","review":"I purchased this 'heavy duty' shaver to help get rid of some of the pilling on my couch. The thing just STOPS. I thought perhaps the pills on the couch might be too much for any shaver, so I tried it one a sweater. A little better - started to get rid of the pills - then it STOPPED AGAIN. I don't know if this thing is defective, but I doubt it - it's most likely just poorly made to begin with. Sigh. My search for a decent shaver continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too shaby","review":"i read a lot of negative things about this fabric shaver...but i had no problems with it. my couch was pilling really bad so i needed a heavy duty shaver. this one worked great. since it plugs in instead of using batteries...the power was great and consistent the whole time. the only negative was that it took a loooong time to do the entire couch. but i guess if it had taken off layers any bigger there would have been holes in the couch :). overall...im happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surround Fabric Shaver","review":"This shaver works great...but you have to be careful and make sure your fabric is flat because its so good that it will eat your sweater if you're not careful.

When I got it I right away cleaned our sweaters and they look almost brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the extra money, buy a better shaver","review":"I had the same problem with mine stopping.

They were all looking pretty fuzzy and balled up, so time to shave them. I like the AC part over battery but it takes forever and ever and ever to just get a little bit to come off of the sweater. I know the blades can't be super sharp on these or they will go through the fabric, but come on, a little bit would be nice. I felt more like I was giving my sweaters a nice vibrating massage instead of trying to get the fuzz off. Not the greatest for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"I returned this product. I tried it on a sweater, I stayed in the same spot for 20 minutes and it didn't shave.

I just got it out after it had been stored for a few months and apparently the motor has gone out. I tried to use the battery option as well as the electric plug and nothing happens when I turn the shaver on. Its been over a year since I purchased it so the warranty is no longer in effect.

I got out my battery operated Fuzz Wizard, and the reservoir was filled with pills in 10 minutes, and the coat looked beautiful.

I was looking forward to the Mickey Mouse Club on DVD as I had fond memories of watching it every afternoon after school. This has not aged well. \\"Spin and Marty\\" and \\"The Hardy Boys\\" serials are still enjoyable (they were both serialized on this program). The rest of this resembles an endless talent show put on at your local public school by some local kids. It isn't very entertaining. It gets tedious quickly. It moves very slowly. The production numbers were expensive by children's show standards in the fifties but they look cheap and tacky by today's standards. Dull. I used my fast forward button a great deal on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie in Waiting","review":"Yamashita's book is just short of a tour de force. It's engrossing, jauntily satirical and multicultural to a fault. I agree with the other reviews that find it a direct indictment of materialism as well, but I was more intrigued by her apocalyptic vision for LA. The city of angels has always been a focal point for artists, and many think its time of burnout will come. Yamashita thinks that the destructive impulse will come from within and from nearby borders, and that makes this book even more fascinating as a possible scenario for the end of LA as we know it. Why hasn't this become a movie, or even a movie of the week? The fever pitch she manages to end chapters with at times would directly translate to the large or small screen. Maybe the Hollywood vultures haven't found her yet. It's only a matter of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Oranges and Narcos...","review":"Rest assured, I did not want to read this book and neither did my whole class.

The book offered some insight but it seemed to confuse people more than convey a message. Everyone I talked to in my class about this book (including the professor) was confused about the ending of the novel. Not only did I not enjoy reading this book, but I was left with little closure at the end of the novel.

I broke a key recently and its replacement has no cut out for attaching strings, so I needed a sleeve. The sleeves I found at Staples were much bigger than my card key, so I went to Amazon and found this item. It's only a bit bigger than my card key, so it satisfies my requirements. It seems sturdy enough and has no real downside, no odor or sharp edges. I guess it could have been an eighth of an inch narrower, but that is just a quibble. The RFID works through it, so buy with confidence.[Update: the holder lasted about 3 months before starting to tear. Lucky, I have 11 more to go.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, cards can slip out","review":"This is a decent and sturdy item. I do wish the clip would keep the card from slipping out.

The interjection of biblical elements detracted from the approach I was expecting, thereby making it a sham on so many levels. It is Christian trying to dress up as Zen, and it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Trying to sum up this book, the author's own words come to mind: a \\"street smarts\\" of sorts for Eastern philosophy. It is a unique and refreshing look at the same not-so-obvious-to-some drudgery.It covers basic tenets that will change your life if you live by them. Sluyter avoided meditation details which indeed enhances the applicability of this book to most people's lives. I found the practical advice, in Dean's own original language, very valuable.The general pace of the book is good as well, keeping the reader interested at some level. If you are set in your ways or have a negative outlook, you probably won't find much here. If you have already based opinions on Eastern religions, I'd still bet this book expands your Zen conversation skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing book that talks to you..","review":"This book is quite interesting. It takes the wisdom from many different religions, though it definitely has a very Eastern bent. His writing reminds somewhat of Alan Cohen. Well, that makes sense since they believe in similar things and they both come from a Jewish background.I feel relaxed reading this book as I did with Cohen's work. I would definitely recommend this. I would also recommend Eckhart Tolle's book called \\"Stillness\\". I like it better than the \\"Power of Now\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware: Shoddy workmanship from Marvel","review":"See other reviews for the stories here. My gripe is the poor materials used in these Marvel collected works. Like Thor:Across All Worlds (and every review there mentions this fault) the pages started falling out after the first read. Sub-standard glue and binding result in a book that just crumbles in your hands. Appalling quality control from the normally reliable Marvel. I've stopped buying any of these glossy page, black and white spine editions. Been burned twice now, that's plenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"This looks interesting","review":"I wish I could give this one and the sequel a full set of stars, but I haven't had much of a chance to watch it as of yet.

If you're using it as just a fine comb for grooming, then it's a good thing, but if you actually want it to catch fleas, take a pass on this one.Rotating tines are (much) less effective at flea catching than the fixed tines and I certainly would not have purchased this comb if I had known what it really was..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is an interesting collection of short stories and peotry by Jane Yolen, who has done a lot of her work about dragons. I love the poems about St. George, types of dragons, and Here There Be Dragons (which the title comes from). The pencil drawings by the illustrator are excellent. The short stories are good, but not really masterpeices.

We have seated groups of 2 children all the way to groups of 5. I am confident it would hold 8 children no problem. My biggest child weighs almost 50 lbs and it has worked perfectly for him as well.

The table is quite sturdy, but not easy to just store away, you have to remove the wingnuts and a few screws.

It seems very solid too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great table with a lot of seating!","review":"I do day care and this table has been wonderful! It is a little difficult to put together, but I was able to do it by myself. In reference to it collapsing. It comes with locks to hold the table top in place. If she were to attatch those it would not collapse. I have stood on top of mine, with the locks, and had no problems. The locks prevent it from folding up, but if an adult is going to sit at a child's table then I would advise using them!

Should have read this review section. I actually went to the store to by the Easy Store Picnic Table that is Red and Blue but they no longer have it.

Seats deflect when pressure is applied.3. Crayons don't wipe off unless you use a sandblaster.4. Certainly not \\"easy store\\" considering you gotta break out the tools to collapse it.5. My wife and I wanna be at the table with her to draw, write, color etc. so the table is not conducive to that.I wouldn't put more than 2 toddlers at the table (less than 30 or 40lbs)We're gonna go pick up the Wood Primary Table Set. Those chairs can hold our weight if need be. We would at least be able to sit on the ground closer to the table.

I have 4 children and we do all our activites on this table in addition to having our meals. I collapse the table occasionally, and also have to remind myself to tighten the nuts every now and then as they do loosen with use.I purchased the market umbrella and on sunny days, I take it all outside for water play. I wish they would have made caps to pop over the screw heads on the seats to create an entirely flush seating area, however, of all the picnic tables available, this one is the best for use and value.Seating wise, it can accomodate 8 children, though it is perfect for 4! But remember, it's for children and not able to support the weight of an adult.I'd recommend this table to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ...","review":"Tonight I purchased the Fold 'n' Store picnic table. I was always impressed with the quality of Little Tikes products, so I didn't think this product would be any different (especially when bearing a $69.99 price tag). I was wrong. I have 4 complaints:1. I lost 1.5 hours of my life (granted, the kids were helping) assembling the product only to find that minimal pressure will bend the seat. I couldn't imagine letting two 40-pound children sit on either seat.2. The bolts stick out the bottom of the brace support and could easily cut a child's head when they crawl under the table (you know kids).3. Folding the table flat is a chore as four wing nuts need to be removed, the safety bracket on each leg needs to be removed, and then the brackets need to be reassembled.4. Maneuvering the \`flat' table is cumbersome because the seats are not secure when the table is not being used.

To the reviewer that wrote it was not for them, I think it really was for you. You have a child, who needs love. This book is only a sample of ways we as adult can assure our children we love them. Your situation is no different from everyone else. The book is merely a landscape you can paint the ways you love her and who in your famil loves her.I found the book to be warm and rich in color. The pictures with the words were like being rocked to sleep, as bedtime stories do. I found it a good book to answer the childrens fears in a world full of hate, violence and craziness, who loves me?

After connecting it, the AUX 1 input worked as CD1, Track 11. However, I could find no combination that would select AUX 2. I called the Tech Support number from the installation instructions and was told that: a)This unit has been out of production for more than 3 years; b)There is probably no way to select AUX 2 from my Bose receiver; c)It may be a defective unit, but it is no longer supported, so it can't be repaired if it is bad; d)The best way to get AUX 2 working is to return it, and buy one from a different company.

'Giantslayer' which is the seventh book in the series, focuses on the High Elf Mage 'Teclis'. Teclis is in and out of a number of Warhammer stories as a plot element, but here you really get a good exploration of his character. 'Giantslayer' also explores the rather different land of 'Albion', and the interaction between Dwarf and Elf within the Warhammer world.

Taking this down is a nightmare and reinforced my decision to return it. The poles are held in with spring clips, which are a pain to indent sufficiently to remove the pole from the plastic elbows.

But on page 243 the author does meander to a sensible suggestion for those of us who do not have a \\"seeing eye\\" -- Small-Cap Value Index Funds.Throughout the book the author makes it clear that what counts is performance based on hard numbers but he does not provide that about himself. Is his record at times brilliant but in total not that great like that of Lord Keynes to whom he dedicates so many pages in the end, or is it exceptional like Warren Buffett's?

Some of the writing is fairly pedestrian. The shifts from prose to diary to prose again can be disconcerting for the reader. The content ranges from the insightful to the ridiculous. Although the author does have flashes of brilliance, he also touts ridiculous concepts such as the contrarian indicator, hot streaks and reversion to the mean. As an example of the ridiculous the author dedicates an entire chapter to a man who allegedly could obtain a \\"special\\" edition of the Wall Street Journal which contained future prices.

I worked with Barton Biggs at Morgan Stanley in the late '80's and early '90's when he ran Asset Management and even a stint at running research.

This text is concept and theory - nothing more. Though ridiculously out-of-date in 2004, many techies are looking for methods/tutorials to set up a corporate intranet. This is not the book for you. This book should be purchased for non-technical supervisors and MBA's who need more to be informed of the why's then the how's of an intranet.This is far from the realm of the O'Reilly series.

My newborn fits in the back with his Evenflo carseat (dont spend the extra money for the Combi carseat) and my 3 yr old sits in the front. It's a pretty lightweight stroller and easy to maneuver. I walk 3-4 miles a day with it and my 2 children. It allows me to get out of the house at least and enjoy the beautiful weather! I haven't had any problems with the wheels or the front footrest like some other people. It's easy to fold up and open up and it fits in the trunk of my car. The cupholders come in handy and there's plenty of storage underneath. And my three year old can adjust her canopy in the front however she wants. I would definitely recommend this stroller for the price and convenience. It's much harder to get around with 2 kids than it is 1 at this stroller makes it much easier for me to do what I want to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I had been looking around for the longest time for a double stroller, however it seemed that every stroller would be very hard for me to handle (being 5 feet and 117lbs.) on a daily basis. I have a 2yr. old and a 1yr. old and this stroller is just what I wanted. Its light yet sturdy, both seats can recline, the front one only partially. When folded it doesn't take up much room either. Before I got this stroller I had my Graco stroller with the travel system. Compared to the Combi the Graco is heavy and bulky, and of course could not hold my two dear daughters. The basket on the bottem is a little small for a large diaper bag but perfect for your purse, toys, and what ever will fit. Love the five point harness and the size of the canopies. I didn't expect the front seat to have a nice size canopy, so I was pleasently surprised. All in all I am truly happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"just don't","review":"I got this stroller from a friend, brand new. I took it on a test drive to Disney land for 6 hours. After one day, a wheel is bent, and my arm is totally killing. I have larger kids--42lbs and 28lbs. There is no way this stroller could hold the maximum pounds. I was counting on this because my younger child has special needs and will be in it for a while. The manouverability is rediculous. The parent cup holder is not in a workable spot if you put your diaper bag on the handlebar. Folding it is very difficult unless you're a houdini. I think that's how my wheel got bent. What stroller damages itself when folding? This one! The storage is inaccessable, um need I go on? OK. I will. In the middle of the night I woke up with the most excrutiating pain in my arm.Thinking of this one for big kids--ie, not new born? Just DON'T!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful and at times brutally truthful deck","review":"This deck is very powerful and extremely honest.

Walker cards are wrong. The fool wanders and looks to the left, which is a major heresy in a system where the active side points to the right (active, future) and the passive to the left (past, emotions).As for all minors, while beautifully illustrated, they tend to orient the interpretation by being too specific. This indeed provides a great help to the clueless beginner but influences the intuition of the experienced in a limited way.So this is not the deck I use, but the one I tenderly look at :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"It rusted almost immediately and then the handle broke off from the brush which made it completely useless.

Validity of the book's contents are inversely proportional to the reader's knowledge of the instrument. Good things are some quotes here and there from credible sources, such as Alan Young. Overall, however, it's just a picture book with some accompanying text and many errors spread through the entire content. Also present editorially is the omnipresent Hammond hyperbole, such as declaring the G-100 a \\"technical success\\", which, of course, it wasn't...it was an adject failure which booted Hammond out of the \\"big organ\\" market for good.

I even have a small plastic Titanic model. Having said that I have to admit that I learned even more after reading this very good book. Well done, concise and an entertaining read. Aimed at a younger audience than me, but that in no way cheapened or lessened the experience. For the true devotee I would heartily recommend this well written book. Probably a good point of entry for those new to the Titanic club. Lots of great photos and great captions that accompany them. Titanic light? Not really, just well done and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, But Out of Order Episodes","review":"To every fan of this series, Kevin Conroy is Batman.

It's amazing just how good the overall content of the show is. Superhero shows, before this, were never this character driven and the previous episodes story never had an impact on future episodes. Not the case with Batman. Everything is chracter driven with a secondary action emphasis and the past is not forgotton as the show progresses.This set includes all 28 episodes that span over 4 discs. The transfer to DVD was done with care and the episodes look brilliant. I remember how drab the colors were on the original television broadcast, however on the DVD the blues are blues, the blacks are black, etc.My favorite episode from the 1st season is Heart of Ice with Mr. Freeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"best batman series","review":"I believe this was the first of the DC animated series so the art and color is a bit rougher than later series but I still remember seeing the previews and thinking: I HAVE to see this!!!

This is by far the best treatment of Batman in animated form- but why did Warner Brothers have to include the lame \\"Batman/Superman Hour\\" intro on this set? Please tell me the other three seasons (or the DVD versions) didn't do this! If I'd have known that the digital downloads didn't include the original Batman Intro (which really set the tone for how cool this animated series was), I wouldn't have purchased it. Since there's no Superman episodes on this set (which is a good thing, since Bruce Timm's artistic style was better suited to Batman anyway), having the second rate Batman/Superman intro makes no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A GOOD DETECTIVE TO ENJOY THIS MESS","review":"Don't get me wrong ...

I mean, COME ON!! That was Episode 38!! Disk 3 Episode 17 \\"See No Evil\\" ... that was really epsiode 56!!So Warner/DC have started something they can never correct...

(although I can understand being bitter at WB for their previous releases)... these are the first 28 episodes of the series, and the fact that they're being released on DVD is truly something. This is one of the greatest animated series ever made. The stories are more intriguing and better developed than most drama on primetime TV today. Don't miss out on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Batman Ever!!!","review":"In my personal opinion, Batman: The Animated Series was the only time Batman was done right. Bruce Tim, Kevin Altieri, Boyd Kirkland, and the crew succeeded in creating the Dark Knight without taking away his heart. This cartoon is great for every Batman fan; those just being introduced and those who've followed the Batman for years. With the voice talents of such actors as Kevin Conroy(Batman/Bruce Wayne), Loren Lester(Robin/Dick Grayson), Mark Hamill(Joker/Jack Napier), and Bob Hastings(Commissioner Gordon) this show can't miss.

This animated show is over 10 years old and it holds up today as it will 100 years from now. It took everything that was right about the movies 10% and everything great from the comics 90% and melded it into its own universe. Allowed others to see what I love about Batman.

We were out of town until just before Christmas, and this was a night-before assembly job. Thank all my lucky stars for friends who are serious cyclers and who know bikes, because this would have been a ruined Christmas morning. Both wheels were completely out of true and wobbled horribly, the chain-guard (cheap plastic) was uneven and being raked by the chain (from the factory, not part of the home install), and the brake mechanism is less than desirable.

It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx, which was a complete failure. Drucker didn't even fully analyze Globalization in its entirety.The only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the American worker. Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in.

COMPLICATED WOMEN is a work of advocacy, in a sense -- he wants to rescue the women of pre-Code from obscurity and critical neglect, and he does so ably. This book is more cool-headed amd critical. It's also funnier. It feels more grounded in the real politics and culture of the early 1930s. The research goes deeper. The book is longer.

Unfortunately,only seven seasons have been released. The photography, stories, and the down home attitude of Matlock solvingthe mysteries with his helpers who not only take us across America, but Europe too. You feel you are part of thestory and mentally help solve the mysteries and help convict the criminals in court. I wish that Matlock could have teamed up with J B Fletcher, Murder She Wrote, to do a mystery movie together. I highly recommend Matlock.The 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's had some very good series and Matlock was one of the best.

At most, a few sentences are added at the end indicating that Lee made his way back to Virginia. Even the sophisticated reader has had little opportunity to learn just what happened after the battle. This book changes all that. In great detail, almost every moment of the retreat to Virginia is described. The author makes great but appropriate reliance on primary sources to provide not just the only but the definitive study of these critical few weeks of the war. The book is generally well written, sometimes vivid. However, the author does spend more time than is necessary listing every pound of corn, every mule, every wagon foraged by Lee's army. This makes several pages of the book a numbing read and this data would have been better left to the appendix. This is, however, a small problem in an otherwise outstanding book. A must read for any serious student of the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retreat from Gettysbury: Lee, Logistics, and the Pennsylvania Campaign","review":"A must read for anyone how has intrest in the Gettysbury Campaign.

The latch portion is still riveted (screws would allow me to fix it myself), but I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the redesign has made this a better gate.

What ticks me off is that obviously this is a necessary safety product. Sending it in for repair leaves my stairs open for a month or maybe more without a gate. I'd like to send them the gate and go purchase another immediately. They will not reimburse me for a replacement. Obviously allowing my child to fall down the stairs for a month isn't an option.

I would have shifted the gate over slightly, but our stairway setup doesn't allow for this.

I have dealt with the Customer Service and she wants me to present my receipt to show I bought this gate before they changed to the stinky 90-day policy then she would replace the gate for me. Of course I don't have the reciept and I don't want this gate in my house any more. I believe it is a safety hazard once the knob stop functioning and should be recalled. I want to encourage everyone who has the same experience not only writing to their CS dept but reporting this product to US Consumer Product Saftey Commission & the Consumer Report just as I did. That's hope the consumers' voice can be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gate, even better for older homes","review":"Our initial purchase of a top-of-the-stair gate was returned to the manufacturer. Of course, we always do a lot of research for safety products so we were a little bummed out to have to start a new search. The problem was not with the gate but with our home. At 90 years old, we have tall, thick, elaborate baseboards. All the gates except for this one do not allow adjusting for the true inch difference from top mount and bottom mount. There was a review written by another person who has the same age house as we do and thank you for that review because it made our decision for this gate a no-brainer. We actually like the gate and it was pretty easy to install. The directions could have been written more simply but we figured it out in about 30 minutes. Very good gate and even better for older homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far!","review":"I read all of the other reviews that said the latch will break and we have not had a problem yet!! A neighbor with the same gate had it last about 2 years before the latch broke. I bought it anyway because it was one of few that would fit our opening. Aside from the questionable latch this gate is as good or better that any other gate I have seen. It is a little awkward for one handed use but it can be done. It latches closed very easily and securely. Our 2 year old knows where the latch is but cannot operate it herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking mechanism broken on 2 gates","review":"I bought 2 gates about a year and a half ago. Within 6 months, the first lock broke, today, the second lock broke. It gets stuck in the locked position. The part can not be repaired, so you resort to replacing the entire gate. There are many complaints of this and the warranty is only 90 days. Take note that most of the positive reviews on this product are typically only from people who just bought the item. It is nice while the lock works, but useless and unsafe once it breaks. Good luck if you purchase one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved gate but LOCK HAS BROKEN TWICE IN 2 YEARS!!!","review":"This gate seemed perfect at first, until the lock broke within a year. That was okay because the company was going to replace it, except for the fact that in order to get a replacement I had to return it to the company FIRST. During this time, without a gate, I used a pressure mounted gate that I already had(which is not acceptble for top of stairs) so I was a nervous wreck until I received the replacement. Now, after more than a year of having the replacement gate, this lock has broken as well!! Not quite sure what I'm going to do now because I really like the gate WHILE IT WORKS, but It's been over a year so I'll have to BUY a replacement. I'm looking into other brands....Very Disappointed Customer"},{"rating":"1","title":"How many bad reviews does a product need before people stop buying it?","review":"I just noticed a lot of very similar comments posted here... For me, as with other postings, the knob broke 13 months after purchase (9 months after installation) and First Years refused to replace the part because it was out of the 1 year warranty. Based on the same issues being posted by other people, this is clearly a major design problem. Because of their refusal to accept responsibility, not only will I not buy this gate again, I will not buy a First Years product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it less than 1 star rating","review":"We have 4 of these gates. Three of them broke. The latch is flimsy. It is poorly made & can not withstand too much use although the main point of having it is to be able to go through without having to remove a barrier type or climbing over.When it breaks, & it will First Years customer service will tell you to remove the broken part & ship it to them at your expense (leaving you with no gate) & IF it is still under warranty they will send you another piece. Otherwise you are out not only the gate but the shipping expense as well.Off to find another brand but plan to stick with names that offer better customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems after 3 1/2 years","review":"I have 2 of these gates, one for the top and one for the bottom of my stairs. I have had them up for 3 1/2 years, as I have 3 children 3 and under. They are used extremely often during the day, and neither one has had a problem with the lock breaking.Another reviewier said they used the hands free gate instead. This is also a great gate (we have it blocking off one of the rooms downstairs). However, that gate is NOT DESIGNED to be placed at the top of the stairs!If you are looking for a gate for the top of stairs I would recommend this Simple & Secure gate. You can have the gate swing only one way, so if something does break you don't have to worry about your child leaning into it and falling down the stairs. Easy to use, and only needs one hand to open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Parts Break","review":"I would give this 3 stars, but I need to do my part to lower the overall star rating so people will read the negative reviews. Like most people giving low ratings, I also was disappointed when the plastic parts--of this otherwise very sturdy metal gate--broke after several months of moderate use. So far my problem has been only the hinges, but after reading other reviews I am counting the days before the lock breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great for a year.....","review":"I bought this gate a year ago and placed it at the top of our stairs. My son definately cannot get out or open it on his own. It is very secure and managable. Recently it broke. We closed the gate and now it cannot open. We have resorted to using a flat head screw driver to open it. Appearantly the little hook that locks into place will not move. When we originally purchased it it was $29.99. Now we have to get another door, because it is secure, and now it costs $60.00. We obviously appreciate the safety it provides and willing to purchase another, despite the cost, but we were so dissapointed that it faltered on us....especially now that we have two toddlers in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks...can't be fixed","review":"Very disappointing. We liked this gate as it served it's purpose of protecting our little ones fro the stairs while we were upstairs. But as I read from other reviews, the dial broke and it is impossible to fix. I would not buy this gate again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted for 2 years then broke","review":"We purchased 2 of these gates. Each failed after about 18 months of fairly frequent use. We had the same issue that other customers have documented where the knobs froze. I will say that the gate (not the latching mechanism) is well built and sturdy. However, the latching mechanism/knob isn't the easiest to use and tends to fail over time. I would buy a different gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"My lock broke too!","review":"We got our gate about 5 years ago. We used it about a year with our second child. Well our third is now crawling and we just put it up again. After 3 days up our lock froze in the stuck position. I was about to buy the exact same gate since I was pretty happy with it before and I thought the age was the problem until I read the reviews. This is a problem that needs to be fixed by the manufacture. I'll be looking for a new gate now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GATE!!!!!","review":"We were very happy with this gate for the first 6 months, until the lock broke. I called the company and they told me that the warranty was only 90 days, but they would send me a new gate as a courtesy. Guess how long the lock on the new gate lasted... 6 months. Now it's broken as well and the company told me \\"tough luck.\\" I wish I had read the reviews, because now I see I'm not the only one this has happened to. This gate is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lock WILL break- Don't buy it","review":"As many of the other reviews, I am very disappointed with the Company \\"The First Years\\" The gate was great while it worked, but we only had this gate for 13 months and the lock broke. I called The First Years 1-800 number and of course they wouldn't help me because it had been over a year and the warranty is only for a year. I told the woman that I can't believe that something that cost this much money would break after just a year. I let her know how disgusted I was with this product and she didn't care. Don't buy this gate!!!! You will be spending all that money for something that will only last you a little over a year. STAY AWAY from all The First Years prdoucts because if they know that this gate breaks after a year and keeps selling them, then who's to say it isn't going to happen with their other products!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible gate!","review":"This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke! The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty. They will not even let you buy a replacement part. They want you to buy a entire new gate. What a rip off! Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Years customer service is BOGUS","review":"This gate functioned wonderfully until the locking mechanism broke. The \\"First Years\\" has refused to deal with it, saying it is out of warranty, and that the gate needs to be replaced.They base this upon the manufactured date of the product, not when I purchased it. Notwithstanding that, this is a product quality issue.My comment to anyone out there is never, ever buy a product from a company that doesn't stand behind its products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for a better gate.","review":"We purchased this gate a year ago for the top of our stairs. It was relatively simple to install and worked well, until today. The push button mechanism that allows you to open the gate from either side broke, leaving us with a worthless barrier to climb over. I called the company and they said the piece that is broken is not repairable and the gate is no longer under warranty - which is 90 days. A customer service rep for the company said that particular piece does break from time to time. If you are going to purchase this gate, I would suggest having a screwdriver handy so you can take it apart, or at least push on the locking tabs, so you can get up or down the stairs and not risk going over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2, and both gates' locks have broken","review":"These gates required drilling into 90-year old woodwork in my house, and lasted less than 6 months before the locks went snarky. Extremely disappointing, to say the least. After the locks broke, they remained barely functional for a while longer (knob would move locking mechanism if turned from one side only, strenuously forcing the knob to turn through a loud thwack-click), but it was a PITA every time, definitely not fun to open with a sleeping child in your other arm..And now finally, one of the knobs has completely popped off. Game over.Stay away from these ... or caveat emptor.For me, replacing them means I'll be patching, repairing and painting over the holes from this one, and then making new ones as I install something else. But, one way or another, I have to install new gates (definitely from some other manufacturer) to get our 2nd child through his stumbling years. They don't call them \\"toddlers\\" for nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock Breaks!! Do NOT Buy","review":"I hate this gate. We have purchased three gates in the past two years and all three locks have broken, getting the knob stuck in the locked position. The company has replaced two of the gates, but was quite clear in stating that they were no longer covered under the manufacturer's warranty. I definitely recommend that people do NOT buy this gate. It's not only a hassle to deal with the lock breaking all of the time, it's just not right for anyone to spend approximately $60.00 on a product that is inevitably going to break in about 12 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"I too had the same problem many other's had with the lock breaking after 11 months. I called the company and they will gladly replace it for free...AFTER I send the lock in to them. Obviously when I break out the lock we will be gateless, so in the meantime I need to buy another gate to put at the top of the stairs. I'm stuck buying another one to get a replacement that I won't need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Gate - While it works","review":"I thought that the gate was very easy to install and worked great for the first 1.5 years. One evening I went to open gate and heard the \\"crunch\\" noise. The handle was frozen. Normally I'd take the handle apart to try to repair, but as other reviews point out, it is riveted so it cannot be opened. I was going to buy another gate so could use the same mounting hardware and latch, but with a new born, I don't want to be doing this again in another year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks","review":"We've enjoyed this gate for about a year and a half, but the locking mechanism (the knob) broke and now we have to buy a new one. It has a one-year warranty, but it should last for at least 3 years -- from crawling to preschool. What really steamed me is that you can't just buy the part of the gate that broke -- that would have actually been okay (and I would have still given it 3 or 4 stars)-- but you have to buy a whole new one. It's just a bunch more landfill that the world doesn't need and more expense that I don't need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We bought this gate for the top of our stairs about three months ago when our daughter started crawling. It was some work to get it installed, but our door/wall/stair layout is a bit tricky. The only thing we ended up buying besides the gate itself is drywall anchors, since we weren't able to screw into a wall stud. We have never had a problem with it, every adult who's used it has been able to open it, and now that our daughter is walking around, it holds up just fine to the pulling up and shaking she gives it. It feels safe and secure and I would recommend it to any parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well at first, but. . .","review":"We bought this gate three years ago when our first daughter was born. We didn't use it until she was crawling and moving around, so the gate has gotten about 2 1/2 years of steady, solid use. Originally, we found it very loud when it closed (we'd get her to sleep only to have her wake up when the gate closed behind us). We learned to close it quietly. About a month ago, however (we now have a second child who's just started crawling), the knob froze in the same way that others report. At first, it just locked in place, but we could manually turn the knob to make it lock, then the knob just stopped turning at all. (and with the height of this gate, it's difficult to climb over it and I won't do it while holding my younger daughter!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Gates","review":"I purchased these for a part-time Preschool program and although they are easy to use, they are not as durable as I'd like them to be. However, we will continue to purchase them because of the price & convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT Buy this gate!!!","review":"This gate is obviously a way for The First Years to make a profit & lose a lot of customers. The gate will last only as long as the warranty. Then the spring in the cheap plastic knob will break, usually in the locked position. The First Years will do you the favor of having you break this piece out of the wall, ship the handle portion of the gate to them to check manufacture date & then tell you that it is no longer under warranty. So you will be left gateless & out of luck. I have had three of these. Two to close off kitchen/family room & one replacement. All knobs broke. We are now prisoners in the family room & we get to lift the 35 lb toddler & the 25 lb toddler every time we wish to get in or out.Save yourself the horrors & buy any brand but this one. It's just not worth it to spend $60 for a gate that will only make it through the first year."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE","review":"This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home. I've bought 5 of them over 4 years. We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking. DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months. PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW. IT WILL SAVE YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...until the lock broke!","review":"I have been meaning to review this gate since I have been using it for a little over a year. Well, I now have good reason to write a review as the locking mechanism has become non-functional. I opened it up (no easy feat -- had to drill out the rivits) thinking there was probably a spring that had come loose. But unfortunately the problem was do to the poor design and cannot be fixed due to one of key plastic components breaking. This is quite disapointing since I have only been using this gate for just over a year. I would highly recommend *not* to buy this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock is guaranteed to break!","review":"Like quite a few other reviewers said, the lock on this gate will eventually break - three of our four broke between 15-20 months after purchase. All in the same way, with the knob mechanism becoming stuck in the locked position. Seemed like a wonderful, simple to use gate at first, but what a total disappointment now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this gate works well for only a couple of months","review":"I bought this gate in September of 2004. We use it to gate off our living room to keep our twins safely confined. In December, the turning lock system froze rendering the gate unable to open. We had to get the gate open, so my husband popped one side of the locking mechanism off. We contacted first years about the problem and asked them to send us a new locking mechanism. They wouldn't do this and instead wanted us to send the gate in for repair. This poses a problem as what do we do while the gate is in for repair/replacement? We have decided to leave the gate in its broken condition as we can open and close it now having popped off one of the knobs. It is not in a critical position like the top or bottom of the stairs so we will live with the problem but are not happy. I read another reviewer with the same problem. This gate works very well for a couple of months after that forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"The gate lasted for about 6 months and then the locking mechanism broke and it's now a useless climb-over object. I'd never recommend this gate to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking Mechanism Breaks","review":"Would not recommend this gate!!!!!!We purchased this gate to place at the top of our stairs. Originally we were very happy with it & even bought another one for our deck. Shortly after purchasing the second one, the locking mechanism on the original one broke and the gate was stuck in the closed position. Well, it's a few months later & the exact same thing happened to the second gate. I can accept that the first one may have been a fluke, but for the exact same thing to break on the second one is not a coincidence. I have contacted The First Years, and even though I purchased the gate in August of 2004, since I can't find my receipt, the warranty is only good for one year from the manufacture date on the gate, which was 11/03, so I am SOL.Would not recommend this gate!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great gate with a fatal flaw","review":"I've purchased this same gate 3 times over the last 18 months! It is a very simple gate to install and very sturdy. Works and fits perfectly at at the top my stairs. One major problem, knob/locking mechanism keeps breaking! There is no way to fix either since it is rivited closed. I would buy it again until there is a better gate on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, then it breaks","review":"We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously."},{"rating":"1","title":"We went through FOUR gates!","review":"Please spend your money on a different gate. There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first, but after going through what we have gone through, I wish I would have gotten a different gate. We have twin girls in a bi-level house. A stair gate is a must. The 90 day warranty is a joke, because naturally, each gate broke after 90 days. Same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn. I will say - when it worked, it was nice. But read other reviews, and you will see the same problem over and over again. Shame on me for buying it again. It just broke this past Saturday, after six months of use. I will contact the manufacturer, but as in the past, I'm sure I won't get anywhere. If enough people complain, perhaps they will change the design. Again, please look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knob broke after 18 months","review":"I agree with several other reviews that I have read. It is a secure gate while it's working.

We had it a little less than 2 years and just locked up one day in the closed position when I was trying to get up the stairs with my little guy. I called Learning Curve and they said they only warranty it for 1 year... we didn't even put it up until about 6 mos after we bought it! They told me there was nothing they can do to help me.

Keep that in mind as you buy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this gate!!!","review":"This gate works very well initially but the knobs will freeze, rendering it useless.

As with the rest of the unhappy reviewers, the locking mechanism broke and left us with an expensive but worthless gate. We also found the company's customer service department to be lacking in critical ways, such as customer service. The one thing I haven't seen mentioned yet is what the guts of the locking device look like. Once you crack the thing open, it doesn't take a PhD to see that it's designed so that when (not if) it breaks, it breaks in the locked position. Great for minimizing the company's liability, not great for people who need a gate that functions for two to three years (read: everyone with toddlers.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ETDurkin","review":"We've had this gate for exactly 2 years.

It is strongly recommended that you purchase a gate that is wall-mountable for the top of your stairs, for safety reasons. We have found that this gate works well.

The installation wasn't too bad and got easier with every one I installed. We love the way this gate works and by ever so slightly installing the hinges at an angle (i.e. not perfectly verticle) you can have the gate swing open or shut when it's not locked. Problem is that we have had 3 of the gates fail in the latch mechanism. One day you'll shut it, you'll hear a pop, and it ceases to function. You can't open it without jimmying it or taking it off the hinges. I expected better durability from this company. Obviously, they're not cheap. Anyhow, great gate while it works but you'll probably buy two while your toddler is growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for our unusual staircase!","review":"Our house was built in the 1930s and has lots of quirky features that have occasionally made childproofing quite a challenge! Like one of the other Amazon reviewers, we needed a gate that could be installed at a slight angle (because the left wall of our staircase finishes at the second last step rather than at the top of the staircase). We also needed a gate that could accommodate baseboards. The First Years Simple & Secure Gate does both. I find it a little awkward to open (although with a very curious 11-month old that might be a GOOD thing), and sometimes I wish that it was self-closing, but overall it has proven to be a very safe, simple solution for our unusual staircase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting it to restore","review":"I bought this product because it claims to be able to \\"make an exact duplicate of your system and restore it to its prior state.\\" After spending lots of time making a sytem image of my Windows 2000 machine with a 12 GB drive to 17 CDs, I needed to restore the machine to the same hardware, except for a new hard disk (hard disks fail, right?).

I have submitted numerous issues to their technical support, and have never had any sort of follow-up or resolution on any of them. Using it with their scheduler is even worse because many errors like failed backups go completely unreported while silly conditions like no files selected for incremental backups are always reported by a dialog that must be dismissed by the user. This is not very convenient for unattended backups -- which is what a scheduler should be for. I also ran into cases where the target drive (where to store the backup files) was offline, so Backup Now! silently changed the backup location on me.

The second pass, the program reported problems with the last CD, the 10th. Did the same operation with Norton Ghost and had everything backed up in less than an hour!

Does not backup to more than 1 volume in your DVD writer (lots of contact with NTI support, but no resolution \\"it was my drive\\" they said - so why is it specifically listed on their site as compatible?Most troublesome - did a backup to an extra HD on my system - that took all night to backup 20Gb!) and when I did a restore it froze after \\"restoring\\" for 12 hours. I am self employed and am my own IT person, so while not an expert I am a fairly advanced user (been doing this since 1984 and I have never had so much trouble and frustration). I cannot afford to loose my data, I would go out of business. So I cannot recommend this product and would advise that if you are really stuck, use the backup function in XP (it is fast - 1hr to do 20Gb and it restores perfectly - but only does backup to a HD, not a DVD writer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backup Now Delux download version","review":"This product did what it said it would do.

Cynthia is slowly coming out of the grief over the death of her partner Kitty when she meets two fascinating women, Sophia and Greta. This book contains mystery, intrigue, suspense, possible terrorist connections, murder attempts and two passionate love affairs. The problem is that all of this supposedly happens in just two days. Cynthia meets Sophia first, sleeps with her and decides she's met her next great love. Then she meets Greta and decides she's met her soul mate. I'm always a little nervous about people who meet someone and fall passionately in love after a few minutes. Maybe things are different in the jet set, which all of these ladies conveniently belong to. I suspect, since this is Lattimore's first novel, that she just didn't know how to develop her story better. It's a good story, but it could have used more detail and development to make it more believeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best!","review":"This is definitely my favourite album of Prince's.

Corny and cheesy.The segues in and of themselves are cringe-worthy enough, but the music at this period in Prince's career was that of a lost artist haphazardly chasing trends. He was completely out of touch and sales of this record reflect that. There is a small minority of Prince fans that like this record, but unless you are a connoisseur of cheesy pop, or a completist, I would advice to skip this record and most of Prince's 90's output."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the CD","review":"First I was told it was being shipped and then I was told it was not in stock.

Oliver's geeky character was just polarizing and distracting. And none of the main actors of the show provided anything exciting to the final season. It seemed that everything that was so good about the show went south and downhill. The only two shows that stood out was when they went to Kings Island amusement park in Cincinnati and when Greg's hair turns orange after using hair tonic in the very final episode!

First of all, they are all growm up now.It's not cute anymore. And most of all I hate the cousin Oliver. He is the most annnoying thing I've ever seen on television. Why they cast him on the show? Maybe their ratings were falling.No wonder it's the last season.

My hats off to Mr. Newberry for this excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sermon from a salesman","review":"The author has this notion that success, belief in God and spirituality are inseparable. He implies that, in order to be successful one has to be religious and spiritual. He evokes 'Jesus Christ' so often that it makes me wonder if he is just pandering to the religious Christians just to sell books. Maybe he tries to turn us into nuns and priests as you read along. No thanks!Questions like 'Was Bill Gates just lucky?' come across as amateurish. I felt like listening to a car sales man as I tried to plow through the first few pages (I'm currently shopping for a car and the parallels between the two are uncanny). I do understand that some people will lap up the infinite reference to Jesus and all the other snake oil sales material. I downloaded this book after seeing the rating but it was a total let down.

There was not even an inkling as to why he did those things to her. They were down right cold and I just couldn't like him at all and this book didn't even help.

This CD has all of my favorites on it, except for \\"Whispering Pines.\\" The thing about his music is, if you aren't happy, the tunes will slowly cheer you up, and make the day brighter. If you are already happy, it gives you a good reason to tap your foot, and soon you'll catch yourself whistling or singing it everywhere.

It has great information about each and every sport you will see. It tells about the history of each Olympiad and when and where each was held. It tells who holds the record on all of the swimming events and also tells who won the gold medal in each event at the 1996 Olympics. My favorite thing about the book is that there is a space for you to record the gold medal winner for each event in 2000. Even though it is titled for the year 2000, it is also great to have for the next Olympics because you can still read about each sport and the history of the Olympics and that information will not be outdated. I do hope that they publish another book just like this for the 2004 Olympics. I would definately buy it! I love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, perfect miniature worlds","review":"Each of the poems in this collection contains a beautiful miniature world. Each are absolutely full of surprising yet perfect images, language with an inherent sense of music, and devastating emotional force.

I feel haunted by the way that the poems moved me and privileged in how much I enjoyed reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Amazon","review":"This book is in French, but Amazon didn't let me know.

This book must be used in conjunction with a formal Structural Analysis book in order to check and or correct many of the formulas given. This book does give you a broad over view of Structural Systems, but do not rely on it to be correct. My firm has both this book and the study series by Kaplan. Suffice it to say, Kaplan's Structural series is a much better study guide and so far I have found no formula errata. My Structural Engineer Colleagues can not believe that this book by Steven E. O'Hara and David Kent Ballast ever made it through any type of pre-production review with this many errors.Updated 12.15.2012: To be fair, the Kaplan book was not perfect either, but, in my opinion, was still a much better study guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair system, but not perfect","review":"The first batch of alfalfa sprouts produced great.

I threw that out and started over. By day two, again the sprouts were starting to mildew. I have low humidity in my house so I can't figure the problem.

So far so good, but this system isn't perfect, needs more supervision than I can offer it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildew sprouts","review":"I bought this seed sprouting system because I love sprouts and had a different system many years ago. My seeds sprouted okay, but they kept mildewing! The watering system is terrible. If you don't keep a constant eye on them, they either dry out or rot.

But there are some quirks though: There are no title cards, making the episodes start abruptly after the theme song. But for some wierd reason, the very last episode on Disc 2, \\"Cadet's Regrets\\", have the title card intact. Every episode starts with the theme song, but they have used the older opening (with Alvin surfing in the bathtub etc.) through the whole collection, even on newer episodes which originally had the \\"white limousine\\" opening. The cover also states that some music have been changed, but I couldn't spot the changes (as opposed to the very blatant change of \\"Love Potion #9\\" to \\"Witch Doctor\\" on the Chipmunks Valentines DVD). Quality of sound and picture was acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Release Season Sets","review":"to the company that is releasing these, i think its better to try to gather all episodes and release these as Season Sets. it will really make true FANS happy like myself. i dont see whats the point to release a few episodes here and there with no initial order. please look into trying to release these my Seasons. it will definate make people really happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like buzzing, then buy these","review":"They work great--if you like hearing a lot of buzzing. No kidding--a single unit emits an audible buzzing sound, which gets louder the dimmer the light setting. Imagine if you had more than one unit within earshot of the other? Holy buzzing, Batman. For what it's worth, these barely buzz at all when off or completely on (i.e., with no dim). But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of a, you know, dimmer?Other than the buzzing, these look and work great.Strongly discourage purchasing these dimmer switches.

The training basically consists of being able to recognize harmonic intervals and sing melodic intervals. Basically it's a string of intervals without any musical sense whatsoever. I had no problem with that, until I have read something from an Arnold Schoenberg book about this type of ear training. Schoenberg said that he saw various students that were very good with this kind of exercises. However, in his view, ''training the ear in this way without training the musical mind, will not be of great help.'' That changed my view immediately. Music is not made of a string of perfect fifths. So what's the point of practicing a drill that consists in singing a string of perfect fifths?While this type of training might be worth doing for a few weeks, by all means do not make the same mistake as I did : working on it for almost an year. I now train my ear only on real music, and it is this that I find very valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable information but it could be more","review":"While the author provided a good detailed analysis of each Venus/Mars combination and separate explanations of Venus and Mars in each sign, a more in depth analysis of the core and meaning of Venus and Mars as planets, might have provided for a better introduction.

I'm a beginning investor with only a few years of experience, and the book was below my knowledge level.

They can't breathe life into the meandering script about fledling performers trying to get a break in the Music City. Another problem is the central romance between a narcissistic Phoenix and an absolutely wooden Samantha Mathis generates zero sparks.

Maybe most of you folks don't understand this, because you all live with it every day, while where I live at, one could hardly find any country music. Any way. That country magic cought me so hard,that it was one of the main reasons for me to start dreaming about moving to the US. That movie did a lot to me, but made me sad too. Sad about things I will never have - like to see Nashville,or to go and buy a country cd from Wal-mart or Target...

The metal toolbox that it comes in is built decently, but there is no padding, so I would recommend gluing some foam in the box to cushion everything. I used it to break up an old, old, hard concrete step that had been in the way for the last 12 years. In 15 minutes, it was broken into football sized chunks and the jack hammer wasn't even breathing hard.EToolsCity is great. The tool is supposed to ship with 2 extra brushes, but mine were missing.

It is very easy to set up and take down. I was able to breastfeed my 5 month old, and lay him down for a nap with ease. My 2 and 4 year olds could eat lunch on the beach without having to worry about getting sand on their food. Nice to have a shade when the sun and sand gets too hot. Great quality and great for anyone, not just parents. Overall I would highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trip to beach with a family","review":"I purchased based on the good reviews that it had received. I purchased it for a trip to the beach with my family which includes our youngest (1 yr old).The Shelter comes in a very small and easy to carry bag. It is easy to set up and understand. I would suggest two people to sit up but could be done by one person just faster with two. This Shelter was well worth the money and cheaper then most that we had looked at.I would suggest this shelter for anyone with kids going to the beach. It gave our kids a nice shady spot to retreat from the sun. Our youngest even took a nap inside it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"This beach tent is very easy to use and can be set-up by one person easily (once you get the hang of it the first time). One recommendation - don't try to set it up in 30 mile an hour winds like my foolish husband insisted on doing - you will not be successful! However, with proper use, this definitely provides shade and shelter for adults and kids at the beach. A great product! Better than an umbrella!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a great price!","review":"I practiced setting it up on my deck once and it was fairly simple to do. It's pretty much a one person job although it is easier having a second person helping with threading the poles through the fabric loops. I used it for the first time at the beach and it was great! If you want the sun you can take your blanket outside and when you've had enough you get in the shade! Lots of room to throw in all the \\"stuff\\" that you bring to the beach. When it's really warm having the ability to open the rear door really gives you an open feeling, and the ability to zip both doors up for privacy is a real plus when you want to change clothes. It holds up fantastic in the wind and we could stay at the beach when others were packing up and chasing their umbrellas! We had a few people who lost their umbrellas stop by to ask where we purchased it! The packed-up size (24\\" x 5\\") is great for packing on the motorcycle and it is very light. What else can I say except try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We have used this beach shade twice. On the second use one of the poles broke so we can no longer use it.

We left the door open and opened up(unzipped) the window on the back - which let the beautiful breeze through one end to the other. Aaah! Have a margarita and the best nap on the beach!If it gets windy just put something heavy( we put a cooler on one side and my beach bag on the other) on the two outer ends and that should do the trick. They do provide extra bags to fill sand.Overall - the sun protection strategy for the trip worked for me. Being from India, I don't need the tan - just the breeze =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Nightmare.","review":"I camp a lot and this shelter makes tent #6 for me. After reading all the great reviews, I purchased this in order to have our infant on the beach. I don't know what Coleman was thinking. The sleeves that you insert the fiberglass \\"poles\\" in to are made of a weak mesh. The metal tips on the poles ripped through the mesh the first time I set this up on the beach, and only continued to rip as the vacation went on. Forget about setting it up in wind. I'm disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quick setup","review":"We bought the Coleman Beach Shade recently and found it is so difficult to set up that we end up using our little beach umbrella.

The Beach Shade is definitely not a \\"popup\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"5 minutes to set up","review":"The sleeves you slide the pole into to set the tent up are made of some cheap mesh that tore as we were sliding the pole into it on our 2nd use. Now every time we use it we have to lay across the tent and make sure teh pole in that sleeve doesn't push out of the growing hole. We camp a lot and use lots of different tents. We bought this for an open beach shelter. I found it takes a long time to set up for only 34 poles and the poles must be pushed gingerly or they will tear right through the sleeves. Otherwise its a great large roomy shelter that if you use the stay lines, it will probably stay up in a moderate wind (as long as the sand is not too soft). My wife will not use it because it takes too long to set up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman Road Trip Beach Shade","review":"It is OK once it is put together but it is one pain in the neck to put up.The sand bag idea was not thought out. It needs to be secure to the ground before you can even start thinking about erecting it. We had a hard time with it using the stakes into dirt so I know it would not be fun putting up on the beach. We wound up ordering another tent. I wish I could return it.Brian Cianfrani"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thing","review":"low price (45.90), very light and compact to transportation, easy to set up and easy to break down, enough long stakes (for sand)...in other words - it is good protection from wind and sun on the beach - that what is needed"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good beach/picnic shelter","review":"This shelter takes a lot more effort to errect than the pop up shelters but it is worth the effort as it is much sturdier, you can also zip up the door to make a privacy screen for getting changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tent!","review":"We bought this tent to use at the beach with our 18 month old. It's easy to set up and transport and the stakes work great in the sand. This tent is a great place to take a break from the sun, eat lunch and take naps. Would highly recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is design for!!!","review":"Used the shade for the first time on the beach. Very easy to set up and didn't even read the directions. Took maybe 7-10 minutes at most. The temp out was 100 with high humidity. This shade is pretty much the only reason we where able to enjoy the beach on our vacation. I was a little worried about the wind gusts, but no problem. This has room for two with beach chairs. Our daughter 5 even enjoyed it a few times while not playing in the sand. One thing of note, it really depends on the sun angle to the amount of shade you will get. We were able to get more shade as the afternoon sun was hitting the back window side more. If the sun is shinning at you (facing the opening) then this isn't going to help much. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. I would recommend for someone looking for a little shade at the beach rather then screwing with an umbrella. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shade for the beach!","review":"This is an incredible product. If you can put a tent together, this is easy to put up. We loved using this shade on our latest beach trip. It is comfortable, enables the kids to get out of the sun, and is very roomy. This was our best beach purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over an hour to put up","review":"It took two of us over an hour to put up. Instructions poor and someone on the beach had to help us that new how to put it up. One of the poles snapped and broke while ripping the meshing so we ended up renting an umbrella. I will probably throw in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Put Together!","review":"This did not work for us. We wanted a family tent to take to the beach to keep the sun off our toddler and baby. My husband took it out in the backyard to practice putting it together.

We had to order a beach umbrella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received a Defective Product!!","review":"I just received this today. While the shipping was exemplary the tent was BROKEN! One of the 2 shock-corded, black, cross poles was broken (the cord inside the pole was snapped!!) Needless to say, I'm not happy AT ALL because I purchased this for a trip to the beach that is scheduled for THIS WEEKEND (in 3 days)!!!! I just now attempted to call Coleman, but of course, I have to call back during regular business hours! Even if they replace the part, how will I get it in 2 days, before I leave for my trip??!! This is EXTREMELY frustrating and disappointing. I'm shocked and appalled that Amazon would ship a defective product!! I am NOT HAPPY with this experience AT ALL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd product, good seller","review":"The item was really like new. It was shipped fast and we used it in our vacation.

I broke the poles right away but, the shade is still ok and usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quick set up.","review":"Although it says it's a beach tent, it takes some time to put the rods together and figure out where they go. When I go to the beach, I don't want to spend the first 15 minutes setting up a shelter. Instead, I purchase a pop up type that only takes about 15 second to set up. Returning it to Amazon was no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for shading at the beach","review":"I had done a fair amount of research on these beach shades and I chose this one with the zip window in the back to allow for air flow. The one year old fell asleep inside and we didn't need to worry about sand being kicked on him. The first time setting it up took a bit longer than I would of liked but now I will be able to do it in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend it, it is also big enough for two adults to sit in as well. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome quality, love everything about this","review":"This is such a great product.

It held up just fine and provides ample space for us to lay down and have the baby crawl around in. However it took about 10-15 minutes just to set up on the windy beach and if I were to purchase a beach shade again, I'd consider an instant pop up one to save on time.It's quite a hassle to have to wrestle with this thing when you have a small child. Other than that, great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT for everything!","review":"I purchased this Beach shade by Coleman because I had a small 9 week old baby and children ranging from 7 to 14 that loved the outdoors! We go to the park a lot and have picnics so I thought maybe this would be good to keep the baby in the shade. It say's BEACH SHADE but we have used this shade for camping outside, picnics and for just plain fun. It's PERFECT for my large family of 7. It's big enough that we can all fit with the door open. I love this product!The first time we put it together it was a bit awkward but you get the hang of it and the second time it's a cinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Beach Tent","review":"The tent is perfect for the beach. I went with a friend, (no children) and the tent was perfect for us to change in by sitting on the floor and we kept the cooler and music in the tent to keep everything cool from the sun. It took us about 10 minutes to assemble and about the same to disassemble including placing it back in the nice carrying bag it came with. It was windy on the beach and the tent held up with no problems and I did use the sand bags that it came with. The floor is nice and extends out on the sand, giving you extra space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great once it's set up","review":"This is a great sun blocker for the beach, but it is a little bit time consuming to put together. The 4 poles need to be assembled and then slide through the guides in the shade. It can be done by one person but having a second person helping makes it much easier and less frustrating. Once the four poles and installed, use the included stakes to secure it to the sand. It was fairly windy a few days we were on the beach and the stakes did their job. Another family near us had a similar shade, but the stakes that came with theirs were about half the length and were useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shade Tent","review":"We bought this tent to use at an outdoor concert series. I have a little one who is still nursing and we thought it would give us shade for him, as well as a place to nurse. It worked well! It was easy to set up and take down. We had to move it once and it was easy to move. I did not give it 5 stars because it was difficult to secure. There were some strong storms while we were there and we thought staking the tent with the stakes included would keep it grounded. It did not however. The tent blew over. The stakes were bent in half. Overall though it was a great tent and served exactly as we wanted it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very goooood at beach","review":"It is easy to build up.It is enough to make a shade.and it is very compact to carry.My family love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coupland's odd humor and appreciation for his country blend well","review":"You don't read Coupland for content, and you certainly don't read him to understand where he is coming from. Coupland is best read as a collection of highly eclectic - and in this case, almost loving - insights of a country he knows well.

The picture featured in the ad isn't very accurate imo.There isn't anything useful to attach it to a costume. $10 ones usually are not only real (albeit cheap) metal but also have a pin that you can use to fasten to the costume. Those I would say are a much better deal. About the only thing this could be used for is to attach to string or a key chain to be worn around the neck. But even then...Yes it's 2 bucks but after paying shipping I would say it's not worth it. I kind of had the feeling this would be the case and wasn't surprised.

If you are new to his self-indulging spews of wretchedness you will either love him or loathe him.His writings ( in this case poetry) mirror his life i.e.: drinking binges,numerous affairs with women of all sorts, days at the track,facing mortality , and the abject sadness of skidrow life.

It is one of the finest works of a literary genius, and I am saddened to think that readers will be deprived of this novel. Moorcock's superhuman knack for vivid description goes into overdrive in this book, as he recreates a series of feverish memories of a time of luxuriant perversities and meager strife, maintaining a brilliant counterpoint throughout. The cast of characters is stunning and real, as if they were transcribed from some party the author had attended. The explicit details of the main character's decline from the role of sexual dominator to sexually dominated parallels the heart-wrenching destruction of the beautiful, ancient city around him, a powerful yet brilliantly subtle device.

Dont' buy this product as a step stool!","review":"It look like most folks bought this item as a Seat for beside the tub, but as a step stool it is quite dangerous! On the lower level, the stool is quite stable, but on the higher level the whole top colapses!! I purchased this product as it was advertised as a two level step stool, wich is what I was looking for. When I called \\"The First Years\\", they were very short with me explaining that in VERY SMALL PRINT on the packaging it tells you not to use as a step stool on the higher level. I did actually read the directions (which I'm sure many folks don't for a simple step stool) and the warning wasn't in that part of the packaging. Anyway, I'm sure it's a fine bath seat, but it is quite deceiving and VERY UNSAFE for anyone who might buy this as a step stool and asume they could use both levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this!","review":"We have this stool in our bathroom--my 2.5 year old now uses it to stand on to wash his hands. The storage inside is a great feature--we put his pull-ups in it. Also I like the two height adjustmetnts. It's very stable--so when my son stands on it, I don't have to worry that he's going to fall over! This is a fabulous product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great to store tub toys","review":"I recently purchased the tub side seat and would recommend it to others. I like the vented storage for tub toys and it is great to sit on while giving my son a bath. In the future we will use it as a step for hand washing and potty training. My only criticism is that the texture might be too smooth. It might be slippery for little stocking feet if used as a step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review","review":"I gave this to my daughter in law as a gift and it's just what I was hoping. A simple bath seat, sturdy, adjustable height, and a place to put bath toys. Some day it will be used as a step stool so it will be around for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"**SAVE YOUR BACK***","review":"This side seat has been a complete blessing for me!!! Now that I'm putting her baby tub in our regular tub (we used to put it in our kitchen sink, until she started grabbing for the faucet!!), this totally saves my back from being sore. It allows me to ergonomically keep my spine in a good position, while washing my baby. I haven't really stored anything inside it, since I keep her toys/wash right in her bath but the storage seemed a good size. I found it a little hard to open, but that could be user defect (me!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this seat! What a great idea!","review":"The tub side seat has been wonderful, I use this every night to sit on next to the tub as I bathe my daughter. I am not a tiny woman and the seat fits me just fine. Inside right now we keep an ample supply of baby washes and washcloths, making this seat a great organizer. In the future I imagine we will store my daughter's tub toys as well. It let's me sit at a good height to wash her and I never get a backache or kneeache. This seat is a deal for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have used this stepstool for 8+ years and I love it","review":"I haven't read the rest of the reviews, but I have had this stepstool for about 8 years and I love it. My daughters use it to reach the sink in the bathroom when they brush their teeth, and I use it when I give the baby a bath so I can sit down next to the bathtub. It looks like it's going to last many more years, it's very sturdy and easy to clean. I've never used it for storage, just as a stepstool and always on the higher level, I've never had any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and Comfy","review":"This seat is much better than the \\"multi-use bathing cushion\\". It's a lot easier to pull baby out of the tub, at a higher height, sitting comfortably, as opposed to being on your knees. You can adjust the height, and there's no strain on your back or knees! It's a bit bulky in our small bathroom, but it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it love it love it","review":"I only wish I had bought this sooner. My back was killing me from trying to bend over the right way to bathe my daughter. Now i just sit on the seat and am perfectly comfortable. My 13 month old loves to take baths and now I love giving her them. We don't really use it for storage much but there is a ton of room if we wanted to. One of the reviewers said you can't use it as a step stool if you're over 20 lbs. I weigh 110 and have used it as a step stool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important safety alert","review":"I use this as a stool in my daughter's bathroom. I do not store items in it. She uses it to get on the potty and to step up to the sink. Please be advised that if your children are as independent as mine is, this item is 2 pieces which means that when they move it the top sometimes comes off and then is loose. Thus when they step on it they will fall and subsequently get hurt (as my daughter has numerous times). I like to use it to sit during bath times but I am in the process of looking for something that is one piece-safety first!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite stool for multipurposes","review":"Out of the 2 seat/stools we've tried, we definitely like this one better. At first, we used it as a seat while bathing my young son. Much easier than kneeling or sitting on the edge of the tub. Now that my son is climbing onto everything, we place this against the couch or bed so he can climb up himself instead of needing us to pick him up onto the couch/bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Wonderful Bathroom Tool for Moms","review":"I love this product. I read all the reviews before and looked for stools and all kinds of things. Finally I came across this tub side seat / stool. It's wonderful. It's one of those items you wondered how you ever made it through bathtime without it. It's durable, it doesn't take up much room, and it's doubles as a stool and a tub side seat when your washing your little one up. My daughter loves it becuase she keeps all her tub toys inside of it, and when we get ready for bath time, we pull them out. I think this is a wonderful and ingenius product.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marsha Stephens","review":"I received this as a shower gift, and I am glad I did! I don't have much storage in my bathroom and I like having a place to store all my baby towels and bath toys. It is definitely a necessity in my bathroom as I have a clawfoot tub which is elevated off the ground -- and it would be pretty difficult to bathe my baby without it. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the lid back on securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a solid stepstool","review":"I purchased this step stool along with the \\"Munchkin folding stepstool\\". I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height. The stool arrives set at the lowest setting, and to make it higher, you rotate the top 180 degrees. An intersting design! However be warned... the top is somewhat rounded, and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall. This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools, the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier (has not tipped yet). Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool, there are better options out there... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath!Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless concepts, great for reference","review":"I had to read this book for a marketing class in grad school.

I personally thought I already understood it, just from osmosis. However, reading the book taught me more about the characteristics of those customers, how you gain penetration into their markets, and most importantly how you manage a team and produce a product into those markets.There are also lessons in there about establishing a beachhead and how to choose your target customer that dovetail nicely into some more modern work around persona identification in software development and the need to identify just one target persona for your application at a time.

And with such a short recorded history and small population, it's possible for a historian to give a far more complete account than would be possible with almost any other country. King clearly relishes this possibility, devoting well over 500 pages to the personalities, native traditions, heroes, tragedies, political deals, and evolving arts. He attempts a full, non-compartmentalized history, with proportional weight on the evolution of Maori society. Some would say it's too detailed, but that's how King shows his devotion. The book is far too honest to seem nationalistic, yet King's pride is obvious as he looks to an emerging meld of Maori and migrant (Pakeha) culture, that grows more unique as the world goes global."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer the Rhino","review":"This is all great music, 5 stars each and every track.

Turns out they were about 70% left, but I figured I'd try these out since they only cost $30 and I already had the wheel off.The pads are chamfered (beveled at the edges - a design which reduces brake noise) and the kit includes some grease for the backing plate that also helps reduce noise.They were easy to install, work great, and now my Camry has 100% silent brakes.

It's very sturdy, easy to clean, and we especially like the high back--which my son seems to like also. The only thing that is problematic is that where the tray removes, there is a hole--which my son discovered immediately! He drops his fork into it, food, whatever. It's easy to retrieve once he's out of the seat, but it can't be done while he's in it.

My son took it apart several times. The seat base also fell out of it while he was sitting in it.

Also the chair in the house is connected to a table chair and out of the way it never takes up any needed space.

He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking","review":"this idea is nice but, the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap. next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray, and that is really hard to get off, by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash.unless you are super woman i would not buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for smaller children maybe","review":"We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents. However, he is a very large boy (35\\" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably. So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food. We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy. We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many flaws","review":"The straps for securing a child were worthless, they kept popping out the back. My daughter couldn't use this chair until she was 9 months old and now I have to quickly grab her when I swivel the tray open before she throws herself out. The tray isn't very secure, it wants to pop out of the swivel side too easily. And, (...), the whole left from where the tray pops into to swivel, is just a nice little place for a toddler to stash food. I am planning on buying a different one soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best booster","review":"If I do it again I would not buy this booster. There is a hole in the arm rest that is used to attach the tray to the booster. When you are not using the tray there is nothing to cover the hole. Therefore, my son loves to put his food and eating utensils down the hole. It is not easy to clean since the booster is attached a the chair. I would highly recommend buying the Grow With Me - Portable Booster Seat By Safety 1st. We have an older child that had this booster and it was wonderful. I wish we had bought it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"We bought this chair to use as a spare for company and to use when we travel. NUMEROUS times it has fallen apart while carrying it. When my 1 year old sits in the chair she is able pull the tray right off. Thank goodness for the straps!! We used it in the park one day and she leaned back hard enough that the back popped off. (usually it has a chair to use as a back support) We only use this chair when we have too. Otherwise we use the tot lock by graco. Much more sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I previously owned a Breadman vertical bread machine. It baked excellent bread in the one pound mode, wish that I could say the same for this machine. The bread does not rise very high and seems to collapse after reaching its highest point. Wish that my other machine's bread pan did not leak, it baked excellent bread which rose very high and the flavor was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy,","review":"Pluses, price was very good and the quality of bread is good. Negatives - This is my 4th bread machine and definitely less well made that the previous ones. It is very noisy as many reviewers had pointed out. I thought because it is used in a laundry room with a door that can be closed, I wouldn't notice the noise, not so! Also, the pan is much lighter weight than others I've owned and does not snap in and out easily. Controls are hard to read, as other reviewers complained about. If money is not a big issue for you, go ahead and get a higher rated, better quality machine. The last machine we had was a Breadman, more than ten years old when it wore out, and I expected better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"Bought a TR520 at K-mart just before Christmas, present to myself! Have not been satisfied with the quality of the bread.Followed the recipes exactly and none of the loaves I've tried have been as good as they should be. My first one, a plain white on light setting , delayed setting,was a real flop. The second one, Cranberry-walnut recipe did better ( didn't do the delayed time)but it didn't have a \\"kneaded\\" type texture. Next was onion bread but I used a dried vegetable mix instead, again very coarse texture. I've used proper yeast and bread flour.Also the smaller loaf came out as wide as the full 2# loaf, which was not what I expected.There should probably be an insert to use with the lesser amount of flour to get a proper size loaf. I'm seriously considering taking it back ( if K-mart will let me) I'll keep looking and reading reviews before another purchase. Was so looking forward to having 'home-made fresh bread'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else","review":"Pros: price.Cons: hard to read display. Whites letters against bright yellow background.Does not mix well. I have to scrape the pan frequently during mixing process or there is a mess of flour left on the bottom and around the sides.Does not bake evenly. The crust is too dark and the middle is undercooked.Claims to do quick breads. I tried the banana bread recipe that came in the box, but had to throw it away due to burnt crust and raw, runny center.Noisy!If there was a score less than 1 star, I would give it to this bread machine. I am packing it up to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth!","review":"Bought this some months ago and used for few times to see how it works. Horrible waste of money as well as flour!

OMG the fumes filled our entire house. They made me so sick. I had to unplug it and put it outside. There is no way I am going to use that machine. I have never experienced this with other non-stick appliances. If you are sensitive to the off-gasing of chinese products.....DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE!!!! So toxic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbakes EVERYTHING","review":"I've had this machine for about six months. I use it all the time (about once a week). I realized after my first few loaves that it way overbakes them (regardless of the setting used). So now, I use the bread machine on the \\"dough\\" cycle, and then take the dough out, put it in a separate pan, and bake it myself in the oven. This isn't that big of a deal, but it definitely negates some of the point of having a bread machine. I really want to be able to just put it in and go to bed, leave for work, or whatever. Instead, I can only use it when I'm home, awake, and can supervise the baking at the end of the cycle. This annoys me. But it's the only way to get edible bread.If I had it to do over, I'd spend $50 more and get a machine that will truly do the whole job on it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"$7.50 fee for DOA machine","review":"I chose this machine because it was inexpensive but had generally very good reviews. When it arrived, I ran the fast-bake cycle as the manual instructs, to burn off the manufacturing oils. At that point, the machine broke. I could hear something rattling around inside and a screw and couple little round things fell out. I contacted the company, per the manual, and customer service agreed it was under warranty and they'd replace it BUT they are charging me $7.50 for shipping and handling the new machine, and I have to pay several dollars more to mail them the power cord and documentation of the purchase. Since price was a big reason I bought this particular machine, I'm none too pleased to be paying an extra $10 to replace a machine that never produced a single loaf of bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"I purcahsed this breadmaker after my last one wore out.

Thank you for the wonderful product....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving $","review":"I bought this bread maker a couple weeks ago. It's pretty good, I'm still trying to make the perfect loaf though. I don't use white flour of any type, so I need to adjust the recipes a bit. But so far everyone is ok with the bread I have made and it still goes quickly. This is saving me about $3.50 a loaf!My children and I also have allergies and this allows me to give them bread that I know is safe. :) This product is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"My mom picked this up for me when it was on clearance at a local supermarket for $13. I have used it half a dozen times over the course of the past 6-8 months (I'm not a heavy user, obviously) and I think it works just fine. If you make bread daily or even weekly, this may not suit your needs. It's definitely a lower-end machine, but everything I've made in it has turned out pretty good and the instruction booklet includes quite a few recipes. The only thing I've noticed is that sometimes it needs help getting all the ingredients mixed. Some of the flour will get stuck in the corners of the mixing pan and I just keep an eye on that and use a spatula to kind of help it along. Probably not (ok, definitely not) the best machine out there, but for light use this does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I bought this machine just over a year ago and have only used it a few times.

Very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"Received this breadmaker in Sept 07 and must admit I used it at least once a week, it's now May 08 and the last 4 loaves have flopped. The recipe is the same, then I thought it might be the yeast, so I purchased a new bottle. The last loaf still did not rise and bake properly. I'm using just the dough cycle until I buy a new machine. I will pay a little more and hopefully it will last a little longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed the color scheme for the control panel?????","review":"Why would anyone put this color combination on an appliance?? You can not read any of the controls. Light yellow with white lettering, what were they thinking?? Anyhow opened the box took out the machine.

I can use very simple or complex recipes and as long as I have followed the recommendations of the manufacturer, the bread comes out just as planned! I had to try only three \\"practice\\" loaves to know how to alter my recipes. I do suggest you use the yeast suggested in the manual instead of any in your recipes or purchased bread mix! Now, go bake some fresh bread...winter is coming and nothing is as welcoming as that smell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Oppinnion of my Breadman Bread Maker","review":"I tried it several times and was completely disappointed.

I know I will not use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horizontal Loaf Breadmaker","review":"This Breadmaker is exactly what I had hoped for. In all my years of skirting around purchasing a Breadmaker, I never realized how easy it would be to use one and then we found this one on Amazon.com. My husband is the primary cook in our 2-member family, we are retired senior citizens, and he is very pleased. The breads are delicious and there was no trial/error period! The aroma of fresh cooking bread is so good! We find ourselves waiting anxiously for the end of the cooking cycle, slice it after it's cooled, get out the butter/margarine and enjoy a very small piece and critique it. No failures! Thanks. jtf895@aol.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, love it!","review":"Works great, makes delicious bread. I would recommend looking for bread recipes on Allrecipes.com- then you can read the ratings of what works good. My first loaf was a recipe from the manual and it didn't work at all- not sure if it was the recipe or user error, but now it's working great. Just make sure to check dough consistency after the knead cycle to see if you need to add flour or water- the weather can change the dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bread, Man...","review":"Lightweight, noisy, cheaply made piece of junk.

That is hard to read. Lessee...if I plan on using this for the next five years how am I going to feel squinting and moving the machine around so I can get it just so in the light so I can read. I DON'T THINK SO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"May be the best on the market","review":"I owned a Breadman for about 7 years, and wore it out. It worked great, except the last year or so it needed a bit of help to pick up and mix all of the ingredients; just a bit of digging flour out of the corners with a rubber spatula. In the new one, they've changed the shape of the pan; it looks like I won't have that problem.I replaced it with this one. The heating coils quit about 90% of the way through the first loaf. Replacement was quick and easy, and the replacement has worked perfectly. I'd give it 5 stars, except the control panel on the front and the liquid crystal display are hard to read. I'll probably buy another Breadman in 5 or 10 years, when this one wears out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Different One","review":"I have had this bread machine for one year. At first I was very excited to start using it. I have used it a lot. Every loaf of bread I have made has been over cooked. The paddle is also difficult to remove to clean the machine. I am now looking for a better machine. It may be an inexpensive machine but it is a waste of money. Spend a little more money and buy a much better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR ME!","review":"I have used several different breadmakers in the past, but this is by far the worst of them. Since my previous units were old, I thought this would be a new and better one. Not so. I thought the instructions were more difficult than before, but the biggest problem is trying to read the control panel. I am short anyway, so then I stand on my tiptoes to read the panel, and I stil can't see it because it's white on yellow! Even setting it down to a shorter height didn't help much-still had to squint to read it. On top of that, my first loaf was just a simple white loaf, but it turned out much too heavy and dry, although I followed the instructions explicitly. This is going back, and now think it might be better to spend a little more and go for a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Works as advertised.

Overall worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNCTION = 5 STARS, DISPLAY = 1 STAR","review":"I love this bread machine, except for the display. As you can see in the photo, the display panel is yellow. What you can't see, and I mean you REALLY can't see, is the wording. Whoever decided that white lettering on a yellow background would be acceptable must work under very bright florescent lighting and not in an actual kitchen. Even my 24-year-old daughter, who has perfect vision, cannot read the lettering without difficulty. I had to break out my sharpie and write over every button, referring to the diagram in the included manual. Other than that, the bread machine works well. So far I have made whole wheat bread from my own recipe, and pumpernickel, honey-wheat, and cracked pepper-cheese breads from the recipes included in the manual.

I've used it to get many of my students stared in jazz guitar. There ARE many better books, with more theory and interesting substitutions. But this one will have you playing good sounding stuff from the beginning. This book was written for people who wanted to know how to play the music they were listening to. If you like 50's and 60's jazz and standards, this book will jump start into how to get those sounds. Once you can play them, you'll need Arnie Berle, Andrew Green, Mark Levine, etc. to fill you in on where this stuff came from, and how to go on from here. Like another reviewer said, the book's been around for quite awhile. There's a reason for that...it's quick, to the point, and great sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!!!","review":"The picture on the cover of this CD is of four young guys in white suits, which would lead you to believe that it is a CD of songs by the original group. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is just a ploy to make you think that it is a CD of the original hits, and not the collection of heinous re-records which it is. To their credit, it sounds to me like the original lead singer, Trevor Brice, but it also sounds as if he needs help (The vocals are double tracked, unlike the originals), and that no one remembers how the originals sounded (They don't even try to be close). As my title states, avoid this like the plague, and get the Repertiore or Collectibles CDs. They are the original hits, just as you remember them. This CD is now an expensive coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holly Hobbie is back!","review":"I got this dvd for my daughters, ages 10 and 2, and they both love it.

There is even a song where Holly looks at a picture of her great-grandmother and sings a song about how they would have been friends.The subject matter is typical little girl stuff...teasing brother, being honest with friends, etc. The background family stories going on are good too.It is kind of like Strawberry Shortcake a little bit older.

I purchased these to compliment my Infinity speakers. I have $2000 (retail) worth of Infinity subwoofer, stereo and center channel speakers, about 10 years old (purchased when I was single and foolish). I purchased some Infinity bookshelf speakers for surround sound for my newly created home theater. However, my wife bulked at 4 more (7.1 system) imposing black boxes taking over the room. I did some research on-line and settled on these Micras. While they can not compete on the low end with my Infinities that are 10 times the volume and cost about 10 times as much, the mid and high range is great. These little speakers really put out the sound. Another plus is that they come with mounting brackets included. These are highly recommended for surround speakers.

I also didn't care too much for the way it is put together. It is sort of like a collection of thoughts strung together and called a book.

However, I was horrified to discover that on page 13, the kids (who are spending the night in a back yard tent) decide to sneak out and go on a night hike along a local lake. There is a discussion among the kids as to whether they should ask their parents' permission. They decide not to ask; the more responsible kids buckle under peer pressure such as: \\"Since none of our parents said anything about a hike, we don't know whether they would mind or not,\\" and, \\"Your parents have gone to sleep and they'll never have to know about it\\" (both quotations from page 14).I don't care how cleverly American history is presented in this book.

A friend lent me her copy and I kept it for years. I finally thought I should purchase my own copy and give this one back. Unfortunately, the CD I received looked like a new printing because the front picture was reduced in size with a blue border, and the song list was different--although this turned out to be an error on the jacket, not a difference in the album itself. When I played it, the sound was definitely tinny, and after a few playings, my cd player will not even recognize that it is loaded. Perhaps I got a boot-legged copy, but by the time I noticed the problems, it was past past thirty days. I thought if it loaded in the CD player then it would be as good as the original.

This book is fabulous as a jumping off point. It describes books well enough to pique your interest--or turn you away,if it's not your style. Plots are discussed only in the minimum; there's never any spoilers. It also discusses actors, writers, and production work of the wonderful series Mystery! The pictures from the shows are beautiful. If you have any interest in the show Mystery, or in adding new authors to your stack to read, take a look at this book.

I have had many questions about different mystery series. The latest is when the BBC produced The Dorothy L. Sayers series with Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane, why did they stop short and not produce \\"Busman's Honeymoon\\"? And the answer is:\\"Sadly, Mystery! Viewers never got to see the payoff to this classic romance. Sayers wrote about the marriage in \`Busman's Honeymoon', which couldn't be filmed for Mystery! Because Sayers had sold the film rights to Hollywood in the 1930's; it was turned into the 1940 film \`Haunted Honeymoon', but efforts to secure the rights for the new BBC-TV version weren't successful.\\"This book is packed with such information and many great stills form many Mystery! programs.

All the jacket blurbs were about this being a portrait of the American West. But that's not the point of the book. This is an epic soap opera filled with bizarre characters. There is every kind of stereotype imaginable: the necrophiliac mortician to the incestuous minister. More intriguing, however, is the fact that ALL the characters are crippled physically and/or emotionally. And if there is a chance for misunderstanding or cross-purposes or unfortunate coincidence, the author goes with it. Because of this, the book can be one depressing read. However, once you get into the mindset that this is all a hoot, you can actually find yourself looking forward to where the author can possibly be taking this. I did.

The central character, Joe the hunchback buffalo hunter was exceptional, as was every single character in this book. Not only did we learn about the frontier, the period of the buffalo hunters, and later the bone gathers, but we met and became close to wonderfully developed characters.

It was hard to relate to either character - either his cartoonish perfection or her irritating existence as one long chain of doubts.Maybe I'm just not cut out for this genre, and after this book it will be a long time before I give another one a try.

Amazon needs to do a better job sorting and classifying their items, especially those from 3rd party sellers.Anyway, as for the actual textbook, it is very lite on information, basically a high school text. It is brief to the point of being incorrect and I do not recommend this book to anyone who is not actually using it for a class.

The problem with the book is that \\"Hannah\\" is a self-absorbed, immature, odious character. And not in an amusing way.

All of a sudden, someone flips on the lights and you can see every bright white tooth, dimple, wrinkle and hair out of place. Her writing is so illuminating, you feel like you're seeing inside and through the characters. You're more than just inside their skin, you're inside their psyche as well.The novel takes you through the nostalgia of a sleepy lake resort with everything from sexual entanglements to large environmental concerns, and family relationships, back stabbing lawyers and corporate villains in between.We expected nothing less than a delightful, insightful and entertaining book.

Not bad at all.","review":"I first heard the single off the band's website without actually knowing anything about them. Based on the music and some glowing reviews here on Amazon.com, I went out and picked up a copy. For the most part, I am impressed. The album has a strong, consisitent set of songs that showcase a talented group of musicians who obviously have a great appreciation for the sounds of hard rock and metal music. The best tracks here are RAPTURE, FALLS APART, FOREVER and LOSING YOU. Vocalist/guitarist J. Loren's voice blends dramatically with the soundscape, his lyrics dancing from religion to personal loss, and finding new love. It is tough to find acurate comparisions to other groups out there, but if you are looking for a dark-themed album with a blend of heavy and melodic songwriting, this one should please. I also suggest that people check out the limited edition verson. Its a softcase with built liner notes, and is a pretty impressive package.

If you are carrying even, say, 20 extra pounds around your midsection doing many of the basic exercises is futile, and can cause too much strain on your back.

Like for instance the song \\"Psalm With No Words,\\" that song would have been great without his guitar all phased/chorused out. It sounds terrible! He also needs to work on playing less, because he tries to put too many chords/notes in a phrases and it just doesn't sound that great. His songwriting is okay, but I think his playing shouldn't overshadow the song. The song should always come first.Many of his albums are lacking in the creativity department simply because he tries too hard to somehow inject his songs with an over usage of technique. He should really let the song speak for itself and not subject his listeners to his effects and overbarring guitar technique(s).I like Adrian Legg, but I'm not going to subject myself to him, unless his music starts to speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic X","review":"The movie was received on time as promised.

When I read \\"Mekong First Light\\" I was overwhelmed by the realizm and sincerity contained in Joe's words. His description of the infantryman's life in the Delta is not sugar coated or glamorized.

Several of my DVD's have glue on the edges...from poor packaging of this product....like so many other people dealt with. I have yet to watch any movies, yet I know I MUST clean the damaged ones up, or no way will they be in working condition.

Strongly recommended. My kids are already hooked, thus ensuring another generation of Brady Fever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs MADE IN MEXICO","review":"It's an okay set, rather flimsily put together. Aside from the fact that there's a sticker that says \\"Discs made in Mexico\\" and there's glue on the edges of some of the DVDs (I had to remove it with finger nail polish remover then wipe off with water), AND the fact that the DVDS have about 6 or 7 minutes of advertisements for other DVD sets (I didn't pay to see advertisements and waste my time), it's overall okay. I bought the set for the episodes not the pretty packaging, extra advertising etc. I suppose if the discs were \\"Made in Mexico,\\" the container must've been \\"Made in China.\\" I swear, there's nothing \\"Made in America\\" anymore! What's happening in this country anyway? Brady Bunch DVDs made in Mexico?!?! I thought at least they'd be made in America, like the Brady Bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought this Deal of the Day!","review":"I was hesitant to buy this Complete Series set based on so many reviews indicating a bad experience with glue-covered discs. When Amazon offered this as the Deal of the Day for $[...], I could not resist! I ordered on July 13th and this was at my house on July 16th (free shipping, too)!I was a bit nervous as I opened the package....it was delivered on a day that was 99 degrees outside, and I knew the potential for melting, tacky glue was high. The packaging does leave a lot to be desired....the adhesive on each of the accordion pockets holding the DVDs was indeed tacky and gummy, but the CDs were in fine shape and no adhesive got on them.I was 9 years old when the Brady Bunch premiered in 1969, and this was a Friday night staple in my house! Brings back a lot of memories. I am a fan of this piece of American pop culture, but not a big fan of the box/packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brady Bunch Complete Season","review":"Really love having this Series in a complete set. Like I read in a previous review before buying...Not totally crazy about the packaging. The disks come in an accordion like sleeve that's a really flimsy thin cardboard.

Otherwise, I have no problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun re-living the 70s!","review":"My kids have had a blast watching all of the episodes that I grew up with.

Now I watch it with my own kids and they love it too. It is a welcome relief from the typical \\"Family Channel\\" fare where parents and adults are portrayed as dolts to be mocked by their children.Although many people regard the series as mindless fluff, the show deals with many important social issues some of which maintain their relevance today. Topics like gender and race relations are covered, albeit from a late sixties network TV perspective. I also think the show deals well with children's issues such as self image. Every parent should take a page from the Brady parenting handbook.I downloaded Growing Up Brady for Kindle last summer and I am going to re-read it now that I can watch the episodes in order. Pre-teen kids will love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"my granddaughter was delighted","review":"It was as described and more.

Some of them can be hard to get out of the sleeves sometimes. But the content of the set itself is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Packaging Leads to Defective Discs","review":"The discs are not housed in plastic cases - they are packaged in a paper-made \\"flipbook\\", where each opening holds another disc. This packaging leads to the discs being severely scratched and, in some cases, covered in glue (from the glue that is holding this paper contraption together). The end result is that several episodes are un-watchable, as there are numerous skips and stops. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on buying the seasons individually - while it may be a bit more money, it will be worth it when you know that each episode is guaranteed to play without any issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"My kids love watching this show as much as I did growing up.

Many years later, they ask for no medals, only dignity and the right to be as respected as their fellow citizens. A powerful parable of the importance of individual rights and decision-making, and a sharp denouncement of the savagery of American war crimes and two-faced justification of intolerable humanitarian outrages during the Vietnam occupation, God Go With Them ultimately champions the human spirit in its willingness to take a stand based on what is right, in spite of the scorn of one's brethren."},{"rating":"2","title":"This continues the trend...","review":"First thing LTJ Bukem fans need to remember is that this comp is not really a part of the traditional DnB sound of Bukem... there's been a trend with this series to get jazzier and jazzier.

I will admit that the 5.1 disc sounds awesome and definitely adds value to this release.However, if you're expecting \\"Promised Land\\"... you're in for a disappointment.

While it isn't fly-fishing specific, it is a much more comprehensive book, and rates places based not only on the fishing, but on camping spots, number of people, and scenic beauty, which are at least as important as the fishing, in my opinion.

These stories are enchanting and surprisingly powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four great singers equals one heck of a CD.","review":"It's amazing how each song highlights each one of the foursome's strong points. This CD really made me stand up and listen. The CD opens with \\"Silver Stallion\\" and one cannot help but think of bygone cowboy days. Waylon Jennings transforms \\"Angels Love Bad Men\\" into one of his trademark wicked songs. Reminds you of the \\"Waylon and Willie days\\" when everybody wanted to be an outlaw. This album would get five stars if it had included their version of \\"Help Me Make it Through the Night\\" (a danceable form of the famous Kristoferson tune). And, it's nice to know that Johnny Cash sounds as good as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Highwayman II","review":"Highwayman II is a huge disappointment from some legendary and talented musicians, singers and songwriters. It's over-produced and has an '80s (ugghh) slick feel to it. I listened to it twice, can't remember which songs are on it and will drop it off at the library when I get a chance.

The problem is that they changed the housing that holds the 32 tweezers. For some reason, the way they make the new tweezer holder does not work as well at pulling the hairs out. I had to make several passes with the new one to pull out the same amount of hair that I used to be able to pull with just one or two passes with the original.So although it works OK, and the rechargable option is nice, I have decided to return it to look for another that is made more like my original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"This epilady does not work as well as similar products I have owned over the years.

The only complaint I have is that the hardware was slightly different. Instead of the broad plastic covered wing nuts these came with standard tiny ones. Normally this wouldn't bother me but when you beat on these things for an hour or so you need to tighten everything up, the broad plastic ones are easy to locate by feel and don't hurt your fingers when you snug them up. For the price, this was a great way to bring the 5 pc up to 7 to better simulate a true 5 pc set with cymbals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drum Pads!","review":"I got these for a set of Alesis drums since they're the exact same pad. (Alesis and Ion Audio are owned by the same person.) The only downside if not using with the ION Audio set specified is that the mounts are for it and so are the cables. So if you've got something like an original DM5, you'd need a 1/8\\" to 1/4\\" cable or an adapter, and a clamp to fit a rack with 1 1/2\\" tubing. If you're replacing old pads or have extra clamps (or can repurpose)some, and have any 1/8\\" to 1/4\\" headphone adapters, neither is a problem.Although the pads could be considered a little small compared to a real drum or cymbal, that's just what they are.

Herb is successful because he has studied the symbolism of sounds, so his synthesized music is carefully prepared with instruments that will emote reactions in the listeners. Shirley MacLaine liked his music so much she used it on both her video Inner Workout, and her audio cassette Going Within.I especially liked this album because of the depth of the music. Play this album, and listen to TOUCH, while you are making love with your partner, it definitely enhances the experience!

In fact it is a shame Hollywood has not turned this into a movie.

It's pure, nice, simple, direct 80's rock. And by those standards, ie the classic rock standards, it turns out to be a very, very good album. If some of you want to bang your head on the wall while listening to music (which is fair enough and sometimes I do it myself) try Judas Priest for that matter. Rock is rock, and this is what this album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice Goes to (Hair-Metal) Hell","review":"I like the 70's Alice Cooper a lot.

I started to like Trash.It was the backup vocals that didn't set in well at first. Then, it was the whole fact that it was Cooper from the 80's, and this was my first introduction to Cooper in the 80's.As I started listening to more of his albums, I really began to enjoy this one. Plus, \\"Trashes the World\\" is one of my favorite live performances. A must.I wouldn't recommend starting out on this album if you're just getting into Cooper. Start with \\"Love it To Death\\" or \\"Killer\\". But if you're really in it for the raw, original Cooper, go for \\"Freak Out\\", the little gem that I love.\\"This Maniac's In Love With You\\" is by far my favorite track.\\"I'm Your Gun\\" comes second.And then of course, \\"Poison\\".Not a bad effort. With a few flaws, you can't go wrong.Go pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If there were more stars to rate this album I'd use them!","review":"Trash is Alice Cooper at his heavy metal best! If there were more stars to use to rate this album I'd use them! This album rocks! From the hard core hair metal sound of the music to the poetic genius in his lyrics, there is not a bad song on it, (well, maybe one). His all star line up of hair band rockers such as Jon Bon Jovi, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton, to name a few, are a lot of fun to hear and blend well with Alice Cooper and his band. I think I read that this is the number one selling A.C. album of all time and \\"Poison\\" is still one of my favorite heavy metal songs. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd worst Alice album ever ! .","review":"When this album first came out back in '89, I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. I just couldn't believe that Alice would stoop to this. Desmond Child is without a doubt the worst thing that has ever happened to him. Some people just have the wrong idea about how Alice Cooper is supposed to sound, and Coop listened to the wrong guy this time. Variety used to be one of the best things about Cooper albums, but here you get none, only monotony. This is a textbook example on how not to do it if you're a serious artist, and I had always thought that Alice was. -But the \\"hairspray-period\\" of any artist is always the lowpoint music-wise, and such were the late 80's. (The worst album is still \\"Raise Your Fist...\\".) - Admit it Alice, you know I'm right. Was this really the album you wanted to make, or did other people want you to ?. Whatever, Trash stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too commercial.","review":"While \\"Trash\\" has some excellent songs on it like \\"Hell Is Living Without You\\" and \\"Bed Of Nails\\", the album seems too commercial and too ballady, esecially since it's the follow up to Cooper's heaviest album \\"Raise Your Fist And Yell\\". In my opinion this is the only Alice Cooper album not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice hangs his head in shame on front cover for delivering TRASH","review":"Are you a fan of the original Alice Cooper Group?

Poison, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same old Alice.","review":"This album is great! It may no be Alice in his glory day, but he can still rock out. I original owned it back when it was first released. Because 'Trash' was getting a ton of airplay at the time. That song is still great, but there's a ballad or two that will blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Cooper Rocks","review":"One Of The Top 5 Alice Cooper Discs.

The single \\"Poison\\" got him back on top 40 radio for the first time in years, and the album was a huge success. Cooper was back to playing big arenas in front of sold out crowds. But......I think the album stinks. The music is cliche ridden hair metal and most of the lyrics are just plain stupid. Compared to most of the Coop's other work this dreck just does not hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mounting system","review":"Thought this mount was priced too high until I saw the unit. Heavy duty, works as advertised, high quality and well designed. Tilt is actually capable of a little more than 10 degrees and swivel is dependent upon the distance from the wall with the ceiling mount - mine swivels 45-50 degrees.

I was very very pleased with that one, until i lost it. This one, on the other hand, couldn't even compare. The resume resumes from where ever the player wants, not necessarily where you left off. Sometimes, it simply refuses to read a track, but spends minutes trying. The unit skips for no apparent reason, even when i'm not moving it. The final kicker was when i dropped it (no more than 2 feet), the top came off, and even though i was able to snap it back in with no apparent physical damage, it no longer works at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jogproof--that's a joke!","review":"If you plan on using this while running, be forewarned that it skips more than a six-year old girl in pig-tails and braces.

Everytime the music reaches a climax the camera is either zooming in or out of some fresco painting on the wall or the ceiling. If you want to take a tour of the inside of the St. Florian Church, then this is the DVD for you. But if you want to watch a performance of the Bruckner 8th symphony, I would look elsewhere. The picture quality and sound quality on the DVD are very good. Boulez is quite sullen and mechanical in conducting and becomes and bit boring to watch. This performance is available on CD by Deutsche Grammophon, however, and is wonderful to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"IDEAL FOR MOST USERS","review":"The nice thing about this \\"Mac OS X in a Nutshell\\" is that it used consistent and unclattered narration throughout its chapters. Its goal is to familiarize 'OS X' users with the fundamental mechanism of the Operating System. Every aspect of the software was discussed.With over 750 pages, this book's coverage is vast. It includes substantial directives on how to optimize all the new Desk Accessories, (DAs), which were introduced in 'Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar'. Also, there are guidelines on how best to configure the software and the search engine, in order to enhance networking.This should be an ideal book for every user-level (from beginner to advanced). It contains some information that will interest Unix users. However, if you are an advanced Mac user who wouldn't compromise superlative texts, then, you should note that \\"Mac OS X Unleashed\\" offers a better depth and value than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but a jewel nonetheless","review":"This book is deeply moving because it deals so closely with issues close to the human heart. The prose is simple and uplifting, the story just an excuse to reveal to us universal truths that we all know but refuse to acknowledge. Critical and cynical people might brush this book aside but I feel that one really has to look very deeply into it to really discover its true worth. This must be read with an open mind and I feel that the ending is particularly apt because there is none. This situation could be so easily applied to our daily lives and the author is telling us in simple gracious terms that patience and undersanding should be the forefront of our relationship with our family. Despite the somewhat muddled use of the flashback technique and several narratives that are a little to rambling, this is a jewel that teaches love, in a world where there is little to be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's True","review":"While reading \\"Follow Your Heart\\", I found myself questioning all of things I have found important in my life. I feel that the book teaches you many life lessons, especially to follow your heart.

This sad old woman's reminiscences on how her daughter never forgave her for emotionally abandoning her as a tiny girl, and her 'realisation' that her daughter was not too bright, and had a flawed character, is not the sort of thing that you should ever write to your grand daughter as a parting gift...Not to mention her own misdemeanours-having a child outside her marriage and never being honest to anyone...I hated reading about how bright and special and sensitive she was as a child compared to her daughter and granddaughter. No wonder every one left her. I can't understand why anyone would want to hear her philosophy on life, take it to therapy granny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"As the main character of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" says, sometimes it is interesting to see how bad badwriting can be. I read this book several years ago in italian, but still I remember it as one of the worst readings I ever had. This book is offensive to the readers because, by purpose or not, it tries to move our deepest feelings with a \\"plot\\" which is a moral blackmail. The author tries to reach depth by describing with a simple language the most important feelings. You need a great poet to do that. Tamaro simply has no talent nor ispiration. She just can write one stereotype after the other. A lesson on how not to write a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply enlightening and beautiful","review":"I simply could not put the book down. It was so inspiring and enlightening that I would recommend it to everyone I know.

The long, lengthy, boring letter that she writes to her granddaughter tells about her life. And what a boring life she had. Olga lived in Italy. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because there are a few tidbits of good philosophy and ideas in it.Her granddaughter appears to be insensitive and ungrateful, according to the things Olga says.This book was translated into English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiration","review":"I want to thank Susanna Tamaro because she had inspired me to become an author for I have way better stories to tell! Great writer, very simple and I do agree has many in-depth life lessons; however, I have lived through more tragic and life growing experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow Your Heart","review":"It's interesting to see that people either give it only one star, or five.There are no in-betweens. In my opinion, it's because you either \\"get it\\" or you don't. I've almost been able to sort everyone I know into these two categories.This was, and still is one of the best books I've ever read. I treasure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a better grandparent letter writing book....","review":"Although I enjoyed the audio adaption of the book I was a little put off by \\"grannies\\" view of her own daughter and then her granddaughter. I could feel the loss of her grandchild and how sad it must be to not have familiarity with those you love. I did want the granddaughter to appear before the book ended though, or at least I wanted more news of what happened. I enjoyed grandmothers past life but just couldn't understand this deep separation of her granddaughter. Maybe she will write a letter someday to give us her side and what happened.Here is a much happier and very touching experience with letters from a grandparent. Please, read Camron Wright's \\"LETTERS FOR EMILY\\". I enjoyed the mystery and love displayed in this book. You will enjoy it I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"No, I couldn't put it down, but only because I kept looking for something really deep and true in this book. Unfortunatelly, I ended up disappointed. I would definitely recommend it as a beach literarure, but if you are looking for something that will really touch your soul and change your relationship with mother or grandmother, try something else. The past of certain characters and how it reflected their future is just too predictible and too trivial, that in one point it becomes pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!!","review":"It is the most boring book I ever read. I am Italian and I read it in Italian. The language is childish, I don't suggest anybody to loose his time with it. The main point of the book is that: When you have a problem, just go in a dark room, and listen what you heart tells you. Can you believe that? Listen to your heart, he will speak to you.

I bought this book originally as a gift for a friend whose mother was recently diagnosed with a very severe form of MS. Once I got the book home, I opened it up to scan through the stories and I could not put it down. Each and every story combines sadness with joy, depression with inspiration. I will warn you, if you are the kind of person who finds personal accounts of tragedy meets spiritual triumph as lame or cheesy, dont buy this book. However if or anyone you know has MS, please buy this book, it will help to light the darkness in the Tunnel you are going through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrecommended","review":"I do not recommend this book. I purchased it under the assumption that it would include individual accounts of people dealing with MS. It does, but not in the manner that I presumed it would. The book does offer individual accounts of the struggle with MS, but the stories seem to be incomplete and unorganized. As someone living with MS, I wanted to know about the individual's diagnosis history, symptoms, treatment, etc. Many of the stories never mentioned specifics or they left out important events. The idea of what the individual's have been through does make the stories inspiring, but the lack of content and organization left me feeling frustrated and sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Beyond challenge","review":"I just finished reading When The Road Turns, and found it to be inspirational and informative while maintaining some semblance of humor throughout. I don't think you have to have MS to appreciate these people and to learn from their examples of how to live life beyond MS. It is a wonderful insight into making the most of life and getting somewhere new by rediscovering ourselves. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and uplifting!","review":"Living with MS is definitely a challenge for each of us, no matter the level of our disability or ability, as I like to think of it. Each author of \\"When the Road Turns\\" is a true inspiration to all of us!I know two of the authors that contributed to \\"When the Road Turns,\\" Kathleen Wilson and Dean Kramer. Their stories are particularly inspiring. Kathleen has shown us that we can reinvent our lives, despite MS, by looking within ourselves to find a new path. The amazing part is the new path can be even greater and more rewarding than the one we followed before MS.Dean has given an insightful and humorous look at MS through the eyes of someone doing ordinary things in an extra ordinary way. She has a wonderful talent for taking the reader with her as she shares her innermost thoughts about MS and personal experiences.Reading each author's story made me realize that we all have our own mountain to climb, it doesn't matter how high it is, but how we climb it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspired","review":"After reading about half of this book, I had to stop. I am not very inspired. In fact, it had the opposite effect on me. A lot of the stories I read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had. Kind of scared me a bit..is this what I have to look forward to as the years progress? I was more inspired by Montel's book (once I got past the ego part of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women's version works just as well...","review":"I have purchased this in stores as well as Nair's depilatory cream for women because sometimes the men's version is cheaper but sometimes the women's version is on sale. I have noticed no difference in the hair-removing capability between the two creams. Both remove hair well in ten to twelve minutes. For me, the hair does not grow back for three to five days. The women's version does have a nicer smell (won't stick with you once you wash it off, but easier to tolerate while using it). If the women's version happens to be cheaper at your store, I would just go ahead and get that. It is basically the same product with different packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burns only a little, if you leave it on for too long!","review":"I used this on my bikini line, and my lady parts. Be careful ladies that you do not leave it on after 8 minutes and follow all directions or you will get a nasty burning rash feel for the next couple of days!!!!!!!!!Other than that, glob in on there in generous amounts and dont be stingy. This is cheap stuff, as far as cosmetics go, and you DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO APPLY TO THE SAME AREA TWICE. Or you are asking for a burn.I use the mens stuff because I figure that anything made for men is probably stronger and better.

I think using it with dry body is more effective so if you need to used it again make sure your body is completely dry.I think I have a new skin :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"please dont buy this thing. i used it in the hopes that it would prove as a cheaper alternative to waxing and be less embarrassing- couldn't have been more wrong. it made everything worse. hair grew out darker, coarser and more (2-3 hairs per follicle where there was previously just one hair). i just had waxing done, after using Nair, and it has never ever hurt this much. i will never ever use this product and will never let any of my close friends use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the smell is bad..product is okay","review":"I was looking for a less painful solution to waxing. I have pretty hard hair on my chest. It was kind of getting irritating with heavy hair because i have sensitive skin. I thought this would remove hair completely, but it only removed surface hair unlike waxing. I guess my assumption was wrong, but the smell is just unbearable. It's not possible to apply this thing outside, so i had to sit in the bathroom and deal with the smell. Even after, washing the body and removing this product, i was smelling bad. I still have one bottle left out of three and i am afraid of the smell. Overall, i think it would be a great product for people who don't have sensitive skin/hair, can deal with the smell and/or can't smell, have very small amount of baby hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected...","review":"A complete waste of money.

It does NOT workI used it and it said to leave the cream on for about 8 minutes. After 8 minutes were over nothing happened. It does NOT remove hair. It only burns your skin. It will also make you bleed.I even left the cream on for 10-12 minutes and still nothing happened. It just cut my skin and starting to burn and caused bleeding. WORST PRODUCT EVER! I would leave this 0 stars if I could.Do NOT buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Do not buy this product. The smell isn't all that bad at first but once it burns your hair it stinks. It is very very messy and it hurts if you leave it on longer then 4minutes but if you don't it wont get all the hairs. I figured what the hell I'll try something other then shaving. The first time using it on my chest and arms wasn't all that bad but then I used it the second time and now I have red bumps all over my arms and chest. It isn't a rash either it is more of acne but I don't have an acne problem so it has something to do with irritation of the skin from this product. I suggest shaving or using wax."},{"rating":"2","title":"once was a skeptic, now am an addict","review":"basically what happens is you put the stuff on and wait about 8 minutes.try gently wiping your fingers back and forth on the hairit should clump up into little round packs and be effectively shaved offif it doesn't just freely wipe into the clumps wait another 5 minutes and it definitely should by thenthe hair starts growing back immediately, just like if you had shavedit doesn't take any 2 weeks to grow back, that it a lie.but it is great. no razor burn, your legs are silky smooth, your chest is totally bare without effort. i'm addicted to this stuff, literally. i used to think it was not going to work. only one thing is bad about it. keep it off of your nipples or they will feel like they are on fire for 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I was very disappointed with this product for removing hair. I had to reapply Nair three times because it left patches of hair. Even after that, I had to shave some areas and it left me with minor chemical burns. To make matter worse, I had stubble in one or two days after applying Nail. I know it doesn't specify how long the affect will last, but I could have just shaved the areas and had the same affect. It depended on the area, but the hair removal was spotty and didn't last long at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Be careful!","review":"Not trying to bash the product, but it did not work for me - and that's an understatement...It removed all the hair - baby smooth at first, but during the next 2 weeks I got so many ingrown hairs and nasty pimples, bumps, etc. on my legs that it was simply unbearable! I'm an avid biker / swimmer and this made my rides agonizing wile waiting for the hair to finally grow back in and break through my skin (took about 3 weeks to get back to normal). May have just been my personal, isolated experience, but just want to let others know what could happen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, did the job for me!","review":"Okay, let's see.

It would leave lots of random hairs on my body, so I had to shave it off anyway. I followed the instructions too, even the instructions for coarse hair.

It removed unwanted hair quickly, painlessly and without an overwhelmingly bad odor. As a matter of fact, the smell was ok at first, but then became a little salon/chemical-ish, if you know what that smells like.It was very easy to use, removed hair with ease and I'm pleased with the results. My only wish is that the hair didn't grow back so quickly. I've had wax removal before and it takes much longer for the hair to grow back. The product claims that less hair will grow back, but I cannot comment on that claim yet since it's only been about a month since I used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I read all of the reviews before I purchased this product and although most of them sounded negative I decieded to give it a try anyways. For me it did a great job... no horrible burning like one guy wrote... and no irritation. I know this has alot to do with your particular skin.. so I guess you just have to test it out first.

The visegrips just make it that much of a better deal, if you need them too and you need to do a little plumbing here and there - just buy this.

Dr Carpenter does an outstanding job of compressing the chronology and explaining the impact of European culture on African societies. This book is written the old-school way. Having been to Africa several times myself, it is fascinating to read a book written in 1959 that explains things so accurately about Africa.

So far I am 120 pages into this book. I like it very much - it is very readable book and has made many concepts clear to me. Some q-banks reference this book (Appleton & Lange Anatomy for one). One very successful USMLE tester(268/99)credits reading the blue boxes in Moore before the exam with being the most high yield Anatomy study for the Step 1 exam. Beating HY Anatomy and BRS Anatomy. I have both HY Anatomy and BRS Anatomy - however, reading this book gives the more exam important concepts and mechanisms the USMLE Step 1 test is changing towards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing descriptions","review":"I found this book to be quite confusing, without the clarity or focus an anatomy text needs. The text should provide clear, succint information that doesnt wander and make the reader's mind follow suit. There should be simple descriptions, followed by more complex information, rather than just complex, detailed information from the get-go.On the other hand, it does cover everything and has some clinically related examples which are handy if you are a medical professional. If the book is required for your class, buy it, but be prepared to either buy a different one or not read it because it doesnt help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical School Essential","review":"I found this book to be absolutely essential for getting through medical school gross anatomy, although not everyone does. I can't imagine learning anatomy without Moore and Dailey, but I have classmates who never picked it up and learned anatomy from Grant's Dissector, Netter's Atlas, and lecture notes alone. On the one hand, Moore and Dailey is so replete with details that it's not the most time efficient way of studying, but it's got pretty much everything that you'll need to know in it, and probably more. It's also got such great illustrations that, armed with only this text, a dissector, and a cadaver, it's possible to get through gross anatomy with Moore and Dailey and no atlas, although I would recommend picking up Netter's atlas, too, and possibly Rohen and Yokochi for self-testing yourself if you really want to splurge. Gross anatomy is rough, so do yourself a favor and don't skimp on buying study materials to save yourself a few bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OR AN ATLAS, BUT A GOOD TEXT!","review":"Here is the low down. This book is not a book that you can even consider reading through! It is, however, one of the best references that you can buy. I felt like the text was clear and detailed on every anatomical part that I wanted to know about. In medical school, there were times that I needed to reference something because I didn't understand. This book did a great job of filling that roll. It is comforting to know that I have this one on my shelf, and I am still referencing it. The pictures are clear and informative, but it is a text. It is not an Atlas or a review. It will explain things to you in words with a few picutres to supplement. In hindsight, however, it wasn't necessary. It is nice to have, but you can do without if your class doesn't requre it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many errors in the text","review":"My medical school must have ordered an edition that hadn't been proof read. We spent more time going over the errors in the book than anything else. Half way thru the class, I was using it for a doorstop. Graphics and diagrams reversed, ugh, bad news on a test! I think I should get my money refunded. As for Atlases, I used both Netter's and Grants, both were great but Netters is perfection. One thing that was good with the Moore and Dalley text was the \\"blue boxes\\" with clinical correlations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb lesson in anatomy","review":"This book clearly and concisely teaches all aspects of anatomy. Not too much depth, but definately not too little. Others have complained about the pictures. Yes, they are Grants and I agree that Netters are much better, however, these illustrations do instruct well."},{"rating":"1","title":"never opened","review":"One of those books that is required, and you do not open it once.

It was horribly dense and detailed. I have yet to find an anatomy book that I like, but I can tell you right now that this is far from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb text, not so great pictures","review":"I used Moore's as an adjunct to studying anatomy with Netter's atlas of anatomy. I found that the text was concise, lucid, and enjoyable to read, with pertinent and important clinical examples in the form of case presentations.The illustrations, on the other hand, are from Grant's atlas of anatomy, and occasionally are confusing or downright obfuscating (the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck come to mind.) So I recommend reading the text, but referring to Netter's atlas when referring to pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the best","review":"Moore's is great for a first reading, and the pictures and diagrams are first-rate. The clinical examples are right beside the basic anat, which is good when you're beginning to read for understanding but somewhat a bother if you're keen to revise the clinical applications as an entire region. It may be too verbose for quick mugging, but then again Moore really IS excellent for getting one into a new region. The Head chapter is especially lucid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a very good book to start with","review":"I found Moore's anatomy very useful at the start of my anatomy course. Its very clearly written and the illustratiosn are great as well as the tables and charts. Its very useful especially when you are starting to study a specific region or system. I must say though that it did become a little unspecific and general when i advanced through my course so i reccommend this book for beginners in the area of anatomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was particularly interested in one of the two enclosed disks - 1 CD - same title as the book, and 1 DVD - Primal 3D Anatomy.

Several months later he is still thinking about this kiss when he sees her again. Only this time she is pretending to be someone else and can not reveal this to him or else she blows the cover and her secret willl be revealed. Something Emily can not afford.

It has a masquerade, a heroine who discovers her sensual self without acting ninnyhammer around the hero, an arrogant hero who remains likeable despite his high-handedness, and a truly loathsome villian.What I love most is the interplay of words and innuendos between Emily/Emma and Jordan. And with Jordan so obsessed with her, how could a girl resist? And the love scenes... I was reading this in a rainy cold night and I actually kicked the blankets off, surprising dear hubby.This book is truly one of the surprising classic scenario of wonderful serendipity.

I don't hit the road without this CD in the car and have enjoyed several road trips while singing along to Cult of Personality, Taste the Pain and You Got It... And getting wistful over All for Love, In Your Eyes and Reach... This is just one of those albums where there isn't a dud on the track list.

The problem came down to finding a freeware software program that would allow the Palm to operate with the GPS. I finally did come across Cetus GPS, which looks to be a great find!

Though not their worst albums (those were to be all the albums following this one) it is indicative of the coming slide.

Muir's underlying sensitivity-hidden-beneath-a-maddened-frame are traded in for conventional metal anger without wit. The Skater-punk nuance is also dumped for a gansta persona (just check out the cover art)as if being a skater just wasn't hard enough for their image. Ironically, it was the following album, Lights..., that really got Suicidal Tendencies noticed but, this one is truly the last Sui albums worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Tomorrow","review":"Read Julie Orringer's \\"How to Breathe Underwater\\" or Neil LaBute's \\"Seconds of Pleasure\\" instead for a better debut collection of short stories.

The characterization lacks complexity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noose is for the Reader","review":"The inability to define oneself seems to be the central theme in this convoluted collection of short stories. From pornstars to various flat Chinese protagonists (farmers, archaelogists), Leung presents himself as a poor man's Amy Tan or abridged/Cliff Notes Maxine Hong Kingston. With all the emotional disconnected plots and characters, the author reveals a sense of cliched, bitter and jaded portrayal of sexuality especially that of between gay men. I wished this author would show some insight that has not been said before and better than what others have written already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Super Feet for my feet","review":"I hike a lot and my feet tend to pronate so after 5 miles my feet start hurting. I spoke to the wonderful folks at REI who recommended an insole. They suggested Super Feet. I slipped one in my boot and instantly my arches hurt. The green Super Feet have VERY high arch supports. I went on line at Amazon and found these and thought I would try them out after reading all of the reviews. WOW. What a difference. They have just the right amount of cushion and arch support. They flex nicely under the ball of my foot and don't take up a lot of room in my boot. I plan on buying a second pair for another pair of hikers. I did a 10 mile hike with no foot pain. I'm sold Spenco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!","review":"These may be good insoles if they happen to fit your feet. The arches in the Women's size 7-8 insoles start to rise about 1-1/2\\" past the heel, with the center of the arch about 6-1/2\\" from the toe. I have high arches, and the arches in these insoles begin and end much too close to the heel to provide good support. And because the support occurs where the arch isn't, they're quite painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feel Good Opera","review":"You will rarely see an Opera as well produced , performed and conducted as this production.The cast has a wonderful time.The youthful Julia Kleiter in one of her starting roles is really attractive. Eva Mei gives a \\"Tour de Force\\" performance and Christoph Strehl , a light tenor, is right up there w/Juan Diego Flores.However, Mozart wrote this at 19,and watching it you realize how grateful you are that his Operas improved through the years . But you are thankful for how entertaining this particular production is and that you now have it in your Mozart DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD not hard to swallow...","review":"This DVD is spectacular! It contains a full length YYYs concert from Fillmore, and if any of you were there, you know how much energy emenated from that stage as Karen O. and company showed their talents. I can't get enough of it. It also contains several videos. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karen O = Amazing","review":"One thing is for sure--Karen O can liven up an otherwise boring group. Brian and Nick, while talented, are not the most exciting people to watch on stage, but then we have Karen, who runs around, does headrolls, jumps on top of things, etc. She's just nuts. Despite all of this wild gallivanting about the stage, she can still hold her own in the vocal department (and quite well, at that).Between the crazy parading and the sweet melodies, she certainly has performance down to a twisted but intriguing art. She is most definitely the centerpiece to this DVD and to this band in general (and not to mention a heroine to half-Asian women everywhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - too many errors","review":"The number of misspelled and missing words in this book make it very hard to read at times.I thoroughly enjoyed the story and will try to find a better copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liverpool cd","review":"thank you for a wonderful cd and all the sounds of anfield. just close your eyes and it makes you feel that you are there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO concise","review":"Massoulie tries too hard to condense his information making it very difficult to follow.

Or, if you can still find the Silly Symphonies set, I recommend that instead. That being said, this is a moderately priced sampler of some really solid Silly Symphony classics that need more exposure. The Prince and the Pauper is not one of Mickey's best, but is interesting. This is a nice collection, albeit a little random. It is very worth having The 3 Little Pigs as well.

I have to hand it to the authors they really did some research to put this book together. So why did I give it such a low rating? It was a mind-numbing read. Though I was able to glean some interesting stuff from it, it was mainly all academic knowledge. If that's your cup of tea then you will love it.

This book fits this criteria. It was carefully written by three conservative scholars whom had presented the New Testament with an unbiased perspective; except conservativism, comparing conservative perspectives with critical scholarships, though upholding conservative scholarship. The content is a tedious reading but prove to be a good resource/text for academic learning in theological education. These are the strengths of this book. If one is looking for a general introduction of each book, this is the one. If one is looking for a content-based text on each of the book, this is not the ideal. I would recommend to anyone of the former category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transaction, love the quality of the DVD!","review":"This transaction was excellent.

Walter Brennan is a very talented actor, and his antics will have you laughing out loud. He really makes the show come alive in a time when tv was actually a pleasure to watch.The show is family oriented,and you won't be ashamed to watch it with all of your family present. Big ole Luke McCoy is a sweet loveable,naive,kind of guy,who can really get into some trouble. Grampa McCoy played by Brennan, has a charm all his own, and can really get into a mess. HaHa. Kate is a sweet, down to earth lady, that is a joy to watch and her wisdom is priceless. The kids, Hassie and little Luke are your typical kids learning about life and the pangs of growing up. The farm is transformed into a nice living home by Kate. You will like this show very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real McCoys Season 3","review":"Great service!

I bought one collection each, of the first three seasons. The vendor (supplier to Amazon) for the DVD collections used cheap plastic cases for the DVDs, in which the plastic center post clips inside used to hold the DVD in place in the case, were so thin and brittle they broke almost immediately, requiring I buy new generic DVD cases from the local Radio Shack. Pretty poor quality materials used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting soundtrack.","review":"(As a first time buyer of Amazon MP3s) I was afraid of the quality. I don't settle for 128 versions.

Great quality on my Chopper2 Headphones.As for the music itself, I'm sure you already know that if you're here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping and powerful","review":"The movie was stunning and so was the soundtrack. They moved so well together that I was moved to tears. My husband felt that it was a bit repetitive but that's because they use the same melody in each song though each song varies dramatically. It's as if the melody is the story moving along and taking different shapes with every scene. I thoroughly enjoyed both.*Side note* It's great music to study to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Mesmerizing","review":"I have not seen the movie yet, but this soundtrack album by Clint Mansell is a classic. The music is minimalist, haunting and entrancing. The music is three dimensional, soaring through various levels of emotion, including the deep spiritual emotions of yearning, love, pathos,and isolation within an infinite universe. Stands alone as a work of art. Beautifully played by the Kronos Quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great score to a great film.","review":"This is the most moving score i have ever heard. I have alot of film scores but none as great as this one. this is the kind of score that helps make a movie become even greater than it is. cause everyone know that with out a great score the movie does not feel as emotional as you intended it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"this CD is amazing. When I received it I listened to nothing else for nearly a week. I just couldn't get enough. The movie is beautiful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mansell was brought into this world to score this film...","review":"Clint Mansell apparently \\"gets\\" Darren Aronofsky's indie films. This score matches the dreamlike imagery to absolute perfection. It is as if Mansell was BORN TO SCORE THIS FILM. There is simply nothing more I can say except to say thank you Mr. Mansell and the Kronos folks....and where the h*ll can I find the Wind Chill score?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie wasn't perfect but the score is.","review":"Less in your face than Mansell's brillant(and much used in commercials nowadays)score to Requiem for a Dream this is still a great score and another great use of Kronos Quartet.Subtle and haunting at first it builds to an exhilerating climax in the soaring Death is the road to Awe.You don't even have to own the movie to enjoy the hypnotic journey this music takes you on.Most film scores merely get the job done serving up emotional cues(Chase!Love!) but this scoe trancends the ordinary and is really something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I'm a pathetic Clint Mansell fanboy so I'm probably more than a little biased, but this is really well engineered from start to finish. Each instrument stands out with superb clarity, yet they all integrate extremely well. The strings are the obvious stars of the show, but I especially like the way the drums were recorded--if they used a reverb plugin to get that sound, it was an amazingly good one. My only complaint is that the entire thing is only like 45 minutes long. I liked the film as well, but the music really sells it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting, stunning","review":"It's very rare for any soundtrack to support the movie in such a powerful way but also be able to stand on its own as a complete art piece. \\"The Fountain\\" OST is one such example. Beautiful, haunting, emotional, poetic, poignant, mesmerizing, unforgettable, transcending time and space. A movie soundtrack does not get any better than this. In fact, the score is so powerful that it often even overshadows the visuals. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of Melodies","review":"Every song in this soundtrack was played, at one point or another, in the film. They all revolve around certain melodies or tunes but somehow manage to distinguish themselves from one another beautifully.I love the film and possibly adore the soundtrack even more. Once you listen to the songs, all you can think about is the movie and the incredible story and imagery. The songs have the ability to transport you into another feeling, mood, train of thought. I consider this one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard, on par with Lord of the Rings and Titanic soundtracks.Like most people my age, I hardly ever buy music but I felt that I needed to buy this CD and I do not regret it at all.My suggestion, even if you didn't like the movie (shame on you), is that you should buy the soundtrack nonetheless. Wonderful buy, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie, you'll love the music.","review":"I loved the movie a lot and was so impressed with the music. You won't be disappointed with the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless...beautiful...haunting...","review":"I enjoyed watching \\"The Fountain\\", but in my humble opinion the soundtrack far surpasses it.What Clint Mansell/Kronos Quartet/Mogwai have produced is a work that captures the movie's somber theme in greater detail than the actors could portray.The soundtrack opens with \\"The Last Man\\", which hooks you with a simple, mysterious piano melody and really takes off when the Kronos Quartet hits the same melody with multiple layers on the strings.\\"Stay With Me\\" is another enchanting, bittersweet track where you can really feel the influence of Mogwai's post-rock guitar-work adding a new dimension on top of the string-work of the Kronos Quartet.The final track, \\"Together We Will Live Forever\\", ties together some of the melodies from \\"The Last Man\\" and \\"Stay With Me\\" to end the soundtrack as beautifully as it began. Another favorite track is \\"Xibalba\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book","review":"This book is beautiful and gives great insight into not only the education of children but the living with and enjoying children."},{"rating":"2","title":"praise for Karen Andreola!","review":"A few years ago I read Karen's book and it has stuck with me since. It is without question, the BEST book to inspire the BEST homeschooling ever! When I felt most discouraged, I would pick up her book and get the encouragement I needed. Now, two college grads later (one Summa Cum Laude and one Magna!) and three kids that are younger, later, I am still holding onto the Charlotte Mason principles. Karen is like a cool breeze after a hot, humid day! Please get this book, some herbal tea, a relaxing chair and some time to yourself. It will be an investment in your family, I promise! I, Arden Detweiler, wholly endorse this wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat of info","review":"This is a great intro to Charlotte Mason for newbies but for those who have been introduced to Charlotte's approach before reading this book, it would be a waste of time. It's a repeat of information for me. Well written and easy to read but not much help for myself. I prefer Catherine Levison's basic how to guide to Charlotte Mason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"I was not at all familiar with the Charlotte Mason Method and was curious about what it was. This book was recommended to me as a start. I really enjoyed reading this book. The author simply explained what the CM method was and how she taught her own kids. I did not feel like I was being lectured on someone's opinion but it provided very valuable lessons. In a humble manner she gives subtle advice and encouragement concerning homeschooling and raising kids. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to homeschool but dreads the whole text book/ work sheet. My only \\"complaint' would be that though her advice was Biblically sound she used very little supporting Bible scripture. But that is a minor thing. I prefer this to the other homeschool books I've read that twist scripture to back up their absurd convictions that all must follow or else."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, informative book!","review":"I have studied Charlotte Mason for the past 6 years of homeschooling my son. I own many books regarding her educational ideas. This book, in my opinion, says it all! It is informative in such a complete way, but also is an easy, fun read. It is my number one homeschool book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough","review":"I purchased this book when I started out on our homeschool adventure. Although it is a truly lovely book, complete with charming illustrations, I find the image that Andreola presents is rather unattainable.After reading the book I felt like I could never create as lovely an environment as she presents and that the Charlotte Mason approach was simply beyond the reality of our home. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the book, it simply left me feeling inadequate!I would definitely recommend this book and consider it a valuable addition to our educational/instructional library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Learning","review":"This is my favorite homeschooling manual. There are so very many choices available to homeschoolers now. This text really helps a mother sift through those choices, by giving her a method of gentle learning. On television, you have this image of mothers at the table with their children fighting over learning. If you put this program into action, learning is gentle and the relationship between mother and children blossoms. My children don't mind learning because it is fun, easy, and it never wastes their time with twaddle, which she explains in this book. So many programs are built on the \\"make them read a summary then test them\\" principle--no real learning occurs. This program is altogether different. It is so worth it. I now have a teenage boy with Asperger Syndrome who loves to read! It certainly wouldn't have happened without this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this because of the reviews here.This was not what I expected at all. The reading of this is not as smooth and flowing as her novels were.And to be quite honest,I think I learned more on Charlotte Mason ways in her novels instead of this book.Not to say,that there is no good bits in here.There are.It is just a hard read.And you can not fly through it at all.I have not finished it,but from what I have read thus far-I think I would had been better to get a different book on the CM ways.I will finish this and if I see I was wrong,I will modify my posting here.It seems there are many happy people here liking this one,but I would had passed on this if I could had skimmed through it holding it in my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly photos B&W, a few small plans, section, renderings","review":"Mostly B&W photos, some in color, a few plans and even fewer sections - mostly of a small size and poor quality, a few old-fasioned renderings, but professionally presented planning projects, short project descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're A Hardcore Celtic Fan...This One's For You","review":"I ordered this CD by mistake, thinking that it was Iona of the British version (ie. WOVEN CORD, THE BOOK OF KELLS etc.). This Iona is US born and bred, except for one token Brit in the band. They have a mixture of music types from Scotland, Ireland, Wales mixed in with an Appalacian twang. I can't say that there was any selection on the album that stood out to me. I couldn't get past the hardcore celtic/appalacian sound. The quality of the recording was more like it was recorded in a pub, than in a studio. I am sure there is people out there in musicland that will like this traditional celtic sound, but I am not one of them. I am afraid I am spoiled by the meditative, inspirational and spiritual music of the British Iona group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty neat","review":"I purchased all 3 GLO E plushies and the puppy is my favorite.

It's a shame because I've been looking for an alternative to Toppik, which works great but is expensive.

It works nearly as good as hair cubed, except it's not nearly as waterproof. If your hair gets wet, it's gonna come off. It's perfectly fine when it dry though. I think there was supposed to be some kind of sealer you use with it that I didn't get, so maybe that's the trick. Hair cubed is almost completely waterproof without the sealer.

Basically, I think the operation is a little sloppy. I have filed a claim under the A-Z amazon guarantee (never a positive indication of the quality of a vendor). I thought the price was really good, but given the grief and aggravation -- I recommend buying from someone else.

My 1960s copy from Stackpole is well used and well worn: Smith's history of the development of pistols and revolvers, rifles and machine guns is \\"worth the price of admission\\" by itself.

For the most part, the album sounds like a replay of \\"Infected,\\" which sounded much fresher than \\"Mind Bomb\\" when it was released two years before this album. Critics had panned \\"Infected\\" for sounding too self-absorbed, and \\"Mind Bomb\\" hardly improves upon such solipsism. Actually, both albums sound very dated, as if that \\"Manchester sound\\" from the late 1980s and early 1990s were put into a time capsule. I listen to the drum track from \\"Armageddon Days (Are Here Again),\\" and expect the chorus to repeat, \\"Face the face...got to face the face!\\" from Pete Townsend's \\"White City\\" (which was used in a TV ad).

The songs have a dark, emotionally evocative feel to them. The music features the electric high notes of Depeche Mode, but has a glib pessimism in its lyrics that reminds me somewhat of the Smiths.If you've ever had a relationship putter out, Kingdom of Rain will probably reopen wounds, but music that isn't moving isn't worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taming Mighty Alaska","review":"I read this when it first came out and absolutely loved it! A trip with the Andersons is like a visit with old friends. This book is a must for anyone traveling to Alaska by car or RV and a delightful addition to any armchair traveler's collection. Descriptions of scenery are vivid but the interactions with the people the Andersons meet are lively. Perhaps the dialogue, which covers everything from purchases from clerks to other camper's tales of glory and woe, is the most appealing feature of the book. Parts of it make me laugh so hard I have to put the book down for a bit. I reread this book a couple of times a year. If you enjoy this you may also want to read Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" and \\"The Lost Continent\\"; Emily Kimbrough and Cornelia Otis Skinner's \\"Our Hearts Were Young and Gay\\" and another older book of William C.

I am now on my third set of these shields. I have never put them in boiling water, the microwave, or the dishwasher - just regular hand washing. But they only last me about two weeks before they completely deform. The rubber stretches and leaves big stretched out bubbles which no longer adhere to my skin. The deforming has caused me significant nipple irritation. I also noticed that these used to be made of a thicker plastic before. My first set is much less flimsy than the other two sets I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain aweful !","review":"I don't usually write reviews but these breast shields are so bad, at least in my own experience, I had to warn other potential users.

Some women may notice an increase in output when using these, as they are more comfortable to use. They only come in one size, but they fit most women, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped, Discolored, Torn","review":"I've only been using the shields for 8 months and not on a consistent every day basis. They are wrinkled, discolored, and the soft plastic is separating and disintegrating where it meets the harder plastic.

After using the pump a few times, I noticed that I had a blister on my areola! My son and I had not changed anything, so I did not think that it was our routine or set up, but I made an appointment with a lactation consultant just in case. When I showed her the blister, which had popped at this point, she said that it was definitely from the pump shields. She said she hated the softfits and had seen this in other moms as well who used these shields. She recommended switching to the hard plastic shields, which I did, and I have had a much more comfortable experience since. They may be more comfortable for some, but beware the blisters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great spare!","review":"These are much softer than the regular issue hard plastic shields. I prefer them because I think they are more comfortable. I did not notice any significant increase in milk output, but they are a great pair to have around because of comfort.

I now have another child who refuses to latch, so I needed a more powerful pump and opted for the Medela Freestyle pump, which came with these shields. Pumping was immediately painful and I ended up with bleeding, cracked nipples.I switched back to the Ameda and purchased, upon the advice of a lactation consultant, the hard Medela shields in size 27mm.I have relatively small nipples that aren't flat, but aren't huge. The 27mm doesn't hurt, but it does weigh me down a lot and seems to be too large, so I am going to try the 24mm in the hard plastic. I also noticed with both the softfit shields and the hard 27mm shields, I am getting more clogged ducts. I hope this will be resolved with the 24mm.In short, although I'm not positive this is the cause, if you have inverted or flat-ish nipples, I would avoid these shields."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky","review":"The plastic is too sticky or grippy, pulls uncomfortably.

I wish the personal fit shields came as soft fit's so I could have tried them out to see if they were more comfortable. I did notice for the time that I used these sheilds that even washing by hand and never putting them in the sterilizer bags, they still seemed to warp a little and the soft part of the shield seemed to discolor slightly, I wonder how they would have held up with long term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me bleed","review":"These are so uncomfortable. They stick to your skin and they made me bleed at the part between the soft plastic and the hard plastic because the flexible soft plastic caused rubbing. Before I started pumping I thought they seemed like they would be more comfortable, but now I know better. I definitely prefer the hard plastic ones and will not use these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent telling of the Bonhoeffer story","review":"This is a very decent telling of the Bonhoeffer story, although a little bit light on the theological convictions behind the man. Nicely done with a high level of 'Hollywood' polish.

Better yet, watch them both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie of Falsities","review":"If it were possible, I would give this movie a -10 rating. It does not reflect the truth about Bonhoeffer's faith and his commitment to Christ. If you read his own writings, you will see that his heart is steadfast in serving and following Jesus Christ to the fullest. This movie falsely accuses him of a wishy-washy belief and it portrays a man who is not standing on conviction. I recommend reading his own writings (Cost of Discipleship, Letters and Papers from Prison, and the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works series) instead of watching this film that has set out to destroy the truth about the God-honoring man that Bonhoeffer was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great man, great story, ...not a good movie.","review":"A cheesy account of a fascinating and inspiring true story.

Excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting view of WWII history","review":"This film was assigned as part of a program of study my husband is in or we may not have selected it to watch. The film was a pleasant surprise. As most films, the script writers must select snapshots of Bonhoeffer's life story to highlight, but the result in this film is a very interesting and compelling story. If you are a fan of BBC dramas, or a student of WWII history, you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may fall asleep","review":"I am a big fan of Bonhoeffer and several of his books, but the movie was a disappointment. His character portrayal was cold and dry, and I struggled to stay awake. Instead of watching this movie, you should read or re-read Letters and Papers from Prison or the Cost of Discipleship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace","review":"The story of Bonhoeffer is a story full of integrity and choices.

Without slavery Southern Men of Honor could not exist. Slaves served as a statement of wealth and also as a relationship for the aristocrats. They considered slaves to be their opposites. Slaves were afraid. Men of honor were brave.

Why do we work? Because we have to. Wants are not limitless. To have a desirable lifestyle one can either increase income or decrease desire for material objects.Outside of this, there's not too much merit in the book. After the first 2-3 chapters the rest of the book is pretty boring and provides no real insight. Only a philosopher or a very thorough anthropologist would find a reason to keep plugging away at this bore.Some of the data certainly paints an incomplete and biased picture...see various other reviews on the Web for details.Plus, the guy's an arrogant, snooty you-know-what (I found this out after reading the book so it didn't bias my opinion of it) so don't give him any royalties, buy used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tung oil, but a varnish","review":"Note that this is labeled as a tung oil \\"finish,\\" and not as tung oil itself. The reason is that this is a wiping varnish designed to produce a similar look to that of tung oil. It may look alright, but do not be misled into thinking it is something it's not. Unless it is labeled as 100% pure tung oil, and the directions tell you to thin it with mineral spirits, you don't have the genuine article. It's deceptive marketing, frankly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Finish","review":"As noted in the previous review, this is a wipe-on varnish. I have no idea if it actually has tung oil in it, and don't really care. What I do care about is that it produces a nice finish, and does so easily. I' ma woodturner, and I use Formby's Tung Oil Finish on many of my higher-end gallery pieces.If you want real tung oil, then by all means buy 100% pure tung oil.

It is a film about recovering a lost time and a lost culture. It is a film in a language that you are unlikely to hear often, if ever again...the language of native Greenlanders.

There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares.

It's like a tea: it's a bunch of leaves and dried herby items that need to steep in the water.

But to stroke your chin and think patience, and slow-and-steady is the only way to wealth: We all know the internet-rich-people who got rich overnight. Similar helpful points are made in this book. I recommend it. I listened to an audio-tape of Kennedy's (an infomercial tape, where he was promoting the book PSYCHOCYBERNETICS) and he relates there how he once suffered a personal bankruptcy.

Color prints are just ok. But the fax function has two features I really don't like:1) You can't adjust it to hear your dialing or the phone answering.2) Any time the fax doesn't go through, the machine prints a full page report. If it takes you 6 tries to fax something, you get 5 pages of report. It is impossible to turn off this 'feature'.

Then intermitantly a few weeks at a time it would not stay connected, but I could solve it by unplugging the electrical cord, as explained in the manual. Then when it used up the cyan color I could not get it to except a new cartridge, ink would run allover. I tried several with no success. I started to examine down in the ink hole and could see a shinning object only in the cyan hole. I couldn't get it out, but it appeared to be a little round ball of sorts.

The wand which you can buy seperatley or it comes with the bears, lights all three of them at the same time from anywhere in the house. This is a great feature at night when the baby wakes up because I can turn it on from my bed and he will go back to sleep. My 22 month old turns it on to walk down the hall at night as well.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of the supporting text is geared towards presenting an understanding of the vb6 code. It appears as though the vb.net(vb7...) material was added as an afterthought(in a rush), probably after the book had already been largely written. The vb7 material is brief, vague and frankly incorrect in some of the examples!

I have to say even the first book in his series (Java) is not a good book.Comparing these books with the original GoF book, the only credit I can give the author is giving an example to each pattern, which is quite a easy job for anyone who knows both the pattern and the language. The GoF book gives much better explaination for patterns (with examples in c++). Therefore this book is only useful to someone who has no knowledge of c++. Even for these people, I would recommand to read this book with GoF book together, GoF first for understanding one pattern, then this book for example of that pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best swedish ninja film ever.","review":"The best swedish ninja film ever, but that doesn't say much. An extremely boring film. The directing and cinematography is ok, but the screenplay is stupid. Did you knew that ninjas have poisoned arrows that makes the head or heart explode when the victim gets the poison in his blood?

Well, watch this on your own risk... you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ninja turned SWAT team","review":"I've seen worse ninja movies before; but even they had more attention to martial arts than this flick does. There seems to be a preoccupation with watching military soldiers being mowed down by gun fire than anything \\"ninja\\" at all. Its more like watching a swat team in action.

It should not be taken seriously. But the budget was apparently very tight and it is in view of that still intresting to see that a movie eventually was presented by Mats Helge.

Each country gets a chapter explaining who its main trade unions are, their membership demographics, and a description of their counterparts in the corporate world. Comparisons are made between countries, regarding their relative levels of unionisation and industrial disputes.Often, the pressures of a EU-wide common market are also explained. The effects of these on nation-based trade unions, which are still most of them, due to legacies of language and history.The book is good for getting a quick, accurate briefing on each country and on the entire EU scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst chair I ever bought","review":"This has got to be the worst booster chair. When I put my baby in the seat, it came apart. I thought maybe I did not have put together properly so I redid it. Still the same thing. The sides expand from the weight of the baby so the seat becomes unhinged and the baby is now sitting sideways in the booster chair.

DANGEROUS! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"If it weren't for the seat belt, my poor son would be bruised from head to toe! The seat stays together fine for me. I only put it together once and have had no problems. The tray is the danger in my house. It falls off at least once a day. I remembered how annoying it was to pull my daughter's tray all the way off when she was covered in food and eager to get out of her seat, so when I saw the swinging tray, I thought, \\"Oh how convenient! I'll get this one.\\" It has been nothing but trouble. The tray falls off when I'm putting him in, when I'm taking him out and even when he's sitting in it. The button to take it off is easily accessible to a curious baby. Please learn from my mistake. DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know what I did without it!","review":"We purchased this booster seat for our little one and I can't believe what we did without it. We travel quite a bit and we don't usually have room for his huge highchair. With this booster, we can make sure he has a place at the adult's table too. It's completely dishwasher safe (a major plus in my book). The straps are easy to remove and replace. The whole thing comes apart in about 30 seconds (with a little practice). As far as I'm concerned, this thing is a Godsend. It's safe and secure with two straps for the chair and the tray easily swings out of the way with one hand. Give this one a try...

Feist did a great job with this one. It's not my faveorite of his, but I definently recommend it to anyone who is a Sci-fi fantasy fan.

I also recommend Prince of the Blood, another of Feist's masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of the Rift War Saga. As a matter of fact, I read fantasy today because I so enjoyed that series so many years ago. However, I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was trite and the characters did not have the depth that I'm accostomed to seeing in Feist's writing. In addition, some characters from the Rift War Saga seemed like completely new people with no explanation of the change in personality. After starting the Serpent War Saga, I understood that this entire book was only a long, boring prologue to his new long, boring saga. However, I keep reading Feist in the hopes that he will again show the originality and character development that made me love the Rift War Saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fantasy For Boys","review":"As a woman this novel left a bad taste in my mouth. A lot of women, and men, claim that fantasy novels as a whole are sexist. I disagree for the most part, but this book... well.. let's just say that its premise, in a nutshell, is that a bunch of clueless macho idiots get to dress up in kewl pirate costumes to save a ship full of naked women. I'm not making this up! To Feist's credit, the women, for the most part, are strong, intelligent, and pragmatic. Unfortunately these qualities are wasted since the plucky lasses do very little other that fend off rapists and make fruitless escape attempts. Mostly in the buff. What irks me most, I suppose, is that the heroes have far less regard for their women than the villians do. If this review makes you want to read more, by all means buy it. But if your the type of person who rolls his eyes at bikini laden beer commercials, you might want to pass for something a little more mature. Which would be anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page-Turner","review":"The book was fantastic.

My only complaint is the cheesy way the romances wrap up near the end. Overall a fantastic Riftwar follow-up and a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ***SPOILER***","review":"What I really found disappointing about this book was the healing of Nicholas foot. Feist could have shown how a cripple could be a vital person and a leader, but instead chooses to remove Nicholas' one mark of character. This weak move made me that much more appreciative of George Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" where bastards and cripples and other deformed persons play important roles with their \\"handicap\\" being a part of their character. I'll give you Erik from the following series, but I thought Roo's reconciliation was too easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring start... but a very good ending.","review":"Thought the start was quite boring it was much better in the end.

Also, the less known, hauntingly beautiful Coventry Carol, captures a mood of winter that is both chilling and crystalline. The Lumiere String Quartet has done a fantastic job with this CD, and is one that I recommend for discerning listeners who appreciate the quality of their musicianship.Simply one of the best Christmas CDs in terms of sound quality and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book for beginners and experienced alike","review":"As a student of the martial arts I have read many books on different arts and have found most of them to be endless pictures of techniques that I could never put into practical use.With Ralph Haenels book I was quite surprised to find that there were comparably few photos and instead chapters on will how to practice and stories of the authors history and how he has learned over the years. I would like to to say that the chapter that has had the most effect on my martial arts practice is the chapter on motivation; I have felt, like everyone else, giving up when class was a little hard or I had a bad day at work however when I read this chapter and especially the part on dream pirates I have managed to pull through difficult times and kept my motivation. I highly recommend this book to anybody in martial arts and am looking forward to more from this author.Dwight Epp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find retail, but worth the hunt online","review":"This is a great monitor, better than you will see in the usual computer chain stores (they claim not to have heard of it).

First, it does very little beyond restating what Lewis wrote in his books. None of his books are very long, so I suggest you skip this one and just get it from the horse's mouth. Second, Martinadle falls into the same old trap of casting Lewis in his own image.

I loved that I didn't have to rely on a sink and soap to clean my breastpump parts. I would also use the wipes to clean the area where I would set up my pump and bottles. I didn't use them too much at home because when I was home, I would just put the breast pump parts in the dishwasher. I do see how these would be useful for a working mother or someone who pumps away from a sink, but to use at home seems a little silly. Soap and water work just as well and not near expensive. Just a quick note, if you plan on using the pump parts right after using the wipes, you have to rinse them with water. You can only use parts after they have air dried after using the wipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Individually wrapped wipes","review":"These are the quick clean medela wipes but individually wrapped.

They do what they're supposed to do and they're easier than rinsing the pump accessories for us working moms so no complaints there. They are indeed individually wrapped, which seems like a waste. What bothered me is that they are marked \\"unscented\\" but there is clearly a chemical scent accompanying the wipes. The instructions say that you can wipe your pump accessories down, let them dry, and they're ready to go. However, if your accessories are still damp from the wipes, then you need to rinse them off. I'm guessing this is because of the chemicals they use. So once the pump accessories dry the chemicals magically go away? I don't know how this works but I'm not getting them again.

True, both actors did very well portraying their individual versions of outcasts and the tension which developed between them.

It didn't take long at all to recieve it when I put in the order. I would highly recommend. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although the price of the toy was good, it didn't come from Amazon it came from another company and I had to pay double for shipping and handling. What I mean is it was a ten dollar toy and ten dollars shipping and handling.

The orange barrel was missing. Cleanly, as if sawn off. I checked the box & packing material twice for the piece and it's just not there. Since the box was well sealed and undamaged on arrival I can only assume that it was sent in that condition. Yes, as others have noted, the gun is very light/fragile plastic and will not stand-up to kid use/abuse. It is more suitable as a Halloween costume accessory as it only needs to last one night. That was my intent as Grandson #1 will be a Gangster this year. Unfortunately, with Halloween being this Sunday we are now scrambling for another gun.UPDATE - I called Amazon this morning to cancel the return that I initiated yesterday. As it turns out...7 year old boys like Tommy Guns without the orange tip just as well as, if not better than, those with one.

My husband and I have been drinking this tea for years now, and while we've tried much more expensive teas such as Teavana, we keep coming back to this over and over. It's our favorite and if it's brewed just right it has a tangy, smoky complexity that's just unbeatable.

This tea is both relaxing and energizing, which makes it difficult to both describe and explain. However, when you try a tin, you will know what I mean.

A small amount of conch will infuse a whole can of coconut milk for an outstanding sauce. This supplier ships it overnight fresh, but I've found the meat pieces can be wrapped and frozen successfully.

It sounds like a collection of underscore/backup tracks in need of some melody or lyrics. As each track starts, you're thinking \\"yeah, this sounds good, this one could really pay off\\" and then you wait for something to happen ... and then the piece ends, and you're left hanging there wondering \\"where was it? Did I miss it?\\"This album stands as a sort of \\"musical sketchbook\\" full of ideas which are not completely fleshed out. It needs work, and it's definitely not worth the price of admission.

The \\"5 Burroughs\\" album wasn't perfect but it was a step in the right direction (from the bizarre \\"Hello Nasty\\"), but this new \\"all instrumental\\" album is a bore to listen to. I think that some people will really like it--perhaps I'm just missing their sense of \\"irony\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Awful","review":"This certainly must be a \\"Mix-Up\\". Could the Beastie's really put out something this bad? I can think of high school garage bands with more substance than this CD, which is basically full of poorly executed random jamming. Clearly, the Beastie Boys are attempting to play their own instruments again, which I feel is a very bad idea. If you are hoping for a rap CD that can hold a candle to Licensed To Ill and the untouchable Paul's Boutique, keep looking. The Mix-Up isn't worthy of even listening to once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I would say if you are new to the band you might find this appealing. For me it was not the same as past musical experiences I had in listening to albums of the past, including several that came after the famous \\"Licensed to Ill\\" which I have heard is one of Capitol Records all-time best selling albums. This CD left me frustrated as I did not feel there was very much creativity at all. As they say; \\"to each his own\\" but I personally felt this CD was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can they sink any lower?","review":"This album sounds like random jamming by a bunch of amateurs.

Then there are the people that compare one thing to something else just because it has a few similarities.Maybe the Beasties weren't trying to sound like Medeski, Martin & Wood. Maybe they were just doing their own thing. Expanding on a sound and style they had already established if only hinted at on previous albums. And maybe you could write better music yourself right chief? I highly doubt it.This is a great album and a natural progression from a band that has long since earned the right to do whatever they want to do. I hope this becomes a trend and we see more instrumental releases from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking where they've left off...","review":"If you've fancied Sounds From Way Out, you'll definitely be satisfied with the performance of The Beastie's latest."},{"rating":"2","title":"driving muzak","review":"Obviously it would be amazing to hear a new album that sounds similar to \\"Check Your Head\\" or \\"Ill Communication;\\" an album with a perfect blend of hip-hop, jam tracks and the occasional hardcore song... But hey, at least they got back to playing their instruments again. When \\"To The 5 Boroughs\\" came out, I was a little disappointed that it was all computer beats. However, this could quite possibly be a transitional album that brings us to their next album of Check Your Head style material? I hope. But until that happens, I'm happy with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DJ Shadow goes Rap; Beasties go Chill-out?!?!?","review":"Both are a let-down at the same time.Check out 'POW' from The Broun Fellini's instead.~!an"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't even have Beastie Boys name in title","review":"I hadn't read any reviews online before purchasing this CD so needless to say, I was stunned to find out it was an instrumental. I mean why buy a Beastie Boy CD without hearing words? It's perfectly fine if they want to do alternative stuff, but PUT A WARNING ON THE CD that says it's instrumental. On the back it even states that \\"songs' written by them, but it should've said \\"music\\" written by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ?(@&!&","review":"How can these guys get a record contract to put out something like this? And Bon Jovi just did a country cd too. What is this world coming to? What's next, Ozzy Osbourne doing an opera cd? AC/DC going bluegrass?What's so frustrating is that there are alot of good bands out there who can't get a record contract.

Anyone who plays an instrument can relate to how much fun it is get into a groove and just play. Unfortunately, its not always as much fun to listen to. These instrumentals lack the fun, funk, and whimsy that makes the Beastie Boys what they are. If you want to hear great instrumentals, pick up The In Sound From Way Out. It collects the instrumentals from their previous albums and it rocks! This album makes you want to take a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beasties have just jumped the shark","review":"The Besties have abandoned their strengths and are now playing pretend in the deep end of the pool. Take a listen to Medeski Martin and Wood, or Garaj Mahal. In the vernacular, they are now biting some styles, and the result is WACK. As a hip hop crew, they are untouchable, as a funky jazz combo, they're a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not THAT into the Beastie Boys","review":"You know the type of person that likes every single thing produced by their favorite artists? I mean all the garage tapes, out takes, jam sessions - they somehow find worth in every utterance. If you're not one of those types you probably won't enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming Soon to an Elevator Near You","review":"Not having an advance notion of what to expect, this non-vocal work was quite the surprise. In and of itself there are some catchy melodies - but it's sort of false advertising. When one buys a Beastie Boys CD - there is an expectation level to hear a certain type of music that's the band's trademark. This CD did not deliver. Had I heard some cuts w/o knowing in advance who was playing - The Beasties would not have ever come to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"There isn't one song on here as good as Groove Holmes; can't believe I paid $13 for this. I like the Beasties as much as the next middle-aged ex-new waver but this is disappointing. No, it's lame. We'll always have Paul's Boutique and I still think they are three talented and funny guys but The Mix-up, no. Should have been a free e.p. or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"How can some artists always stay fresh with new sounds and others become washed-up? The only reason I give one star is because you can't give zero. This album makes for an expensive drink coaster.No fresh sounds, nothing upbeat and very monotone. I guess when you have a reputation like Beastie Boys you can assume something good is going to be relesed. After 2 clunkers in a row that's no longer the case.The name of the album should be called \\"Fill My Bank Account\\" since all they are doing is taking your money and retiring on it. These boys are a very long way from \\"Paul's Boutique\\" and \\"Check Your Head\\"...two masterpieces.Zero stars!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill Background","review":"The Beasties are always giving the people what they want. They may not know they want it but after you get it, you realize you needed it. This is one of those records. It's not anything ground-breaking but it is just what you'd expect form an all instrumental (that's right, no lyrics) record from them. This record is great to chill to or have on the background of any get-together. It takes you right back to the instrumental songs of Check Your Head and Ill Communication records but is totally all brand new music. Nothing here appears on their The In Sound From The Way Out Album but it is similar in it's construction. I enjoyed The Mix-Up and I hope you do too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth money.","review":"Some of these little jams are worth hearing once maybe but mostly this stuff is amateurish, boring, and just nothing of any relevance. The BB's have some decent stuff but you better not start here. This is all instrumentals and they sound like a fairly low key garage rock weekend band just kind of laying down some tracks. Some of it is okay most of it is derivative and really lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"great background music","review":"I think if you took all of the instrumental interludes from past Beastie Boys works, it would be better than this album but that doesn't mean I don't like The Mix Up.

The sound on this 2ble album is totally abysmal. I bought this because of all the tracks what I didn't count on was the awful sound.

The truth is that the audio problems go FAR beyond the remixed titles. The whole of the 2nd disc is a washed out, muddy audio mess and it is inconceivable that someone at Sony/Columbia didn't catch it before release. This compilation is about 15 years overdue for a serious remaster.Some of the titles here can be heard in far better quality on the Sundazed releases, however admittedly a few of those have some excessive overmodulation issues. They are still by far the lesser of two evils. At least the songs PUNCH the way the Raiders need to punch.As is, the \\"Legend\\" CD sits on my shelf gathering many years worth of dust. It's far to painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed....and destroyed!","review":"I purchased this CD thinking that it would be a clean-sounding CD version of the songs I remember coming from my AM radio in the Sixties and Seventies. Wrong! \\"Kicks\\" is one of my absolute favorite radio hits from the Sixties. In glorious mono, it comes out of the speakers like gangbusters, and has a sly anti-drug message to boot! The re-mix of this song on this compilation reduces the lead guitar to background noise, replacing it with a tamborine brought forward in the mix.

Can't they stop tampering with a great singles band? Don't give us these absurd remixes. & don't hand us a mono radio mix without a stereo version, too. & forget the \\"alternate\\" takes; the guys had ace L.A. session musicians helping out anyway, & Terry Melcher called most of the shots, & they weren't the Beatles. My advice at this point is to skip the \\"essential\\" & \\"legendary\\" releases & grab \\"Just Like Us,\\" Midnight Ride\\" & \\"Spirit of '67.\\" Yeah, Mark's slow songs are awful, but you'll get a good dose of \\"Fang\\" & some excellent Brit/Byrds style retreads. & give the Boys a hand; they did better than swell for a honkin' party band from the Pacific Northwest.Bob Rixon, WFMU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Sound","review":"Whoever mixed this cd should be drummed out of the business. These are not even close to the powerful hit versions of Kicks, Hungry, Good Times, etc. Feeble mixes like these would never have gotten played on radio.

I have the privilage to see Mark on stage next week, and I can hardly wait. I've waited 35 yrs already. That's long enough.

I received it quickly and was satisfied with the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DePaola's Worst","review":"I usually like Tomie DePaola, but this book with its seeming autobiographical nature nearly turned me off his otherwise wonderful work. The lesson it contains about art is so negative and out-of-step with how I have always been believed art should be taught to children. Furthermore, the lesson about teaching and school is just horrible. Tommy is beaten down by one horrible teacher in regards to art so that when another shows the tiniest humanity toward him, it's held up like some amazing kind gesture when really all the children deserved to be treated better and encouraged more. Maybe this was the author's experience and maybe he did somehow learn something positive from it, but is this really the sort of depiction of school and art education you want to present to kids? I honestly don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disheartening plot, would not read it to children","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book made me sad when I read it. The teachers are portrayed like military sargeants (\\"Everyone must use SCHOOL CRAYONS\\") who are insenstive to the talents of a child. The messages are that school is a place where you must do exactly as you are told, that art supplies are stingy in terms of supply (you may only have one piece of paper and don't use up the tip of a crayon), that you are required to do MORE - not different - if you are talented in an area, and finally, that you can only express your talent/creativity if there is time leftover after you have met the base requirements. I was appalled when my daughter brought this book home as an assigned reading in first grade. I don't like the themes, I don't like the characters, I don't like the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good message","review":"Tommy in this book seems spoiled and not willing/able to make something out of what he is given.

It took me nearly a month to read this book as I found myself not getting wrapped up in to this book.For $22.00,I can not recommend this book as there is plenty of more exciting books out there for less money.

The speakers themselves sound very thin and the highs are too bright. I would definitely tell people to spend a bit more and buy something with more sound quality. There are many other manufacturers of small speakers that have a much better overall tonal quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salamanders","review":"My son checked this book out of his school library and absolutely loved it. So much that he now wants to buy it.

Not your typical children's book. Simple, yet there is much meaning behind the story, allowing for discussion with your kid(s). I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone gets angry","review":"This is a wonderful book for children who were adopted. It explains in simple language how easy it is for a child to be angry with his or her parents, and shows that such feelings are normal. But after all, kids love their parents, no matter how they came to be in the family. Buy it. Alyssa A.

If you are a person who will actually sit down and write a couple lines (there's not enough room to write much), it could be good for you. But...I can't really recommend it. Serious scrapbookers should make their own (this is like scrapbook-lite). Non-scrapbookers...well, maybe you want to look at it for yourself before you decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Study Guide","review":"This study guide was extremely helpful to me.

Great sound -- great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I purchased this some time ago and am still enjoying it tremendously. The album has most of my favorite classics on it and they are done in a haunting style. If you love cello and violin, this is definitely a must have.

Jeffrey Scott Shapiro sure knows how to write! I mean, never before have I come across a guide to political economy that better explains international monetary relations. I especially enjoyed the section on David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, and respected the care invested in outlining the nuances of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. While the author seemed overly concerned about the influence of MNCs and BITs on LDCs, he arrives at a welcomed conclusion advocating increased regulation of FDI. Rock on! I reccomend this book to anyone who really wants to see the facts presented in a professional manner! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias! Writer is out to try to ruin Kobe!","review":"This book is one of the most unbelievably biased things I've ever read. The writer seemed jealous of Kobe and his lifestyle, and therefore made him out to be this total creep (and a rapist, obviously.) While public opinion seems to be on the side of \\"Not guilty\\", this book goes as far as to give a detailed account of the rape scene, explaining how Kobe made her bend over (a chair), things he said to her, things that I thought were totally fabricated. Also, the girl is made out to be this sweet, innocent, poor thing just trying to make her way in the world.This is a book designed to organize lynch mobs, and revive the old KKK. Seriously guys? I thought we were past that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel sorry for them both-- Blockbuster is right.","review":"Great revelations, damning to both sides in many cases and a fun read, as much as that's possible from a book about rape. Shapiro and Stevens are storytellers in the tradition of Crichton and King and they have a great story to tell and they do it in a way that keep the action moving forward with some incredible scenes between Kobe and the girl and the girl and some of her friends who think they're still act like their in high school. I follow the case on television but almost every chapter had something that I didn't know either about Kobe or the girl. I would hate to be in either of their shoes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"An in-depth and specific account of the Kobe case to date. Written with hard facts in the style of an entertaining novel. Offers great details about what the victim says happened inside the room that night with Kobe. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lilly Fuller: Kobe's Biggest Challenge","review":"Jeffrey Shapiro's book detailing the many aspects of the Kobe Bryant case is a good source for those interested in following it.The book has a definite pro-victim stance....and gives an in-depth saga of the young woman (who is called \\"Lilly Fuller\\" to protect her identity). Shapiro tells us of the horrors the young woman has faced...from death-threats by crazed Bryant fans to being sold-out by so-called \\"friends\\"Also...Shapiro gives some indication of what Bryant said to police during an interview...and why Bryant's attorneys want to have the statements not admitted during the trial.This book will offend the die-hard \\"Kobe is innocent...girl is lying\\" crowd....but those who feel there is a lot more to this case will discover why the DA in Eagle, Colorado pursued this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meant a lot to me to have read the details of such a lifesty","review":"We had this book at The Evergreen State College Reservation Based Program. This Winter Quarter and I found my journal notes to be about twenty six pages long, this is how much it meant to me. I am thankful for the people to have shared this information with us to be able to treasure in our hearts for ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do I even begin on how bad this film was...","review":"The acting was an abomination (except for the female lead, to which I gave the two stars), the story was inane, and the vulgarity that it tried to convey came off as hilarious instead of shocking. This movie was a perfect example of what NOT to do in a film, and I swear that I have lost more than a few thousand brain cells from having watched it. Please, for all that is great in cinema, do yourself the favor and avoid this at all costs. It has no redeemable value, and you will be angry with yourself for having wasted close to two hours of your life to watching it. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing Doesn't Cover It","review":"I was looking for something a little different yet sexy. There is hardcore sex in this movie, for less than a minute. There is full frontal male & female bodies. There are also amputees behind glass waiting for you to use them. There are people actually suspended by hooks aka body suspension. There is murder, plenty of blood & cannibalism. Could've been zombies, but everyone was very much alive. Seedy, underground clubs & mutilation. This is not for the faint of heart, nor me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film","review":"This film won awards at film festivals and I can only see one reason for it to have won. The cinematography and acting job by the lead character. The film other than that was a bore for me. There was nothing that shocking or shocking at all in the film. But I will give credit to the filmmaker for his directing and the supberb acting, and thats about it. For fans of horror and bizarre cinema skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to find this","review":"Rarely use the typewriter, but when needed, it is very helpful. I was really glad to find the replacement ribbon for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sportscount","review":"These Sportcounts works well as advertised, but if you are using it for swimming to keep track of your laps you better have good vision to be able to see the screen through your goggles. If you want to check your interval times as your swim, you are better off with a watch with a larger face."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"If you are swimming more than a few laps, then keeping up with lengths/laps becomes a problem. A 50 meter pool takes 66 lengths to swim a mile. This fits snugly on your index finger and tracks laps, average times, and total time of the swim. You hardly notice it is on when you are swimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do anything except count","review":"Just got this, turned it on and all I can do is get it to increment the count when you push the button. No timing, no summary, nothing else except reset to 0! It came with no instructions but I found some online, but that didn't help. Amazon's getting it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swim lap counter","review":"I love this lap counter. Keeps track of my laps and lap times. I wish it has a pause button on it, but not a big deal. It will display total laps, avg lap time, time of fastest lap and time of slowest lap. Would be nice if it would display time for each lap. Overall, a a really good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is an amazing item. I use it specifically for counting laps as I swim. I swim daily for 30 minutes and all I could do before was watch the clock and count laps in my head. Then I would start thinking about other things and forget what lap I was on. Now with this nice little waterproof device that fits on my index finger, I turn it on and start the timer and then with my thumb I can just automatically record each lap as I complete it. It was a little hard to begin with before I was able to figure out just the right \\"touch\\" to record the lap. I swim with prescription goggles and just want to be able to hit a button (by touch, not sight) to record the finished lap. It is that easy! Worn on your index finger, you just use your thumb to hit the button. At the end of the session you can get all kinds of information, total of laps that you did complete, the fastest and slowest lap, etc. This can be used for walking laps around a track etc. Great item and the price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Great Compnay","review":"I am a fitness swimmer who was constantly losing count of my laps and never had a truly accurate time on my workouts. I purchased this model based on the reviews I read here and eagerly anticipated using it. It arrived, I ran through the insturctions and quickly understood the function. Nice and simple. On my first swim, it fried before I completed my first lap. I contacted the company, and the rep I spoke with said \\"Oh geez, I'm sorry. We had a shipment come in with some problems.\\" He immediately acknowledged a fault and gave me a remedy. I sent it back and received either a new or repaired one in a few days. It has worked flawlessly since. I don't hit the pool wihtout it. It is refreshing to deal with a company that takes responsibility for their product and provides good customer service. I have recommended it to friends and will not be without one for as long as I am swimming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little device,but . . .","review":"Fits on index finger,thumb controls the single-button input. Works great, BUT the tiny button has tiny tactile \\"click\\" . It is NOT easy to trigger it while swimming. If the button was a little larger,the \\"click\\" more prominent, this device would be FANTASTIC. The display could be 2 mm bigger . . . it is difficult to read at a glance. It defaults to interval timer with each lap click, aggravating when all I need is lap counter . . . GET THE (CHEAPER) SILVERVERSION IF ALL YOU NEED IS A LAP COUNTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 4 months... disappointed.","review":"I bought this about four months ago and used it on average twice a week since. Well, last week, went to the pool and tried to turn it on, and it didn't. It's completely dead. It may be the battery, but I'd still be disappointed if that was the case being that I only had this for 4 months. $30 for 4 months of use (not even daily use) is not right."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working, after battery replacement","review":"I like the device. I've had it for 2 years, after which the battery needed to be replaced. When i replaced the battery it stopped working altogether and started malfunctioning.Furthermore, when i contacted the manufacturer about it, they've refused to offer e replacement or a discount on a replacement.Basically, if you buy this, then expect to need to buy a new one after 2 years (or less if you use it quite often)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was also shipped the wrong device","review":"I was very excited to get my 90010 combination Lap counter/Timer last week, but the same thing happened to me as to another reviewer-despite the fact that the packing slip said lap counter and timer, the device inside was only a lap counter. (I read the instructions on how to use and the device had the color stripe of lap counter only). I suspect a problem at the packaging facility rather than fraud. And yes, the whole returning thing is a hassel-in fact I am out the money because I brought the box to work to try to figure out the process to return it and it was stolen! I plan on buying another one because I think it sounds like such a great device, but I am hoping the company sees these reviews and checks into the problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in Less Than a Month","review":"I used it in an indoor pool for 75 minutes a day, 4 days a week. In less than a month it dropped my count followed quickly with being unresponsive. After it went into power save mode it didn't come back. I won't bother buying another one to see if I just got a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little short","review":"Product performs as stated but there is a little short in mine that causes my finger to tingle just like your tounge does when put on a 9volt battery just not quite as strong.

It was nice not to have to count laps and getting the timing information was a lot of fun. I started a spread sheet with the information and I'll be tracking it from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"90010 sportcounter","review":"This product was recommended by a friend. It arrived in a timely manner, but neither my husband nor I was able to get it to work. We both tried several times, but to no avail. I've returned the product and await to see if we'll get a refund or a counter that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functioned only as a counter","review":"I too received a 90040 counter dressed up like a 90010 counter/timer. The invoice and all the packaging referred to it as the counter/timer but the device only operated as a counter. Given the rash of other recent reviewers who experienced the same thing I would highly recommend not buying this device from this seller. They clearly have a not-insignificant number of defective or misconfigured SportCount devices and despite the multiple returns they have not taken steps to address their stock problem. At best, the seller is negligent; at worst, they're knowingly trying defraud their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect scientific example for that intelligent design argument","review":"Perfect read if you need to reconcile science with intelligent design.

Had he met with some accident with his voice or his lung, or was he a counter tenor before or what? Other than this contributor, it is also difficult for those who speak little other European languages, especially German and Italian, we have to rely so much on subtitles when we should concentrate on the picture...Having said that, most footages are thoroughly enjoyable for some people like me who don't have sufficient background for singing. Without this DVD, great singers as Slezak and Schimdt, and their unique way of expression, would have escaped my attention. For the general audience without much operatic background like me, the contributors are professional enough. Very often they are able to draw our attention to the essential characteristics of these singers and the nuances of their singing. I'm very thankful for their contributions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a Cheap Monitor in a pinch. Got pinched.","review":"This monitor was at an unbeatable price. Upon receiving I found out why.

I would never buy anything used on Amazon due to this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"the second edition brings a new chapter on the graphics pipeline. Well done, except that it is extremely obscure, for those who already understood the arcanes of the graphics pipeline.Chapter 5 on \\"ray tracing\\": 6 pages on root finding of quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials;to compare with Chapter 7: \\"Visibility determination\\": The spatial partitioning deserves solely 4 pages.What's the point on dwelling so much on something that is trivial and botching something that is hard to grasp and of paramount importance ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fantastic","review":"This book is great. Its material is well explained, the topics covered are complete (for the most part), and the examples make sense. It is a fantastic reference that should be on the shelf of any professional game programmer or aspiring game programmer. However, this book isn't a hand holding guide to making \\"cool\\" games, as some reviewers expected it to be. There is no single book for that. There are so many topics to cover, it would be impossible to put them all into one text. Please don't be fooled by reviews from non-professionals, as this book is a must have.

I am so surprised that a book this good is free! The characters in the book are described in great detail making me almost feel like I know them. They are all likable, but not overly perfect. The scenes are described vividly, but not so much that you're reading pages of excess. Everything was done just right. Sometimes it made me feel giddy by reminding me of how falling in love or a first kiss feels.

I thought the introduction of the main characters was cute and left me with the feeling that I had to keep reading.... unfortunately I did. The story gets really silly and annoying. It wasn't believable and very 'loose'. I began skipping paragraphs and looking for key words that might help me get into it. I am bummed I wasted time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"Although pretty typical (rich handsome guy meets beautiful poor girl) it was a good and easy romantic read. Book 2 is inviting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I picked up this book because I'd read some good references to Julie Ortolon in a forum and wanted to try her. I'm afraid this book didn't do it for me. The story line was very weak. In this day and age, a 28-year-old man really plans on marrying a woman he hasn't even dated and feels no romantic connection with because their families want them to marry? And then when he slips and has a liaison with the heroine but later treats her like dirt because of this imaginary engagement, she takes him back in the end?There were engaging parts of this book. I enjoyed Rory's character, and her brother and sister were interesting characters (who I assume will have their own books). But the improbable plot and uneven characterization of the main male character (Chance) spoiled the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh","review":"I would have given this book one star, but in the end it was a pretty easy read and only 99 cents. The story was good and could have been really cute, but the writing was sub par and the characters weren't written with any real depth. I actually liked the sub characters better than the two main characters. Chance and Rory were annoying after awhile. Their misunderstandings about each others feelings just didn't make sense and dragged on for most of the book. I wasn't even going to finish the book because I just didn't care about either one of them, but I did finish it by skippig a lot towards the end.I think if this book had a better writer with the same story line, it could have been really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling for you","review":"Loved this book very funny and I couldnt put it down I read it in one weekend downloaded it on Friday and was done with it on Saturday evening so good!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away with this seller","review":"I had purchase with this seller.

I don't use it in my digital camera cause I never take that many pics at a time. I tried to use it in my LYRA 2 player. It works fine if your not moving. Because it has moving parts it skips a lot and creates a ton more heat than a real compacflash card. DO NOT USE IN A PORTABLE DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER! It skips every time you move. If your're going to put up with skips you might as well use CD-R's for 50 cents each with an MP3 cd player.If you want more space get one of those Archos jukebox recorder things with 20 gigs that work as hard drives too.

But overall my son who is now 4 months old loves the Elmo gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary, and Boring","review":"We purchased this for our 6 month old daughter and for the first two weeks she cried everytime Elmo popped up, it scared her. She did get over that but then after a few uses she was bored with it and doesn't even go near it. Another problem is that it keeps asking the same question, for example find the green guitar....and at 6 months, she can not find the items it was asking her to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"elmo overhead gym","review":"My mil bought this for my son almost 5 years ago and it is still going strong!! My 3rd son is usinging it along with my 2 and 5 year old! Yea its a bit loud but just put a piece of tape or something over it. Its a wonderful product and is very durable!!!! The best feature I like is it goes to a sit up position and you can lay it flat on the floor which is awsome for tummy time. We didn't use it much as an overhead gym so I can't rate it for that the reason being is that with having boy I was nervous about them getting flathead! I would buy this over any play gym all over again!! You will not be disappointed just keep lots of AA\\"s around you will need them. Your child will love it and so will you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had returned it with my first child!","review":"I wish I had returned it 5 years ago when I bought it. The buttons don't work most of the time. My second child now uses it and the buttons still aren't right. example it says find the red guitar and you mash it and it doesn't do anything. It would be a great toy if it didn't have this malfunction. I'm getting rid of it this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed!","review":"We just got this for our 7 month old. She loves pretty much anything Elmo and was laughing so much in the store whenever we activated the demo. We were sure that this was going to be her new favorite toy. After we got it home and together for her, she got bored very quickly with it and now will not give it the time of day. The box claims that this toy says over 40 phrases, but I feel as if it is more like 20. We already put it back in the box and have it ready to be returned for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The toy worked great for the first day. Now it will freeze up immediately after putting it on. You change the batteries and nothing changes. I wish I saw the bad reviews before I purchased it. My son really did like it, but it started scaring him when Elmo would freeze up."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS COOL AT FIRST BUT THEN BROKE DOWN","review":"We saw this toy at Babies R Us and it looked like it was a good gym for our baby. We liked how it had many songs and that Elmo slides back and forth and plays peek-a-boo.Our baby loved the gym. He would track Elmo from left to right and bat at the toys. However, after about a week, the music & Elmo started getting stuck. This happens when we left it in \\"Soothing Mode.\\" This is the mode where the gym plays music continuously for about 10 mins. I thought turning it off and back on would help, but I was wrong. Also, replacing the batteries didn't help either.I read the reviews here after buying it and thought that only some units were defective, but it seems as though most units are defective as many people are reporting the same problem. Good thing we kept the box and Babies R Us has a lenient return policy.Bottom Line: Don't buy this gym, you'll end up returning it within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality toy","review":"My little girl is now almost 1 year old; we bought this toy for her when she was about 6 months old because she loves Elmo so much. We held onto it thinking she may like it some day, but it continues to be too loud for her. The buttons are also sometimes difficult to push and the toy is very unpredictable. Pushing the same buttons do not give the same responses each time; sometimes they do not work at all; I have tried all 3 modes of play and none of them seem to work correctly. I would not recommend this toy at all!!! This toy was very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, but has flaws","review":"We bought this when my son was 4 months old. He loves it. We've changed it to the \\"sit up activity\\" this week, since he is starting to sit. Some of the buttons do not work properly. For example, it says \\"find the yellow lion\\". When you push the lion, nothing happens. He also got a little excited with the mirror that hangs down. It broke off a week after we'd bought the toy. It's still a great toy. It keeps him entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Toy for Infants","review":"This item was purchase for my little girl when she was three months old as a Christmas present. This is an awesome toy she enjoys the lights and the music that it plays. The only problem I had with this toy was at the beginning when I put it in the soothing mode it didn't work. It was as easy as turning it off for a couple of hours and turning it back on. This toy is great and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous: Needs to be recalled!","review":"My 8 month old son absolutely adores this toy, but he turned over to crawl away with the arch down and it caught his foot between it and the little bit of a base that it has. His foot had to be pushed to the side and then removed. His similar Aquarium of Wonders toy has s large enough space to prevent this. He also pulls up to stand and as this toy has no platform it has started to topple over under his 18 pounds (his Aquarium. . .has a platform and we have had no problems and we have caught him and the toy and prevented an actual fall). We have taken the toy from him and we are going to try to take it back to Toys R Us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"The buttons on this toy get stuck. You press them and sometimes they dont make any sound at all. Real bad quality product. I wouldnt recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money and time","review":"It seems like there are alot of defective qualities about this toy. Wishing now I had read the reviews before buying, the defect in our peek-a-boo gym is a new one that hasn't even been listed here yet. The one we bought has a problem with elmo. To elaborate: he is stuck in position and when turned on, this thing roars like it's in pain. The other sounds that were quite normal sounded great, way too loud, but great. But unfortunately, we could not even let our little one play with her toy because of the horrible roaring sound. So, we're packing it back up to take back to Toys R' Us. Initially, I was going to exchange it for another one, but after reading the rest of the reviews, I think we're probably going to get our daughter something else altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned mine","review":"Returned mine:Volume is too loud and ear piercingElmo started talking without touch activation- scared the hell out of me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I purchased this toy when my daughter was 6 months old and she is now 9 months old and still loves it. The problems that I have with this toy are it will tell you to find the yellow lion, etc. and it won't always register when you push it. I also don't think it is balanced enough for a child to pull herself to standing on it. The day I brought home the toy was the day my daughter discovered she could use it to pull herself up. You have to be holding the back of the toy whenever she uses it. My other problem was when elmo plays peek a boo it takes a while for him to pop back up - my daughter is on to other things when he disappears for a few seconds. Other than those 3 things the toy is cute and fun and my daughter gets a big smile whenever she hears Elmo's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"We received this as a gift four our 4-month-old son. He loved the Elmo and the peek-a-boo part didn't even scare him. The variety of songs was great too. Unfortunately, he can only use the toy in the laying down position and the three hanging toys don't work. The sensors that activate the music need to be pushed up but the baby is on his back, pulling down. Unless he hits the toy just right it doesn't respond to his pulls. I could tell he was getting frustrated. I was wondering if they even testing this toy on any infants that couldn't sit up yet. Truly a shame because he loved Elmo, but we will take this back and try a different gym that will interact with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Upon A Time In America","review":"As far as I know, the only series to have been filmed on location throughout the United States; from Huntington Beach, California to Mount Snow, Vermont.

They hail from the dead 80's genre of hair metal. I can't believe people buy this crap, because so much good music is slipping under the radar while this gets recognition. These guys are a joke, nobody can deny that. Instead of copying AC/DC and Van Halen these guys should make their own sound.Go buy Atomship's, Dredg's, Tool's, and Deftones' albums if you want cutting edge rock that is all about a new sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very, very mediocre and derivitive","review":"Outside of the ls's falsetto (and Tiny Tim has original provenance over that) this band does nothing even remotely interesting or unique. I wish that someone could tell me why, if a band's lyrics are purile, utterly bereft of any deeper meaning, and oftimes just embarrassingly stupid, would they include them in the liner notes? If you don't have the lyrics sitting right in front of you, you might mistake what the singers warbling as something decent, even insightful, but in truth it's utter dreck and the documentation merely proves it. But the gratuitous use of obscenities really, really makes the weak writing so much stronger. Okay, not really. I'm so glad I only paid $11 for this POS, but better to not buy it at all.

He sings like his pants might be on too tight.I recommend this music for no one.

Artists are important to any society, and I was looking forward to using this book as one of the ways I communicate that idea to my daughter. What a disappointment!Here's the story: five mice (a very small community) need to gather food for the winter. Four mice end up doing the work while one mouse (Frederick) sits around gathering ideas and inspirations for his poetry. Winter comes, and all five mice share the food that was stored. All the mice are perfectly happy telling stories and entertaining each other until the food runs out. Then they ask Frederick what he stored for the winter, and Frederick spins some beautiful poetry. The epilogue, presumably, is that they all starved because they didn't store enough food!Love, music, poetry: these are the things that make life worth living. But necessities, like air, food, and water, make life possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad excuse for a book.","review":"I was not expecting a glossy hardcover, but this is like a handout.

All the other field mice are working hard to prepare for winter; but, Frederick seems to daydream all the time. When winter comes we see the value of his daydreaming and the importance of poetry and the arts. The book was a 1968 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. I recommend the book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible story!","review":"The first time I read this to our son, I thought it was cute, and the more I thought about it I came to the opinion that this book is in fact garbage! The premise is that if you are a deep thinker and can tell a good story, you don't have to work as hard as everyone else.Frederick doesn't pull his weight in work, because he's watching the sun so he can tell his \\"comrades\\" all about it in the cold of winter, and that's just as good as hard work. The heck with a good work ethic, it's for those other guys not Frederick!This is progressive political indoctrination at it's worst! Why? Because it's aimed squarely at our children!!The fact is if you are a \\"deep thinker\\" and you want that to be your \\"job\\", then you've got to do the hard work as well as the brain work to succeed. Thinking outside of the box is a critical skill important to progress, but so is working harder than the other guys.Read this to your kid as long as you think they might have a great future \\"saving the Princess\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible message","review":"Just started buying books for my baby and came across this one. I know that arts are important to society, but that concept is probably a little abstract for a very young mind to grasp.

This book will never be read to my kid if I have anything to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible lesson for children","review":"My 5-year-old brought this book home from kindergarten yesterday, and I read it to her never dreaming how it would end.The book begins by describing a lazy mouse who sits and does nothing while the rest of his family gather food and supplies for the long winter. On each page, the hard-working mice ask Frederick what he's doing, and he replies with all sorts of lame excuses that amount to one thing: he's doing nothing.In the end, the mice run out of food before the winter ends, but instead of starving, they all are \\"warmed\\" by Fredericks words. As anyone who has ever been hungry can tell you, words make a poor meal.I was stunned by the way the author turned a classic morality tale on its head in order to glorify laziness. I spent the next several minutes explaining to my daughter that this book was a classic example of BAD behavior, and she should never be lazy like Frederick. Please don't subject your children to this anti-morality tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stage one of future Disappointment","review":"I read this book prior to bringing it home to my son to ensure it espoused the values I would want him carry forward in life. To suggest to a young child that Blue Sky and Sunshine will carry you through challenged times is simply setting them up for disappointment. While the rest of the family was showing strong character and work ethic Frederick was a lazy day dreamer that made no contribution. If he had worked along side his family in preparation for winter they would have had more fuel for their bodies and straw to keep them warm. Essentially he became a burden on his family and could only share mystic thoughts of yesteryear while his siblings and parents starved themselves during the dead of winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"If you are a poet you must read this book.

Ub40 have turned into a money making machine and I understand why their songs are never heard on any of the radio stations in Jamaica. They represent British music exploitation at its best. I'm sure Bob Marley would be disgusted if he heard UB40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Labour of love III is awsome","review":"No other band in the world has reproduced better the rich Jamaican music we know as Reggae.

I just wish they'd list who the original artists were. A note: If you can find original versions of the \\"Labour of Love\\" songs, they're usually worth buying.

I guess that is caused by the rubber bottom. The inside stainless steel, after first time using, leaves stain at the bottom and sides. Besides, the plastic around the filter is some kind of very cheap material, which cannot bear boiling water. As said in the user's guide: use hot water, but not boiling water right from stove. I would recommend you for Bodum French Press(the stainless steel ones, not the glass ones), which are high quality products.But if you don't care about the cheap material, don't care about the smell, only like the portable feature and the color, that might be a right one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not insulate heat","review":"I don't know what everyone is raving about when they say it retains heat. I have 2 glass beaker coffee presses and decided to buy this since it is advertised as \\"double walled vacuum-sealed\\" so I could have hotter coffee after preparation. Now I have several vacuum-sealed mugs and Starbucks stainless steal vacuum-sealed tumblers so I was expecting the same quality. Unfortunately right after adding hot water you will feel the heat on the outside surface of the press. And I don't mean a tiny bit warm. I mean you will burn your hand if you held it. Everything else about the press works as advertised but since it doesn't retain heat it defeats the original purpose of buying such a product.

Each track started in the middle of the song and then repeated every 4 bars or so until the track ended - no intro, no chorus/verse/bridge structure, no breakout solos, no dynamics, no end.

David Mead, who has been a guitar instructor for many years, writes it in a very light-hearted way. However, the instruction that he gives is very serious and is a good foundation for beginners. Mr. Mead explains the essentials of what you need to know about chords, scales, reading tabs, etc. The core of the book is the 10-minute workout itself. This is based on scales, chords, arpeggios and speed/endurance, etc. Basically, you start out with five fairly simple exercises that you must complete in two minutes. As you become proficient, the exercises become more complex. These exercises combined with the other material in the book should have a beginning guitar player able to hold his/her own on about 6-8 months. It is no \\"secret shortcut\\" book. You earn everything you learn, it's just set up in a logical progression and is based on cumulative practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple exercises to make your fingers nimble!","review":"I like this book a lot because as a beginning guitar player it keeps it simple and gives you short exercises to work your fingers.

It even includes an edited version of a Labelle song that Nona sang lead on, from their last album, the indescribable A MAN IN A TRENCHCOAT [ VOODOO ]. The only quibble I have is that the label [ Razor & Tie ] put on the long version of BUSTIN' OUT, which lasts almost 9 minutes & features long instrumental passages . They should have put on the 3:45 minute single version that is to the point and packs more of a punch.

One of the best shows on TV! Too bad it lasted only 6 seasons - - perhaps because of Bob Crane's murder?? I would love to have all seasons on DVD, but sadly, English sub-titles are not offered. I can HEAR perfectly well, but have difficulty understanding the words. So the producers have lost 6 sales. If it had subtitles, I'd have given it 5 stars!If you don't need sub-titles, buy it! You'll love it if you enjoy a good laugh at impossible-to-happen nonsense. No slapstick, just great situations gone comically wrong - for Stalag 13's benefit! All characters marvelously played by perfectly-chosen actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless Humor","review":"Hogan's Heroes are mindless, humorous walk into what was a horrible time for our planet...we can only deal with itby poking fun at it and laughing at it....would be wonderful if such action did happen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we wanted","review":"You can have hours of fun with this as our entire family loves these. You get alot for your money and it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Men Love Hogan's Heroes!","review":"As a female, I thought the show was a little tedious the first couple of seasons .But, I have to admit that it get's funnier with each season. Men love it all, and even my two sons like to watch it with their dad. I have heard my teenage son laughing out lad hysterically while watching this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After listening to Never Never Land I could not wait to get my hands on anothe CD by Jane. Got Come Dream With Me and was really excited when I heard the first cut Over The Rainbow then it was all downhill from there. I admire her ability to be able to sing very technically difficult songs but they ar not pleasant to listen to. I know that artists feel the need to perform these to prove a point but should save them for live performances. Being able to sing flatted fifths or augmented sevenths may be impressive but not very pleasing to the ear. Hope she gets better direction on her next CD till then I will keep listening to Never Never Land. I think she needs the exposure of singing with a Big Band like Rob McConnell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not jazz, just wonderful","review":"Okay, first off, stop calling this jazz. Jane isn't jazz just because a jazz band backs her up, any more than Sinatra is a jazz singer because Basie's band or Red Norvo's band backed him up. Let's not even mention Basia, because I'm limited to a thousand words. That being said, just because she isn't a jazz singer doesn't mean I don't LOVE this album. Okay, her cover makes her look like a muppet, but listen to that voice! test one for any doubters among you: can any singer who makes that treacly Bread detritous \\"If\\" sound like a classic be anything short of promising? Hey, loose her on the Carpenter's catalogue, I'm sure she's up to the challenge. To paraphrase Nike...Just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming of Jane","review":"Jane Monheit makes torching a tune seem so effortless that it is easy to forget the skill and dedication behind the music. In Come Dream With Me, Jane delievers on the promise so teasingly offered in her first CD. There is growth and artistry that never surfaced in her first recording. The only glitch in this collection is Over The Rainbow, a tune that simply cannot be improved. Judy marked it as hers, now and forever. Miss Monheit's second CD offers a bright bit of swing as well as the rich soulful styles she has made her own. Jane, Jane come out and play, you've got so much to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Featured on other albums","review":"This album Come Dream with Me is amazing. Jane's incredibly talented and really makes a mark. This CD is the best of the best. And if you liked this CD I suggest you check out her appearance on two tracks on the new Les Brown album \\"Session 55.\\" It's worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIKE A RAINY AFTERNOON.....SOOO SOOTHING!","review":"I've never purchased a jazz CD but when I sampled these songs, I instantly purchased it. Hard to believe she's only in her early twenties...sounds like she has being singing for decades! What a scrumptious voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Second Effort","review":"Jane Monheit is obviously not a pure jazz singer, and IMHO, thank God for that! This is one of the finest female voices I have ever heard, and while \\"Come Dream With Me\\" does slightly disappoint in comparison to the more upbeat \\"Never, Never Land\\", it has enough wonderful performances (Over the Rainbow, Blame it on My Youth, A Case of You) to mark it as a must own CD for anyone who loves luscious vocals married to style, taste and intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Slump","review":"If this CD had been Jane's first, I very likely would have been more impressed. But \\"Never Never Land\\" is so nearly flawless, that it's not surprising that \\"Come Dream With Me\\" falls flat. She does a stunning version of that tired standard, \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\". Then later she ruins the mood with Bread's maudlin tune, \\"If\\" and tackles Joni Mitchell with \\"A Case of You\\" changing a word or two while she's at it. She tries to save all this with \\"Blame it on My Youth\\", but it's too little, too late. Although her voice is marvelous and I look forward to her next effort, I think the CD starts out very strong in the beginning, starts to unravel in the middle, and becomes unlistenable at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Sophmore Effort","review":"This album is very good -- my personal preference is Never Never land, which is less produced and fresher. But I am flabbergasted by the backlash Jane Monheit is experiencing in the jazz scene. Since when does talent, opportunity, saavy marketing and beauty equal setting low standards in vocal jazz? Why can the jazz community be happy for young Jane and those like her? By attaining the level of record sales Ms. Monheit has reached, she broadens the acceptance of jazz into entire generations of listeners. What she is recording may not be perfect yet, but keep on going Jane! We're here for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Dreams","review":"Over 50 years of vocal music is covered in this wonderful CD. Not since Judy garland has there been such a heart-wrenching renhition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" - but the vocal quality is of a caliber never achieved by Garland. From \\"I'll Be Seeing You\\" to \\"Waters of March\\", her interpretations are warm and exciting. I rate it four stars rather than five only because I missed the lyrics in the CD jacket (which were included in her first CD 'Never-Never Land\\", a 5 star if there ever was one). Try it you'll like it - and become addicted to Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but not Jazz","review":"It becomes increasingly concerning, this newly packaged \\"jazz singer\\" situation, not just Jane, but Diana Krall and others....the creative spirit is missing. The depth is missing. The voice is quite nice, but, it's just hard to feel much of anything from it. And, it's the feeling and creativity that I listen for in jazz.I want the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It is better to look good, than to sing good\\" R. Montalban","review":"I cannot agree with the other reviews that I have seen for this recording, thus far.I guess that this is what it takes for jazz vocalists to get heard - the ability to LOOK GOOD. Carefully molded, cautiously photographed,songs chosen, highly paid studio cats to lend credibility... is this what we want from Jazz? Are we all really just sheep? THIS IS A GREAT JAZZ VOCAL ALBUM????? This is a jazz karoke recording. The magic of great music does not appear on this recording. Ignore the beauty factor and RUN out to buy the new Shirley Horn CD (You're My Thrill) if you are looking for an AMAZING Jazz vocal recording and wish to feel the magic of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding!","review":"This woman can sing! I am not a big jazz fan, but this album blew me away. This is one of the best voices I have ever heard. Buy this CD, you will not be sorry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"with all due respect - buy a reissue of a real vocalist like Ella, Sarah. Billie, Dinah or a new recording buy Diana krall or Cassandra Wilson - - Jane just doesn't sound sincere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Base your reviews on whether or not she can sing.","review":"I fail to see why beauty and age should be factors in a review of any singer. Billie Holiday and Carmen Mcrae were not too hard on the eyes either, and they are legends of vocal jazz. Jane has a beautiful and very emotive voice. She has great phrasing and a stellar group of musicians accompanying her. Personally, I like my singers to be a little more bluesy and rough around the edges. Give me Cassandra Wilson (another beautiful woman), the late great Terri Thornton, or even the sweet and sassy relaxed vocals of Shirley Horn anyday. But I have no problem giving my kudos to Jane Monheit. A Case of You is one of my favourite Joni Mitchell songs, and I doff my hat to Jane's rendition. Diana Krall faced the same criticism that she was too young and good looking to be talented. Listen to the cd, if that voice of liquid honey backed by the great Kenny Barron, among others, does not move you , check for a pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future Superstar","review":"What a pleasure it is to be able to watch a superstar career in the making. Jane Monheit is a young but true talent. Her second CD is beyond being a pleasurable listen. Her voice approaches greatness at times, and I can't help but think that she could become one of the best jazz singers ever. She has a voice that is a musical instrument, fluid and mellow. Few voices ever captivate me, but hers is an exception. But voice is only one dimension. Monheit knows music and sings it with both understanding and deep emotion.I hope Monheit's career is carefully and properly managed. I look forward to future CDs, appearances, and who knows what else could be in store.I recommend this CD without hesitation to anyone who loves vocals and jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming with Jane Monheit","review":"Hearing Jane Monheit sing is truly balm for my soul. She doesn't know how her albums.....and I have 4....have helped me get through a period of grief.Joanne"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly its a disappointing record","review":"I bought this at the same time as I bought 'Dreamsville' by Stacey Kent, and Miss Kent's album is better, ten times better. If you don't believe me then give Stacey a try - I'll bet good money you'll agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz Singer???","review":"Why people keep refering to this lady as a jazz singer is beyond me. Pleasant, I suppose, but she ain't no jazzer. It's probably the same people who refer to Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Bing Crosby as so. If that's the case, where do we put Kurt Elling, Mark Murphy, Jon Hendricks etc. Same with women...Jane Monheit isn't in the same league as Sheila Jordan, Anita O'Day, Annie Ross,Betty Carter, Carmen McCrae, even Cassandra Wilson.If you want easy listening, buy it. If you want jazz vocals,keep digging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who are jazz fans","review":"Ms. Monheit is a talented singer but one who doesn't understand the first thing about jazz phrasing and improvisation. I'm not a big fan of her singing style, but some may like it. At any rate, she's not a \\"JAZZ\\" singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Laughed So Hard When I Heard This Album","review":"First of all, Jane Monheit has a lot of people fooled into thinking she's some kind of extraordinary jazz vocalist, well she's far from it. She doesn't even deserve to be labeled jazz. She's pretty good looking, but I guess that kind of thing is what sells records nowadays doesn't it? The musician's artistic merit and pure musical ability don't get graded much anymore do they? That's why I'm here writing this review. There are people out there that are diehard jazz listeners and know talent when they hear it, unfortunately, Jane Monheit doesn't qualify as jazz anything. She's just another example of a record company gone greedy and everything that's wrong with music today. Perhaps she needs to take some pointers from Cassandra Wilson, Shirley Horn, and Diana Krall. These women have more talent in their pinkies, then Monheit has in her whole body. What a disgrace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I received a recommendation based upon my purchases of Diana Kral CDs. In my opinion, Jane Monheit is as bad as Diana Kral is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever else, not a jazz singer","review":"Has good song selection, but the lady's definitely not singing jazz (or swing).Needs lots of work on her voice and phrasing, among other things, if she's ever to prevail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane has miles and miles to go before she can become great","review":"Son, son Jnae has a long way to go before reaching greatness. Her journey has just begun and there is so much distance to be covered before the end.I think Jane has a lot of potential, but there is a lot of experiments that she will need to make over the next few years. She will need to get her feet wet with real life situations. To truely understand these torch songs, requires more than just a good voice. These songs require having a lot of hurt and pain in your life.Let's just sit back and look a Jane over the next several years and see if she doesn't get better with age. Maybe she will and maybe she won't. We'll just have to wait and see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds real good to me! Smooth and nice!","review":"I've been a jazz fan for over 40 years. I never heard of Jane Monheit until I heard a cut on the radio one night. I couldn't care less if she looked like \\"Aunt Esther\\" or Marilyn Monroe, it just sounded great. What a pleasant surprise when I saw the cover. The important thing is, she sounds real good!! I can't understand why anyone would rate this CD 1 or 2 stars. Maybe, these two other reviewers have a personal vendetta against her. Jane Monheit is one of the most vibrant jazz singers I've ever heard. If you love jazz singing, you'll love this album. Just because she doesn't sound like Ella or Billie or Cassandra, don't put her down. She sounds like herself. Sounds real good to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading all the other reviews.............","review":"......... I wanted to get my two cents in. Mainly because everyone is right. The 5 star reviews and the 1 star reviews are both valid. The good reviews keep pointing to Monheit's voice, which is outstanding. The pans point to a poor song selection featuring few up-tempo numbers. Right again. So if you're a jazz fan like the rest of us, decide for yourself. If ballad after ballad isn't your cup of tea, you won't care for this cd. If a full album of slow tunes won't trouble you, you'll probably like it. My two star review is because I think the cd should have been more balanced, but I'd rate it 4 stars if it were not for that. So now you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Dream With Me","review":"Jane Monheit is an incredibly talented and sweet young woman. She simply has a gift. She opened this year's Litchfield Jazz Festival and there were just as many people (if not more) there for her than for Dave Brubeck. Once in a generation is there a voice like this. Please support this young women and go to her gigs and buy her records! Enjoy and learn from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's okay, but...","review":"Both of her albums are okay, but she's got a long way to go. I'm not saying she isn't talented, because she is, but at this stage she's -- well -- boring. I know others who have written reviews think she's a great jazz singer, but listen to her music again. Is it really jazz the way she presents it? I don't think so. She could be good someday, but not now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul music for the white bread crowd in Westport Conn","review":"Would you even be listening to her if she wasn't attractive but rather 300 pounds and homely?

She does an excellent job of Waters of March! You have to hear it to experience it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illinois was DEAD on","review":"Check out the review below from a music fan from Illinois--he/she was dead on. First album (never never land), my favorite. Second album (this one) a disappointment. I barely listen to it, if at all. Some good songs, too down tempo, too ballad-y. I never thought I'd say that about an album. But the result is that by the middle of the album, every song sounds like each other--pass the sorbet! Some ambitious fusion choices (like Illinois, I did not like IF, loved Joni Mitchell's a case of you). Perhaps, like some good authors, the sophomore effort can be a bit disappointing, especially if we fans have some sort of expectation set. I would recommend skipping this album and wait for the next one. I still love Jane, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low end Rear Surround Speakers","review":"I purchased these speakers to be used as my rear surround source because of their size and color. Although I order white, I ended up with a pair of black speakers. I decided to keep the speakers instead of going through the hassle of returning them.As far as the sound quality, when playing music, I found the sound to be quite tinty, not suitable for full range music, but they are decent enough for rear speaker sound effects from movies.For the price, I really can't complain, after all, they are mediocre speakers.If not for the mix up in color, I would have given the speakers a rating of 3 stars, but since I did not get what I ordered, I lowered my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"I ordered these speakers to use as rear surround speakers bacause they were small. The first time I got them they were both broken in half and cracked. I figured it might just be a one time thing so I sent them back and waited for the replacements. They arrived pretty fast, but when I opened the box they were both broken and cracked again. Now three weeks later I am waithing for a refund. DO NOT order this product, Even if they weren't broken I still would have not been very happy with them. I know they were only 25 dollars but they looked like they would be worth a tenth of that .

They sounded great and could handle a lot of power.I decided to buy a pair of white ones and pair them with the black ones to complete the rear and suround portion of my home theater. Well the white ones wern't anywhere near the sound quality of the black ones!!! Same speaker, different color, WHAT????? Well after trying a couple of things I noticed the white ones had thin cracks all over them and they would rattle if you turned them up. Also one of them was louder than the other.Well, I got burned on this one. By the time I went to use them and figured out some one had dropped them several times and over powered one of them, then returned them to Amazon, it was past the return limit and Amazon would not take them back. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY RE-SOLD THEM TO ME IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I always trusted Amazon.

When got to a computer I put some words into search, others were asking also. It came back Drift Away by Dobie Gray. Come to find out several songs I knew of. For months try buy in stores but was told to old of song artist only online. kept looking anyway. My Birthday was Sept that is what I wanted. I did get it finally for christmas, play it constant.

My life was ruined and I hated Kevin.But after listening to the music on the album, I can only say \\"Thank-You Kevin Federline!\\" My life now has meaning.

I do have to give credit where credit is due and Federline really nails down the \`me' attitude of the self-indulgent self-proclaimed celebrity in his lyrics (almost all of which are about him, what the media thinks of him, etc). I find it rather unfortunate that people like him get to enjoy the amenities of a high-dollar West Coast studio while so many of the musicians that I know, those who have true talent and decades of dedication to the creation of original music, have to slug out the rent with a three dollar cover charge. Maybe that's what Federline was talking about when he claimed to be screwing Lady-luck, but probably not. In the end Lady-luck apparently was screwing him out of large fortune and a plane ticket to lasting celebrity status but at least he had a chance to ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Just looks at you*","review":"Oh my! Kevin Federline owes me 32 minutes of my life back for listening to this album. That's the nicest thing that I can say.

I feel violated...","review":"I just heard this album being played in my house and I actually thought it was a joke. All of the songs are total crap. I can't believe K-Fed actually thought anything on this album would be good enough for humans to listen to. His songs are horrendous and his childish lyrics are enough to make people want to stick flaming q-tips in their ears. I can not imagine anyone listening to this garbage and thinking it passes as music. The only reason to buy this album is the laugh factor.

This, I'm dead serious, is the worst album ever released. Did you know up to this date he has only sold 7,000 copies? Also, while he was touring, he had to cancel a lot of the shows due to no one buying tickets. Only 300 people came to one show and they were giving away tickets for free. Not only that, but only a 1/3 remained after it ended. Yes Fed-Ex, you really are \\"America's Most Hated\\". I, being smart, downloaded this album just so I could review it.

We seriously didn't need another Vanilla Ice.Tell you what, buy this CD if you want, but don't come crying to me telling me that \\"I didn't warn you\\" B.S., because I definitely warned you and made it clear.

The whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Vanilla Ice, but I think K-Fed has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '06, Kevin released this: \\"Playing With Fire\\" - his most accomplished album. I think his undisputed masterpiece is \\"Dance with a Pimp\\" - a song so catchy, most people don't listen to the lyrics, but they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of friends, it's also a personal statement about Federline himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"why.","review":"why would you stoop this low and shameyour loved ones by even thinking aboutpurchasing something this unfathomablywrong. sometimes people use old cd'sas coasters. i don't think you couldeven use this release in that capacitybecause the cup/mug would explode upontouching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"The very existence of this cd is a true testiment to the current state of the music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stapling my weener to a 2 x 4 and smashing it with a hammer would be less painful.","review":"This guy is without a doubt the king of douchebags.Horray!K-Tard can at least celebrate that huh?Is his 15 mins of shame up yet?Hell even William Hung had more talent then this idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a","review":"pant load.If he weren't married to Britney \\"I Sold My Body Instead of My Talent when I was a kid\\" Spears, Kevin, aka \\"Cletus\\" would be your deadbeat brother-in-law sleeping on your couch, bumming money for cigarettes and beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Baby Jesus, It's Awful!","review":"Kevin Federline, you made Baby Jesus Cry.

Fast forward the song to about 7:45 and it plays a song called \\"Middle Finger\\" (self explanitory)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be used to interrogate spys / prisoners / terrorists.","review":"Honestly. Lock the terrorist in a cell and crank \\"Playing with Fire\\". Before the CD reaches Bonus Track 1 we'll have the guy spilling the beans about where they hide those WMDs and roadside bombs! I'm sure it was thought of but Amnesty International would probably put a stop to it immediately. It's just not right.But seriously they dumped some very serious money into this CD you can tell. The cover slide out looks like something my 14 year old could put together in year book class. The entire CD is just mind boggling bad. You wonder how something like this even gets stamped to a CD in the first place.It's funny to think that the recording studio workers were probably driving home laughing their butts off when they recorded this CD. I mean, sure they kept a straight face while in front of The Man so the could keep collecting their paychecks but that drive home had to just be such a release of laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is AWESOME.......","review":".....as a white elephant gift. You are your friends will laugh for hours, or even minutes when your idiot buddy gives this to another moron at a white elephant gift exchange. You'll first laugh so hard at the cover and the pictures inside that you'll want to punch your grandma in the throat. Then when you begin to listen to the horrible stuff that is supposed to be music, you'll slap your dog so hard that he'll splash all the water right out of your bath tub.

But, I do thank Mr. Spears because I so have my White Elephant gift for this years party.He keeps saying that he doesn't mind the \\"haters\\" because that just helps fuel his creativity. I don't think so.The lyrics are comical. With lines like \\"Cab looked better than a couple pair of Grammys\\" and referring to himself and his wife as Bonnie and Clyde.

I honestly think my colon was trying to kill me for letting it be exposed to this. If you want an honest comparison, picture this: Federline's sense of flow and timing are less developed than William Shatner doing \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" from his album, The Man From Tomorrow. There's a little technical proficiency in this mess, but it's wasted on Mr. Spears, who believes we'd all be better people if we just understood how great he really is. Ugh.

Those who call this album a \\"classic\\", loses all creditability as a music critic and obviously has never listen to rap music. K-fed basically lacks the lyrical talent of artists like Naughty By Nature, Jay-Z, and Nas. Also, his voice and flow needs a little more practice ,maybe he needs to spend more time rhyming on freestyles in mixtapes before relasing this type of garbage.Playing with fire, More like playing with himself.K-fed, why you don't go back to your old day job as a backup dancer and stop having stop babies, you scumbag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this aint even fair","review":"I got this CD as a gag gift and for some strange reason, I actually played it. It was so bad I actually listened to the whole album (while often fast forwarding the song) just to see if it could not get any worse, and to my horror, it did.This is just shameful. Theres a reason why William Hung sold more albums to this point and why \\"K-Fed\\" had to cancel 9 of his 12 shows so far on his tour. Just to put in perspective, in San Diego he sold 9 tickets to his concert.....NINE!

This talentless hack can't faze Vanilla Ice, so much can be expected from our friend K-Fed, I feel so bad that he's gonna be laugh at in the entire world(old school Vanilla Ice style).P.S.

For some reason Amazon keeps denying them. My best guess is that I included some of Kevin's lyrics in previous reviews, and Amazon's \\"horrid writing\\" sensors went nuts and rejected them.Suffice to say, this was awful. What was worse, though, was the five minutes I lost out of my life when watching him perform on Ellen. For a former backup dancer, he has zero moves as a rapper. Then again, he has zero skill as a rapper, so it shouldn't be too surprising.He spent most of the album bragging about his ill-gotten wealth, and unfortunately for him it's his braggadocio that has fans and the media gunning for him.I am especially glad that he will NOT be taking Brittany for a ride.

It's something I've looked at for awhile as a \\"fun\\" potential upgrade, but I'd been overwhelmed at the price. Well, I got this for a reasonable rate, and I must I'm pleased at the results. The car definitely has more seat of the pants power, and the additional intake noise is fun as well. At normal throttle settings, it's nearly indetectibe. So far, no negative trade-offs in my opinion.The installation is fairly straight forward, though the directions falsely indicate \\"with supplied hardware\\", where you actually use existing hardware to mount several components. This did set me back a little. Also, the radiator shroud bolt is not long enough to accomodate the forward mounting bracket. One trip to the hardward store for a longer 8mm cap screw solved this however.Overall good kit, and it makes my 2000 HPP car more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds louder, revs faster, and lower mpg","review":"Just as the title, it sounds louder, revs faster, and getting lower mpg.

This book captures all of the above and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Insightful, Fascinating.","review":"...I bought this book in a discount house on a whim. It has turned out to be one of the most worn books in my library. This is NOT an encyclopedia of Oaxacan woodcarvings, or a catalogue of such, which may have been to the disappointment of one of the reviewers. The writer does an OUTSTANDING job at studying this group of people and their craft/artform as an anthropological survey, that is not in the least bit dry. Great stories, and imaginative professional photography of numerous pieces. This is the book, that caused me to travel 2,000 miles and spend thousands of dollars to meet the people that the author writes about....and that is the only caveat I have towards this book; it will introduce you to a culture steeped in poignancy, depth and every bit as 'magical' as its' title suggests. 5 stars. No, 10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK product, with dangerous zipper","review":"After the first night, we thought this sleep sack was ok. It fit fine, and the mesh opening at the bottom did seem to keep the boy's feet from getting too stinky. But there were issues: The satin lining makes it kinda hard to hold the baby--he slid around inside it too much. And the zipper is terrible! It feels chintzy from the first time you use it--the pull tab gets stuck. And then on the second morning, we brought our son into bed with us. After a little while we noticed little blue flecks on our sheets. The paint was peeling off the zipper's pull tab! I'm not a maniac about baby safety, and I understand that my boy will be exposed to things and put all kinds of dirt into his mouth, but I certainly don't want it to be detritus that comes off his supposedly baby-safe clothing.If it weren't for the zipper, I'd give this two or three stars. But because of that, it gets one. How hard would it have been for the manufacturer to use a better zipper?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I had purchased sleep sacks of various brands before ordering this one through Amazon. When it arrived, it looked nice, but not as good of quality as I would expect for the price. When I started playing around with it, I noticed that the zipper and the overall quality just weren't good enough for me. The zipper pull actually came off. I don't think this product would have lasted for many washes and wears! We sent it back immediately. Go with a better known brand. We even bought some of these at Walmart and Target that were wonderful quality and a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time!","review":"This story is a major rehash of Wuthering Heights. There are no new ideas, and March, the lead female character, is weak and unbelievably lame. This book is further evidence that classic stories, like Wuthering Heights, should be left alone and not re-written, or you run into the danger of having a book like Here on Earth that offers nothing new. Why read Here on Earth when you can read Wuthering Heights, which is the same story, but is much more memorable and thus a far better read? Oprah, what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here on Earth reads like a cheap romance novel","review":"I have been an Alice Hoffman fan for many years, always seeking out her new books to read. I loved The Drowning Season, Seventh Heaven, Turtle Moon, Second Nature, and Illumination Night. However, I really felt like Here on Earth was written by a totally different person. I don't read romance novels (trash), but I felt that Here on Earth was geared towards readers of romance novels. Because it was on Oprah's reading list, I will never again trust any book on that list. I bought the book only because it was written by Alice Hoffman, NOT because it was on Oprah's list. I believe it is for people who are not serious readers of literature. Shame on Alice Hoffman for lowering her quality of writing. I'm appalled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not her best work","review":"I have read ALL of Alice Hoffman's books and was very excited when this one came out. I have to admit though, I am a little disappointed. I am about half-way through the book and finding it not a compelling read (I keep hoping I'll get hooked)HOWEVER, I would urge any reader - whether you are loving this book, or hating it - read her other work, ESPECIALLY \\"TURTLE MOON\\". That was my introduction to Hoffman and really blew me away. Don't give up on Alice, every book can't \\"hit a home run\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your self a favor and read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" instead","review":"I don't usually read Oprah books, but since this was supposed to be the \\"90's Wuthering Heights,\\" I thought I'd give it a try. Not only is the writing miserable, but the plot is strangely very close to that of the novel written 150 years ago. Coincidence? I think not. Poor Emily Bronte must be rolling in her grave. If anyone wants to read a truly good book instead of this homemaker fantasy trash, go to your library and pick a classic. Wuthering Heights would be a good one if you didn't already know the plot word for word from \\"Here on Earth.\\" But really, I think Oprah should give up the \\"book\\" club. By her choices, we wonder if she ever passed high school english."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to skip","review":"While reading this book I went from loving it to disliking it rather quickly. The story moved very fast and kept my attention at the beginning, but it soon became..well a disappointment. Its hard to read a book that has such a dark qualities everywhere. I can't imagine the sun shinning at any point within this story! When I was through with the story I didn't learn anything about love, instead I felt like was tricked into reading a horrible romance novel. I honestly don't recommend this book. If you are in search of a good book with awesome characters I recommend \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" by Wally Lamb, or \\"Where the Heart Is\\" by Billie Letts. \\"Here on Earth\\" is one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the rabbits?","review":"Nope ... didn't like it.

Infidelity, physical abuse, alcoholism, incest ... and they're worried about RABBITS?"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy reading","review":"While this book was easy to read, I didn't find myself not being able to put it down. In comparison to Oprah's other selections it falls under the traditional lines of a woman suffering and depressed. Hollis seemed too good to be true in the beginning.Victims of abuse will find this title amazing and powerful, if not painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't draw me in","review":"I love reading. I've read just about all of Oprah's pick and this one was the most disappointing. I didn't feel for March at anytime during the story. Hollis was presented as this complicated villian/hero who was only confusing at best. I don't think that the author gave us enough to actually care for anyone in the story at all. This was my first time reading a book by this author and probably the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"An strong resemblance to Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"","review":"I was surprised by how much this story resembles \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" For example, the estranged family relationships, Heathcliff vs Hollis, the moores vs the marshes, the relationship between lover and brother, and their mysterious path to wealth. Fortunately this story isn't nearly as tragic as Bronte's. However, Hoffman still keeps the reader glued to the book turning page after page to uncover Hollis and March's fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete letdown...or a good waste of valuable reading time","review":"Don't be fooled by the interesting synopsis on the back of the book...this book doesn't deliver. I don't expect a happy ending in every work of fiction, but this one leaves you completely high and dry. The first part is full of wonderful detail and introspection, unfortunatley that part takes up three-quarters of the book. There is no climax until the book is 75% over and the reader is left feeling that the end is very rushed. \\"Come on, Alice. Time's up!\\"...\\"Oh, O.K....just give me another five minutes.\\" I appreciate foreplay as much as the next girl, but the finish has to count for something! Romance is best the first time around, we get that, but did she have to take up so much time getting to the point? I'd pick another book before I'd recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off of \\"Wuthering Heights\\"","review":"Do yourself a favor: read the beautifully written classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\" by Emily Bronte instead of \\"Here On Earth\\". The first is a work of genius; the second is a BLATANT rip off without the talent !! There is a slight difference in plot,a \\"what if\\" question one which every \\"Wuthering Heights\\" fan probably wondered, but that's it. Note the dedication page : \\"To E.B.\\" I think Ms. Hoffman should have paid a TRUE homage to EMILY BRONTE , and the original story WUTHERING HEIGHTS. How can you basically take someone else's idea and not give them proper credit or homage????"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting take-off on an old classic","review":"Some people seem to be offended that Hoffman would dare use the plot of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" so blatantly for one of her novels, but I found it fascinating for just this very reason. What WOULD have happened if Heathcliff had gotten Cathy back? This \\"rewrite\\" of that wonderful classic into a modern setting and that unmistakeable Hoffman-like language is intriguing to say the least.That a happily married woman can once again become snarled into an old erotic relationship and can't get out is a highly-charged story all in itself. That her daughter, who seems on the fast track to becoming a slut, finds peace through a horse, balances the first lurid story out beautifully.For me the novel is a good study of how erotic attraction can blind a person, and just how worthwhile true friendship in a relationship is.Still my favorite Hoffman novel (that I've read) so far is \\"Turtle Moon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Hoffman Books Than This","review":"Flat characters, predictable storyline, plodding chapters--a frustrating and unsatisfying read. Unless you are a dedicated Hoffman fan, I recommend skipping this book. Instead, I highly suggest \\"Blackbird House,\\" which better reflects her skills as a storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating read","review":"Some reviewers seem to hate this book for stealing the plot of Wuthering Heights. I, never having read Wuthering Heights (and now confused about whether I should bother), still disliked this book. I generally disliked many of the characters and the choices they made, and I won't rave about Alice Hoffman's writing style, though it is difficult to put my finger on what exactly bothered me. Perhaps the author was trying to prove a point about obsessive love, but characters' behavior seemed to change too abruptly. I knew early on that the book would only frustrate me, but the story was captivating enough to keep me reading. The end wasn't so bad, but getting there was painful. I'm sure others will enjoy this book -- to each his own -- but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was my first Alice Hoffman novel. I think she is a good writer, and the story held my attention. (The similarities to Wuthering Heights are unmistakable... at least for a good part of the book.) But the ending was ridiculous, in my opinion.The main character sort of fades out of the story, as does her daughter. The book ends up being about three completely different characters than it's starts out (and continues for quite a while) being about.I must have missed something along the way, but I found the ending contrived, disappointing and flat.I also found the transformation of the daughter (and the main character as well) pretty far-fetched.All in all, I don't recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"About an inch away from a Danielle Steele Novel","review":"I'm surprised that this is an Oprah book. There's no depth to the characters or the plot. I feel no connection to their lives or decisions. Based on this novel, I would not read another Alice Hoffman book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"I have never read any other book by Alice Hoffman and, based on this book, I will never read a second book by her. This book was so shallow. The characters were shallow, the plot was non-existent and there was not a likable person in the bunch. March stays with Hollis and, then leaves Hollis for no apparent reason. There is no explanation as to why she puts up with his abuse and there is no explanation as to why she suddenly comes out of her haze and leaves him. The ending was predictable and telegraphed almost immediately. I have rarely read a book as bad as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who did not enjoy Here on Earth...","review":"Please do not give up on Alice Hoffman! I have read all of her books and found Here on Earth not to be up to her usual high standards. Please read Turtle Moon and Second Nature and of course Pratical Magic. You won't be disappointed !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible","review":"This book is awful. As previous reviewers have said, it takes a great writer to write in the present tense, and Alice Hoffman is not such a writer. The writing is also cliche-ed, and worse, is trying to be grandiose and literary, while falling flat. I found I didn't care about the characters, nor did I find them believable. I only finished the book because it is an incredibly quick read, and because I wanted to know whether it ever improved. I feel like Hoffman didn't feel like writing any more after 275 pages, so she tacked on the neatest ending. Don't bother to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, haunting, twisted, and dissapointing","review":"This book started out OK, then got mildly interesting, but from page 64 (in the attic w/ Hollis) on it just got worse and worse. Who wants to read about characters who are totally irrational though they act normal,and make bad decisions. I just wanted to yell at March every time she went crawling back to Hollis. It's a book of addictions. Alan is addicted to alcohol, March is addicted to Hollis, Hollis is addicted to sex, watching people through windows, and being in control."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"I read this book in 2 days, never wanting to put it down. I lived in that story. I could feel those people around me, I could picture everything. While I was reading, I was also listenin to the Counting Crows...unplugged...Everytime I hear this cd, I think about this book, and the lives in it, and everything that went on. How some lives were destroyed, and some were destroyed even though it was always thought to happy...I can't even explain how this book was by far the best book I had ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. This was the first selection from Oprah's book club for me and I was left feeling very unsatisfied at the end. What lessons, if any, were learned by any of the characters? Hollis died, for what? This was not a moving story at all. Nothing but pain, regret and bad choices by the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Thus far, I am on page 35 and I don't think I can stomach too much more. It all began on page five with \\"the light is so lemon-colored.\\" (All of the page references are to the 1997 hardback edition) Then on page 11, we move to \\"the sky was the color of a velvet ribbon,\\" followed by on page 13 \\"the sky was always the color of ashes.\\" I waded through to page 34 where I was set upon by this description of a white horse falling to its knees. \\"It falls like snow, like a drift which can cover you completely.\\" Yuck! I think I'll return it to the library tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuthering Heights is a better story!","review":"It came as a great relief to me to look through the other customer comments and see that I am not the only one who saw the striking similarities to Wuthering Heights. I counted at least 12 basic plot lines that parallel WH. The major differences betweent the two books is that WH is much better written. The characters are developed in greater depth and there's more thought given to the story. Also, in WH the heroine is attracted to and destroyed by her lover, but for reasons more substantial than just sex. It struck me as completely unbelievable that a woman who was supposed to be as strong and intelligent as March could become a blithering idiot because a guy was good in bed. If you want a great tale of a mutually destructive relationship, which negatively impacts the lives of many, read Wuthering Heights. Here on Earth is much easier to read, but put in the extra effort and read the \\"original\\". It's worth the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and dreary modern Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read all of Hoffman's books and Second Nature, Turtle Moon, and Practical Magic are in my top ten of books by any author. When I read this book I had not yet read the reviews or interviews so I was unaware that the author was deliberately updating Wuthering Heights. It was rather annoying at first. I also did not like many of the characters the way I usually do in Hoffman's books. This book does create an atmosphere of place and character that brings the reader into the story. I frankly couldn't put it down because I had to find out what would happen to the people in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to read","review":"I am sure that the plot, content, and outcome of this book are very good, BUT trying to read a book written in the present tense is very difficult for me. I am having the toughest time getting through it! I have seen it pop up on all kinds of \\"recommended\\" book lists, but the tense in which it is written overides any desire to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a Nap?","review":"I found this book to be especially boring until it takes off in Part 3. The first 2 parts definitely could have been condensed with a little more action to hook the reader in. I do not recommend this book to anyone unless you want to be bored, frusterated at March's stupidity, and left with an overall depressed feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care what you say... I liked it","review":"This is not the type of book I would pick for myself, but recently I found myself in a situation far from home with no T.V., Radio, or even my own book collection so I was forced to read whatever my host had to offer. Although I felt there were some really strange twist, maybe something I wouldn't have personally put in, and some things that were so outlandish, no one could ever relate to such characters, I did however find myself drawn to the book. I finished it in about 5 hours which was nice. Do not go into this book expecting your life to be changed forever, or maybe a new outlook, it doesn't offer either. But for me, it allowed me to tap into a hidden part of my own life where I had been in love and lost, and that intrigued me. I can definately see where people would have issues with the book... but for me, it was worth the short 5 hours it took from my life... maybe it will be worth it for you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an original work","review":"I'm glad to see that several others agree with me...Hoffman needs to credit Bronte for the plot and characters! As soon as Hollis comes to live with the Murray family, it is obvious that this book is a shamless knock-off of Wuthering Heights. It's not the worst book I ever read, but if you haven't read Wuthering Heights, do yourself a favor and read it!! It's time better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuthering Heights redone","review":"Has anyone else noticed that this book is a copy of the Wuthering Heights storyline but turning Healthcliff into a wife beater? Very inconsistant characters and a real rip off of the original. Just read the original again-or for the first time if you haven't read it yet-"},{"rating":"2","title":"It felt more like poetry than prose...","review":"I just finished this book today, and it absolutely blew me away. Not everything ended the way I would have liked, but sometimes that's for the best. My best friend recommended this to me, and apparently I need to start taking her advice more often! A few things were left unresolved--for example, what happened to Tarot at the end? All in all, it was a fantastic book and I would recommend it to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price I paid for it","review":"After buying the book on a friend's recommendation, I was greatly disturbed to find it nothing but a modern version of Wuthering Heights, which was not particularly enjoyable to begin with. In Hoffman's book as in Bronte's, I found very few of the characters even remotely likeable. I thought it was a shame to call March and Hollis' dark obsession 'love', when it seemed to me to be anything but. Hollis was a stereotypical abuser who attempted to control and isolate March merely to give himself a sense of power. I didn't feel that March's feelings and obsession with Hollis were very developed and I found myself unconvinced of her 'love' for him. Nor did I feel that the initial relationship between Gwen and Hank was particularly well developed. All in all, just a trashier, more violent version of Wuthering Heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing.......","review":"I thought this book was pretty well-written, but the subject matter was depressing and very sad, and the characters unlikable. It gave me an uncomfortable and somewhat disgusting feeling after reading it, which stayed with me through to the next day. Also, I found it kind of odd that every one in the book was beautiful, handsome and/or had been in their youth. Not my kind of story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant Wuthering Heights Rip Off!","review":"Character for character, plot for plot, \\"Here on Earth\\" is a blatant rip off of Charlotte Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". I was shocked and very dismayed to discover that a modern author with so many books to her credit would do such a thing! There is no mention ANYWHERE of the 'similarities', much less an acknowledgment of the novel as an 'adaptation'. It amounts to nothing less than PLAGERISM of a timeless classic. The author should be embarressed (I was embarressed for her while reading it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adaptation or Theft","review":"This isn't an adaptation of Bronte's Wuthering Heights, it's a mugging of it. The author has stolen bronte's story and moved it from the Moors to Massachusetts. I find it very difficult to get past this. Especially when, having enjoyed Wuthering Heights so many times, I already know how the story will unfold. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"\\"Here on Earth\\" was the first Alice Hoffman book I had ever read, and after reading \\"Practical Magic\\", it will probably be the only one. I heard about it on Oprah one afternoon, and promptly left for the library to see if they had it.The story is wonderful, but I gave it four stars because I can see an underlying theme of being just like \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which is a literary masterpiece (in my opinion). Anyone who has read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and this book can see how they are very similar.All in all, though, a wonderful read. A heart-breaking, all-consuming love like that - I think we've all had a Hollis at one time or another, someone we thought we had to save."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscovered love","review":"Spellbinding book about lost love re-discovered and the hell that creeps into relationships. I hung on every word, would have read it cover to cover if given a chance. March Murray returns to her hometown for a funeral and has her life turned upside down when she encounters Hollis, her long lost love. Daughter Gwen finds love and a deeper sense of self when she meets Hank, her first cousin and Tarot, a horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Characters, Cheap Plot","review":"I've read a lot of Alice Hoffman. Her characters are usually real people, with flaws and beauty. This woman though, this main character March, is an utter unfeeling idiot. There really isn't anything redeemable about her. Sure she doesn't end up with the one-dimensional psychopath she professes to have a deep love for, which is you know, great, but the only REAL reason is that he dies.The plot itself is, as the author admits, a takeoff of Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Fine. Okay. Wuthering Heights is about a complicated relationship between two tragic people. This relationship? Is about two sort of stock characters with little to no depth and their pretty simple relationship of abuser and victim.The book basically makes no sense and you hate the characters.The only redeeming part is that the language and imagery is nice, as per usual.Ms. Hoffman really did herself a disfavor with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat disappointing, but still enjoyable","review":"I really liked \\"Here on Earth\\" until the last chapter. I couldn't put the book down until I read it through. I must say though, I really thought Hollis would see the error of his ways, so I was very suprised in the last chapter. I recommend this book over \\"White Horses\\" and \\"Second Nature\\" which only made me question Alice Hoffman's intentions with the characters. So if you like tragic romances, pick up one of the three I mentioned, because that's exactly what you'll get with these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"...I found Hoffman's characters to be unlikable, as well as inconsistent. The use of the word \\"f***\\" throughout the book did much to give me a feel (as well as some nausea) for the heartlessness of hero/villain, Hollis, but when the word came in the voice of the heroine..., March, it rang opposite her romanticized view of her relationship with Hollis. ...I didn't have any sympathy for Hollis, where I fell in love with Heathcliff. And no character in \\"Here On Earth\\" seems to be better off in the end for having made it through the novel. Many relationships severed, but few lessons learned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WET TEABAG DUD!!!","review":"All that the naive teenager went through to get over Hollis the first time should've made March a wise, adult woman. Remembering how toxic Hollis had been then and knowing how dangerous Hollis was now, for 38(?) year-old March to fly back to his wretched clutches, in the face of an enviable husband and supportive friends was not merely disappointing, but utterly perplexing.Gwen's storyline redeems this to a one-star read.Had Hoffman put in even a minimal effort, this might've been a decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"When I bought this novel, I expected it to be about love and romance. Well, it wasn't. It was about love gone wrong. I loved the complexity of the relationship between March and Hollis; it helps others understand the mixed feelings and sometimes strange actions of a victim of domestic violence. The detailed description of the characters helps us identify ourselves with the minds and souls of each character and why each one acts the way he or she does. The story is so intense, I couldn't put it down!I urge everyone to read this book. This novel is great!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Wuthering Heights instead.","review":"It appears Alice Hamilton must have enjoyed Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. This book is obviously similar with a few sex scenes added to please the 1990's crowd. Hollis is similar to Heathcliff, March is a parallel to both Catherines, and Hank and Hareton are also identical. Hollis is the abandoned orphan brought home by the wealthy family. The oldest son, like Hindley Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights, is jealous and cruel. March Murray can't settle her reason and passion conflict and her daughter is even involved in a first cousin love affair. Unlike Emily Bronte, Alice Hamilton cheapens the novel with trashy sex scenes and downplays the institution of marriage. For those who are conscious of grammar, Hamilton's use of \\"you\\" is especially irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply a wonderful book","review":"How can anyone give this book less than 5 stars? Must be jealous writers who only wish they could do as well as Ms. Hoffman. This is a wonderful book. I had to force myself to slow down and read it carefully because I knew it would be over way too soon for me. The characters were very well drawn, interesting and colorful. Impossible to guess ending, hated to get there anyway, yet I was compelled to finish. I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book STINKS!","review":"Actually, I would prefer to give this book no stars as it deserves none. I hated this book. I could not relate to nor feel sorry for any of the characters. The way March let Hollis manipulate her was pathetic beyond words. A friend lent me this book as she enjoyed it and thought I would too. All I can say is Thank God I was not the one to spend money on this book. Shame on Oprah for making such a foolish choice and shame on the author for wasting paper on such a rotten book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter dissappointment","review":"This was my first Alice Hoffman experience, and I must say, my last. I almost stopped reading after 2 chapters, because I was not finding any enjoyment in her way of writing. I found it void of imagery, excitement, and completely void of passion. Although characters do not have to be likeable, (as in the case of practically all in this book,) good writing will make you feel for them in one way or another. I felt nothing at all. Hoffman dribbles on too much about nonsense without truly creating a picture in one's mind of the world and the characters she tries to convey. She tries to tell it as if she were the alter-ego of each character, but to me, her way is not effective. I know many will disagree, tastes in authors are as different as tastes in food, but I personally do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time with this one","review":"I frankly am surprised by the content of this story. I have never read a book that has had such undeveloped, shallow characters and a plot-line that was weak and predictable. I picked this on a recommendation from Oprah's book club, and was very disappointed. The plot was not developed fully and therefore made it very hard to believe why a strong woman would leave her husband to stay with the love of her life and once she has done so, becomes so fragile and weak and subservient. The whole story makes women look bad and men look worse! These characters have absolutely no shred of morality at all: there lives are replete with adultry, incestual longings, and mental and physical abuse. There are better books out there that deal with the subject of abuse in a more mature way. Perhpas Ms. Hoffman ought to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sugar-coating on her characters.","review":"I loved this book. The author depicted the characters in a real manner, not sugar-coated. They had faults and made mistakes and she told their story in a believable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG Disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to reading this novel. I'm so sorry I wasted good money on it. Although the words themselves were well chosen, somehow I never got really interested in the characters. I could not sympathize with any of them and frankly, didn't care what happened to them.In the end, I finished the book because I figured it might improve. Unfortunately I was wrong.The messages of addiction, self-hatred and self-indulgence were disturbing and twisted. I saw no redeeming value in this book. I gave it away to the library because I didn't want it around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd skipped this one","review":"I tried this book because I loved Practical Magic. Here on Earth was so dark. The cast of characters were all miserably unhappy, twisted, and wounded. There was no humor or joy. Every major relationship in the book was flawed and pathetic. I found little to like about this book other than Hoffman's story telling abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT REALLY DESERVES ONE STAR!!!","review":"The book started of with a beautiful writing of a nature scenes. The background and the flash back does giving some charm for readers...BUTWhen I justed START to like this book I was very disappointed. I was almost falling asleep when I read this book. It was BORING... At least I finished it because I PAID FOR THE BOOK. (shouldn't have) Maybe as the story develop the author couldn't think of anything else to write so she just do what ever to finish the book.P.S. \\"Here on Earth\\" is a very predictable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great incorporation of an old classic","review":"March Murray comes home from California only to come face to face with Hollis, her first love. With her is her daughter who finds a somewhat comforting companion in her cousin, Hank. This meeting between March and Hollis sets off a chain of events which rekindles an intense, yet destructive, passion that to consume them.Anyone who has read the original will see the parallel. The story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw has been immortalized over the years and Hoffman has incorporated that love story in a fundamental way. Hoffman does a fantastic job of integrating a contemporary what-if spin on Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights. I read this book on the recommendation of a professor after reading Emily Bronte's novel but it sparked my interest in the selections Oprah does choose for her Book Club. As a book, on its own, this novel can stand, but foreknowledge of the parallel premise between it and Bronte's novel is what makes Here on Earth a moving story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I couldn't wait to read Here on Earth after having read several of Hoffman's other books. Boy, was I ever disappointed to find I knew what was coming at every turn of the page at the start of the book. It was as if I were rereading Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte -- just different names (although Hollis and Heathcliff do start with the same letter and both housekeepers last names started with D!), a different setting, and a different time -- too many similarities for me to overlook. How disappointing! I didn't even take the time to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending doesnt leave loose ends","review":"The book ends at a natural place and doesn:t leave loose ends. The book was about the relationship between Hollis and March, and it naturally ends with the end of that relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who wanted their money back. This book is junk and my time is too precious (whose isn't?) to waste on this drivel. The writing was so poor--trite and cliche--that little things began to bother me immensely. For example, does Ms. Hoffman know that daffodils do not close in response to the wind? Once the blooms are open, they stay open. Does she know that, due to chestnut blight, there are virtually no chestnut trees left in North America? At least none tall enough for mourning doves, or any bird for that matter, to nest in each spring. If she's going to incorporate natural science into her novels, she should at least get it right, because there is nothing else \\"right\\" about this junk. Amazon.com should let me choose the option of a zero star rating because it is well earned in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap rip-off of Wuthering Heights.","review":"There should be a law against such blatant copying of a classic novel (in this case, Wuthering Heights). It is beyond me how this is being reviewed as the 90's version of that great love story and not a vulgar theft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here on Earth","review":"I found this book to be very boring. The main characters were not very interesting with the exception of the daughter. I just never really felt very invested in the plot. It was a very slow and forgettable read for me. It was also a bit too simple for my tastes, it belongs in the young adult genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"What a waste of time this was. Probably a waste of talent on her part too. I seem to remember her as a good writer. I would never have finished this book if I didn't think I needed it for my thesis.

There is too much spousal abuse in this country and we don't need to read about it for \\"entertainment.\\" If you want to read a good romantic story, read \\"The Notebook\\" or read \\"Range of Motion\\" by Elizabeth Berg.

I, however, found 'Here on Earth' to be a trashy novel with weak characters. March was pathetic, and it angered me as the book progressed through her abuse by Hollis and finally her daughter. March watched a man strike her own child and did nothing. This novel is not based on love for a man, but selfishness of a woman who cares nothing for her 14 year old daughter and husband. I found her character revolting and offensive.

Wuthering Heights isn't even original and may not even have been the first to think up such a devilish man like that of Here on Earth's man.Here on Earth has to be reasoned with for that of it's explicit, accurate, and deadly realistic case study of abuse. You fall in love with this man like the girl, and in the end are still somehow attached to this man and \\"feel\\" for him even though he beats his wife and controls her every move.For a very painful book to read on abuse, Here on Earth is the best bet.

It's natural for human emotions to take order and take control, but this book suceeded in making many people steam and vent and ultimately (either for better or for worse, your call) hate the book.Alice Hoffman is a very talented author and it shows with this book. What other book out there can lead you to fall in love with a character, only to hate him in the end because he developed and became older and viewed life in a harsher way?Here On Earth is one of the most realistic and painful books I have ever read...good job Hoffman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic by Hoffman","review":"It has many stories in one, all woven together and intersecting with creative artistry. Hoffman has the ability to share the souls of her characters with the reader & this book was no disappointment there. Realistic characters, flawed and very human, their weaknesses were the book's strength.. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat","review":"This was the first Hoffman book I have read. In short, I did not find any one of the characters likable or realistic. The plot was flat and did not pull me in to the story line. Really boring! In addition, is anyone else tired of \\"love\\" stories focusing on women cheating on their husbands (Bridges of Madison County, Horse Whisperer)? Unfortunately this particular story does not have the emotional depth necessary to pull off the plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice Hoffman is no Emily Bronte","review":"Superficial and cliched character and plot development. Mediocre writing. Overwrought tendency to \\"tell\\" the story rather than \\"show\\" it. Too blatant a re-telling of \\"Wuthering Heights\\", without the complex nuances and contradictions that made that novel timeless. Good example of middlebrow contemporary fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this one","review":"This book was the first by Alice Hoffman I read. I was disappointed by it. It took me months to finish reading it because I couldn't bear to see what March was to do next. Hopefully the next Alice Hoffman book I read won't be this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown in L.A. , expected more","review":"I watched the episode in which Oprah sat down with Alice Hoffman and the others and could not wait to run out and purchase this book. What a letdown. The characters are so depressing that I didn't find anyone that I really cared about at all. I kept waiting for the big turn around, hoping that it would change my opinion of this novel, but unfortunately it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"I read this book because it was recommended by Oprah, but I have never disliked a book more. I couldn't wait to get rid of it. The characters are both so needy. Hollis has no redeeming qualities and why March wanted to stay with him is beyond me. He not only treated her poorly, but she allowed that treatment to carry over to her daughter without even noticing. I find it hard to believe anyone could be this oblivious to life around them. Yes, love can sometimes make you blind, but it is not romantic or beautiful when it causes you to cease being human. March gave up her whole life for a worthless man. My recommendation is to never, ever read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated This Book","review":"Boy oh boy. Seems like everything I read these days on Oprah's approved reading list is depressing. This book is no exception. Maybe I just like a little happiness in my books because this one did nothing but drag me down. The characters left much to the imagination, since the author's style apparently doesn't fill in a lot of the blanks there. One-dimensional cardboard stereotypical characters and misery is all I got out of this read. Tired of reading about hopelessness, cruelty and despair with no redemption at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Glad I didn't buy this one. It came for a quarter off the sale rack at the local library. The main character of March is so unbelievable and awful that I just couldn't enjoy any of this book. Character is the mother of a teen girl and that relationship was so far from reality as to be laughable. And the love interest was an abusive nut job that no one could have mooned over for very long. I also didn't enjoy reading about the way March treated her friends - she was oblivious and uncaring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this a best seller?","review":"So I was at my local bookstore and without any idea of a book in mind to purchase, I relied on a NY Times bestseller/Oprah's bookclub pick to make my decision for me. As I was reading this book, I kept waiting for it to get \\"good\\". That just never happened. There was potential for this plot, these characters, and none of it was developed. The author just skipped around and never got to the heart of it. The book ended with an absurd twist that seemed all too convenient for the author to finally end this product she created. I truly did not want to read any more of it, however, because of the abrupt ending, too many questions remained...where did the characters go/what became of anyone? This book actually left me frustrated for days...not only with the story but the fact that I wasted my time and money on it! Why was it ever recommended by Oprah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"like watching paint dry","review":"Is it just me? I am an avid reader, I know enough to give a book a really good shot before I flip it closed and say,\\"I cant take it anymore\\" Im sorry, this book is in my opinion one of the worst books I have ever \\"attempted\\" to read. There is no \\"draw\\" nothing that keeps you interested, nothing to bring you back to the book to see what happens next. This book is painfully slow, it drolls on and on about nothing. The relationships are sketchy, the charachters are bland and the reference to animal abuse is offensive. I just dont get it. I think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"At first, I thought the book was rather good, but when the guy starts going crazy, it made me upset. Not really my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ \\"WUTHERING HEIGHTS\\" INSTEAD.....PLEASE","review":"At the end of the first chapter I knew what I was in for. This book is a terrible version of Wuthering Heights, one of my absolute favorites. It's not loosely based, its an updated version that didn't need to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess if this were really the worst book in the world....","review":"I wouldn't have been so disgusted with the character of March. I mean, disgust IS an emotion, right? So I guess I can say that my emotions were stirred by this book.So if you want to be disgusted by the portrayal of one super-duper huge loser named March, you should definately read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. This book is just a recycled version of Wuthering Heights. I struggled just to finish this boring and bland novel. Please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most inane read of all time.","review":"March Cooper, mother of fifteen-year-old Gwen, has returned to her place of childhood in New England for the funeral of her surrogate mother, leaving her husband in California to tend to his work. Without any regard to her family, March takes up with an old boyfriend, allows her daughter to date a close relative, and leaves hubbie Richard to rot in California. Then, surprise, surprise, her life doesn't stay perfect and the reader is supposed to feel sympathy? This only chance this book ever had was a decent plot because the writing is atrocious and March is a terrible mother and wife represented as a fool for love which makes all of her decisions acceptable? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD soap opera....and an insult to females..NO STARS","review":"I love probably 3 out of 4 of Oprah's book club books I read. This was one of the \\"4's.\\" I didn't like this novel at all. I thought the turn of events in the novel were so outrageously unrealistic & insane. This may sound strange, but they were so crazily unrealistic that you could PREDICT what would happen by just thinking...\\"what would be the most crazy thing this character would do next..?\\" And they would do it! It literally reads like a bad soap opera...where crazy things happen just to keep you in amazement of how insane some people are. I don't even feel as if this book is worth any stars at all. I also felt as if the way March treats herself and allows others to treat her is a great insult to females everywhere. Not to mention the insult that Louise Justice is to females. Most of the book left me with a sick feeling in my stomach. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS, WOMEN! If I could, I would have given it ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah- What were you thinking?","review":"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT read this book. Do not waste your time on this uncreative and poorly written \\"book\\"- and I use that term loosely. If you are looking for a good tale, read the original- Wuthering Heights. There is no subsitute for the original Catherine and Heathcliff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaak!","review":"Did Ms Hoffman recieve permission from the Bronte estate to rewrite Wuthering Heights into this soap opera?Is it my imagination or do all the comparisons to that great classic simply fail to say that she simply changed some names to protect the innocent?Geez you guys, what's going on here?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severly disappointing!","review":"I started this novel with high hopes because I am an Alice Hoffman fan. I finished feeling disappointed and cheated. What I thought was going to be an inspiring novel about a feeling I have had myself left me feeling empy and unfulfilled. It seems Ms. Hoffman started this story with high hopes herself than didn't quite know how to capture the feelings of the characters and so turned Hollis into an obnoxious, abusive man and turned March into a totally unsympathetic character. Yes, love sometimes makes you blind to a person's true character and makes you turn a deaf ear to those you love most but March's total immersion into a man who could be so cold and cruel really alienated me from her. The ending was a cop out, an easy way to end a novel that made you feel like you had wasted time even reading the book. This book was a total rip-off of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and my opinion is, if you can't improve on a classic, don't bother tryng."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Original \\"Wuthering Heights\\"","review":"Will someone please tell me...was this meant to be a retelling of Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" If it is, the writing isn't even close to the quality of the original. I've looked everywhere in this book for some credit to be giving to Bronte for this story, since almost every last detail is the same, but I can't find any. Did Alice Hoffman have a mental lapse and not know she was copying someone else's story? Aren't there copywrite laws? It's past ridiculous. Don't bother...skip this one and read the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-magnificent obsession","review":"This is a depressing and, ultimately, disappointing story. Hollis borders on the satanic with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. We at least understand why he has to control March; we have no idea what March sees in him. And worst of all, the story builds to a climax that never really happens. If you want to read a good Alice Hoffman book try Practical Magic or Seventh Heaven but don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I loved this book, it was an enchanting yet chilling expedition into the human heart. A heart led on my memories of love, blinded by compassion and awakened only by pain. As a 16 yr old this book held me like a moth chasing flies in the flame! I read it within a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"come down to earth","review":"I could not believe Alice Hoffman's unoriginal retelling of Wuthering Heights, which is basically all this book amounts too. The theme has been done... and done considerably better than this superfluous attempt. Not only is the use of present tense extremely annoying, but the way Hollis obtained March's and Allan's land was unbelievable. It was a fact that women could not own their own land when Heathcliffe took Earnshaw's property in WH; however, in Here on Earth, it is unbelievable that a lawyer would not think to rewrite his own will after his daughter was born and certainly after his wife died. I was shocked to see that Michael Douglas (who does he see himself as: Hollis?) had bought the rights to the book... jeez, look out for another Hope Floats soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of my time","review":"Oprah, Oprah, what were you thinking putting this book on your list. The characters were bland, unbelievable, and not even remotely likeable. I'm on page 150 and I can't bear to go on. I've never stopped reading in the middle of a book, but this might have to be a first. People, save your money. You will gain nothing from this book. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuthering Heights? hmmm....","review":"I started the book and within minutes of reading picked up on the fact that I was reading a basic synopsis of Wuthering Heights. It confused me, so I went to reviews and summaries and could not find that fact discussed? Adaptations are alright and can be explored beautifully, but there should be disclosure. The cover and write-ups about this book fail to do so. That makes it all a bit fishy to me in terms of the authors intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Hoffman Writes with Beauty Rarely Encountered","review":"This book is typical Hoffman. It is filled with magical realism and darkness. It pulls at the reader like a full moon testing the tides of your emotions.The book focuses on the obsession of love. The love is hurtful and wrong but it pulls one towards it like a magnet despite the red flags and obvious dangers. Love may be blind but it is not immobile. It moves towards passion like a lemming towards a cliff.This is the heart and soul of many a Hoffman book. It is rare to encounter a writer as good and prolific as Alice Hoffman. She sees the beauty and magic in the mundane and through her writing we are privileged to see it as well.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"S'okay, but some of her others are lots better...","review":"Well, I like Alice Hoffman's books as well as the next person, but personally I don't think this one quite measures up. Here on Earth is an attempt to explore the many sides of a once-loving relationship that has gone unexamined and unrealized for many years. The language, of course, is evocative, and makes the sharp evidence of damage to the individuals involved all the more searing. Terror, lonliness, compassion, unforgiveness, and memory, and loss all play a part in this good (but not great) novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it","review":"This is a good book. Although it has usage of bad words, which at some points are not needed, this is an interesting book. This book is a rather compassionate book which, I think, should only be read by elder people and elder teenage kids. This is a great story which deals with things that may even happen in real life. This book is a strong one because it deals with real life happenings. I encourage all ages of viewers to read this book. Especially ones who love books with deep and compassionate stories to them. This may have bad language where not need but it has great story line to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such unappealing characters I just couldn't care","review":"Not bad writing, but I just couldn't care about either of the main characters. I kept thinking, \\"grow up and get over it already.\\" The secondary characters were more interesting and seemed to have more subtle nuanced relationships -- a book about them would have been more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help me understand...Please!","review":"I read this book based on Oprah's recommendations, but also because I was intrigued by the many mixed reviews posted on this site. After reading the book, the strangest thing happened; I just didn't know how to feel about it! Did the author intend for this book to be bad, just to force readers to stop and think and debate about its merits? The story was interesting, but the characters lacked...I don't know...everything? The whole background was dark, foreboding, and frankly, quite scary. Is New England really so bad, or just the town in which these feeble characters lived? Every single character in this book was moronic, immature, and full of self-pity. I hated them all! I'm surprised no one else has mentioned the rabbits to which the author referred at least fifty times. What's up with the rabbits? Do they rule the town? I found them quite frightening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-o-r-i-n-g!","review":"I came across this book at a garage sale, and because it said it was one of Oprah's Book Club selections, I couldnt wait to read it. Ugh. I struggled through, and thought it was the worst thing I've ever read. The whole concept was boring, the writing was boring, and I'd say...'dont bother'. I am one that has to finish something once started..so this was torture. I kept thinking that its going to get better, and the only halfway decent part was at the very end. I thought this story was most unbelievable. Dont waste your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a more apt title would be: What On Earth?!?","review":"I survived reading about four chapters before I couldn't take it any more! I bailed out just before March and the towns folk of Jenkintown gathered for the housekeeper's funeral. (see? I can't even remember that woman's name) The characters were so polarized. Hollis was the mean, evil, brooding forsaken lover, a loner... The housekeeper was just so \\"good good good\\" it was not believable. I was vistiting a nursing home today and decided on the spot to get rid of the book, I left on the reading table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Again, I read many of the reviews posted here before I decided to read this book. Many people wrote about this wonderful love between Hollis and March. Are you out of your mind? That's not love! It's some sick obsession these two have for each other. I'm very disappointed with Here on Earth. So disappointed that I don't know if I can finish the thing. It just makes me angry to read it. Not because it's striking a nerve or anything that deep. The story is just plain stupid and unbelievable. There's nothing endearing about this novel. Someone used the term \\"sleaze\\" and I find it very descriptive. Big news flash, ladies....sex and love are not one and the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The premise and prose promised a story of complete characters living out a complex story full of interesting depth. But they all fall flat and the story became predictable about 1/2 way through. The drama Ms. Hoffman creates with her poetic descriptive prose overshadows the predictable plot. The characters originally seem much too smart to be caught in these circumstances, but by the end they've left you wondering what earth they were on here and why. You almost feel like this book was an outline for a much deeper study of human relationships. Too bad it didn't fulfill its promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style: Intriguing - Plot: Tragedy of the Week","review":"The style is intriguing as perspective and characters change mid-paragraph. But the tale itself fizzles after a promising start. In the begining March and Hollis' love was tragic, but by the end it was pathetic - not something I wanted to read any more about.I have read that Michael Douglas has purchased the movie rights to this book - I hope he won't venture to anything larger than the small screen.The book did not insight me to read another Hoffman title."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!!","review":"What starts out as a pretty good read soon turns to sleaze when the main character, March Murray, gives up her marriage to return to the arms of her past teen lover - her foster brother! The sleaze spreads when March does nothing to discourage her daughter's budding romance with the girl's first cousin!! I've enjoyed other Hoffman novels, but this one is a disappointment. And what was Oprah thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"....wow.....","review":"A very powerful, emotional book - I read it in 24 hours and was drained emotionally afterwards! Sadly enough, I think this tale is played out too often in our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Irritating","review":"Anything I have to say has already been said. I'm so tired of reading Oprah books whose main characters have no redeeming qualities. Even Hank, the \\"nicest\\" guy in the book, doesn't realize how badly Hollis treats him. You would think Hollis is the embodiment of Satan the way he just sucks everyone in despite treating each and every one of them like doggy-doo-doo.Additionally, I began counting how many times one of the characters referred to \\"smelling like anger\\" or \\"the scent of fury\\" or how someone \\"smelled like fire\\" after sex. I got the feeling some professor must have written \\"nice imagery!\\" in red on some creative writing paper long ago and Hoffman's decided to stick with what worked.The only reason I gave this book 4 points is that I was able to finish it in spite of disliking it so intensely...but it's possible that's only a tribute to its relative brevity (as opposed to Wally Lamb's 465 page monster)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"i picked up this book because i watch Oprahs show daily and i thought it would probably be a very interesting book. I must say i felt quite sick reading it based on the fact of alot of swearing, and things that don't really happen in everyday life if it does happen every day then we must live in a very SICK world. I'm afraid I probably won't buy another Oprah book club book again!! is it any wonder our world is in a sorry state. I think Oprah should vet these books properly, I mean what if a younger girl were to read this book, do we want that for our younger generation, for them to know such words. Our young children are supposed to learn from and respect their elders, how can they with these books around??"},{"rating":"2","title":"a real page turner!","review":"This is the first novel I've read by Alice Hoffman, so I was not sure what to expect. I thought it was a great book and couldn't put it down, even to work! Unlike some of the other readers, the language and subject matter did not bother me....after all, we live in that type of society and I am a realist...I don't like to believe that some imaginary world exists where people do not make foolish mistakes or use bad language, or commit violence against others. Perhaps if you are content on your imaginary moral high horse, you should not read this book! Anyone with an open mind, however, will enjoy this love story for what it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography is Better Written","review":"Oprah has done it again! She has sold our souls by encouraging us to buy a book that has absolutely no redeeming value! At first I was fascinated by the similarities to \\"Wuthering Heights--a book I loved), but soon I realized that this is yet another book meant to shock the audience by its vulgar language and explicit scenes of rape (no, not a \\"love\\" story as promised by Oprah!) If you enjoy GOOD literature, this one is NOT for you! If you have any standards concerning exposure to language and events of a questional moral content, skip this one. Unless you've been in the situation March experiences, it is better to read something non-fiction to learn about its horrors than to subject yourself to this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Another!!","review":"There are so many other, better books to read than this one!!!! This is not a horrible, terrible, very bad book - BUT - it also is really not very good. Having said that, the beginning starts off well enough but page by page I lost interest. The only reason I finished it was because I thought something big and interesting would happen - IT NEVER DOES. This is a strange book and I am puzzled as to why this was one of Oprah's picks - it was profound or especially well-written. Try some of her other picks - I guarantee you will like them better!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark!","review":"I took this book on vacation. What a poor choice! The whole book is just too dark. I cannot imagine a woman like March letting a piece of trash like Hollis totally dominate her life and I cannot imagine a mother who would let her daughter act the way she does. A very depressing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book!","review":"I had high hopes for \\"Here On Earth.\\" It is an Oprah's Book Club Selection and received praise from the Washington Post Book World, and The New Yorker (to name two). I found the characters to be unbelievable and underdeveloped. I didn't have a clear picture of who March,the main character, was. What motivated her? What kind of person was she? What did she think and feel? I found myself sympathizing with the horse, Tarot, more than with the human characters. I was annoyed with the dialogue. I found it to be trite, and unreal. Some of the responses by adult characters were so immature that I would expect to hear them spoken by sarcastic teenagers. I thought the plot was simple and only mildly enjoyable. I was somewhat curious as to how the conflict would be resolved, and this motivated me to read the book through to the end. I give \\"Here on Earth,\\" a somewhat generous 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Zero Stars possible?","review":"Man, this was one terrible book.

As an exploration of abuse and doomed love, this falls way, way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoffman, what happened?","review":"I loved \\"Practical Magic\\" and \\"Turtle Moon\\", but this book was such a disappointment. Nothing about how March reacted to Hollis made any sense, beyond her girlhood dreams about what might-have-been. If he'd been waiting for her all his life, he had a funny way of showing it. And nothing that we knew about March would prepare us for how downright silly she is. The man is an abusive creep!Some of the writing was her usual wonderful(The entire first chapter, for example), but I never got over the Kathy/Heathcliff/Wuthering Heights story. There was something ridiculous about them, too. Way too much melodrama, not enough insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable Characters?","review":"So what if there aren't any likeable characters?

Hollis was a nice lover for March, until he turned greedy, rich, and rude. March was headstrong, but was weak and always followed Hollis. The wonder of this story was March's daughter, who was working with her own problems of love, just like how her mother did years ago and still is now.Timeful and captive tale, complex and a horror to read, but satisfying in the end. One great Oprah pick, I love Alice Hoffman now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the whole thing, but now I wonder why.","review":"A sad story about some sick people who need some serious counseling or more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, though disturbing.","review":"It took me a while to get into this book. It is well written, and it was the descriptive prose that kept me reading at first. I couldn't identify with any of the characters; March is particularly irritating. But as the plot developed, the characters begin to change, some becoming more sympathetic and others more detestable. The pages started turning faster and faster. Overall, I enjoyed the book, although it is undeniably depressing. This was the first Alice Hoffman book I've read, and I will definitely be reading some of her other works in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid tale on Spousal Abuse, True and Frightful","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved how the main storyline was enhanced my bits and pieces of other little stories. I found it interesting that she chose to develop each and every character within the book - she may not have gone into great detail about each one but she did offer some insight and history into each individual mentioned, which I thought added depth to the story.However, I was mildly disappointed in March's character. As a main character and someone we are watching throught the entire book, I just wished that she had been stronger somehow, more resilient to Hollis' schemes. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, I just wanted March to be stronger and smarter than she was. Although, I guess March's inadequacies add to the realism of the story. It's definitely a book I would read more than once - highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply, superficial, shallow","review":"I glad a friend loaned it to me, otherwise I would have wasted my own money.

I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Alice Hoffman's work, but I was very disappointed with this one.

However, as romance novels go, this wasn't too awful. Character development sucks, I think we're supposed to guess at the attitude/mood of the characters when they speak, dialog is rare though. But still, Hoffman does have a nice quality in her sentence structure.I remain surprised at the choices the Winfrey woman makes for her book club. I can see Here on Earth as a read for sad, lonely, depressed teenagers. Maybe. I wonder if even teens would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitation at its Worst","review":"I have to state up front, that I did not finish this book and any book that is so bad that I don't finish it rates only 1 star! This is the same ol' regurgitated story as many other authors (even resembling Hoffman's own, \\"The Probable Future\\"); Local girl moved away and comes back for some depressing reason, drags her teenage daughter with her and said teenage daughter is a reformed rebel, and mom falls in love, but there's a deep dark secret with a troubling message). It's not the darkness that makes this book bad. Rather, the characters aren't likable, the writing is choppy, doesn't flow, and the story itself is a good alternative to Ambien for those of us who are insomniacs. Hopefully Hoffman will write more books like the Dovekeepers and fewer like this one. Definitely a thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"Pretty intrresting read, not the best book ive ever read... but not a dissapointment either!

The ending is a let-down. We never find out what happened to the people we are supposed to care about... we never learn why the main characters really behaved they way they did... and any book with the \\"f\\" word in it used to describe the act, is really just trying to be soft porn.

It started out with such promise too...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run of the Mill Romance \\"Novel\\"","review":"Where was Fabio on the Cover of this book to warn off those of us thinking this was going to be a literary excursion? The prose was drivel. Numerous \\"deep meaning\\" references to food and animals left me saying \\"so what?\\". The characters were shoddily drawn caricatures, one-dimensional and wholly predictable. I was actually laughing at a few of the \\"revelations\\" of the so-called reporter Susie in her investigation of Hollis. While the subject of domestic abuse and obsessive love could have been delved into seriously..and even compellingly for the purpose of fiction...this book did little more than trivialize a serious matter with the paper-thin personalities of March, Hollis Hank, Gwen and \\"the Coward\\". I finished the book to give Oprah the benefit of the doubt...but now I see that the same thing that allowed her to engage housewife-voyeurs in the sensationalism of her talk show has also allowed her to endorse this ridiculous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak attempt","review":"This novel started out well, but halfway through degenerated into cheap romance, cliched writing, and a plotline straight out of a soap opera. I found myself unable to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Hoffman insisted on telling us, rather than showing, the important details, a device which greatly weakens any writing. Oprah struck out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointingly empty examination of the facets of love","review":"Hollis is Heathcliff for the 90's? What a tragic comparison. Hollis is a violent sexual preditor and a murderer. March, an otherwise accomplished and cherished wife and mother becomes a helpless victim under this charmless brute's spell. I kept waiting for March to wake up and defend Gwen, but she displayed only limp disregard. The end of the story fizzled out, concluding too neatly, in a unsatisfying, unlikely way that left too many questions unanswered. Not one of Ms. Hoffman's best. Also, while the writing style itself was evocative of the cold, frozen emotions of the past, Ms. Hoffman used too many similies and metaphors; left the story laden."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was going to be a romantic love story.","review":"I was rather depressed after reading this story. I can't believe that Oprah recommended this book. I kept hoping that March would wake up and go back to her husband. I thoughtthe book might get better at the end but it didn't. I wish I had never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad made for tv story line","review":"This is not a romantic story about passionate love. It's a story about stupidity, lust, and selfishness. It's disgraceful how most of the women in this novel are portrayed, giving up their lives, their selves, and their sense for a smile, a kiss, a touch, or just hard sex. I can't believe Oprah took her audiences down to this level after elevating them in Paradise."},{"rating":"1","title":"An o.k. read but not Alice Hoffman at her best","review":"I was very excited about this novel especially since it was an Oprah pick. However, I was disappointed by the book. I did not relate to the main character's attraction to a very cold and sick man. There was nothing redeeming about the story, perhaps because I expected so much from the author. I liked Practical Magic much better. If you want to read Alice Hoffman read Practical Magic and skip this one. It really wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"March Murray is a little bit of all of us.","review":"March Murray reminds us all of the vulnerability of our emotions. Alice Hoffman takes us on a journey of choices, and chooses for us the ones we probably would have chosen if we were March, and haven't we all been at some time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I found this book enjoyable at the beginning. However, the relationship between March and Hollis was not sufficiently developed. Additionally, the author's treatment of Gwen's relationship with her cousin was distracting. Luckily, it only took me two days to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disapointment","review":"I was really looking forward to this book but boy what a disappointment. The characters are a joke and although the basic idea for the plot is good, how it is developed is very poor. Also, the characters are inconsistent. For example, the author depicts the beloved housekeeper as a Madonna like figure. Yet, we find a very contradictory descriptionn a few pages later - she was a busybody. Well which one is it? A busybody or the all nuturing mother figure.I can't even bring myself to finishing this book. It is a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time with this one!","review":"After reading all the reviews for this book, I was really excited to read it. Boy, was I disappointed! This is a stupid book full of insipid, fully unlikeable characters. There was no one even remotely appealing. And I did not understand this great \\"love\\" between March and Hollis, as it did not seem to be anything except lust, even from the beginning. If you still must read this book, get it from the library. That way you still may lose several hours of your life reading it, but at least you wont waste any money. Just make sure you return it on time as it is not worth the 5 cents a day overdue fees."},{"rating":"1","title":"An item of interest...","review":"Although I have not yet read this novel, my interest has been piqued. It is currently being made into a movie, and the film crew is working on the project this week in my neighborhood, on Summit Avenue in St. Paul next to the University Club. Word from a crew member is that the script barely resembles the book though. Thought you readers might like to know... If you live in the area, it might be worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best book .","review":"This is the best book . One of Alice Hoffman's best work. She truly captures the nights of the females. I would recommend this book to any teen or Adult. Not to the little kids because of the graphic content.I give this book 5 great big stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"My strongest reaction to the book was its lack of ethics.","review":"The book was \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" and it was fairly distressing that an author could use the story line without crediting the original author. I would have enjoyed her variation, but was too 'haunted' by the author's lack of ethics. Did those who disagree really read Wuthering Heights?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich entertaining read","review":"As usual Alice Hoffman writes a true tale of love and hate. It's disturbing how people compare this book to \\"Wuthering Heights\\". These two books take place in two different time periods, different societies, and different characters even. This is more forceful, if you'd want to compare and say.Read it, especially if you haven't read anything by Hoffman yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent but no genius...","review":"I'm not bothered by the similarity to Wuthering Heights; it's obvious that Hoffman was attempting an homage, rather than crude plagiarism. However, Hoffman is definitely not the writer E. Bronte was. Cathy and Heathcliff have a mythic power about them which lends a sort of awe-inspiring greatness to even their worst excesses. Hoffman aims for that and fails; she has produced a dreary woman-in-danger tale, not significantly different from a thousand others easily found on drugstore shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen plot from the classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\"","review":"The relationships in Hoffman's book mirror exactly the key relationships in the classic \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" Of course, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a much better novel, and the fact that Hoffman's relationships (biological, family relations, and love) are lifted from this classic make it all the more disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why we get what we NEED!","review":"Sometimes love consumes our entire being-- logic and reality do not exist. Such was the case with March, she lost herself in Hollis (as so many of us do when we are trying to escape reality). When obsession and control are the key factors in a relationship, the worst is bound to develop. I read this story in 2 days. It normally takes me 2 years to complete a book!! Excellent reading for anyone who has felt incomplete in their current relationship and choses to explore other options. We may not always get what we want out of love, but we do get what we need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I selected this book because it was an Oprah recommendation. Like most of the other Oprah books that I have read, this book leaves the reader depressed and wondering aren't there any uplifting, enjoyable books out there that Oprah could recommend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"This book was trashy and poorly written. The characters were impossible to like. How anyone could read this book in one sitting is truly a mystery to me. Reading it was almost a chore. I would rather go to the dentist! Poor choice Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark","review":"It is not one of the best books I've read this year. It is okay at best. I am sure that there are hidden meanings to some of the writing, I wasn't interested enough to really dig deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the character's and the storyline very disturbing.","review":"I thought the story line was very disturbing and the character's. Is it just me or does anybody else recognize the adultry that March was committing with Hollis? if they were so much in love no way would she have married another man (True Love can stand the test of time), I thought it was tasteless on the daughter's part to fall for her cousin (which by the way she was informed of who he was), I just can't believe people find adultry romantic it reminds me of another story (Bridges of Madison County). I am a happily married woman and I would not willing commit adulty, shame on Oprah if she and Stedman were married this book would have not been picked by the famous book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"March, Get Over Hollis Already","review":"This book was terrible. Frankly, it wasn't even entertaining. I kept reading hoping to discovery -- at some point -- what all the buzz was about. Save your money and pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing!","review":"By the end of the novel, i was depressed and couldn't have cared less about March and her miserable life. She was a selfish and immature person- a negligent mother and a terrible wife. Had this been a true story, she her husband and her daughter would have wound up in therapy for the remainder of their lives. I would have been better off (and more entertained) had i opted to watch an episode of Jerry Springer instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"This book definately sealed my opinion of Oprah's books. They all seem to be either about the oppression (of women or racial); or they are just plain depressing. This one is both. The beginning of the book was good, with great imagery; however the plot quickly became unbelievable. Never mind that March's husband let her stay in Maine with another man without putting up a fight....but to let his daughter stay also??? And while I can definately relate to an all-consuming love, it became very difficult to relate to March and her selfishness. Read Wuthering Heights if you want this story with real characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless","review":"If you have ever been blind in love, breathless with longing and totally without volition, where your body and mind seem scoured by the beloved's presence, and only in his/her absence can you breath and move, then you will identify with the woman in this book. I felt as battered as she by the end, revolted and yet plummeting toward the finish, where surely, surely, something would be resolved, released, remembered. The author did not let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A no brainer if your bored and there is nothing eles to read","review":"I was so excited to read this book. Into the 2nd chapter I could hardly believe what I was reading, Wuthering Heights? I had to check the cover of the book again. The only reason I finished it was sheer curiosity. I was most amazed at the character of Marchs husband, Richard. What man would let a woman he loves just leave without doing one damn thing? Especially when she is with a man like Hollis and Richard knew what kind of man he was. The characters were weak. I yearned for more depth in all of them. The ending was horrible. Your telling me that after all March went through with Hollis that she would not have been in the last few pages.( I do'nt want to give the ending away in case someone still wants to read it.) Right! It was easy to read and I did read it quickly. Hoping that it would get better. Did Oprah really read this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Poorly written and so many lost threads of the story. No follow through and an abrupt ending. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Book I've Ever Not Finished","review":"I can push through nearly any book, no matter how much I dislike it. This time... There was just no way. It's been compared to Wuthering Heights; in actuality, it's enough like Wuthering Heights that you can tell from where she stole the idea, but the execution isn't even close. Cheesy, clunky, and wholly unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical oprah book","review":"ugh. it started well. the first 1/2 was engaging. the middle part was suspenseful. but i should have known by the oprah endorsement: SPOILER ALER: it devolved into typical oprah style - the woman becomes battered by her 'true love' in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. typical story of a woman who submits passively to her 'love', whom others 'don't understand'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and pointless","review":"I don't understand why people enjoy this book so much. I read it because it was on Oprah's book club, but it was not up to her usual standards. It was an extremely odd story line that had no point. It as very twisted. It is also nothing like the movie. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Woman has a secret eternal love.","review":"Every woman has a secret true love that couldn't realized. And when years pass and become older start to think about that old love. Great story. It was put in black and white what many women feel and don't dare to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful story every woman should read","review":"Not only should every woman read this book but have their late teenaged daughters read it before there's a \\"Hollis\\" in their life!I found this book moving and powerful and disturbing all at the same time. I got so wrapped up in it from page 1. Although some of it was very predictable (like a train wreck), it didn't prevent me from staying up to finish the book in one sitting.The basic story of the a woman trying to capture what didn't work in the past is a story that too many woman today live through. Although March was married and although she and Hollis would never in this lifetime EVER be able to have a loving and trusting relationship....March goes for it anyway without any regard to the cost of her loving husband and fragile daughter.The ensemble characters add to the story but it clearly is based on March and Hollis and how you can't go home again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here On Earth","review":"Alice Hoffman is no doubt an awesome writer. I had no choice but to feel the anger, love, and entrapment that she so discriptively wrote about. But I also think that the book left something to be desired. I wish Hoffman would have given a better explaination in the end. It was almost as if the characters would have been standing around asking what now just as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, be embarassed!","review":"This drivel steals all of the worst traits of Wuthering Heights: unlikeable characters driven by sick sick motives into a well of self pity and melodrama. I can't tell you how much I disliked this book. I wish it were possible to give zero stars. Self-imprtant and self-indulgent people abuse each other and make huge moral missteps in this irritating trip to dysfunctional land.If you're looking for a wonderful book, skip this one -- and Wuthring Heights, too. Read Charlotte Bronte's fabulous Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar to WH but...","review":"This book has many of the themes in WH, the obsession, the secondary love story, the familial tie that is hinted at in WH, etc...But Heathcliff of WH while horrible in the second half of the book to most of the females he is involved with- Would never have hit Catherine- cheated on her ( I know, I know, what about Isabella?) this is different in this book. If fact Heathcliff declares how much he loves Catherine by saying, that he would relish killing Linton and Hindly but b/c Catherine loves them, he will not-The supposed obsessive love in this book is not love at all- it is more along the lines of a true sociopath that is prone to domestic violence. I think in his own twisted sense he felt like he loved March, but NOT LIKE HEATHCLIFF LOVED CATHERINE. So- these two are similar, but if you want quality- stick w/ WH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The abundant praise that this book has received should be ignored by anyone with good literary taste. Hoffman's writing style attempts to be poetic, but instead her prose is so crammed with flowery expressions that it is merely childish and annoying. Her observations about life lack true insight, and her characters are weak and one-dimensional. I am embarrassed that I ever purchased and attempted to read this horrible book--please use more common sense than I did and don't join the other readers who made \\"Here on Earth\\" a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"playing it safe","review":"I was excited when i realized this book was a modernized version of Wurthering Heights, but was soon dissappointed. Not that I expected it to live up to the original, but I at least thought it would be an interesting take on one of my favorite books. For one thing, the book did not go far enough - Hoffman tried to keep it \\"safe\\" for the modern reader. Hollis (Heathcliff) is completely one dimensional, negelecting the reader of the one character that makes Wuthering Heights such a great novel. Bronte never gave the reader what he/she expected - which is that either Heathcliff would turn out not to be so evil or that all the other characters in the novel would wise up and leave him to suffer alone. Hoffman gives the reader exactly what he/she is expecting, and this is what truly made the novel inferior to its predecessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Wuthering Heights","review":"If you've read Wuthering Heights, the plot will be extremely familiar. If you haven't read Wuthering Heights, read it instead of \\"Here on Earth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No family can be this dysfunctional.","review":"What a great beginning! The story brought me into the small world of a Massachusetts town. The characters were believable and down to earth. Unfortunately, the book did not continue to be either believable or down to earth. I have never read about so many dysfuntional people or situations. There was alcoholism, incest, battering, sex with a 14 year old, low self-esteem, divorce, animal cruelty, small town politics, emotional abuse, and more machinations than anyone should put in one book. I could not relate to many of the main characters by the end of the story, although the daughter was the most interesting. Often the prose would get so flowery and/or detailed that I ended up daydreaming while trying to read. The greatest sadness was that I know this could have been so much better. That faith in the author kept me reading until the end. I do look forward to reading other books by Alice Hoffman, hoping that this one was an anomoly."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful","review":"very trite, poorly written (sophomoric writing style with cliche flair) and weak plot that was fairly predictable. extremely disappointing and can't believe i wasted my time reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Sturdy","review":"This case seems nice and sturdy, just what I was looking for.

After about 3 months of regular use of bringing my laptop to school, I noticed the fake leather over the hinges for the shoulder strap started to tear, and eventually, they both broke off. I basically dropped my laptop the first time this happened and was not in a good mood. I hooked the straps on to the handle hinges which seemed to be a little sturdier, but they just tore off also. The construction of the hinges to the bag are not very good, as they rely upon the fake leather and a little (too small) of a a bolt that just goes into the bag (no washer on the inside to deter the bolt from pulling off the bag). The laptop I have is an older IBM T20 with an AC adapter and an extra battery. I'm guessing this is too heavy for the bag, even though the laptop is relatively light.

The handle, which I rarely used, also had the leather tear away on one side, and the leather on the handle itself is cracked and worn.The rest of the bag has been fine, and useful for travel with a laptop.

Fluke makes some of the best quality electronics testing equipment available. These leads are made of a very pliable silicone material that is easy to roll up and put into a meter case. The end of the leads has the banana jack arrangement that allows other types of implements to be installed, like alligator clips. This lead set is a little more expensive than others on the market but you won't be disappointed by the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd ROCKS!!","review":"Loudmouth is the best Hard Rock cd i have heard in a long time.I bought it for the song \\"Fly\\",but the other songs on the cd are just as good if not better!!

I'm sure glad i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT Guy Approves","review":"The wire is a little stiffer than some of the cable I'm used to and that makes it much easier to arrange the cables before I slide it into the end connectors. Small wire colors are standard. I am the IT guy for a high school and I make a lot of cable to replace damaged computer-to-wall jack cables of varying size and it's very helpful to be able to just make the size of cable I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent value","review":"I can't give this 5 stars is because the cable gets stuck coming out of the box sometimes. Also, the cable was not very smooth; this could be why it got stuck coming out of the box. It's like you could see its ribs. Regardless, it's great for applications where you won't see the cable much, like running it through walls. It's solid wire, unlike a lot of the cheap \\"CAT5e\\" stranded wire crap you'll find on Amazon, so that's worth a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat5 Cable at a Good Price","review":"For the price, I have no complaints with this cable. I have definitely used higher quality cable in the past, but at a much higher price tag. The main difference in this cable and its more expensive counterparts is this cable has more of a likelihood to kink or tear while you are pulling it. As long as you are not a raw brute when pulling this cable, you won't have any problems with it. If it stops flowing out of the box, do NOT give it good yank. Just pop open the box and straighten it out. I may have needed to this 5 times when using the entire box. I would definitely purchase this product again. The nice thing about this cable is that it is very flexible making complicated runs very neat and tidy. I will be using this cable for a home audio system using Russound audio products. I can't wait to get it all done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"I believe this could be one of the best possible debuts for Keyshia. She did well with sampling Luther VanDross's Never Too Much. The lyrics are very reflective and blend smoothly with her vocals and the instrumental. I also think that it would sound even better if it was a solo track. I think Keyshia should go back to old songs for inspiration, because, although without charting success, it has really done her well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and FAST shipping","review":"I drive a 1998 Ford Expedition with the 5.4 engine.

What a funny, funny guy! It is wonderful to have this CD with most of his very best work on it readily available to enjoy. I suppose some of the humor would not appeal to some very young listeners - sadly it is linked to a period of time that they will never relate to in our rapidly changing world. But for the most part, it is timeless, FUNNY, and delightfully silly stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for a new generation.","review":"Allan Sherman was taken away from us much to soon. Even though he probably would have not been as popular as comedians became more vulgar and the times more permissive, I believe he still would have produced many more hilarious parodies like the ones you will find on MY SON, THE GREATEST.My particular favorites on this good-natured and goofy collection are \\"Hello, Muddah, Hello, Faddah\\", \\"Pop Hates the Beatles\\", \\"Sarah Jackman\\" and \\"Crazy Downtown\\". It's good clean fun that I hope will find a home in the hearts of a new generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh and Laugh Again with Sherman!","review":"This CD is hilarious. You never know when Sherman is going to surprise you with his unexpected lyrics. His \\"almost\\" Sinatra voice, the Jewish flavor of some of his humor, and his understanding of the lighter side of human nature made him a great comedian in his day, and this CD does a great job of capturing his comical expertise.Some of the songs are funnier than others. I have always loved his big hits, \\"Hello Muddah,\\" \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\\"and \\"Louis the 16th,\\" but some of the medleys are hilarious.He surprises you with hilarity. Our whole family enjoys the CD.Once in a while, I'll surprise my wife by putting it in our van's CD player; as soon as she hears Sherman's voice, she begins to laugh. Great fun, especially for those of us who are already a tad crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"hello muddah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"gotta have this cd. i remember and you will too! and your kids will love it too. if your kids play it as often as mine have, you may wish you didn't buy it, but buy it anyway. you'll love it. play it once a day like a vitamin, you'll feel better. i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Fab songs to irritate your friends & coworkers!","review":"Too bad the rest of Allan's songs aren't available on CD! I grew up this 'music' [smirk] and loved the sense of humor; it's clean yet funny!

So are Sherman's songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Science Fiction Mystery","review":"In an era approximately 400 years in the future ubiquitous nanotechnology has made many items free or very cheap, and lifespans and health have been improved much. But are people truly happier with what technology has provided, more happy than before? And what about artistic creation and the sense of beauty, how has technology impacted it, and have most people lost the creative talent and instead rely on technology for creativity? These are some of the issues L.E. Modesitt Jr. raises in this fascinating novel while writing about the lives of five disparate individuals whose lives become intrinsically connected. The plot is very complex, with many characters involved, there is a mystery to be solved here. However, at times I thought the reading was a bit dull, one star off for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Another riff on the whole music teacher thing. Unfortunately this one is pretty dull. It looks at a very commercialised world of music where being a classically trained music teacher is not all that financially rewarding. e.g. not necessarily a lot different to know.He has made up another genre of music to be the 'rap' of the time.Underlying all this is some dodgy goings on. Needed to be a bit more of that to be interesting.If you are a music teacher type, you might enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas, mediocre writing","review":"Ultimately, there's nothing original or effective enough in \\"Archform: Beauty\\" to set it apart from the SF herd. Modesitt creates a fairly convincing world and sets up an interesting web of relationships among his narrators, but the whole effort is undermined by poor writing. Descriptions are flat. Dialogue is artificial and stilted. Future-slang is unnatural -- in some cases, practically unpronounceable. Language naturally evolves in directions that are easier to speak aloud, not harder. \\"Counterfeit\\" would never evolve into \\"feit\\" (sounds too much like \\"fit,\\" and many more colorful synonyms already exist), nor \\"Denver\\" into \\"Denv,\\" nor the already well-established \\"condo\\" into \\"conapt.\\" Maybe I've been spoiled by Neal Stephenson, but I like my science fiction to be good writing, not just good speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and irritating.","review":"Cover describes book as a \\"light hearted adventure story\\", should have been \\"a travel ordeal\\". Showed how lack of training and improper equipment can turn what should have been fun into drudgery. Choose biking as a cheap mode of transport rather than doing it for the pleasure of cycling which effected narrative. Constant whining and complaining made it hard to enjoy. Use of local NZ slang got old and author trying to force his personal views on locals seemed inappropriate. I have biked in NZ and it was nothing like the book described."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This book was a fun read. Fast paced, very factual, yet because it was an original hypothetical premise it kept you reading on with suspense. It's historicaly acuarate descriptions and scenes make it a fun Civil War novel, unlike many Civil War novels that seem slow and read like a history book. Fans of historic fictions love to be educated and entertained at the same time, and this book delivers. Good simple Characterization and compelling plot made it a pleasure to plow through this authors first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"This book has fabulous pictures and illustrations as well as some thought provoking theories about the overlap of Science and bible knowledge.
