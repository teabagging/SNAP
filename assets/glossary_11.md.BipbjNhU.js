Loved it so much I purchased a digital copy to download and keep on my Kindle Fire. The problem came when according to Amazon tech help, DreamWorks decided they were not making enough sells in the DVD area, and blocked this from the streaming content on what they called a blackout period. Which in return caused Amazon to remove my purchased copy from my Kindle and block me from the streaming version. Amazon did return my money but it has made me very cautious about making future digital purchases. Just a warning to any buying digital movies from Dreamworks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel!","review":"I loved the first Kung Fu Panda because it was unique, unlike anything I had seen before. When I heard there was going to be a second one, I was a bit leery-- sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals, so why should this one be different? But I was proved wrong, and glad to be!What makes this sequel so amazing is its almost seemless continuation of the first story, but also with so much new information added. All the original voices (as far as I know) came back to reprise their roles, which always helps. And we get to learn about the inner layers of a few of the characters as well. (Getting to know someone on a deeper level always makes things more interesting.) All in all, it was an excellent movie that could easily stand on its own, but the fact that it's a sequel makes this achievement even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Panda, 2 dark","review":"While anticipating watching the second Kung Fu Panda movie, I had fond memories of the first one and how light and funny it was. There were heros and a villan making the story itself pretty standard fare. The fun part was getting the character's defined, building up to a final, victorious showdown. Well, Kung Fu Panda 2, was not the same; not at all. I found it to be a very disjointed story, a little difficult to follow, and it also had more than one story going on. Plus it seemed to me that half of the show was dark in theme and also too many scenes shown in Literal darkness. I still enjoyed the movie, but would not advise trying to get a child under the age of 8 to sit through it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"We love this movie!

WOW! If Kung Fu Panda (1 & 2) are examples, I may need to buy a lot more!Kung Fu Panda 2 was funny, acerbic, witty, sad, and completely enthralling! Watching a roly-poly panda take his kung-fu to another level is heart-warming - and scary!The voices for the various characters could not be more spot on. Jack Black has raised the bar for animation voices so high I'm not sure it will ever be beat!!! (I will add an aside here for Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum/Smeagol in LOTR however, although, technically, I don't consider that \\"animation\\" such as this. Gollum was on another level entirely!)One slight note of caution; 1 of my granddaughters is 2 1/2, and I think this may be just a little too much fighting for her.

It is the studio work of these two double discs that makes them relevant as it presents Yes sounding their best since the 70's. It is remarkable that they can regroup after all of this time and produce such quality material. Yes, there is the occassional wart, but overall it is a terrific return to form (after almost 20 years). Enjoy it while it lasted, as Wakeman soon left leaving Yes to assume a new, less compelling direction. The first worthwhile effort since the end of the 70's. Highly recommended...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same stuff all over again","review":"The concept behind the album is flawed: one live disc, one disc in the studio. The live songs have obviously been \\"enhanced\\" in the studio, especially the vocals, so they sound lifeless and do not recreate the magic of this reunion in a small theatre in California. As for the studio songs, only \\"Mind Drive\\" is really interesting. The rest sounds like a collection of progressive rock clich��s. There's little coherence in the songs, the band just pastes together different bits and pieces hoping that in the end, some form of song will emerge. Maybe this type of material will please nostalgic fans of prog-rock but to me it sounds more like a band trying too much to copy what they were doing in their golden age. There's nothing \\"progressive\\" about that material, this formula has been done before, and with a lot more success, on albums like \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Fragile\\". As a reunion of the \\"classic\\" Yes lineup, it's a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is awful, dont waste your money","review":"This is absolutely horrible.

Along with that, there is a complete record of the Making of Gone with the Wind, nearly a disaster before it became a record-breaking triumph.

This version is absolutely not worth buying because all of the flaws it has. First, when the master CD was ripped to make these copies, it was not done properly. There are digital flaws and skips throughout the entire album. Second, the bonus tracks are out of order. That wouldn't be such a problem if the track listed as 'Pigs on the Wing' wasn't a completely different song (I believe it's 'Mother') from somebody else that's not even Chrome or Helios Creed!The album itself is a good return to form for Chrome, even if Damon Edge wasn't involved.

The music is excellent as is typically the case with Helios Creed but if you buy any version of the album prepare to be screwed. The 1997 CD won't play on a computer! Why? Was Cleopatra that ahead of the downloading and CD copying game that they refuse to let me play it on media player? And the 2008 version is recorded with glitches and skips! I thought my CD was scratched but that's how it was mastered! I haven't heard the LP version but read that it also contains the skips! The only benefit is that if you never listen to CDs on the computer, it shouldn't make a difference with the old version while the reissue contains three neat bonus tracks which sound fine I suppose. But come on, this is a professional release. There should definitely be a recall but since the indie scene isn't dominated by Chrome/Helios Creed fans, I feel you're just gonna have to get shafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby rolls right out of bed","review":"We bought this for our 6 1/2 month infant to use inside our pop up camper.

Unfortunately when he rolled, the sides bent down and he rolled right out. Also he learned to pull up during our vacation and the sides just collapsed when he pulled on them. As this bed did nothing to contain the baby, it was no better than laying him directly on a blanket on the floor. He ended up sleeping in our bed, since this was safer than him rolling around unattended at night. We did let him nap in it while we were watching him.

Yes?\\" is a unique picture book that uses only 31 words, usually no more than 2 on a page, to tell a whole story involving two boys who discover they can be friends. Beautiful in its simplicity, the book also makes good use of Raschka's expressive art style. Indeed, the book is his masterpiece; since then he has applied his visual talents to a series of minor disasters, among them the picture books \\"Arlene Sardine\\" and \\"Like Likes Like.\\" It's a shame that his reputation has had to dwindle so, but I still keep hoping he will come up with another good one like this. He has done a sequel called \\"Ring!

The book is about an African-American boy and white boy that meet on the street and exchange brief words. The African American boy says \\"Yo\\" while the white boy says \\"Yes\\". The message that I took away from this book was that African American children speak \\"street Ebonics\\" while the white children speak \\"standard proper English\\". I thought the book continued to perpetuate bias and stereotypes about African American children. As an educator, I am consciously aware of the books that I read and share with my students and the implied messages that the books share.It is important for all children to see characters in books that can serve as a mirror or window on how they see themselves or others.

I was not very smart at the time; I decided it would be a cheap way out of a book report. Since the book used no complete sentences at all and portrayed absolutely no message, I was given a very poor grade on the report. Little kids should not be reading this because they may fall into the same trap that I have once stumbled upon. This poorly written book is teaching kids an incorrect way to speak, so instead of teaching, it is poisoning the kid's minds.

Second, the host shoots out random phrases or stupid things like \\"was that a lot of damage player one\\", by the way, he has a very limited selection of stupid phrases so sometimes you get the same phrase 3 or 4 times back to back. The menus interaction is really slow(contrary to the theme of the game) and uncomfortable...The games are uncreative, and the ones that got copied from FF1 were \\"updated\\" and now suck. twisted system has an extremely uncomfortable camera angle and different timing so you get what I mean.Not 1 good game in the 40+Please don't buy this, Im sad I paid these people to ruin such a good game, dont do the same...Utterly disappointing:("},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down.","review":"We loved playing the first fusion frenzy.

We assumed as a sequel, this would be as fun or more than the first game.Where the first was fun, competitive, and fast, this game was so slow! We've only managed to play through this once all the way through.Things that slow this game down:-No choice in which mini games you play.-Instead of parts of city like the first, you're now playing for planets. Which take forever.-Frustrating system where you play cards against each other. Becomes a game with unbalanced advantages.

FUZION FRENZY 1 IS MORE FUN","review":"I have been waiting for this game for months. I loved Fuzion Frenzy on XBox and couldn't wait to see the nex-gen version. I bought this game on its release date and wish I would have waited for a used copy. First and foremost, why did they remove \\"Fuzion Frenzy\\" from the game? That was the best part of the game, risking your points and stealing your opponents. Second, the announcer is extremely annoying and his quips are repetitive to the point of hurting the game. Also, how hard is it to announce the winning players name. Player 1 wins the tournament, this is nex-gen and the game can't announce the character. If you loved Fuzion Frenzy 1, you might be disappointed in this \\"upgrade.\\" I sure was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for 2 or more players","review":"The first Fuzion Frenzy was one of my favorite games for XBOX. It's controls are very simple, which makes it fun to play for those who don't normally play video games. So when I recently got my XBOX 360, I was excited to hear there was a Fuzion Frenzy 2. I played the game at a friend's house who enjoyed the first game as well. Immediately we noticed that the announcer in the game was different. In fact, we found him to be quite annoying, and missed the Jerry Seinfeld-like voice of the first game. The mini games are fun, and I have my favorites. I was happy to see that my favorite \\"Twisted System\\" made it into the second game. However, I was a little disappointed that the actual fuzion frenzy round at the end of each area was taken away. Instead, you battle it out in a survival mode at the end of each planet. This is still fun, but I think they should just be mini games themselves, and keep the fuzion frenzy round. Overall, I like the game, and hope there is a 3rd one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Fuzion Frenzy 1","review":"The \\"gameshow host\\" in this game is possibly the most annoying computer generated character since Jar Jar Binks.This game is actually pretty fun for about 2 hours.One good thing about it- you can earn a lot of easy gamerscore points by playing through with each of the different characters. That's really the only good thing about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun but could be better","review":"I bought this game because my fiancee and I loved playing the Mario Party games on the Gamecube...now that I own a 360 I was looking for something that we could get into as much. This is a far cry from the Mario Party series but it is still enjoyable in it's own right. The DJ is very annoying as everyone else has pointed out but you can mute him or turn the volume down on him and even skip him for the most part.The minigames are creative and fun to play but they make it pretty hard to catch up in this game if you are losing. The graphics are good, not anything to write home about but nice to look at. Now that they decided to lower the price to $30 only a few weeks after I purchased it for $50 I would recommend this game for multiplayer purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I bought this game with the thought that it would be a never ending puzzle type game, but found that it isn't.

For the price, it was a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"I LOVED the original fuzion frenzy. I was so excited when I got this one, but when I played it I was really disappointed. I don't really like the new mini games. I don't know if it's that I'm used to the old ones, but I really miss those. Also this fuzion frenzy doesn't have that final battle that came after each stage. That totally takes out of the game experience. I just miss a lot of things the old game had :(.

After ~5 hrs of play, I'm going to trade it in and buy the original.Cons: The games are generally not as fun as in the original, the interface between the games is slow and annoying, the characters have gotten bland (for some reason they're now all white...), and the card system makes luck more important than skill. You spend about as much time skipping through the announcer as you do playing games.Pros: The graphics seem slightly improved, although they are still pretty basic.Get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"good game for children younger than 10 or for xbox beginner","review":"If you are a new user for xbox, this game is good for you to exercise how to use the controler precisely and smoothly.

The first Fuzion Frenzy game of course. This however, did not stop me from having just as much fun playing the sequel. When you play a sequel of a game, you obviously have expectations for it to surpass the first game. If you're realistic, you know that is almost never the case. This game may not have the same exact feel as the first game, but the differences between the two were necessary. Every game is it's own. Overall, I have to say this is an outstanding game for those that do not mind the changes. Anyone who has played the first Fuzion Frenzy may have a hard time accepting this game though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and Carefully Written Introduction","review":"In my opinion this book is a thorough and carefully written introduction into the topic of stress analysis of machinery and structures. The book covers the theory of the basic concepts. The author paid attention to carefully explain the important ideas.First, the fundamental concepts of strain gages and strain gage types are explored. Second, the fundamental concepts of stress-strain analysis are reviewed. What follows is a thorough development of the circuit equations, from the elementary circuits to the Wheatstone Bridge. Then, certain effects are addressed and data analysis is discussed.Since this book is an introduction to the topic it is not necessarily a practical handbook to perform stress analysis.

The dimensions are as promised, the side poskets are 3\\" thick (out of the total 28\\"). The cloth has a layer or plastic bonded to it on the inside, so it should not get wet in the rain. Except for the black area on the side in the picture. It's a mesh. And no, it's not a mesh pocket on top of the side pocket. It's a mesh that goes straight into the side pocket. So one of the side pockets is unusable right away. But I think that in the rain the water that gets in through the mesh would have nowhere to go, would collect in the pocket and seep into the rest of the bag.

Instead, the book itself is only 5.5 x 6.5 inches, and some of the photographs are only about 3.25 x 4 inches. I had to get out my photographer's loop to see some of the details. Secondly, many of the photographs here are duplicates from his earlier book \\"Studio Nudes\\" which was a full size book.

I love every part Tina sings because she uses different tactics on her vocals for each song. Susan does an amazing job on the keyboards and back up vocals. Even though I thought the lyrics were wrong to funnel because I thought the song after Sleep is harpischord, but on the lyrics it shows the lyrics of Harpischord being the lyrics for Funnel, which is really weird to me.

This record is not exactly goth (sometimes it verges on trip hop), but it's still better then most of the records offered by Cleopatra!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubbly and bizarre","review":"'Bread and Jam' is nothing like the previous album, 'Serpentine Gallery'. Gone are the dreamy layers, gorgeous vocals, and industrial beats. On this album, they are replaced by scratches, cutesy-girl singing and trip hop percussion. However, the album is somehow still spooky, its subjects being mainly childhood fears and nightmares. Unfortunately Tina Root's operatic voice isn't really showcased here, except in the wicked track 'Soldiers', which alone earned them an extra star in my review! All in all, 'Bread and Jam' alternates between excellent and irritating, but it's worth it for the good moments if you're an SS fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchblade Symphony keeps growing...","review":"People think that a band has to keep the same sound from album to album, but I think Switchblade shows that they can change their sound and still stay the same band.

Not only have they apparently jumped on the Marilyn Mansonesque nappy-haired ragdoll bad makeup \\"aren't I cute and disgusting\\" look bandwagon, but Tina's vocals become choppy and cracky, not smooth and soaring as they were formerly. Susan's programming and keyboards, which were before unastounding but worked with the feel of the mood, have gone from simple to just plain bad, she's trying far too hard to improvise with no thought given to art or to the range of her talent. I sincerely hope they put more effort into their next album after seeing how this one has failed their fans...and I'm sure their pocketbooks as well...I still like the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever, girl.","review":"So, this is what was passing for goth at the time it was released...Hmph. I quote, \\"Witches they ride on broomsticks you know...\\" Maybe I set my expectations too high, as I loved Serpentine Gallery, and saw them in concert twice. When I bought this I was not expecting trip-hop and yet MORE nursery rhyme lyrics. I kept it for maybe a week then sold it. The one song that I did like, Fractal, I liked a lot. Too bad it was only a minute and a half long. After this I just couldn't take the risk of buying anything else they've released. A shame, such potential..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A change of course for Switchblade Symphony","review":"Switchblade Symphony's sophmore effort represents a change of sound from their first album. Much of the \\"big\\" feel of \\"Serpentine Gallery\\" is missing here. The vocals continue to excel, but the songs aren't as interesting or as good as the prior album. Track 7, \\"Harpsichord\\" is the closest the band comes to their earlier effort. Hard to say if this is all due to a slight change in the band line-up, or if it represents a fundamental shift in their sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEONE TEACH THIS GIRL HOW TO USE HER TALENT","review":"OK. I have to say Switchblade Symphony has potential. That is about it. Other than that, the album is absolutely atrocious. The singer has a beautiful voice -but she also evidently is either really young or inexperienced/immature_THERE IS NO CONTENT WHATSOEVER TO THIS MUSIC> basically, she sings stupid, juvenile lyrics to an underdeveloped melody- but with a beautiful voice. DONT WASTE your money. This is produced at the level of eigth-grade 'goths'. INSECT is the only decent song on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite excellent, even for non-Goth fans","review":"I was very hesitant to buy a Switchblade Symphony album, mainly because the whole Goth scene freaks me out and I don't really want to have anything to do with it. But I finally got my courage up and bought it, and it really is good. It's like really dark, spooky trip hop. Don't be put off by the term \\"goth,\\" because this doesn't sound like Marilyn Manson. It's really a cool experience. So, for those of you who like slightly out there bands like Radiohead and Portishead, but can't stand the Goth scene, (and I know you're out there), don't be scared of SS. You don't have to dress up in black eye shadow and fake stiches because you own a really good barely goth album.-Maquiladora84"},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting and riveting action adventure","review":"what an exciting action filled book. the author provides and exciting as well as scary plot as he sends his wild eyed characters into the thick of action.

You need to know about line, shape, texture, color, and creating a focal point before learning how to make a piece of art. Linda does not neglect techniques, leading you through wire work, bead stringing, beading on a ground, woven beadwork, and the use of polymer clay.

The biggest disappointment, though, is the drawings themselves. Although the cover is in color, all the drawings inside are black and white, but not even with the crispness of ink. They are all printed as though drawn in soft pencil, with low contrast. Visually this art book is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too icky to use, too pretty to discard","review":"I have gone back to roasting my veggies in an open pan.

Second, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, because it was shipped with no padding on top OR bottom, and so not surprisingly, it arrived with a crack through the lid and a part about the size of a dime completely chipped off.

Both images are for the same unit. I didn't think this was a pattern and expected that the replacement would have no damage, so didn't take pictures of the original unit. The product was chipped in several places on the inside rim of the lower half - some of them were big enough to put me off. I had paid for a new product. I asked Amazon for replacement and sent this one back. Amazon promptly sent a replacment. The replacement had more chipping away on the inside rim than the previous one. It looks like all of these units are defective and probably why they are included in 4-for-3 promotion. Do not buy this product. I would go as far as saying, this company does not do any quality control and and can't expect that any of its other eathernware products are in pristine condition either. Bad experience.

It contains ~1500 questions that have been used in real GMATs and answers to each of these questions. The more you do these questions, the better you will score in the actual GMAT. Some of the inofficial prep books suggest that the proposed answers in this book are too time consuming in the real GMAT. I couldn't disagree more. They are most of the time very practical solutions and the more you excercise the faster you get.The book also contains some instructions on how to approach the solving of each type of question in GMAT, and a math formula section to refresh your college math knowledge. The instructions in the book may be quite hard to apply, so I would recommend to buy also Kaplan's main preparation book to support your preparation to GMAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GMAT review on the market","review":"As I mention in my title, The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 10th Edition is the BEST GMAT review on the market. The book is compiled by the actual test writers, so the practice questions are all REAL. I suggest you download the PowerPrep software from MBA.com as well.

I got no more from the book than I did from the handout my professor prepared, and the handout took less time to read. I'd say the worst part of reading Perry was the fact that he quoted verbatim what the students said, including every um, uh, ah, well, etc. Unless your looking to catch up on some sleep, find yourself a handout..."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping from start to finish","review":"In this highly ambiguous tale of moral uncertainty--both in terms of the killer himself and all those around him (his father, his wife, his lover and her mother), Imamura is at the top of his game.

If they had labeled this \\"Crime Fiction With No Mystery\\", then that would be more honest. Most of the stories in this volume have no real hidden element that keeps you guessing.

And these were the better ones! One was a ripoff of Poe's Casque of Amontillado, while the lead story, bet on red, was cliched. Leave it to a fool like Nelson DeMille to pick some really bad stories. The only really good one was Steven Kings' semi-supernatural spine tingler, and that was more for the creepy language and timing he possesses, than for any original story ideas.

I also was irritated that every single character didn't seem to have any morals and was very annoyed by Milly's helpless and weak personality.

On disc two,the most creative tracks would be Glo's mix of \\"Magic Mother Invocation\\" and Global Feat's cut of another version of \\"Isle Of Everywhere\\".There are four remixes of \\"Master Builder\\" but none compare as to the frightingly off-beat mix done by Graham Massey.The oddest tune on here is Doof's reconstruction of \\"You Never Blow Your Trip Forever\\".Aimed at fans who are HEAVILY into Gong or just plain remix titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why This Is One of My Top Favorite Anime Shows!!","review":"This is an awesome collection!

I also recommend the body spray to everyone because it smells soooooo good if you're wanting a nice, sweet scent. I've gotten compliments on it, whereas, I wouldn't get compliments on much else that I used. I looked at Victoria Secret, Wal-Mart, and Bath and Body Works for a sweet scented body spray, but they didn't have anything that I wanted to wear. Then, I came across the Body Fantasies Cotton Candy stuff, and I love it! :) So yeah, don't hesitate.. it's awesome! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Make no mistake; this isn't a definitive defense of the pre-Trib rapture and I doubt that it was intended to be. Such a book would need to be much thicker. Dr LaHaye provides an entry level overview of the pre-Trib rapture as well as the other views, and a run down of some of the polemics hurled at some pretribulationists. Some who hold opposing views will no doubt get their noses out of joint but the reality is that just about every pre-Wrath or post-Trib book and website attacks the pretribulational viewpoint - most often irrationally.As an aside, contrary to some of the commentaries about Dr LaHaye's demeanor, he is always fair and gracious. I am well acquainted with some of the issues where he addresses certain polemics and I think he restrained himself admirably.I thoroughly enjoyed the book. But if you have already adopted a non-pretribulational viewpoint, don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-Tribulation Arguments for the Rapture","review":"Dr. Tim LaHaye has done more to put the pre-tribulation view of the rapture into print then any other writer in modern times. His popular LEFT BEHIND series has sparked even movies and much debate in the Church about the timing of the rapture or even if the rapture is biblical.In this work, LaHaye takes his opponents to task. He seeks to provide both biblical and historical arguments for the pre-tribulation rapture view. He does this by examining both the arguments for this view as well as the arguments of those who oppose his views.What I found lacking about the book was the lack of biblical arguments LaHaye gives. He spends too much time examining the historical debate and not the Scriptures themselves. I believe LaHaye could almost end the rapture debate by staying in the Scriptures and building his case there. The Bible alone is the only solid foundation for truth (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:19-21)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One","review":"Another book using self centered literalism to reach their conclusions.

I have close to 20 years in the business. I was looking for this book to bring to light a medic's point of view regarding the war in Iraq. I truly wish I had tried another book. This one was written on about an 8th grade level. Plus the chapters are short, sometimes only 2 pages long, but no longer than 8. While 6 of the 104 page book were direct quotes of eulogies and obituaries and prayers, 10 of them are taken up with pictures. This is all well and good, but it only leaves 88 pages of content. This combined with the extremely short chapters leaves the story lacking of any depth. I got her emotion and thoughts of whatever the current situation was, but other than that there was no depth.

Some of the central themes about love and death made me think. I do think Kelly assimilated into 19th century life a little too easily. And that the 19th century people she interacted with seemed to take her bold and unorthodox ways a little too smoothly.

They don't give you an examples to work through. I bought the 6th edition recently not realizing that it was the same book. It still doesn't teach you anything.

By definition it is just a bunch of cases thrown together to demonstrate various areas of the law. But lately there has been a new trend in books for 1Ls... analysis.

Encore!","review":"I've always been a fan of the synth-pop INSOC albums and major hit we all know, but when I heard this album for the first time a week ago (yeah, I know...it's been a while, but I've rediscovered much of my fave 80's/90's music), I was blown away! Radically different than his/their earlier works, I can't stop listening to it! Probably my first foray into dark/goth (sorry, but that's the truth), it blends together real well and stands on it's own as a major achievement for Kurt, whether he would agree or not. As another reviewer writes, if he would only release more, perhaps some of this stuff would be big! I'm left wanting MORE of this version of INSOC. Kurt, PLEEZE consider giving us more of your creativeness, INSOC or solo, it doesn't matter. Get yourself a website and/or get the INSOC.org site back up and give us an update as to what your current projects are! GREAT STUFF, dude! I'm definitely a fan regardless of what you release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blindsided!","review":"I just wish I had read some reviews before buying this cd. But then again, with many of you giving this cd four or five stars, I might have been persuaded to buy it anyhow. I don't like this cd at all. I shouldn't have to coerce myself into liking this cd, especially with so much other good music out there to listen to. Information Society captivated me with their first three releases, and then we (or atleast I) was blindsided with this miserable cd full of whimpering and whining. The first track is actually not so bad, once it gets going, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like In Soc, DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"Having been a fan since the inception of In Soc, I waited through all the delays of production for this CD to be released.

Definately not In Soc stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real InfoSoc, should have been a 'side project'.","review":"I love InfoSoc.This album is very uncharistic of InfoSoc.This albim... Blows. Completely. Not 1 track is really any good.It sucks. Don't buy it. Whoever called this a masterpiece has absolutely no taste in music or any other form of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"this just doesn't work","review":"Oh, boo hoo, Kurt. I like Front 242, Front Line Assembly, NiN, and I understand the formula he was trying to achieve here. But the whining, self-indulgent lyrics and poor execution of a mature genre just don't cut it here. One or two tracks are refreshingly reminiscent of the off-cuts on Hack, but other than that, INSOC is pretty much dead here. I try to be open-minded, I tried to listen with an open ear, but this just doesn't work. Its construction is poor; an engineering failure and a mixing disaster with no real content or message to boot. I'm reminded of Gore's fluffy tripe that he tried away from Depeche Mode; you can have a good voice, super brains and musical talent, but without the soul of the rest of your group, you might as well be the next garage band with a half-baked demo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Afraid","review":"I am a big fan of the previous three albums, but this one is too eccentric for me. I was prepared for it to be different because of the member changes, but I was still surprised at how amazingly bad it turned out to be. I really tried to like it, but I'm afraid I'll have to use it as a drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why sap the soul of InSoc for this?","review":"I was a big fan of the first 3 InSoc albums. They all showed a great creative progression and insight, and managed to incorporate fun, thought and skill into masterpieces. Kurt has been quoted that Don't Be Afraid was how he originally intended InSoc to sound. Why after establishing InSoc as everyone's favorite danceable synth show would he choose to abandon that reputation for this depressing collection? Why not just release it under his own name?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messed up","review":"I really liked the first 3 Information Society CDs. I was looking forward to getting this one. The music is definitely gothic in nature. If you are into self mutilation, you will probably like this CD. If you are into railing against God or authority, you will like this CD. If you are into doing heavy drugs, you will like this CD. One wonders what kind of drugs Kurt was on when he wrote this thing. One thing I can say in defense of this CD is that SOME of Kurt's musical talent comes through in spite of his descent into a personal hell (track 1 is actually good ... until he starts singing). I just hope he comes out of this dark phase in his life.The data CD which comes with it does provide insight into InSoc's history ... but does not explain how he arrived at his current state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have always enjoyed the Information Society albums. I found some of the keyboard programming brilliant. They created very original material using samples and keyboards. In fact, some of their music inspired me to become a keyboard programmer and remixer. I was very excited to hear of a new IS record but when I finally received a copy, I was very disappointed with the results. I'm not going to say anything bad about the album; I just don't recommend it to anyone looking for that classic IS sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"THIS is InSoc? Here's a hint, Kurt: If I wanted to listen to (badly done) Front 242, I'd pick up one of their CDs. I can't figure out what they were trying to accomplish here. If Kurt wanted to release a dark, depressing album, at least he could have done it in his own name and not call it Information Society. But instead he decides to alienate half his fans (if not more) by making a complete departure from his trademark style. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against gothy techno kind of stuff. And this album does bear a slight passing resemblance to the first (apparently unofficial) InSoc release... the one with the giant \\"I\\" on it. But for a band that is constantly hovering on the edge of obscurity, this was a bad move. I am begging you, please bring back the techno/synth happy stuff and the clever samples for the next album (if there IS a next one!), okay Kurt? This stuff is just depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This aint your parents InSoc","review":"This cd is a major departure from the pop songs, that are associated with this band.This cd feature dark gothic like songs and lyrics.

Its accually very bad. There is no real singing in this album other than a for a cover song of the Gary Newman. Everything else is just awful music and talking with lyrics that [seems like] he is on some hard hallucination drugsI tried to complete my collection of a band I always liked (especially a great voice), but got super disappointed in someone whom I thought had great talent.Stay away from this one unless you are into psychedelic movie type music that is off the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but doubtful","review":"The product met my expectations as book.

He states that you should put your income producing assets such as bonds in the tax sheltered accounts to minimize taxes paid. However, Harold Evensky in his book Wealth Mangement proves this is the absolutely wrong approach. If you want to maximize total wealth you need to put the assets with the highest after tax return in you tax sheltered accounts, this would normally be stock investements and not bonds.

I will say, after watching this second version, I have absolutely no interest in seeking out and reading any of his books. This is the danger authors risk whenever they allow someone to adapt their work for the screen.I really didn't care for this production; it was (at worst) painfully dull and too long by half. I found it to be limited in scope and a little too repetitious. All the characters were either sad, mad, or worn weary (which I suppose comes from dying and dying and dying). The story is dark and lifeless and takes forever to get anywhere and then it's over in a blink and you're left wondering, as one character puts it, \\"what is the point of it all?\\" This was the slowest race against time, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"No wonder I had never heard of this show, it was such a waste.

Therefore my expectations were pretty low. Unfortunately they weren't low enough. Not even glimpses of a mostly naked Tahmoh Penikett can make up for the terrible writing, lack of plot, slow pace and fairly mediocre acting found in this show. I will never get back the hours of my life that I wasted watching this show... and I do watch a lot of bad TV without complaint.I've never read the book this was based on, but from reading on several forums, it appears not to have followed the book very well either.You definitely won't find me recommending this one. If you're a fan of Tahmoh Penikett, I suggest you just re-watch his better scenes in Dollhouse and give this a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst waste of my money","review":"I bought this on a whim because it sounded interesting.....big mistake!! I watched it to the end which was the next best thing to torture. The story seems to follow no plot and every time there is an opportunity for the movie to get better-it gets more lame. The story had potential and the actors were good (some of them lol), but overall it was a big let down. The end of the movie was the same as the beginning and the middle section was cheesy sex scenes and pathetic battles.

I've enjoyed the irrigator's performance...while it works. The life expectancy of the irrigator (based on owning three) is about 2 years for a single adult using it. With each unit, the toothbrush performed flawlessly. At the 2 year mark, the irrigator would stop working. There isn't an easy way to get it fixed and, in the end, the projected cost is almost as much as replacing it. I'm considering moving to a stand alone irrigator by a competitor.

But the water pic device has about half the output pressure of the older Oral B center. I have tested both, and can't determine if the reduce pressure on the newer model severely effects it's cleaning ability, as it uses \\"micro bubbles\\" to help with the cleaning process.

When it arrived, I immediately tried the waterjet while the toothbrush was charging. The water pressure is not nearly strong enough to get between your teeth, so I never used it again as it seemed a complete waste of time. When the toothbrush finally charged up, I loved it. It really made my teeth feel dentist-office clean, so I decided to keep the machine even with the lame waterjet. Well, I have now had the Oral B 8900 for about 2 and a half months, and the battery is completely dead. It won't re-charge no matter how long I leave it plugged in.

All adjustments on the color settings are in vain. With this size of screen, your eyes will be under tortures when the pictures are not good. I can hardy watch an entire movie.I had hope that these problems are related to the fact I do not have yet the HD box. But when reading other postings, I know now I am not alone. Not sure how to resolve this, but for potential buyers, be aware. I've done a lot of researches, but don't expect this type of problem for a set at this price.

What's sad is that no matter how hard Silvestri tries, he still hasn't won an Academy Award, only a nomination for Forrest Gump. Silvestri deserves more than that.

One thing is for sure, there is not much Cast Away music. The real music lasts 3 and half minutes, more or less. The rest is a very relaxing sound of waves.

It's not entirely sleepy, since selections from \\"Back to the Future\\" and \\"Roger Rabbit\\" are there to keep things bouncing along- it's just his more melodic side. Like I said- a great introduction to his work, and I'd recommend picking up a copy of \\"The Abyss\\" (Choral and melodic masterpiece) and \\"Captain America\\" (Big Superhero fun) with this CD- those scores would make nice bookends to this one, and your Silvestri experience will be off to a great start! My only real gripe with this album is that the \\"wave\\" sounds at the end of the \\"Castaway\\" track make me want to kick my stereo... but just a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Zemeckis and Alan Silvestri","review":"This CD combines the music of Alan Silvestri, on his work on Several of Bob Zemeckis' films. Along with the new CastAway music. It is wonderful, fom the grand Back to the future theme, to the fun music form 'Who framed Roger rabbit'. There is also Wonderful and touching Forrest Gump Suite, and my favorite, the end credits from Contact, A piece that can grab your emotions and put you back in the atmosphere of a wonderful movie. The new CastAway music is no disappointment, it continues with Alan Silvestri's great line of touching work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tevin Campbell CD","review":"I ordered a \\"New\\" CD this was surely not new.

I literally wore the covers off mine a thirty years ago! It is nice to see it reprinted. Dr. Lord put extensive research into this work, and to my knowledge it was the first book on Civil War equipment. Historian or collector alike will enjoy this book, and it has stood up to the test of time, despite shelves of books on the subject of Civil War equipment since then. If you don't have one, get one.

It's nothing like The REAL Ghostbusters. The theme song is just as catchy as the Inspector Gadget theme song becuase they only sing one line: \\"Let's go Ghostbusters Let's go! over & over again. The ghosts,monsters,aliens & the main villian look like they came from a bad 1950's/1960's horror/sci-fi flick. The Belfly bat is nothing then Scrappy-Doo in bat-form. The Main cast have little to no personality. The jokes are cheesey & phoned in a mile away. The animation is ok. The stories are goofy even for a show like this. The Gorilla is nothing more then a second-rate Scooby-Doo wannabe. This show gives me a headache just even listining to it. My advice: Get The REAL Ghostbusters dvds by DIC. I give this set a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This story was a very disturbing story. It is a picture of a dumb, unsucsesful in life, little mouse, and I believe it puts stupid ideas into the minds of little children.

Before you know it, you are hooked, not because of it's taste but because of what it does for your body. I have one in the morning and I am stuffed till about noon. Going on a slow roll weight loss plan, this is a great addition to my diet.I have grown to like it a lot .. with a banana, apple, pears, honey dew or whatever other fruit I can lay my hands on.

Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides... everything well within the usual limits. Heart rate was a little low at 46 bpm. I love the taste...it is green and healthy...not icky sweet and unhealthy like a lot of other supplements that I have tried over the years. Food addiction is the only reason I can think of that anyone would have a problem with The Ultimate Meal.

One shake in the morning with 2 bananas and 3/4 cup frozen blueberries. The trick is to use bananas that are spotting to the point you wouldn't want to eat them by themselves. Really fresh bananas make for a bad taste!!! I have lost 10 lbs and feel great. The reviewers that are talking about how bad it taste must have real issues. Everyone in my family likes it! YOU MUST USE OLD BANANAS!!!!! Also, it is imperative you blend it longer than you think is necessary.

During my recovery I wanted to subsist on a liquid diet, to avoid getting solid food trapped in the holes while they healed. Ultimate Meal was a lifesaver. I could rinse out my mouth with water and the holes from my missing wisom teeth would remain clean and unclogged. Somewhat expensive, but satisfying. Other \\"meal replacements\\" just don't measure up. I lived for a week on this stuff before going to soups and soft food. I'd mix it with soy milk and add other flavorings like chocolate powder and stevia for sweetening, or more often I'd mix it with fruit juice, since that was easiest. It mixed easily with a whisk or a hand blender, and either one fits nicely inside the Ultimate Meal mug you can buy from Ultimate Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT--But there is an Alternative Product to Consider","review":"There is no doubt whtsoever in my mind that the ULtimate Meal is an excellent product.

I think it has all of the positive advantages of the Ultimate Meal but with three improvements: 1) it is cheaper; 2) it taste a little better; and 3) I find it a bit more gentle on the stomach.Regardless of these issues, the Ultimate Meal is a TOP NOTCH product that I recommend whole heartedly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb product","review":"This would be great for weight loss.

Did I just get a bad batch? Similar to the first can, it had a slightly 'off' smell - a little rancid. But with a 'three year shelf life' I figured it must be fine. After one meal of this, I became very ill - cramping, diarrhea, gastric issues. You would think that at $50 a can the seller would take it back.

The only other comparable product I know of is Source of Life also very good, but takes a slightly different approach.For me, I don't follow the directions. I make a smoothie. I probably don't use an entire 1/3 cup either. I use some orange juice and a bit of yogurt and some hemp milk and some frozen berries work great. Blend it all up with a generous scoop of Ultimate Meal and - really - I can't drink it fast enough. I usually have about 16 ounces in about 5 minutes. I can do that a couple of times a day and it's a real treat. It does my body good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"This stuff is not bad, if you follow the directions.

I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop. One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.This case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine. My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out. It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction. Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.It will protect your pod though."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't fit your ipod - don't bother with this product","review":"i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20 & 40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town. However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly. The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't. The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button. So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless. pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiatt keeps me hooked","review":"Hiatt has this reputation of being a great songwriter. He hooked me with a live show in Philly in 88. I was blown away. Through the years, I would rush out to get the next Hiatt, bypassing the greatest hits. To be honest, at first listen I thought mmmm, ok...this is ok..then, each song as the cd pushed on, got better and better. I like the folky Hiatt more than the slick Hiatt. There's both on here. In true fashion, he takes you on a ride, and avoids the typical lyric. My Dog and Me strikes a chord, I can relate, I care. Windows on the World takes you to a place. A far as Fly Back Home, \\"All you creatures walkin upright round here, well you really made a mess\\" sung from a red tailed hawk is what I love about Hiatt. You are caught off guard and pleasantly surprised. Dont expect an over produced Cd, its a little on the raw side. Even have some pedal noise kept in (cool)! I like it John(& the \\"smokin\\" Goners) Its not quite Crossing Muddy Waters, but I like it alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Missing Pieces Here","review":"\\"Missing Pieces\\" is, to my taste, the best song John Hiatt has ever written. If the writing on this one doesn't move you nothing can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful production","review":"So glad somebody mentioned the sound quality (or lack thereof) among all the rave reviews. The album was mastered by Doug Sax, one of the best in the business....what went wrong? To me, it sounds like they didn't care and just banged it out and mixed it quickly. Now this method worked great on Hiatt's 'Bring the family', one of my all-time faves. There's no doubt that Hiatt still is a decent (although predictable) songwriter and singer and his band is surely first rate. The sound and production on this one is so bad that I'm sending it back, really...the mix is off, it's way overcompressed and extremely small sounding......"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Does It Again...But Even Better","review":"This is a great rock and roll album. Whether you're a John Hiatt fan or not buy this album. There hasn't been a rock and roll album this good in a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not very good","review":"As others have written, the sound is muddy and the songs all sound alike. One of the appeals of other John Hiatt records is the change of pace, from ballads to country to power rock. Here, there is only one sound, and I can barely listen to a whole album of it. Buy Bring the Family instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shades of Billy Joe Shaver","review":"This album reminds me of Billy Joe Shaver's last two albums with Eddy Shaver on lead guitar. Too much noise and growling. Some pretty fair lyrics that may be covered by others with a more sensitive delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this had been his first it would have been his last","review":"People who wring their hands wondering why the great Hiatt has never received all the attention he probably deserves need look no farther than this album for the reason why. Good songs without a doubt...but buried in a muddy mix and sloppy production. Even under the best circumstances, Hiatt's tortured attempts at singing can be tough to take. On this album, his voice sounds electronically distorted and echoey in a fashion that makes it even more annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unblelievably Bad!","review":"I understand that Hiatt wanted to change his sound a bit, but an entire album of retro NewWave synth tracks???? Unbelievable! The backing tracks are done completely with sythesizer as Hiatt lamely attempts to evoke the likes of Devo, Flock of Seagulls, and Simple Minds. Believe me, he sounds ridiculous. His gruff bluesy voice is completely inappropriate for the new wave songs on this album. Do yourself a favor and steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD!","review":"Read some of the negative reviews for this CD before deciding to take a chance and recently purchase it (in spite of the bad reviews). Don't know what CD those negative reviewers were listening to, but don't think it was this J. Hiatt CD. 'Beneath This Gruff Exterior' is a good CD with good songs, variety in styles, great band accompaniment, fine or at least 'okay' audio sound (for the particular CD), and even halfway decent vocals for John Hiatt. Bottom-line is that if you are a John Hiatt fan, don't let a few negative (and for the most part - totally inaccurate) reviews prevent you from getting this CD. As a John Hiatt fan, you will more than likely find it to be a \\"good\\" JH CD as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"John's Genius Strikes Again","review":"Its not as good as Bring the Family, but that is not a fair statement. I dont think he or anyone else will ever make a record that good again. But this CD certainly has its own magic. The lyrics range from emotive to nostalgic to witty. With his pen, John appeals to the heart , the mind, and the soul. Musically, you feel like you are listening to a live band at their very best. These guys are pros who have been together a long time and it shows on this disc. I have to listen to it some more, but I think the best track is Missing Pieces. The harmonica on that song is a nice touch. But there are many gems on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious every time","review":"It \\"teaches\\" you actual phrases that by their nature tell you jokingly about the culture.

I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Lighthouses of the East Coast","review":"We got this video for Christmas and watched it soon thereafter. We thought it was lighthouses of America but instead it was lighthouses of the East Coast. There are over 100 lighthouses in Michigan alone and not one of those is pictured. There were none of the West Coast lights included although the packaging said there was. The photography was lousy. The narration was inconsistent and provided little if any information for most of the lights. The music got annoying after a while. They spent 10 minutes or more showing the Portland Head Light, but skipped through a few others with hardly a mention. We did not bother with Discs 2 & 3 since they mostly were repeat viewings of the lights on Disc 1. Ironically, Disc 4 has a Michigan light pictured (Au Sable), but not one mention of any Michigan lights or any of the Great Lakes lights anywhere on the DVD.All in all a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promoting my Website","review":"As an amateur promoting my website this book caught my eye.

These will be pleased to find the famous poems (e.g. \\"Redondillas\\") which they only knew by name and references, as well as famous books here collected for the first time (especially 1908's \\"A Lume Spento,\\" \\"Canzoni\\" (1911), and the \\" Miscellaneous Poems,\\" not previously collected). It's a fine edition with useful notes and reproducctions of all the original title pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Gird on thy star, We'll have this out with fate.\\"","review":"This is a collection of Pound's earlier verse, and items he particularly did not want published in Personae (Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)). It's a shame, really, because some of these poems are pure gold, and demonstrate a lyrical quality to Pound's verse of which most casual students are unaware. For instance, we all learned \\"In a Station of the Metro,\\" but how many of us learned poems like \\"The Summons\\" or \\"Vana?\\" Pound's gifts were manifold, and this book makes that quite apparent on just a cursory reading. I drop it a star simply because I cannot always palate Pound's taste for archaic language, and think he could have benefited from his own American dialect. That being said, Pound--for me--is the master, and this an excellent collection of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Flyin' Music","review":"We brought this album because \\"Away Ye Merry Lassies\\" was stunning.Like the lyrics, the arrangement, and the story line.

If you're a fundamentalist Christian, you're probably not going to like it, but you could re-think some of your belief systems. This CD has grown on us. The more I listen, the more I like it. \\"I Come From Women\\" is especially memorable and strong. You want your daughters to know this song. You'd wish your sons might listen, too. \\"She Who\\" is a stunner -- just when you think you've become jaded and the commute home is too long, put this is you CD player and your burden won't seem quite so heavy, and then \\"Float Down the River\\" will bring peace, briefly.Politics and music are gently intertwinted, and sometimes not. Isn't this the way? The 1993 \\"Gulf War Song\\" is timely in 2006-07.

Barkeley blatantly ignores unsavory facts, fails to give sources for statements which contradict most known evidence and sources (notably why Crown Princess Stephanie was rendered incapable of having more children), and over-romanticizes events in excessive purple prose.I would only moderately recommend this book for the most hardcore of Rudolf buffs, because there are some interesting direct quotes not found in most other English sources and pretty pictures.

The environment crawls with detail, little of it pleasant, but much of it well written, sometimes even inspired. SCENARIO FOR SCORSESE is notable for considering the needs and ethics of living without the slightest philosophizing, using only the experiences of its characters to convey its viewpoint. A spectacular denouement. I anticipate that in future work Schorb will retain the human compassion and environmental richness of SCORSESE which so effectively pulled me into a story I hope never to see in reality. ~Joy Calderwood, Independent Reviews Site"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great nike watch","review":"This nike watch stops working every day.

Seemed too good to be true.Well...it was. The print heads have to be cleaned every few days - it takes about 5 minutes to finish - else the output is crummy. This is a real pain, especially when you are in a rush to print something out. Never had any problems with any of the HP products (2 laserjets and 1 inkjet) that I have owned over the past 15 years.Once the printer heads are clean, the overall performance of the MFC-5100C is adequate. The scanner resolution/quality is nothing the write home about and the printer output is not outstanding (even when set to the highest quality) but is ok for most of our needs.Now would I purchase this unit if I had to do it all over again?

I've printed out enough of those print check sheet to wallpaper a room. I never had this problem with my HP and the ink seemed to last more than twice as long.I saw this problem in the reviews before I bought but was swayed by the number of good reviews.

I've not yet encountered the errors and print head issues others mention. Just daily use of the thing (which I try to avoid) is insane. Eats about 5 pages of paper per printed page, makes this god awful screaching sound when it's out of paper...then makes an overly long beep confirming the lack of paper. The printer consumes ink by the barrel and disables half the features if it runs out of one particular color.I want my old Apple LaserWriter 16/600 back (over 10 years old, 10,000+ pages printed and it never failed me)...never should have gotten rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I, too, got the infamous error 41, and called the number the other reviewer listed (Brother) and they told me I had to take it to a service center for repair, that it was not covered at all since it was out of warranty.

Even before the death error, it had such poor print quality and needed constant cleaning cycles that it was frustrating at best to use this machine.

This did not resolve the problem and I began receiving the dreaded error 41 code. Upon calling brother I was informed the print head was likely bad and that the printer was out of warranty. I was given the name and # of two service reps each of which indicated this had been a common problem. I was quoted head replacement at $150 - $200.

The print quality was never that great, and towards the end it just got worse. Finally, I got an Error 41 message, and I knew the unit was toast.From what I gather, Error 41 indicates only a print-head failure, but disables the whole machine. It is especially vexing, then, that I cannot send outgoing faxes or do any scanning, despite the fact that those subsystems are not broken at all. I'm thinking of moving to a desktop-size laser printer, and would rather not have to spend extra money on a new scanner or fax -- but it looks like I must.Error 41 seems to be a frequent failure across the Brother MFC line, and the inability to use the remaining functions strikes me as a poor design choice on their part.If you want quick, sharp printing, long life and reliable operation, it would seem to be best to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the sentiment - big piece of crap","review":"bought this unit for my 76 year old mother.

Apparently it is related to either a fatal print head problem or one of the motors burning out. We did like the price at the time and all the functions that came with the machine, but the slightly over two year product lifetime seems a very short time for how relatively infrequently we used it (it was our backup printer, mainly getting use as a fax, scanner, and copier).It is extremely disappointing that the 41 problem is so well known and Brother refuses to correct it once the product is out of warranty, which is right around the time 41 starts to happen to most owners. We replaced our 5100C with a Canon PIXMA 780, and will never buy another Brother product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The infamous Error 41-- Get free service from Brother","review":"I am not happy with MFC5100C.

The salesperson warned me that Brother machines were known to have frequent paper feed problems. I crossed my fingers and flashed the plastic. The scanner works great and the print quality is okay. The machine is quite noisy printing. Turned out that all the ink cartridges tended to run out about the same time -- so much for convenience. Paper jams became more of a problem the longer I owned the unit. Recently one color no longer would print regardless of how many times I cleaned the head. Now I have an ERROR 41 message requiring me to bring the unit in for repair.

First it stopped printing in black at all, requiring me to throw out a brand new cartridge and buy another new one to solve the problem. Both paper feeders (top document feed and back paper feeder) jam fully 80% of the time. Now goes through ink very quickly.

The frame is rough and ours had jagged gobs of glue in the inside corners. The playing base is medium density fiberboard with wood veneer - not solid wood. The pouch is made of microfiber fabric, sort of a faux suede. How this company gets away with such outright lies about the product's construction, which it clearly prides itself on, is beyond me. What's more amazing is that people who bought the game actually seem to believe the claims!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Description! Cheaply Constucted!","review":"I purchased this game based on the description of the quality construction, which for the most part, was validated(?) by many reviews. I was extremely disappointed with the reality. Wood construction? No, I would call it compressed wood dust...not even sawdust. I didn't even find the painting to be aesthetically pleasing. The picture of the game at Amazon does not depict the reality/poor quality of the product. Mancala is a great game...find another board, not this one.

I bought this case without reading any reviews and found out the hard way that this case is not practical to protect 300$ camera.1. No cover to keep the camera secure (You don't want to loose your 300$ camera with a 15$case.2. This case doesn't cover the camera all the way this causes one side of the camera exposed to rain etc.. and if you drop it you can damage the camera.3.

The clip's pin must have snapped and slid out, because if that's not the case, then they designed the case very very poorly. Last week I almost lost my camera after not hearing the case fall off, and went hysterical. (It later turned up.) You'd figure name brand stuff would have some quality. After dealing with the thing falling apart and putting it back together, and over again, I finally lost the little metal pieces the last time it fell off my belt, and now I'm in the market for a new case. I really liked this one because it attached to the belt and was designed to complement my Exilim Z-70. I initially liked it so much, that I might give it another chance. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"The EX-CASE3 holds my Casio camera securely, and the camera has never dislodged itself without my help.

The movies are \\"behind-the-scenes\\" substitutes for REAL content and the interactivity is clumbsy and contrived.I don't know when this CD was produced but it suffers from the same problem as most early multimedia: far too much form over content. Face it people, the reason why we buy such a CD is not for the flashy (and they aren't even that) interfaces. It's for pictures/sounds/movies and as many as you can cram on a CD without sacrificing overall quality.To top it off, the presentation is occasionally incompatible with Windows 2000.

Like a restless ghost, he reminds you that the world is bad no matter how brave a face you put on it. Wandering thoughts are honestly introduced without any real temper or obvious emotion. \`Careless love,' an unforgiving acapella, mocks the uselessness of loving beyond the grave. Whereas the title track glides on a cushion upbeat sarcasm - \\"a fireman her husband was... I duly tried to light a fire upon his rightful booty.\\" The constant to all this biting commentary is the traditional, Celtic country rock that Oldham uses. Inconsiderate, but compelling throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another addicitive oldham album","review":"I will admit I have a problem.

His voice, reminiscent here of a tubercular Paul Simon, limns his faux folk conceits with olde English verse and awkward syntax. That's not, in concept, a terrible idea (see Fairport Convention, early Richard Thompson, Nick Drake), but Oldham's third-hand songs, unfamiliar with irony, nevertheless have the uncomfortable presence of pastiche, each one a genre exercise in quotes. He breaks through on one track - the plaintive, melancholy \\"After I Made Love to You\\". Oldham has his reputation, and his claque, certainly. Those who enjoy his work will find plenty of beauty here. The rest of us can listen, learn, and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccessible . . . literally.

Trigger lag time is virtually eliminated because the response trigger automatically pushes the trigger out, and then your pressure immediately pulls it in again. My friends and I tried it on my Tippmann 98, and now our whole Tourney Team has a Response trigger on our A-5's 98 Customs. Be sure to buy a hopper that can keep up with this monster, though. Such as a Halo or an Evolution II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball chopper!","review":"I bought this for my 98 and during its first match it fired about 5 shots and then began chopping the paintballs before they reached the chamber.

This history of the quantum theory is very well written, showing how each theoretical development gives the reasons and motivation for the following, how the matter started with the solution Planck has given to his problem, leading to the later formulations and great discoveries of Weisenberg, Schrodinger, Bohr...

They are watching it again this Christmas and also watch it periodically throughout the year.The story is cute enough, the music is fine (plenty of recognizable Christmas songs as well as a few originals) the characters pleasant and exceedingly nice to one another (nothing wrong with that) but MOST importantly, it absolutely brings the Christmas season alive for my girls and despite minor flaws, puts Mom and Dad in the Christmas spirit as well.You could do much worse than to have this video going at the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Video","review":"My kids love the Wee Sing videos, but this video was a big disappointment.

Neil discusses everything around his music from the recent Time Machine Tour. Great Sound. Great footage from the tour. At 500 minutes, it's more than even this die-hard fan can handle in a single sitting, but it's just so good. After all the previous books and videos, I was wondering what else he could possibly cover and how could it be interesting. As usual, Neil is fascinating and goes beyond the mortal realm.

It should be used in conjunction with a good grammar book, dictionary and flashcards. The great thing about software is that you can work on your pronunciation easily. With the Talk Now series you can click on a word over and over to practice. You can also record yourself. With tapes or a CD you have to constantly back up. Again you should not depend on software to learn grammar or syntax. Use it to practice pronunciation and build vocabulary.There is one downside with Talk Now. You will only learn about 400 words. It would have been great if they had 600 to 800. However it is affordable so its worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Work.","review":"The program is a cute, but incomplete tool for studying a language.

Well, the only spices represented in this book are \\"curry powder\\". Not even a recipe for the curry powder blend, just generic curry powder. Additionally, only half of the book is recipes and the other half describes the culture and provides some conflicting nutritional info in the back, e.g. vegetable based diet is healthier except for the Masai who eat almost all protein (blood, meat, milk) and are the healthiest.

These three are relatives of the leader of the Old Ones, even though they are unaware of their uncle's powers. Each one of them have their own special powers of survival, love and loyalty which turn out to be stronger than any power the Dark Side uses against their quest to retrieve the grail.

I was in third or fourth grade at the time and loved those books. Almost 40 years later, I still love them. 'Greenwitch' takes place in Cornwall and the mix of adventure, legend and mystery is still a delight. This is the third book in the series and you really should read the first two, 'Over Sea, Under Stone' and 'The Dark is Rising', before reading this one. Jane, Simon and Barnabas reappear in the final book, 'Silver on the Tree', so be sure to finish the series.This series has really held up well and even though it is aimed at younger readers, my adult self still enjoys them. I'm especially happy that all five books are now available in the Kindle store. They make a nice addition to my (very old) boxed set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A link in an important chain","review":"Much better than Over Sea, Under Stone, not quite as strong as the other three books in the sequence.

The smell was a bit much, but didn't hang around long. It was the very greasy feeling that was left on my skin that I did not care for. All other reviews said it was light and \\"vanishes\\". Mine did the opposite. It was like thick vaseline that clung to my face and actually had to be rubbed in for awhile to get it to \\"vanish\\". Doesn't all face cream vanish?

You are exploring an unknown universe, where smells, color, sound, memory and experience take on an entirely different nature. How do you make it interesting? Avoid writing like Stanley Coren. Not only does he make the most wonderful details mundane, but he makes the most mundane details downright unbearable! His dispassionate matter-of-fact approach makes me wonder if he wrote the book just to have one on his resume, or whether he's a finance journalist turned dog-writer. I like heavy scholarly texts, newspapers and everything documentary. But this one missess the mark in my opinion...His personal stories and tests are funny and sometimes even amusing. His description of his dogs makes them lovable and vivid. But the riddle is why he fails to continue writing in that style and why the book, which is a great topic, dies as soon as your eyes hit it. If you're fascinated by this topic, or you love your animals (like me), than pass over this one and find another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a good book for someone who has minimal knowledge of dog behavior","review":"If I could go back and stop myself from buying this book, I would. I suppose if you have never read a book about dog behavior before, then you may enjoy this one. It is a very basic understanding at best, and at worst it is the most boring dog book I have ever read. There are about 8 pages in the first half of the book that are devoted to nothing but listing all the commands that his dogs know and what he uses them for. Excuse me, but I didn't buy this book to read Mr. Coren bragging about all the different commands he has taught to his dogs. That pretty much turned me off for the entire book because I can't stand authors with a \\"look at me\\" attitude. Also, the entire thing is laid out and listed in a fashion that just makes me want to fall asleep. It isn't the worst book you could ever read about dogs, but there are definitely much better ones that you could spend your money on instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected!","review":"The book was not at all a fun read!

Hopefully he does a better job with the other research he quotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource...","review":"...for anyone who owns a dog, plans on getting a dog, or is simply curious about the workings of canine mind. Coren does not over-anthropomorphize, nor does he alienate dogs or attempt to describe them as mere objects for study, as the scientifically minded are prone to do--instead he strikes a balance, admitting that dogs do have feelings and emotions in their own way, but that they are not exactly like us. There really need to be more authors out there like Stanley.The book's contents have been thoroughly researched, the information backed up with some very interesting examples and stories, and the conclusions are entirely believable--for those who aren't stuck under the belief that animals are nothing but organic machines. All in all it is a highly informative and detailed book, but still an easy read and you will find yourself looking forward to reading the next chapter... and the next... and the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible Picture ABC Book","review":"This book is a gem from the past. Written in a very simple yet elegant style for children, Ms. Egermeier takes snipets from the Bible for each letter of the alphabet and writes an introductory poem and then a short story covering the specific scripture. An example; X is for Exodus, when, it is said, From the wrath of pharoah God's people fled. While each letters story is very well done, by far the Most beautiful part of this book are the illustrations. Each page is a full color plate by Providence Lithograph and each is worthy of framing on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent","review":"Originally I had the Ipod carrying case, but it scratched my screen like crazy, and when ever I dropped my ipod, the sides would dent >< so i got sick of it and bought this one. it has great protection for the screen, and plastic surrounds your wheel and buttons which is even better. it only got 4 stars because the back was made out of Velveteen, I have no problem with that other than the fact that it caused feathers and dust to come onto my screen, so I cleaned it for 15 minuites and left it in there and it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetable","review":"I saw this movie at the New Yorker Cinema back in the early 1970s.

I'm a fan of foreign films, which are generally slower paced than American cinema, but slow pacing should serve a purpose - there is a limit beyond which the slow pacing takes away more than it adds. Also, the moral of the film is inherently unsatisfying - not because it doesn't offer some hackneyed happy ending, but because it attempts an inadequate compensatory ending - 'life was horrible and sad, but at least we have this'. It resolves as neither tragedy nor triumph, and though a viewer might feel it's realistic, it neither makes us feel good nor teaches us a deeper meaning. In the end, we have sympathy for characters, but would never wish to identify with them.The B&W; photgraphy is excellent, camera movement is superb, and the directing is precise. Also, the DVD extras are plentiful and of superb quality. In the end, it is a package easily deserving of four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent but harrowing","review":"I saw Sansho the Baliff some 30 years ago when it was required for a Japanese anthropology class I was taking in college. This is to alert readers to the fact that it was \\"positioned\\" not as entertainment but as source of insight into Japanese attitudes about various subjects. That is a good thing to bear in mind because while it is an excellent film in terms of acting, cinematography, plot, dialogue, etc. (hence the 5 stars) I suspect many Americans will not find it \\"entertaining.\\" It is so harrowing to watch -- not because of violence but because of heart-rending situations -- that American viewers used to at least a bit of comic relief and/or \\"uplift,\\" even in films billed as tragic, may be squirming. I still get shivers thinking about certain scenes or aspects of the story. Having said all that, I do not wish to give the impression that it is an \\"anthropology lesson\\" -- it is an extremely well-executed film shedding light on some aspects of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie of the Year, 1961","review":"Just as a point of interest, Sansho the Bailiff (Sansho Dayu) was voted movie of the year by the Cahiers du Cinema in 1961. It beat out such classics as Godard's 'A Bout de Souffle', Truffaut's 'Tirez sur le Pianiste', Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Malle's 'Zazie dans le Metro', Ray's 'Party Girl', Losey's 'Time Without Pity', Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita', and Mankiewicz's 'Suddenly Last Summer' among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the greatest movies ever made","review":"The story, script, acting, direction, art direction, black and white cinematography, costumes, sound, music, symbolism, meaning, emotions, i.e., everything in this film is evidence that perfection can be achieved in the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorably tragic","review":"Sansho the Bailiff projects a bleak and depressing view of medieval Japan. The director Kenji Mizoguchi was masterful, providing an authentic and unforgettable immersion into feudal Japan. This Japanese folktale describes the kinds of sacrifices that may have been required to overcome some of humanity's basest instincts, and a sad and mesmerizing story it is. The acting is wonderful, and the music excellent. There are a number of scenes that would likely be startlingly beautiful if shot in color, but fit the starkly tragic mood in black and white. Hopefully this great movie will soon be restored and transferred to DVD. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Then you must find another with an appetite..for INSANITY!\\"","review":"Oh man, you have the Broodwich and THE which is the club of athf ememies!

The author did not actually thru hike but hopped between points - Interviewing and keeping up with certain individuals along the way. When I first started reading the book I was a bit disappointed. You get the feeling of being a dispassionate observer watching a carnival of naive rookies about to \\"hit the trail\\" for a fun time. But as the book progresses the feeling becomes more serious and moving. I would recommend reading Jim Coplan's \\"Wild Bird Song\\" about his personal thru hike from Main to Georgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Season on the Appalachian Trail","review":"This book does contain a lot of information, and I think it gives the reader an idea about what life is like on the Appalachian Trail. But I didn't have that much fun reading it.

I wish more through hikers would write their own story. I am always so happy when I find another such book to read. My favorite so far has been \\"Walking Home\\" by Kelly Winters. I am going to look up \\"Wild Bird Song\\", suggested by an earlier reviewer, right away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, disappointing content","review":"If you're looking for a book from someone who actually has thru hiked the AT, then avoid this at all costs. I was extremely disappointed in the narrative, which is essentially just a jumbled mish-mash of stories culled from AT trail journals. I couldn't believe a publisher would bring out a book with such an extremely misleading title. Lynn Setzer never walked the Appalachian Trail and the style of the book is disjointed, irritating and uninformative. A massive disappointment to anyone who has thru hiked the AT or someday dreams of doing so. I suppose there is some scant merit in the book, and I did actually complete it, but it was a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

This book was a crashing bore and I trust most of you would agree with me. Setzer writes with an amateurish, torturous manner which befits a schoolboy and not a published author. He knows little, if anything, about the AT because he never hiked it himself. He interviewed people who did and writes of their experiences with a detatched air which ultimately infuriates and insults the reader. Consult Coplin's \\"Wild Bird Song\\" for a truly inspiring read. This is dismal droning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and disingenuous look at trail life","review":"This is a poor entry into the Appalachian Trail community library of books. Setzer knows little, if anything, about hiking or thru hiking in particular. The glaring weaknesses show, all too plainly. If you're planning on lacing up and hitting the trail, I don't recommend you buy this book. Walking from Springer Mountain to Katahdin is a joyous, painful, exhilerating and life-changing experience. Setzer never did it and doesn't beging to comprehend what it all entails. The hubris is notable, the writing ability almost nil. Mueser's book remains the best AT thru hikers guide.--------David, AT thru hiker, 1997"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Flash 64 MB unit flash","review":"Have need for it with my Kodak Camera.

It has just bee re-edited, unfortunately I've not heard of an English version of it (it's written in German)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the crayons?","review":"The cover of this booklet alludes to more color artwork inside, which there is not.Although, the poses are repetitive, it does display a wide array of bondage themes.Overall, the black-and-white prints left me feeling as though I were looking through a coloring book for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy one for yourself and one to share...","review":"After reading this book, your views about agriculture will be forever altered. Presented in a high quality, high impact format, the photography offers the reader the chance to see the stark contrast between the products generated by 'power farmers' and that of the 'small farmer' - the true agrarian. Upon opening the book for the very first time, you will be completely engaged; you will be unable to put the book down until you have rummaged through all of the pages. The images will be etched on your brain with a subtle permanence and the accompanying text is just as powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"This is a very simple and easy to use Arabic learning software with a lot of graphics and sounds.

It was extraordinarily difficult to assemble, and one piece of the track has never completely fit into place after repeated attempts. The track does function in this state, however. It is further flimsy and all pieces fall apart easily, the cars' pieces are too delicate for an 8 years old, having fallen off and been stepped on. We couldn't wait to spend hours of fun with this toy, but instead our experience has been more frustration. And then there's the price.

It is particularly encouraging to see LaHaye finally discuss futurism on scholarly grounds, rather than the fictional which has damaged the views' credibility. Regardless of your personal view, this book is a must have and will challenge your misconceptions about futurism, and get you thinking about how to defend or affirm your own views.Gentry's arugments in 'Before Jerusalem Fell\\" and \\"The Beast of Revelation\\" are stripped and exposed as \\"smoke and mirror\\" hermeneutics that grasps at the circumstanstial while dismissing hard evidences, history, and simple logic.Again, this book is a must have for the serious eschatologist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Explosion (Cleopatra)","review":"The best way to describe this CD is to say it's like a krautrock orchestra.A bit similar to the Cosmic Couriers-'Other Places' release.Quite an impressive line-up here.Mani Neumeier of GURU GURU on drums,Moebius of CLUSTER on synthesizer,Chris Karrer of AMON DUUL II on violin and sax,Jurgen Engler of DIE KRUPPS on guitar,Zappi Diermaier(percussion) and Jean Peron on vocals and trumpet.Last two musicians are from FAUST.'Space Explosion' is one of those CD's that get better as it progresses.Which is to say the last three tracks are the best.The listener is pulled into another dimension during \\"Taub\\" and the band's namesake \\"Space Explosion\\".The final cut \\"Krakatau\\" lets you know exactly what this one-time side project is truly capable of.Definitely some brilliant moments present.May be a little to way-out there for some.The label Captain Trip released this title with a bonus track added."},{"rating":"1","title":"And to think this book has ties to Girl Scouts","review":"My children 14 y/o, 12 y/o may be exposed to people with too liberal sexual ideals, but they are NOT interested in these types of visuals. When my children turned 12, I had 'the talk' with them. They both reacted by crying. My boy asked,\\" Why do we need to know this stuff if we're supposed to wait until we're married?,\\" with tears in his eyes. I never saw images such as those in the book until I was out of high school, and I know perfectly well how to have babies. I choose not to indulge in the other things and would much rather those images had never entered my brain in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for preteens...","review":"I personally do not think that I would use this book at all for any age child or teen, but I am very concerned that its \\"recommended\\" age range is 9-12. I wouldn't want my 9-year-old child seeing drawings of naked men and women, learning how to put on a condom, and reading about how scientists are \\"working hard\\" to make the abortion pill available to the general public. This book treats abortion very lightly, making it appear to be something not serious that people do casually, not the life-altering and painful decision that it is. If you really want to use this book at all, I would wait at least until your children enter high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and degrading: Designed for the sexualization of your child","review":"Avoid this book. This book encourages your child to sexually experiment with other children. It is designed to sexualize your preteen. It demonstrates how and encourages masturbation. It encourages homosexual relationships.This books is filled with lewd and explicit sexual content. It contains fully detailed pictures of couples in sexual intercourse. There are about 50 total nude pictures in a 87 page book. This book should be classified as pornography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not age appropriate. Shocking.","review":"I purchased this for my 11 year old son. I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it. The pictures are hand drawn but graphic. Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers. I would be upset to find this in a school library. This book definitely needs to be used with supervision. I returned this book as I believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porno for Kids","review":"I checked out this book for my 17 year old son who was writing a paper on puberty. Most of the text content is great but the pictures are pornographic cartoons. I also have an 11 year old son and was planning on letting him read it. Once I reviewed it, it went straight into my car to be returned to the library. As far as the text goes, most of it was pretty informative and well written for the preteen age group but there were also plenty of references (with lots of pictures) of masturbation, homosexuality, etc. that were way too graphic for anyone under the age of 16 years. Fair warning here: don't buy it for any innocent kids especially ones that don't know anything at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"All I can say is shame on you for rushing our children into areas they are not emotionally ready for. Obvious to me that the author has never seen the \\"normal\\" effects of a teenager who had an abortion. The internal struggle and depression that \\"normally\\" follows. Where are your cartoon pictures of that? Where are the cartoon representations of the child's spirit that is dying while they seek out the \\"normal\\" pleasures this book proscribes. America wake up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shocked","review":"While I agree that the things discussed in this book are important to teach your children I strongly disagree with the graphic nature of the illustrations and some of the content in this book. I have also read that some organizations like Planned Parenthood are pushing this book to be placed in grade school libraries. If this is true I as a parent of a pre-school daughter am OUTRAGED that our public schools are allowing this. I don't believe this is appropriate material for children that young. This is borderline pornography. I also believe parents should be the one to share this information with their children not some teacher with a slanted bias toward some of the content in the book, ie..homosexuality, abortion, how to use a condom, etc. Parents should go to their schools and see if this is happening and voice their opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not prepared for the content","review":"I ordered this book for my 5th grade daughter. The title of this book looked harmless and full of information that I was seeking, so I purchased it. I was not aware that is was considered \\"perfectly normal\\" to engage in homo sexual activities as a part of adolescence. Unfortunately this book was full of other \\"normals\\" that I was not prepared for, let alone comfortable sharing and teaching my 5th grader (or High School student for that matter!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is disgusting","review":"I ordered this from a book club, so I was unable to thumb through it. Had I been, I would not have boughten it! When I was age 10 (heck 17 for that matter), I didn't know what it looked like for two people to have sex or what a man's naked organs look like. I turend out okay. I was a virgin until age 18 and by then I learned enough in high school health class to know about birth control etc.. I agree with what others have said that this is a how-to guide and the pictures are way too graphic for a kid. I also don't see whats wrong with letting our kids be kids a little longer. Do they really need to see this at such a young age. Also, I am against abortion and homosexuality, which this book does nothing but promote!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Information rather than Ignorance","review":"This book is plain speaking, and informative. It is affirming and empowering for children. My 8 year old scans it for answers to specific questions, which we then discuss. My ten year old is reading it more thoughtfully, and finding it a comfortable look at sexuality. Not for people who plan on shielding their children from information, or who have negative valuation of the human body or human sexuality. Excellent for teaching healthy sexuality values!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Subject, Silly Book","review":"Bought this and was very disappointed: the cartoons and illustrations are just plain silly. Some serious content is covered in this book and the accompanying illustrations seem out of place. If a child needs images like that to feel comfortable with the book's subject matter, then they're not ready for reading about it. And if they are mature enough, the images aren't. \\"What's Happening to my Body, for Boys\\" does it better, where it is handled respectfully and maturely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable! Parents read this!","review":"I gave this a one start because of the content. I bought this book because it is being introduced into schools(thankfully not my kids' school YET) and I wanted to know what the school is teaching. It is completly inappropriate for kids! It has details of sex and masturbation being performed in illustrations by kids. This material is VERY inappropriate for 9 and 10 year olds and this it's where the schools are introducing it at. Parents, teach your children what is right ang wrong and when sex is o.k. (after marriage), don't let them be corrupted by the schools with this type of material at such a young age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - lots to discuss with my child","review":"My 11 year old has completely enjoyed this book. When I learned he was going to have sex ed in school in 5th grade, I wanted him to be properly informed ahead of time, and to not be embarrassed to ask questions etc..

It covers everything pre-teens and teens need to know about sexuality, puberty, birth control, STD/HIV, and relationships! Robie Harris tackles this subject with warmth and humor - she understands her audience and your kids will return to this book over and over.Parents will appreciate her tone and the matter of fact way she handles the complex and confusing world of adolescence and puberty. Be sure to read it yourself before handing it off to your kids - while there probably isn't anything you didn't already know, you want to be sure it reflects your values.And remember, this should supplement the ongoing conversations in your family and isn't a replacement for the information and values your kids want and need to learn from you. Especially as they start to date and sexual activity is truly on the horizon.

In short, the sellers use of \\"Very Good\\" is in my opinion a gross distortion of the truth. The Video has a lot of hash at times and the picture jumps and waves. It is a good thing that it was not very costly, but I strongly disagree with its representation as \\"Very Good\\".

Especially with 80's bands, those first few are often their best work, plus your nostalgia and loyalty often make it difficult to truly appreciate later work. However, with \\"Bigger Than America\\", I can honestly say that this is my favorite Heaven 17 album. I've had it for almost two years now and it has rarely left my CD player for the shelf. The textures, lyrics, melodies, and harmonies of almost every song are a credit to the staying power of the three members of the group. From the sultry way Martyn Ware says \\"Dive\\" on the opening number to the dance songs of \\"We Blame Love\\" and \\"Freak\\" to the chilling lyrics of \\"Bigger Than America\\"...I could list every song and compliment the songwriting and vocal talent of the band. I swear you will not be disappointed with this album. I can only hope they will continue in this vein for another record...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks","review":"After reading the reviews here, I bought this album. After discovering that the disc itself is unplayable on an Apple computer (some sort of rubbish copy protection in the disc) I managed to hear it on a car stereo. Apart from 2 really good songs, this album is dated and awful. Instead of sticking to the Heaven 17 sound, they have tried to emulate every crappy house/dance style of that 1996/1997 era. It sounds like a cheap rubbish Corona album or something of that ilk. Oh dear, I'm VERY disappointed. The thing about these 80's bands who were pioneers once, is that they no longer are the trend setters or the ground breakers. They are mearly emulating old garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make em like that anymore!","review":"This is a truly wonderful work!

In his earlier works he showed such drive and determination, if you can find them try \\"Slam the Bass\\", \\"Rock the Guitar\\", or \\"I Love You Like Crumbcakes\\" some earlier treats where Abel truly began to spread his musical wings. I think that the criticism about Abel \\"selling out\\" may have a little truth to it, lately he has been wearing flashy gold medallions and rings, I also heard he was considering doing a duet with Billy Joel. \\"Whats up wit dat?\\"In the end Bang the Drum is still a solid little number, Abel manages to stay two steps ahead of the competition, but he really needs to pick up the pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book available on surgical technique in rat models","review":"This book describes almost every experimental procedure for animal handling and tissue collection possible in rats, from orchidectomy to thymectomy.

I looked at Azn and found everything was going for 6$ or more shipped in a couple of days. I went to the hardware store around the corner and picked up a Westinghouse Halogen J-Type Double Ended 500W bulb for 3$ and it works perfectly. My lamp says use 500W bulb to prevent fire hazard. So I did. Many of the bulbs at Azn are only 300W. Good luck! Years ago I had one of these torchere lamps go aflame at the bulb. Fortunately, I saw it instantly - cut off the electricity swiftly, and the flame died that moment. It was a miracle? Probably, given what the light was shining on at the time!

Forget what the pop music and shock rock industry tell you is gothic, this is the real thing. It's beautiful and poetic by conveying a feeling of darkness and hopelessness. This music is groovy with medieval undertones! If you're like me and think the Sisters of Mercy are good but need to have recorded a bit more fast paced music in their time then you will love this. Snake Dance is a classic song. By the way for those of you who like gothic style music and are new to the scene also check out The Cure, Joy Division, and March Violet fans, Children on Stun (all great British bands who wrote or still write meaningful and emotional music)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun little movie.","review":"I adore Takeshi Kaneshiro so I buy all his movies when they come out on region one.

It's a decent movie, odd casting for his mother though, but honestly if I didn't adore Takeshi (not only looks but his acting as well) I wouldn't have spent so much for the DVD. I wasn't disappointed though. It's a feel good movie with a lesson learned in the end and the cast is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking gadget but awful sound","review":"I bought this as a replacement for my other voice recorder that I lost in school. The sound quality is very inferior compared to my old Olympus. It is advertised as stereo but there is only one mic input. So, what you hear in your left ear is the same as in your right, no stereo imagery. Plus, Sony's DVF file sucks.

I now have it sitting in my CD case collecting dust... I own one other CD by the Monkees that was live in concert from 1967. It had the Banter with the auduence, as well as music too. Sorry Rick but you need to add some laughs or fan interaction with the music. Take a cue from the Monkees and add fun to it too... Hearing the crowds makes it more exciting.... Sorry to say that the disc is a clean miss on that point... The Garbled sounds are most noticable when he is singing on some of the songs... If I had to give it stars, I guess that one would be it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high energy CD with all the hits, ALIVE!","review":"If you are a Rick Springfield fan, either moderately or fanatically, you absolutely must get this CD. What a performer! Each song seems to have a brand new feel to it, more hard driving guitar playing with an edge. You can hear the craziness from the fans during each song as they sing along with him. A couple of my all time favorites, \\"Rock of Life\\" and \\"State of the Heart\\" are on the CD and Rick has made these new versions blow away the studio versions of these singles! In fact, you can make that statement for most of the songs on here, and those songs were great before. If I were to make another highlight, it would have to be \\"I've Done Everything for You\\" and \\"Love is Alright Tonight\\". One very minor complaint,\\"Souls\\", a Springfield concert classic isn't on here, but there are 20+ songs that more than make up the difference. One would be hard pressed to show me a better live CD than this one and I have a bunch of them, this is the one to get!

I can't wait to go out and get the street version of this CD! that's how GREAT this CD is you have to grab all the versions you can of it.So if you have been to any of the Rick Springfield concerts (past or present) or just a fan of his music don't EVEN think about getting around to buying this CD...JUST DO IT!!

Also, in my country his back catalogue was never reissued on CD, so it's very expensive to buy imports.SO, I decided to gamble and buy this ALIVE album, without any expectations, just to know the guy's music a little bit more, know what the fuss is all about... I was not dissapointed at all! This is a very energetic rockin' band, Rick sings better that a lot of young rocksingers half his age. There are good solos, the songs have amazing hooks (without sounding corny or cheesy), the band is tight.I also appreciated the honesty of the guy, because, in the notes, he admits that some overdubs were made in the studio, and even whole songs were recorded \\"live\\" in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the GREATEST HITS ALIVE!!!!!","review":"Full of energy.

They are \\"hosted\\" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures. I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc. Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester. Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly - in the early 1980's.

It has a good sound and is a handsome instrument. The softcase included is nothing terribly special, but it's adequate.On the minus side, the first minor issue is that the included cable is kind of flimsy.The more annoying issue is that two of the tuners won't hold an adjustment well. It's not quite bad enough for me to return it.

His reading lacks imagination, but it gets a splashy recording that pops out all of Bartok's luscious sonorities. The real attraction here are the unusual couplings, a crisp Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion from husband and wife Robert and Caby Casadesus (pulled from the Sony catalog now that Sony and BMG are one in the classical department), and a generous sampling of Barrtok's piano music in the 8 Improvisations from Charles Rosen. These latter two recordings are better than Ormandy's contribution, but he is more than respectable, and the Philadelphia Orch. is amply virtuosic, needless to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"Very disappointed in this product.

I consider an extract to be in liquid form only, but this liquid has a lot of fine particles in it as if the hops was boiled in water and strained through a leaky strainer.

(This ties as my favorite of the line with the Peppermint Soap.) The Lemon Butter Cuticle Cr��me is not greasy, waxy, overly smelly, or disagreeable in any way. It is, as far as I can tell, perfect. I was a cosmetologist in my younger years and have tried many cuticle products. This is the best I have ever used. The scent is very soft, and it is great for both fingers and toes.

The Suave lotion is much cheaper and easier to use, but it also leaves my hands feeling greasier than this stuff. Still, I know the cheaper Suave lotion was helping me solve my hangnail problem.

In short, a dull, depressing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elves are jolly grand fun!","review":"Mercedes Lackey handles elves like no one else. She's always fun and entertaining. The SERRAted edge books are some of my favorites (though the first one was slightly inferior). Wheels of Fire is anothe prime crazy-elves book--but it was unfinished. Though one of the character's lives is traced into Chrome Circle, which I actually read before this one, the rest seem to be dropped. I expect a sequel. It's always a sequel...but all the character build up led to a disappointing flop in the end. I wanted to see more from Cindy, more from Jamie, more from Bob, more from Al, more from Frank, more from Joe! The ending felt hurried, as if Misty was on a tight deadline and realized it a chapter away from the book's conclusion. The only character I was even partially satisfied with in the end was Sarah, a ghost.So, I would say that this book is good, and definitely worth a read (or five), but not Lackey's best, and requires a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HISTORY OF BAND","review":"Lots of great quotes here: \\"The whole album's kinda mad...\\", \\"that's a drag\\" Great insight to the band.

That being said,I did not enjoy this work as much as I did his previous works. One reason might be that I read Decisive Day, The Winter Soldiers and Saratoga before I knew much about the Revolutionary war, and I have read a lot of other books since then. I didn't really feel as though I learned anything new in Victory at Yorktown. It gives a brief account of the campaign in the Carolinas and Arnold's treason before delving into Yorktown. The description of the battle, and the Naval engagements prior to, seemed to lack any emotion or excitement. The personal accounts he provides are really the same ones that every other book about the revolution gives. This could be a good book for those reading about the later stages of the war for the first time, however those who are well read on the subject may want to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Inaccurate","review":"A disappointing rehash of early works on the 1781 Siege of Yorktown. Half the book deals with the southern campaign of the American Revolution. The portion of the book dealing with Yorktown strays greatly from the chronological happenings of the siege. For example, the author starts detailing the story of the assaults on redoubts 9 and 10, which occurred on the night of October 14th. Before completing the account of the assaults, he jumps to the sortie by the British on the night of October 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts. A better choice for those wanting to read about the siege is Henry P. Johnston's book on the Yorktown Campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boots at a great price!!","review":"Bought these boots for my husband and he loves them...comfortable immediately and very nice quality, especially for the VERY reasonable price!!

It does not coordinate with the lessons. You have to dig around in it trying to find what you're looking for. I could go on and on. I'm very glad I got mine as an overstock.

It might have some applications for people who have ADHD and can't concentrate on a book or a Pimsleur lesson, but any serious language learner will find this program, with its idiotic sound effects, its more or less incomprehensible sound graphs, and its laborious manner of arriving at the point, a pure waste of time.

Readers should understand though, that before I started with the software, I had taken 150 hours of lessons from Berlitz & had been living in Germany for 6 months. So that being said, I cannot speak to how well this product will work for extreme beginners. This product helped me expand my vocabulary, practice my speaking, improve my grammar and learn more about the country in which I am living.

Compiled as an afterthought (post break-up), the disc has very little to offer if you're not a die-hard fan/colletor. The early demos are interesting at best. The live material is recorded poorly, and the in-between song banter is suprisingly pedestrian for such a seasoned band. The \\"experimental\\" songs are simply random sounds recorded in someone's garage before 45 Grave really came into their own.

The use of pluralis in the title led me to believe that it would describe different approaches on writing Forth kernels. How wrong I was.First, there is some generic explanation of how a Forth works. The writing is incredibly tedious and mundane compared to other Forth literature (e.g. Leo Brodie, Brad Rodriguez). Also the typesetting is on the verge of horrible -- how anyone could choose a filled black square to represent white-space is beyond me.The greater part of the book contains a listing of a generic Z80 Forth.

Winnicott is writing for a very select group of people: other psychoanalysts.Nowadays, the majority of people in our society consider Freud to be a joke. While Winnicott does not agree with Freud about everything, he's Freudian enough for me to have trouble taking him seriously. His work seems old and outdated.Winnicott writes his theory in a way which makes it sound complex and important. In actuality, it is extremely simple and could be summed up in a few sentences.

However, the CD cover inside does not tell you that JLP is only on the first track, does not credit the musician featured on the other three tracks and leads you to believe (by the title) that it is all JLP.

There are plenty of events and characters and conflict, but they are not conveyed in a way to make me believe them or care that much, to experience them in some particular way. Two characters meet and suddenly they are in love. One character gets angry with another, and this is described as \\"He felt like hitting Dominic, or choking him until his anger went away.\\" Wow. That sentence makes me sense and understand the character's deep emotions. Not.... The novel is filled with very perfunctory characterization.

Thus, this idea of linking his name to the Rights of Man is a contradiction.If Dumas Malone must continue on this track, then he should mention the names of John Adams, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Abraham Lincoln, and we shall listen to him.

Who CARES about the graphics. If this was a 8-bit or 16-bit game, I'd still play it. Yes, graphics are repetative, but what makes up for that is the amazing battle system. I played Kingdom Hearts, and the battle system is similar to it, but it isn't. You can't lock onto monsters, the only way to aim attacks is if you are within attacking range (which is right in front of the monsters basically).

It was hard in the beginning though. I had no idea what to do. A hint for people who are going to play the game is to use data drain alot.

But my peole are really strong now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a New Way to Play....","review":"This game at first, threw me for a loop. Since I had never played an on-line game, and the way this game approaches the on-line games is really great. You level up, and use magic and have dungeon crawls, just like any other RPG, but when you beat the game, your data is saved in a special file for download for the new installment. The game play is pretty easy to figure out, you just need to watch the areas to where you warp. You can be killed INSTANTLY!The dungeons are pretty straight forward, but you also have monster all over the area surrounding the dungeons...A great opportunity to level up fast. I was a level 30 before I knew it! I believe this game will become as great saga like the Final Fantasy Series is. I would definitely recommend this game to any RPGer's out there.

You can read the board, recieve and send E-mails, characters talk about their outside life breaking character.

And basicly it sucks you roght into the game so you cant stop but otherwise I love this game alot i really like the very deatailed graphics and everything else about it!

I'm one of those kids who sits around in the bookstore reading the manga. So I thought even if the game wasn't so good, I could deal with it. Right? Uh. No.I forced myself to play for about two hours. The graphics were insanely bad, the voice acting made me squirm, and the dungeons were just horrible. There were a couple of intriguing concepts in it, which could've been awesome if handled right - as it is, I think they ultimately take away from the game. For instance, the idea of picking words to shape a custom dungeon was really cool, but maybe if they hadn't done that they would've been able to spend more time on actually making the dungeons interesting and playable. Also, being a total Warcrack addict, I liked the idea of a simulated MMORPG, but after a while reading the stuff on the forums to get new words and hints and stuff just gets tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, repetitive, and how many more do I have to buy???","review":"Wow. I was thuroughly disappointed with this game. I feel lucky I am going to sell it to a friend for a fraction of what i paid for this.The story is spotty, the graphics are soooo 4 years ago (hehe), the gameplay is boring and repetitive and the game is so short that an introductory price to this INSTALLMENT of the whole game should be around $20. If you paid full price, for this game, and the rest in the series, I hope you have a fat bank account.With the lackluster graphics being so cheap looking, found and won items being uninteresting or not useful until you buy another game in the series, I have to say I want to WARN everyone that you do not get what you paid for.If you are one of those who are happy with this game: good. I'm not... so off to Target to buy Final Fantasy Unlimited Saga. Final Fantasy series, not that's a REAL game.Blah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheats","review":"This is the best Game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so im going to tell you guys some secert's. If you go into a room were you break open stuff, you can always get back in and redo it.

But still it deserves absolute 5 out of 5 stars. Some people say it has [bad] graphics but I don't it's graphic is that bad compared to other ps2 games and I don't mind the graphic. But the only weakness is that the whole game is divided in to 4 really short CD's, and that means the whole thing costs whopping $...

I happily shelled out the money for Parts 1 and 2, and while they are short if one plays directly through, I spend a lot of time exploring, which has always been my favorite part of playing RPGs. More than anything, I love the World. Yes, it's repetitive... but I think that's what I like about it. It's like playing a MMORPG, only without rude people and PKs.If you're an old-school gamer (my first RPG was Dragon Warrior on Nintendo, followed closely by the original Final Fantasy), you'll probably like this.

Then you will tell me that these laws of Nature are a penal code that can be violated, and that sodomy is just such a violation. Well, if the laws of Nature can be violated, then just how do you violate the law of Gravity? Can you choose to ignore gravity by a simple act of will-power, floating up into the sky? OF COURSE NOT! The laws of Nature cannot be violated as if they were a penal code. Everything that exists is ipso facto natural. Please don't give me the old \\"carrot in the ear\\" argument.

Satinover's hateful agenda is exposed by his reliance on bad science to prove his case. He repeats the lie about gay males dying, on average, in their forties. (A fine debunking of this, by Andrew Sullivan, ran in The New Republic and is available on the web.) It's fine if you want to read or write an anti-gay screed -- welcome to the land of free expression -- but to disguise it as science or medicine is to do a disservice to both, as well as to the author's dubious cause.

Gee, somebody should have told raging queen Quentin Crisp, recently deceased at age 90, that he'd taken up two gay men's average lifespans all by his little old lonesome. Satinover's other book postulates that there is a hidden computer code in the text of the Bible.That should tell you all you need to know about the scientific integrity of his data.

They might sing a far more tolerant tune if they'd bother to open their minds to the real fact that other people's sexual preference should be nobody else's business. It's an issue of biology; not of politics, and certainly not of religion.

In case you don't know, Ms Knight claims to be channeling Ramtha, a 35,000-year-old enlightened teacher from Atlantis. Really!

It occurs cross-culturally throughout history at about 10% of the population. It occurs naturally in every higher animal species. It is immutable. If you are gay, skip this text and try \\"Coming Out of Shame\\"--written by two real psychiatrists with some sense of the scientific method (which, incidentally, was developed by Descartes who used it to proove that God exists).

If a sophomore were to hand any of this to me as a \\"scientific paper\\", I would fail him: the contortion of data is so severe at times that it verges on delusional. Dr. Satinover is on a mission and is unable to admit it; he has provided a case study of how socially moulded fear (homophobia) can be used to impair perception and cognition. His section on genetics, among others, made me bug-eyed in disbelief. Spare yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read Book","review":"The first half of the book, which deals with the medical and psychological aspects of homosexuality, as well as with the political (not scientific) pressure behind the 1973 APA decision to drop homosexuality from its DSM, is great. The second half, a quick presentation of secular and faith-based treatments, is welcome. The chapter on orthodox Judaism and homosexuality is illuminating, but the last chapter, on the pagan and gnostic roots of today's post-modern polymorphic code of ethics, is downright phenomenal, arguably deserving its own book and certainly alone worth the price of this one.The author clearly has a lot of compassion for homosexuals, but very little patience with homosexual activists. Once you read the book, you'll understand why.Considering the centrality of homosexuality in today's culture war, this book should be in your top-five list of books to read.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone must read this book!","review":"This book would have been a masterpiece had the author not talked about religion and God, which, in my opinion, are nothing more than sophisticated and very popular forms of superstition. I think that may have tragically made a number of people resentful toward the book as a whole. It would have been better if every mention of the word \\"religion\\" throughout the book were replaced by the words \\"common sense\\". The thing to remember when reading this book is that if you don't agree with everything, do NOT take the entire book to be wrong. There is also another book that is very similar to this one and just as good - *The Myopia Myth: The Truth about Nearsightedness And How to Prevent It*."},{"rating":"1","title":"An angry little book full of error and distortion","review":"This book is quite ridiculous.

So if anyone out there is having difficulty accepting the social fact of homsexuality, I would say to you- there is a better way forward. In involves accepting people's basic humanity, and the diversity of human experience. The alternative is the vile hatred espoused in a book like this.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV), the Bible of the psychiatric, psychological, and sociological world, clearly states homosexuality to be completely normal and in no way is in need of any sort of medical treatment to \\"cure\\" it. This book is at best outdated science with a right wing bias, and at worst a fundamentalist opinion parading as junk science.

I gave it two stars because the author and publisher did not make this clear on the book jacket - - in order to sell books, of course - - and they only printed the other edition after having received a lot of flack from critics and book stores, which had too many returned because buyers could not understand the material.

So then people started buiding their own little cars. Next came racing. There were three kinds of racing. First came sprint racing.They would race on a one mile track. Second came Super Kart racing. They would go on a three to four mile track with twist and turns. Third came Ice Racing, the cars would have nails stiking out of the tires so when they raced around the track it would give them grip. Super kart racing is different because 1 to 20 cars could race.

The songs are held together by the sincere and emotive voice of Mark Hawks, which helps set The Prophetess apart from other 90s goth bands.The songs range from danceable, full-force goth rock anthems (notable tracks include \\"Embrace My Love\\" and the unique, guitar riff-based \\"Destiny Never Forsake\\") to lighter, acoustic guitar ballads like \\"Sylvia\\".The whole album is very consistent, flows well, and definitely surpasses a majority of similar 90s goth bands in both style and emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURELY amazing!","review":"i saw this band with hyland last summer and they were amazing, and great live might i add.

His other great hate, for Richard Valley of Scarlet Street Magazine, is so extreme as to become cartoonish, and impossible to take seriously.

While the book was largely free of errors in grammar, spelling and punctuation, that is where my good review must unfortunately end. Mr. Ferry spends so much time slinging mud at those who bore him no ill will that it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the book. He truly knows how to destroy a heroic ideal by painting our idols as petty backstabbers, whose only crime was to take a different opinion than the author.

This book is Ferry's revenge and also a another money making venture. He even plans to write a sequal to it. Besides the obvious money making motive, the purpose was to snipe at many individuals legitimately working hard to promote the Horror/Sci-fi genre. In the meantime Famous Monsters magazine is in jeopardy, as a US Bankruptcy Judge declared that Ferry fraudulently tranferred the magazine's assets to protect them from creditors.I urge readers not to subsidize Ferry's unethical behavior.

A very cool slice of fan fiction meets originality. I will have to admit that although the characters were all great and the story was amazing, it was a little less than what I am used to reading. The story was a little slower than I like. Although it had all of the gore that I love and need, the last few chapters were a little less than desired. At the last minute a lot of new characters got added and suddenly became hard to follow because they had way too many characters running a muck all at the same time. It was cool though because most of them died, but I think it was a little much.

The 'Clickers' and other monsters were as original and refreshingly brutal as any alien, zombie, werewolf, or vampire. The characters were highly developed, believable, and dispensable. This book didn't take long to hit the ground running, and once the action got going, it never let up. The pages practically turned themselves.

I have read 'Confessions of a Movie Addict', and as a critic myself, I can proudly assure you that Betty Jo Tucker is one of the finest critics out there and a person who flat-out loves the movies, from the good to the bad.

I found that this exam was very similar to the actual PPST I took, and my score on the practice exam was a good indicator of my score on the real exam. However, this book is not good if you need a thorough review of the material. It skims over things and does not go into too much detail. I needed a lot of math review and this book did not help too much with that. I also bought the Barron's book and thought that one was great for the review but mediocre on the practice tests (that one did have 3 though and this book only has one, but it is an actual old exam). So if you are taking the PPST definitely buy this book but also buy a good one for a review. For that I would recommend Barrons. I got a 186 on the math and 184 on the reading and am still waiting for the writing. I owe my good scores to these two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great overall review","review":"Very thorough in reviewing reading, writing and math.

Their greatest impact may be in their advice to parents on creating healthy nutritional habits for families - a not so hidden message in this era of rampant childhood obesity.

As always, his technical skills are extraordinary - each note sounds clearly, his articulation is perfect even on almost Bird-like runs taken at lightening speed, his ballad playing maintains just the right balance between speed and emotion. The distinguishing characteristic of this album is the extraordinary empathy between Raney and his sidemen, and the complexity of the harmony and counterpoint that they create. When he's not soloing, Raney voices his guitar like a second or third horn, playing intelligent single note harmonies and countermelodies while the horns have the lead. His note choices in these instances are flawless - it's obvious that he was really paying attention during his time in Woody Herman's big band, because this small group sounds really big most of the time.This recording is an extradinary example of musicianship at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORKBOOK, NOT THE TEXTBOOK!","review":"I thought I bought the textbook until I received it!

You need to unscrew the cap to use the lighter, which could be problematic. Unfortunately, my first dozen attempts to get a flame failed. I had to turn down the fuel almost all the way down before it caught. Once it caught, I realized that it wasn't really a torch-like flame as was the Coleman. It's more of a Bic-like candle flame. That was really disappointing as I can use the Coleman almost like a pencil. A torch-like flame is also cooler to the hands because the flame is more directed and you can also use it upside-down or on its side.

The only drawback is that you need to hold the button half-way down jfor about a second before depressing it all the way to ignite the fuel, otherwise, it doesn't light. No biggy.

(hello, splinter cell demo!)The magazine itself is a wicked great read; all of the editors have distinctly cool personalities and game preferences. In the year that i've been reading, i've gotten to know all of their gaming preferences and feel i can trust their reviews of the games i'm looking for advice on.to sum up my feelings on the magazine: i'm always excited when i get a new one, i always read it from cover to cover, i'm always sad when i finish the last page, i'm always waiting for the next one, and i've never been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DEMO DISC!

My first issue just came with NO DEMO DISC, and after calling Future (the subscription service provider) I was informed that the only way to get the Demo Disc is to either pay an extra dollar per issue over the phone, or have my amazon subscription canceled, and a new one started directly through them. Of course you have to pay again, and wait 4-6 weeks for a refund check for the original subscription.In summary:1 year subscription of magazine from Amazon = $24.951 year subscription of magazine AND DEMO DISC from Official Xbox Magizine website = $24.95You fail Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest delivery time EVER","review":"I ordered this subscription close to 2 months ago but have yet to get the first Issue.

That's exactly two whole months I've been waiting for it.I know that Amazon thinks it will come somewhere between July 15th and August 12th, but it's pretty painful going to the store every week and see the issues that I should have at home, sitting on the shelf with all the other latest magazines. It baffles me on what could be taking so long, I got Nintendo Power a few days after I ordered it and that was ordered on the same date.I have checked the mail everyday, patiently waiting, having my stride back from the mailbox end with heart-break for two whole months.Maybe this will give OXM some motivation.

I wish ALL the gamer magazine's also did this. The European version's of other gamer magazine's come with demo disc.?

So this was a great price but never got it yet...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an OK Magazine","review":"This magazine is a below average magazine. It seems to definately be geared towards the younger crowd because pictures constitute about 80% of it. Reviews can range from an OK length to a couple of paragraphs with 1 1/2 of those paragraphs babling about some random thing. While many magazines promise something in the next issue and actually deliver it, this magazine does not deliver it 95% of the time making them very unreliable. Their reviews are also very biased and nowhere near objective. If one game has X and then another game has all X has and a couple of more features, the second game can still get a worse review. Although it is a 'fun' magazine, it is poorly written and laid out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrives with no plastic and no CD!","review":"I purchased this magazine for my son for Christmas. He has subscribed to this magazine before, but I chose to purchase through Amazon. It arrived in February, and every issue has not had any plastic covering it, and none have been accompanied by the regular demo CD. My thought is that it must be going through another party and having it read and taken apart, then mailed to us. I've tried to write to Amazon about this problem, but no reply. I do not recommend purchasing this magazine directly through this vendor, but directly from the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good deal...","review":"Normally I hate magazine's, however, I got some ridiculous deal on this - something like $6 for a year. So I jumped on it. The demo discs that the magazine comes with are fun - but sometimes useless/uninteresting. The magazine itself has some great pictures and well written articles. I won't pay the $25 for a 1 year renewal, however, I will probably buy it through Amazon again when it goes on a random sale. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a Disk too much price for it!!!","review":"I can't believe that a magazine like \\"XBOX Official XBOX Magazine\\" does not come with its disk.

I had a one year subscription with the dvd, when I received a damaged issue and a broken dvd that could not be played on the 360, I was denied a claim for a replacement. I'm sorry but if the sole purpose of a magazine subscription service is to get me undamaged magazines then this business fails on all fronts. Aside from not receiving an undamaged issue, I wasted weeks of e-mailing back and forth over this which was an utter waste of time. If you like wasting your time and getting damaged magazine issues then feel free to subscribe with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Horrible Service","review":"When I bought my Xbox 360, there was a 'One free issue' thing for OXM, which I sent in to see how it was. The magazine's content itself is relatively horrible. The writer's lack creativity and humor. The reviews are useless. I couldn't stand to read much of the content. The discs the game comes with are pretty pointless as well.To top that off, their claim that the free issue had 'no obligations' was BS, as they keep sending me notices to pay for a year's subscription.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.

I really enjoy the in-depth reviews (even if I don't always agree). But it is in the exclusives and previews where OXM shines!I know you can get more, up-to-date info online and perhaps more content. But there is both more credibility in printed documents and I find better in-depth analysis. Dependant on the site, you never know what your are really getting online and often I find the articles drab and un-informative (save for a few stellar sites I won't name here).I got this for like $12 for the whole year after I bought a game on Amazon. I single issue on the news stand goes for $10. I usually buy 3-5 OXM per year...so I already saved money :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"Like the other reviewers have noted, the fine folks who first posted this item conveniently neglected to mention the disc wasn't included.

In fact, I re-read the description to make certain I hadn't missed that fact, but now realize that there wasn't mention that this subscription came without the demo disk. I've contacted the magazine directly, cancelled the order placed through Amazon, and ordered directly from X-Box Magazine in order to get the demo disk. For our family, that demo disk is a very important part of the magazine.

Only thing is I think the magazine is sent to someone else's house first then its reshipped to me. The white box used by OXM has never had my name in it which is kinda strange.

Yet, at times I get bored with it's writing style. They don't make it that fun to read, sometimes its too silly to read, at other times it's written with too much depth, to where it bores you. Plus, it doesn't have any good features (special stories) in it, they are all stupid or boring, with the only good one being in the first issue (the one about the perfect XBox setup, and the XBox set-up quiz).Why two stars then? The reviews are actually well written, and are truthful, and I trust them. So, if all you want are interesting reviews, try this magazine, but if you want to know about other things without getting too bored, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of useless jibberish","review":"DO NOT subscribe to this magazine!!

The articles aren't that great and usually all things you already know about future games from reading websites on the internet. XBOX live has great video reviews too that by the time you get this mailed to you is all old news. Basically I was hoping that to compensate for the fact that they are mailing you something vs. instant info you get online they would have exclusive content, especially on the CD, but that's not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service...","review":"I finally got my first issue, 86 days after I ordered and well past the estimated delivery date. I can understand problems that arise or unexpected delays but what makes matters worse is ZERO customer service support... I used amazon's message system to send the publisher a message 15 days ago and I never got any response or help. Sent another 4 days ago and I sent one to amazon customer service at the same time and as of yet no response from either. I guess the email support is just for show and they don't actually respond???Hopefully this has been sorted out now and come this time next year I will have actually received 12 issues because my start issue was supposedly August and the first issue I got was October. I would be a little more angry if I didn't only spend $5 even though I don't think the price I paid should matter, I couldn't imagine paying full price for this level of service anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXM w/DVD","review":"I'm sure this is a good magazine, but I haven't received my first issue yet.

I ordered the PlayStation Official Magazine, at the same time I ordered this. So far I have gotten two issues of PlaySation Official Magazine, while I didn't receive any OXM yet. So until I get my first issue, my rating of 1 star will stand. Which is sad because I'm sure the magazine is worth 4 or 5 stars.On the bright side, at least it was only $5 and not $30 or whatever they charge for a yearly subscribtion. The down side is, it feels like they just stole $5 dollars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still havn't gotten it!","review":"I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend in June and it still has not come.

The good thing is that dosent have too many advertisings, took me some months to receive my first issue, after that the others haven't arrived in prompt time oh well, the magazine comes with a DVD including a demo, reviews and arcade old games.

All this after numerous calls and e-mails to Future's abysmal customer service. Each time I was assured that everything was fine, and the magazine was on its way.

The writing is poor and seems like it id there just to fill the pages. I have subscibed from the begining and it has gotten better since they lost a lot of the original staff. The game disk is ok. Sometimes there is downloadable content, which is cool.

Clogged my pores! My forehead broke out, and that's very uncommon for me.2. The smell is terrible. Moisturizer doesn't need to be so strongly perfumed.3.

(Even one as bold as to claim a Sephora employee commented that everyone she questioned with beautiful skin attributed it to Olay.) Blogs elsewhere have more objective, varied reviews, and I strongly recommend researching those before purchasing. No skin care product works perfectly for every consumer, and this item is no different. While I appreciate the light, whipped feel and subtle scent, the \\"luminosity\\" in the cream cakes into the few fine lines I have (I'm 27). After applying it, my husband thinks I have dry skin flaking on my face. Overall, the product is mid-range for me, but I am offended by Olay's attempt to mislead consumers with fake reviews, as I rely on honest consumer reviews to help me make informed purchases. As a result, I will not again purchase skin care products from Oil of Olay or its parent company, Proctor & Gamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE ME SICK!","review":"I was really exited to try this product after reading the reviews.

Unfortunately the odor does not dissipate as you would expect. Why produce a working product for only the smallest percentage of women who prefer a call-girl aroma?

I was in the company of a couple that has remained fascinating through most of the books this author has written: Deborah and Simon St. James. They introduced me to a new set of acquaintances that proved challenging. The author gave me the human condition --- the lies we live; the masks we wear; the sorrows, triumphs, accomplishments and disasters we humans encounter. This trip into the pages of \\"A Place of Hiding\\" was less about a police investigation, less about a murder, and more about the \\"why\\" of murder. This story is not a techno-thriller, no police procedural, nor a non-stop, page-turning chase. It is about what people do and why they do it......It's a great book. I loved it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon and Deborah go wild in Guernsey !","review":"Oh dear -has Elizabeth George run out of stream ! - what a convuluted story with subplots that are neither interesting nor useful in helping us understand who murdered Gut Brouard.

Deborah and St James make such an unconvincing pair who clearly should not be at the helm in solving this murder - in fact by the end of the book I was hoping St James might murder Deborah who was making such a hash of protecting her friend China who stands accused of killing Mr Brouard!An awful plot that took so long to end - what a shame as i love her other books . I missed Havers and Linley ."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEB THE WHINER!!","review":"I have been an avid fan of Ms. George's book from the very beginning and can't believe this is her third bad book in a row.I never could stand Deb, everybody puts up with her whining and treats her like a spoiled child, well she does act like one. I like Simon and she was so mean to him in this book. The scene where she stalked away from him and he limped after her, in order to finish a conversation, really really made me see red!

Her prior books have been riveting page-turners that kept me up all night and then gave me nightmares when I finally went to sleep. This book, in stark contrast, was, in a word, dull. I got about half way through it, and skimmed the rest. The characters were both boring and improbable, and there were no flashes of intriguing domesticity to hold my interest. The relationship between Simon and Deborah is absurd; not only does their marriage seem doomed, as far as I can tell there was never any reason to imagine that it could have been anything else.This is a poorly thought-out, poorly conceived, and poorly written book. I hope that Ms George can redeem herself in her next book; otherwise, it will the last one I buy in hardback (or, indeed, at all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliver us from Deborah!","review":"Thought it was only me that wanted to be rid of Deborah. She's a teeth-grating whiney act to take in small sub-plots - since she couldn't carry a tea tray, it's no mystery she couldn't carry this plot, such as it was. I doggedly read on, hoping that Deb would somehow be written out of future Georges -- alas, no. Nothing about her is believable or sympathtic - please, no more of her and her self-pitying blather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved every one of her prior books, so much so that I couldn't wait for the next one. Maybe if you remove all the interplay, soul searching and second guessing that goes on between Simon and Deborah the book would have been close to her usual storytelling. I felt like I was being prepared for these two characters to get a divorce. Certainly, if they bored each other as much as they bored me, divorce is where they are headed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor showing","review":"Elizabeth George is generally a top-notch writer, but A Place of Hiding is an unfortunate exception. The plot was extremely disjointed, and so contrived that at the story's conclusion, very little of the set-up actually made logical sense. George's heretofore tight prose has given way to high school level analogy. Readers looking for the further adventures of Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers will be disappointed to note that Lynley appears only peripherally, and Havers not at all. Simon & Deborah spearhead this investigation (most improbably), dragging with them the detritus of their marriage, a relationship which is now beyond boring.Truly a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less would have been more","review":"When Eliz. George is very good she is the best, but when she is wordy and unedited we all suffer. Surely, someone at her publishing house could have helped the author cut this book by one third. Not only because she become redundant and tedious, but because the flimsy plot does not bear the weight of so much verbiage. In fact, the plot does not really gel -- the pieces begin to come together -- until page 487. Even die-hard George fans are bound to find this one both too much and not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm the sort of reader who must at all costs finish a book, once bought. I am struggling to do so with this one, and I've been a big fan of George. The plot is flat, the characters are flat, and the writing is flat. I get the feeling that George lost interest in this early on (assuming it was she who wrote it, it's far below the caliber of her earlier books). The main protagonists are cliche children of a cliche California tree hugger, Deborah and Simon St James are even more bland and excessively considerate of each other than usual, and everyone is in the throes of childhood traumas tenuously related to the plot (such as it is). And I don't particularly care what happens to any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth George's Latest--This fan is disappointed.","review":"As a great admirer of Elizabeth George novels, I was very disappointed in her latest effort. Too much description,too wordy, too much repetition. Overkill on the foreshadowing, Paul's rucksack for example--we got it already! When I did finally get interested in finding out \\"whodunit\\", it had taken too long to get there (well over halfway), and once the plot was revealed, it was quite lacking in logic and believeability.I will definitely try again. Hopefully, Ms. George will be back in form with her usually interesting and clever tales with witty and intelligent dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"EG in Hiding","review":"Clearly Ms. George researched her setting, and provided some intriguing characterizations. Unfortunately we are stuck with looking through the eyes of Deborah and Simon. I don't understand how such an innovative and creative writer like EG can continually feed us this pablum of a relationship between Simon and Deborah. Yes she is very whiney as others have mentioned. And frankly I don't get it. What is EG trying to tell us? Why would she spend 511 pages outlining a totally windblown character like Deborah? What insight does Deborah bring to the party? She spends a lot of the book in constant battle with Simon (when she is the one who wants him to save her friends). And to top it off it is Simon who apologizes to her for being a lout (even though it turns out that his assessment of the situation is the correct one).This book is hardly a winner for EG."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is now worth 25 cents and I know why.","review":"This is the worst one so far but I am not giving up and am looking for Well Schooled in Murder.

I love the Lynley/Helen/Havers relationships, and I like Simon, too, although I wish he didn't seem so insubstantial and insecure. But Deb just annoys me, and therefore a book that focused on her and her feelings annoyed me. Ms. George's books keep getting longer and longer, and the plots just can't stand up to all the talky weight that drags them down. Crisper pacing and tighter plotting would help, and cutting the extraneous information, dialogue, and red herrings that really don't serve much purpose would also help. It would be nice if she'd return to the writing/plotting skill she showed earlier in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"whine whine whine whine...","review":"Gosh - I really did not enjoy this book. I love Elizabeth George's books but Deborah St. James is the biggest baby and what a schmuck her husband, Simon, is. He needs to tell Deb to grow up. Okay - so she can not have a baby. Hello, adopt!!! It is not like money is an issue for them. This books was long and made longer by having the reader suffer with the unsufferable (is that a word??) Deb. Lynley and Havers and their relationship with London is what makes George's books so entertaining and interesting. When she writes a story with boring and silly characters throughout the whole story (like Adrian's Mom)it is just too tedious for words...I wonder what Ms. George has to say to all the critism regarding her leaving out Barbara."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until reading her last three books, I was a fan of George.","review":"This last book needs severe editing. The style is increasingly sef-indulgent, repetitive and muddy. I struggled with the confused syntax and clumsy metaphors. Various sections using changes in characters' voices and streams of consciousness makes A Place of Hiding almost unreadable. I tried following the story for a while because the setting (the island of Guernsey, occupied by the Nazis from 1940-43) interested me, but found myself skipping through the second half to find the conclusion. A deeper and more fulfilling treatment of the setting can be found in Tim Binding's novel, Lying with the Enemy, which I heartily recommend. This will be the last E. George book that I will open."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Place of Hiding","review":"How sad that yet another Elizabeth George book just doesn't come up to the standard from her earlier books like \\"A great Deliverance\\" and \\"Missing Joseph\\". This book needed some serious editing since - it was way too long and full of meaningless minutiae. The characters were boring and the plot lacked the great mystery that we have come to expect for EG books. I don't undertand why Miss George insists on moving away from her successful characters of Lynley and Havers since these are the people that have made her books famous. Their characters are real and interesting unlike Simon and Deborah in \\"A Place of Hiding\\" I'm sorry to say that Deborah needs a kick up the pants - she is a spolit brat and Simon is a control freak, but none the less he doesn't deserve to be married to someone like Deborah.Come on Elizabeth, give us what we all want and write about Lynley and Havers again and don't feel you have to write 500 pages, 300 would be just fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big fan couldn't get through it","review":"I was stunned to read so many reviews that said what I'd been thinking: I'm a GIANT fan of Elizabeth George, but I couldn't get through this! I'm a big reader, always eagerly await her books and eat them up, but I keep putting this down to read something more fun, more challenging, less boring, less tedious--and have never finished it.

I used to love her books, but I was very disappointed in A TRAITOR TO MEMORY which should have been called A TRAITOR TO HER READERS. It was awful, but I bit the bullet and gave her another chance. A PLACE OF HIDING was the most convoluted mess I think I have ever read. There must have been 20 subplots, none of which were very interesting. Lynley and Havers were conspicuously absent and, deep down, I don't think Ms. George actually likes Deborah and Simon St. James. The whole mess went on for far too long and, frankly, toward the end, I didn't care who killed Guy Brouard. This may be the last time she suckers me into buying a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth George jumped the shark on this one..","review":"This book was disappointing, in a big way. Elizabeth George has picked her weaker characters, Simon and Deborah, and turns them into detectives to solve a peculiar murder. Unfortunately, the book focuses way too much on the fairly one-dimensional relationship between Simon and Deborah and not nearly enough on solving a mystery. Too much whiny soap opera and not nearly enough plot development. Although there's an explosive ending, the final resolution is way too gimmicky, and I feel that solving the case played second banana to Elizabeth George's attempt to show a really boring relationship from two sides.It's too bad, because Elizabeth George is ususally pretty good at throwing some plot twists and red herrings in. She also usually has a more interesting set of peripheral characters and suspects, who are quirky and fun, but here she just falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon & Deborah Go Home!","review":"Simon and Deborah have always been the least likeable characters in all of Elizabeth George's substantial mystery books. They should have never leaped from second string to main character. I can't finish this book. Deborah is such a despicably weak whiner I can't get past it to care who killed who. Simon needs some assertiveness training. Elizabeth needs an editor. She also needs to listen. Her fans have been clamoring for a Barbara Havers book from the get-go. The women in her books have always been too dependent on their men. Maybe Elizabeth's religous background is getting in the way of her mystery writing. This is the only explanation I can think of for creating such unsympathetic, suboordinate female characters. Look what happened to our beloved Barbara, the only independent woman in the entire series. I won't be buying any more books from Elizabeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan: Skip this one","review":"I read the reviews that wrote that Havers and Lynley were MIA in this book and the books main focus was on Deborah and Simon St. James - who are uninteresting characters in the best of times - but I refused to believe I waited like 2 years for a new Lynley George book and I got stuck with this! For shame Ms. George - to deprive your readers of one of the great mystery characters, especially a woman, to have come around in a long time.

Take my word for it George fans: skip this book as it might put you off for good!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think it says it all when a reader whose favourite author is Elizabeth George can't finish this book. That's me. I have been really trying to go past half-way, where it was, actually, a struggle to get, for a couple of weeks and gave up. No need to analyse the reasons - just the fact that I had been amazed by most of her earlier novels (especially captivated by Deception in his Mind), put her up in my Favourite author box but couldn't read this one is enough. It could be the lack of Helen and Lynley and Barbara, it could be the setting that was depressing, it could be the length, but mostly, it was just boring. The characters were boring, not shallow nor undeveloped. They were simply not interesting. I just didn't care to find out why and how that person died. It's really such a pity, because Ms. George can do so much with her characters and has such a lovely style of writing. I don't know what happened here, but I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"No Havers and Lynley and, as everyone has noted, Deborah and Simon St. James are uninteresting characters: she whines, he patronizes.

In addition to this specific problem, the software is agonizingly slow when switching between lessons, and even between different portions of the same lesson.

Always when it gets to the pronunciation exercises. Sometimes within seconds of restarting after the last freeze. Now presumably this doesn't happen on all computers, but I have a pretty good laptop (1.7GHz Pentium/512MB RAM, well above the recommended system requirements) and it's basically unusable (unless you avoid the speech exercises completely).When I pay this much for something I expect it to at least work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dificult, slow cd reading,,, horrible","review":"Dont ever buy this, I mean i bougth it with the intention in learning French for my first trip to Europe, but its a complicated software, hard to use, slow when u try to change to another level.

I loved the movie when it came out, even owned the cassette tape and VHS, then upgraded to the CD and DVD. Yep, I'm a Newsies fan. This soundtrack was a lot of fun to listen to. Some lyrics are different and it will take a bit of time to be able to sing along to the right words, but I'm excited to get to know the music better. The new songs are fun and keep the energy going through the album. I want to tap my toes right now while thinking about it since one of the new songs is going through my head.

What surprised me was that I already knew two of the songs! 'Santa Fe' was sung by one of my friends at a talent show and 'Seize the Day' we sang for choir. I instantly fell in love with the show and came across the soundtrack and HAD to buy it. I listened to it night and day for about a week. By then I had figured out the best songs and skipped through the ones I disliked.

I listen to it constantly and know my favorite songs by heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack!","review":"This is an awesome movie, and the soundtrack does an excellent job of capturing the music from it. It's a great story of the power of unity. I get the chills when I hear the reprise of \\"The World Will Know\\" (specifically, the words \\"When you've got a million voices ringing\\", after the first time, when they sing \\"When you've got a hundred voices ringing\\"). \\"Santa Fe\\" is probably my favorite song in it because it has such a haunting tune.It does have a similar sound to some of Menken's other musicals, such as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" (For example, \\"Santa Fe\\" sounds a bit like \\"Belle (reprise)\\"...and both songs are sung by a character who dreams of much more than he/she has known, about his/her dreams)I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"New newsies","review":"Entertaining and enjoyable recording of the musicals songs.

I fell in love with it and watched it everday.Every single day for about 5 months, I would sit in class, waiting for the long day to be over so I could go home and watch Newsies. It shows Disney at its best and reminds the way they did things around the 90's. its a shame Disney doesn't make movies they way they use to.

After all these years I am still moved when I hear the \\"...when you got a million voices singing, who can hear a lousy whistle blow\\" during the reprise of \\"The World Will Know\\".

The solo singing is outstanding across the board, with Jeremy Jordan in top form. The songs by Alan Menken grow on you with each listen. The conducting is vigorous, but still sensitive to the tone of each song, just like for the stage. The chorus work is nothing short of fantastic. And, as is typical with Disney, the sound recording quality is superb; no distortion, a true reflection of voice and instruments. This is, alongside \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\" the best recorded cast album of the last year or so. Even if you hated the movie (and who didn't), this musical recording is a great addition to any collection of musicals.

A full 15 inches in diameter. Perfect for making a pizza with room to spare. It is a lovely scarlet red and quite heavy. When I have cooked a pizza on this with a premade crust it came out evenly done from edge to center and it did not stick to the platter even without cooking spray. Love that. When I bake at high temp around 475 degrees the platter looks a bit darker coming out of the oven. I was worried the first time I saw this thinking the color was somehow messed up by the heating. But once it begins to cool it will go back to the blazing scarlet color again. Cleanup was a breeze too. But it is big, think about where you will store this before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Just as described! Big. Bold. A very pretty piece of Fiestaware.

They also make it clear they are certified by NSF.However, neither NSF nor Nutramax will disclose even basic test results performed on the product. If you ask Nutramax they will refer you to NSF and if you ask NSF they will refer you to Nutramax. They both use the word \\"proprietary\\" to describe the result of their internal testing procedures. Frankly I think that is ridiculous.There is no reason why a certificate of analysis can't be provided to at least substantiate label claims (at a bare minimum).

But it only told about Tiger Wood's career and his life when he was older , getting into golf tornments and training . But otherwise it is a very good book if you were just wanting to know how he won tournments and becomeing famous . Also it told about how Tiger Woods was ridiculed by his race and how young he was , which was a problem towards his career due to reporters and newspapers.Tiger was also known as one of the multicultrual icons . Also what was interesting to people is Tiger was guided by his father rather than being pushed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some gems","review":"A collection of few chapters with the authors own ideas and thoughts thrown in too liberally, it is more of the author's view of Tiger Woods.

It is certainly a better value than \\"dream home\\" magazines that usually sell for $7 a pop at the newstands, but it pales in comparison to \\"Dan Sater's Luxury Home Plans\\". Sater's book is better in just about every way... larger format, larger pictures, thicker paper, a better selection of homes in my opinion (not to mention a few identical ones), and a lower price.You probably already know that the purpose of these books is to sell home plans. That's why they're so cheap. From a consumer standpoint, they're fun to browse through and you don't feel any buyer's remorse since you can easily spend more money at McDonald's.If you're looking for a book to get valuable ideas for your next home or remodel, take a look at \\"Home by Design\\" by Sarah Susanka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of very very expensive homes.","review":"I will never be able to afford any of the homes in this book, and even if I could, I don't think I'd want something that big.

I love Colonial, European, and Neo-classic styles, so there were only a few homes with touches of these styles (hence, only 4 stars), but I still found the book useful.

Fast paced with steamy sexual chemestry between the main characters. Plot line was interesting regarding the DNA manipulation that created the hero. Evil scientists are the villans of the story.

Having read and enjoyed other paranormal and \\"romantica\\" novels, the reviews had me looking forward to this one. The main characters were attractive enough, and although the plot was fairly predictable the book's biggest disappointment was that the hot encounters between Callan and Merinus was so motivated by an overwhelming chemical dependency (via Callan's pheromones) that the sex was disturbingly and distractingly involuntary--like a drug addiction. If this sounds like it would bother you, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot scenes, Cheesy plot","review":"I love me a good erotic scene but this book was not worth the $. Author repeated phrases, the plot was cheesy and complicated, and characters were one dimensional and forgettable.

This was an excellent story for Lora's breed books. There was romance, lust, love, hate, anger (NOT TO MENTION VERY STEAMY)...just about everything you can ask for in a good read. If you enjoy Lora Leigh's books you will love this one.I highly recommend this book, along with all of the breed books I have read so far.

Good story, too. LOL :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Tempting the Beast sets a very interesting story line for the Feline series. It introduces the reader to the main pride and briefly outlines the difficult and interesting journey they have travelled so far. In very human terms it describes the struggle to understand the mating process and it's effect on the Callan and Merinus. It is fast paced, addictive and keeps the reader entertained. After reading this book, I purchased the others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tempting the Beast:Feline Breeds 1","review":"This was my first book by Lora Leigh. I love the storyline of genetic experimentation. It is a believable possibility. Since I like were-books this was enough like them to keep my attention and the action was great. I was definitely reading erotic romance which gave the fight for the good guys a great \\"twist\\".I bought 2 & 3 at the same time and just put one down and picked up the next one. I look forward to discovering more \\"breeds\\" in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't care for this book","review":"This book didn't make that much sense to me as far as a plot goes. It was mainly pornography. I like steamy scenes as much as anybody but after a while, for me, the repeated sex got tiring. Merinus (not a very attractive name) was a contradiction. She claimed to be able to do the job of tracking down Callan Lyons and getting him to open up to her. She finally talks her stubborn brothers, who were major irritants, into letting her do this and then she proceeds to make so many blunders that it was hard to take her seriously. Perhaps this book wasn't the right one to read first as this is a series but the plot just wasn't there. There was a bit of disjointed story in between bouts of sex. I liked Callan but Merinus was also an irritant. There was just no meat to this story. If you like steamy sex scenes and plenty of them, then this is the book for you. If you like a plot too, then maybe this isn't one you'll enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Sex and Lacking Plot","review":"I just didn't get this book. It was so boring. The sex in this book was the same old over and over except for maybe 1 scene. This book was more about the sex and the plot was put on the back burner. Merinus was all talk tough girl thinking if you call someone an a-hole that makes you tough. Callan was too dominant for me. Plus as a strong kick butt shapeshifter he actually thinks Merinus is tough?!? IMO she is tough on the nerves...This book just rubbed me the wrong way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempting The Beast","review":"This was by far the worst book I have ever read!! The dialog was terrible, the plot was thin, and the main characters were not very well thought out. For example, the author kept stressing how strong and independent the female character was but whenever she got into trouble she would always look for one of her seven brothers to bail her out. The heroine comes across as a spoiled brat who is overindulged by daddy and her big brothers. This was the first, and last book I will ever purchase by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat.

It is a journey that I will enjoy taking again and again through each and every page of this extraordinary book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book of beautiful, inspiring horse photography...","review":"The previous reviewer and I have mch the same opinion, but I would like to explain why this book isn't for me...I am an avid photographer and I was looking for a book with beautiful pictures of horses that I could use as a learning tool. This is definitely not the book for that purpose. Had I been able to peruse the book, rather than just the picture of the cover, I would have passed it up. The photographs were not inspiring, nor were they begging to be emulated or built upon. Photogrpahy-wise, at least for me, they had nothing to offer. The cover photograph is the best of the entire book.Perhaps the text is perfect for the horse-lover who doesn't have the objective of capturing a moment in time with these marvelous creatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"All fluff & very little stuff","review":"I bought this book because I had seen other horse photographs that this artist had done & thought them quite good. She has her own style & it is obviously quite different from other artists. (What would the world be if we all did everything the same or saw it just the same way?!) But sadly, this book has very little to warrant buying it. I am glad I only paid $2.00 for it at a tag sale. While the photographer certainly considers herself an artist, as do many others, there is very little of her artistic talent shown in these photographs. The introduction by Jane Goodall is well written & thought provoking & most certainly, the best part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disapointed with this book. The black and white photos were taken in a studio, not in natural habitat and many of the pictures, such as closeups of horsehair and individual body parts, were, in my opinion, irrelevant to the title of the book. Many of the pictures were abstract and out of focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Got Game (Wnba Series, 2)","review":"Want to know about some of the players on the WNBA?

Don't get me wrong, I love the sound and I love No Doubt, but when you listen to the songs, they leave you wanting to hear the lyrics. It's like eating an amazing cookie that is missing the chocolate chips, or something to that effect. Anyhow, it's a great CD, but it might not be quite what you expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt- New sound, but still a great band","review":"Let me just start with, I am a huge fan of NO Doubt. I love all of their CDs, though I haven't herard their first one, but based on the reviews I'm not planning on it. Yes, true, Rock Steady is a different CD then Tragic Kingdoma and Return of Saturn. But come on people, do you really expect a band to remain the same after 15+ years of being together? It would be rather boring if they did. This CD shows that tey probably were inspired by some Jamaican reggae beats, but did not stray too far away from their roots. No Doubt is one of the bands that I can listen to the songs from beginning to end, without pressing the skip button. Some of my favorite songs include Running, Detective, and Don't Let Me Down. No Doubt also writes their own songs. I always show a lot of respect for that, and I also know that the songs came from the heart, and based on real feelings Gwen Stefani feels or other members of the band. So overall, No Doubt has not disappointed me yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubt if this is their best stuff","review":"The once talented writing from Gwen has all but gone away, along with talent of the musicians that made up the No Doubt I remember. Being a long time \`East Coast' fan of No Doubt, I am dishearten at the direction this band has decided to take with their lasted project \`Rock Steady' Instead of developing a project that would take advantage of their maturity and reflect on the experience of their talent, they have elected to put commercialism and teeny bobber mentally at the head of all else. Just when you thought a nice guitar sole was coming, or the drive of the once - force one drummer, nope just imitation drums sounds and what guitar, that's some high paid rapper doing what he/she knows best ..nothing worth listening to. So buy this CD if want a combo of Madonna want a be, and Juice Joe ras-ta rap man...or what ever ..-----thanks for the effort Gwen. -On the other hand, all of No Doubt's other project are top line!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen?","review":"I want Gwen back.

Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get sold!!","review":"People. I have few words to say :) Just this..do not let the agglomeration of pop culture fool you into buying this cd. The band has lost whatever it had...or its been stolen from then. Avoid this cd like the plague if you are a No Doubt fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I was a huge No Doubt fan, I thought \\"No Doubt\\" was a cute album, \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" was just a fun rockin album, \\"Return of Saturn\\" was just a masterpiece, both musically and lyrically. Then comes \\"Rock Steady\\". I thought \\"Hey Baby\\" was alright, I listened to the entire album, and I admit its sort of a \\"fun\\" album but No Doubt's sound has totally changed. \\"Running\\" and \\"Underneath it all\\" are probably the best songs here. But the lyrics are just.. silly in comparison to the beauty of \\"Saturn\\". It is a decent CD but not up to par with No Doubt's full talent. I was dissapointed with the \\"new style\\" of music here, if anything get Tragic Kingdom or Saturn to truly hear some of ND's greatest shining moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick...","review":"What a low for the music scene. Right next to Missy Elliot and Cannibal Corpse. A pretty good ska band ditches it all and goes mainstream. Fine. Then, seven years later, they come back with an album of cliche, repetitive, choruses, RAP, cheesy dance beats, no talent, and a singer with sickeningly blonde hair and a voice to match. What happened to \\"Trapped In A Box?\\"Instead, we get: \\"Hey baby, hey baby, yeah.\\" and \\"I'm feeling hella good, let's just keep on dancing.\\"Kids, listen to Bob Marley. I'm outta here to do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's..... OK...","review":"You really have to listen to this album more than once just to start to get a feel for it. It's not the same thing that put No Doubt on the top. When I think about how the band wrote the album while in Jamaica, I can see where some of the songs have been influenced. Overall, I'd say there is maybe one or two songs that you can totally groove to and think to yourself, \\"This is still the No Doubt I remember.\\" Other than that, they have changed. Don't buy it if you aren't ready for their change."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt's worst album to date","review":"I would give this album 0 stars if I could. The album is horribly repetitive and even the songs are repetitive as well. The songs are essentially a chorus repeated from the beginning to the end of the song. I admire No Doubt for exploring a new sound, but this is a terrible choice and I hope this is not the direction they will be taking the music in the future. Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn are both fantastic albums worthy of anybody's collection, but if you haven't got this album and you are considering it, at least make sure you give it a listen before wasting your hard earned cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"While I did enjoy \\"Start the Fire\\" and \\"Running\\" a bit it does not make up for the rest of this album. No Doubt used to be fun and refreshing. Now, they've sold out and released a mediocre pop album. Woo hoo. First this then a bad remake of a \\"Talk Talk\\" song? I've lost all respect for this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"No Doubt alienates their rock fan base in favor of a modern pop audience to stay alive. P!nk fans will be pleased. Fans of Tragic Kingdom will be pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is my cd player BROKEN!?","review":"I am a No Doubt fan but this cd is like, an insult! They could have made one song out of the 13 one-line songs on the cd. I seriously thought I got a bad cd because it just kept repeating! Dont waste your time with this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"No doubt that this album sucks.","review":"God, it's like Gwen turned 32 and decided that she had to dress and act like she was 15 again. I enjoyed Southside, I was iffy about Let Me Blow Ya' Mind...but Hey Baby has scared the ... out of me.I was a diehard No Doubt fan for awhile, would have done anything to see Gwen and the guys on stage. But now, it's pretty obvious to me that it won't be anything other than Gwen. In most of the songs, there is no sign of a guitar or a bass, and the drums may as well be a rhythm set for a three-year-old.No Doubt used to be quite possibly the best ska/punk/rock band around--now it's washed up, manufactured, and completely pop. Some reviews say that No Doubt hasn't grown up any with this album...well I loved the 'grown-up' No Doubt. I loved the emotion behind it all, the passion. And I especially loved Tom's guitar.Gwen, go ahead and keep your platinum blonde hair and your ... bikini tops. Just stop taking the other guys down with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I'd read the reviews here before buying","review":"Well I bought this album without hearing a note based upon theirlast album Return of the Saturn which was an excellent album. What comes immediately to mind is what were these guys doing putting out an album this bad? I mean c'mon it sounds like bad 80's retro music meets Hip-Hop. They even bring in Ric Ocasek to produce 2 songs that sound like bad outtakes from Heartbeat City.This album is bad bad bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt Gets Outta The Funk....somewhat","review":"Rock Steady starts out as kinda a high paced fun fest (Hell good and Hey Baby) then slows down around Track 6. Gwen's still on the love tip for the most part so if your not the mushy type forgetaboutit!! One of the highlights of this CD has to be Waiting Room. Prince or the symbol dude helps Gwen out with vocal and its a really jazzy/funk song... i loved this cd and the only reason it doesnt get a 5 is the overuse of this god i know what type of effect it is but it sounds like one of those old school video games...annoying well anyway its a good cd and you should pick it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love No Doubt","review":"No Doubt has managed to merge hip hop, dance, ska, and pop together to make a CD that will rock your socks off!! Gwen Stefani's voice is so unique, and the music just hits you between the eyes. I would recommend this CD to everyone! Oh, the other cool thing is that it's appropriate for any age. I bought it for my 13 year old daughter. I love Gwen because she sings about love and relationships in a healthy way. Buy it for yourself or your young ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, But Not Bad","review":"This album is packed with interesting songs with different beats and rhythms. Some of the songs int his album are different from older No Doubt songs. My favorite songs in this album are \\"Making Out\\", \\"Running\\", and \\"In My Head\\". \\"Running\\" is a slower song with a really good message in it. One good thing about this album is that it contains no annoying song. There's no song that you might rather skip. Anyway, this is a good-to-have album. It's the first No Doubt album that I have bought. I have heard from people who have listened to previous No Doubt albums that this one is pretty bad compared to the other ones, but I don't think that this album is bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get's Ya Bouncing!","review":"If you've been having a pretty glum day or if you just want to feel better, this is the only cd there is! I've tried listening to pop:(, metal, punk, rock, and all those other genres but this is the only cd that has worked so far! There's not one song I dislike! Listen to it for 3 seconds and it'll get your head bopping! Get this cd or you're going to be wasting your green! This is one of those albums where you buy it and go \\"What would I do without you? Hell, I'd even pay 35 bucks for you!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding me right?","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Stefani and the band, but they seem to be getting worse with each album. Their first single of this record, \\"Hey Baby\\" sounds like something a couple of 15 year old kids would write because they didn't feel like doing their homework. It's so annoying, I can't hit the radio dial fast enough to change the station! If the band were still unknowns trying to make it, every producer in the land would easily pass on this album. It's almost like \\"We're big, we're famous, we don't have to write and record anything well written anymore.\\" Come on guys.. you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed =(","review":"This album is very weak for No Doubt. What happened???? I can't even listen to any of the songs all the way through! I am VERY disappointed in Gwen, I know she could have done better. They should have taken more time to make the music and put it all together like they did with The Return of Saturn. This album was totally rushed and it shows! I would not even waste my time downloading it, let-alone buying it! Sorry to say it, but this album is NOT good."},{"rating":"1","title":"apex of idiocy","review":"well, it figures...the first song released off this album is that completely annoying anthem to moronic lyrics, \\"hey baby.\\" i've been watching (listening at times) as a band that had such great messages like \\"just a girl\\" has just gone completely downhill. i find it amusing to see members of this band drape themselves in t-shirts of bands like \\"madness\\" and \\"the specials (i think...)\\" as if this should immediately translate into some type of street cred and should minimalize the fact that their music just plain sucks. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"OK, major disappointment. All the songs sounded the same. I didn't think the lyrics or the music was very interesting or different. I really liked 'Return To Saturn' - but, this doesn't even sound like the same band."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER disappointed fan","review":"If I could have given this zero stars, I would have. Y'know, I'm all for artists growing and exploring new directions, but what a piece of garbage this is (no offense to THAT band!). Like \\"a disappointed fan\\", I pre-ordered this CD and got all excited when I heard it had been released a week early. I ALMOST cancelled the order when I saw the band on MTV2 and heard Gwen talking about how great hip-hop is nowdays, and how it was influencing her. Now I wish I had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a riot!","review":"Reading through these reviews, one can figure out who bought it and who didn't. Those who complain of a repeating line (loop) with each track - downloaded it from the internet. Some smartass created and distributed (quite successfully, I might add) throughout the P2P networks.Serves them right, people just download and don't even think about what they got. In any case, people should support the work of artists and at least buy some of their CD's... not just download them. What a bunch of mindless leeches!This is a good CD - but even without the \\"loop\\", I'll admit there is a bit of a repetitive nature throughout the CD. I sort of like their older stuff a bit more though."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this cd","review":"No Doubt used to be a really good band until rock steady came out there just a bunch of sell outs who play rap instead of rock/ska please dont buy this cd if you think its going to sound like all the other no doubt cd cause if you do you'll be really disappointed like me"},{"rating":"1","title":"occupation: POPstars","review":"As much as i hate saying this no doubt sold out. When I heard hey baby was coming on i was stoked until i listened to it.To achieve the sound of rock steady1)add keyboards2)add rappers3)replace guitar with synth4)bring in pop producers and song writers5)lastly of all add choreographyUnfortunatly no doubt turned it's back guitar, tragic kingdom,and saddest of all rock 'n' roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true fan's point of view...","review":"No Doubt is my favorite band, and the best thing I love about them is that they're not afraid to try something new. With 'Rock Steady', they definitely have tried something new, and in my opinion, I think it's great. I have all five albums they have released, and none of them are at all alike. The only two things this awesome band keeps and brings along with them in each album is their creative, crazy, and fun music, and their love of making it. For Gwen, Tony, Tom, and Adrian...you guys rock! Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this CD :-)","review":"All the reviews I've read say that this album sounds a lot different than previous No Doubt albums. From what I've heard from other albums this is different. I like how the music sounds now better. My fave song on the CD is Hey Baby. Rock Steady doesn't sound a thing like I thought it would. Not that that's a paticularly bad thing. If you're a first time No Doubt puchaser then let me tell you that the sound of they CD can't be fairly judged by Hey Baby if that's the only song you've heard.I did that, but I still like the rest of the album anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would the real No Doubt please stand up!?","review":"I don't know how this happened, but the No Doubt I've known and loved for years has somehow been replaced by not-so-delicious Folgers Crystals! How they could put their name on this sleazy thrust at top-40 playlists is incomprehensible to me. After all the hullabaloo over the band's image when the first Tragic Kingdom videos were shot, this kowtow to mediocrity just serves as confirmation that these talented and intelligent folks have completely sold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy and Creative, This is good stuff!","review":"I gave this a listen before buying it, the songs were catchy right away and I have to say, they just keep growing on me more and more! I love this cd from start to finish. Each song is creative and \\"unique in it's own way\\". Personally, whoever feels that the songs all sound alike, I completely disagree. It's like saying rock is rock. It's just a different sound for No Doubt, but each song is completely different and very unique. Though I love the whole album, my personal fav is Hella Good. Just a feel good, get up and dance and love life kind of tune! Give this cd an unbiased ear and you will be pleasantly surprised. This really is great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"What An Excellent Album!","review":"No Doubt's latest, Rock Steady, is brilliant. No Doubt always has an incredible knack for creating fresh, catchy tunes, and this album is no exception. They combine all sorts of crazy genres into one album, creating an album that is truly unique. There's pop, there's rock, there's R & B, there's reggae, there's disco, there's electronica...and more, all combined with the flair of No Doubt that makes every one of their albums a great listen. The lyrics are great, as usual, and I honestly play the CD over and over again. I can't get enough of it. The end of the CD has me craving more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is No Doubt's worst CD to date. It isn't worth the hour, the fourteen bucks, or the electricity. Their older stuff is so much better than this, wich is suddenly low grade hip-hop. I am dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is AWSOME!","review":"I got \\"Rock Steady\\" for Christmas. It think it is the best CD No Doubt has put out. For me, the best songs are \\"Hella Good,\\" \\"Hey Baby,\\" \\"Underneath It All\\" and \\"Dective,\\" but all the other songs are really good too. The only one I don't really like is \\"Making Out\\"...that song isn't the best, but this CD is definatly (i didn't spell that correctly) worth every cent you have to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't They Have Done Any Better?","review":"No Doubt is one of my favorite bands of all time, so it was only natural that I was excited about the release of Rock Steady.But when I heard the songs,I felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of The Wedding Singer...BROKEN.All of the songs are very repetitive and they all sound horribly similar.I deeply miss the feel of Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn,where they show their true feelings in each and every song.But when I listen to Rock Steady,I can no longer relate to the songs in any way.I also think that the rest of the band(not including Gwen)is dropped in the album.Drums and guitars are replaced with computers(keyboards,etc.).The bottom line:If you enjoyed No Doubt,Beacon Street,and Tragic Kingdom,you will regret buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby......","review":"Talk about a total turnaround, everything that has been good about No Doubt in the past is pretty much gone from this album. It sounds like Gwen went in and laid down about a 10-second track for each song and then the producer just hit the \\"Repeat\\" button to fill the rest of the song. I'm listening to the album for the first time right now and it's totally true! Whoever wrote the lyrics for these songs must have been extremely lazy. What happened to No Doubt the \\"band\\"?? Pop music is ruining my world!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCH A LET DOWN","review":"OK, up to the minute I stuck this CD in my car stereo on the way home from the mall the day it came out, I considered myself the biggest NoDoubt fan on the planet. Gwen was my idol, Aaron the guy I wanted as my best pal, but I was confused. Track one rolled and I hated it, where was all the real music? The guitar licks I needed to learn how to play? I kept going through the CD skipping song after song. I am appalled that No Doubt has become so over processed and...I cant even think of a strong enough word. you sold out gwen. Buy Return off Saturn for the lyrics with meaning and the awesome MUSIC! dont waste your money and smash your ideas of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the Masses- \\"Steady\\" as Dust on A \\"Rock\\"","review":"Electronic Dance is new to this group so I do give it a star for the transition from ska-influenced pop to this....trendy, boring instrumentation, weak voice, packaged MTV goal as if they are screaming for boy band and pop princess appeal. They have those fans but will this album keep the real fans- those who have grown with them? I long for the earlier passion which this cd lacks- only took a year to put out? It shows.Dance gets old. Electronic lacks musical depth. Gwen's personality can't keep this spinning for long. It's ashame that No Doubt feels they must compete with the unoriginal chart toppers of today's music. I'll stick to the very 1st album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been a huge fan,but this is awful","review":"I've never been a huge fan of No Doubt, but I did like some tracks on prior albums. But this CD is a stinker to the core It's such a blatant attempt at getting on the pop charts. I thought \\"Hey Baby\\" was awful enough when it got played at my gym a thousand times, but now I realize it's a No Doubt track..even worse. Hella Good was an obvious mediochre shot at getting on the pop charts.Nothing good can come of this album. It's just bad all around. Well, ok, I *kinda* like Platinum Blonde, but the rest of the tracks sound like a top 40 station nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...this is really crap","review":"no doubt is showing the world a completely different side--the side that has no talent... i bought it expecting quality and was shocked at the lack thereof. if you like no doubt's earlier material...don't buy this. you will get a good laugh the first listen through...but you will never want to listen to it again despite the comedic value. im actually pretty embarrassed i bought it. this is the epitome of [bad] music.it may even be worse than britney spears..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to ska?","review":"This CD is not No Doubt as they were in Tragic Kingdom. Tragic Kingdom is an awesome CD. This CD has gone pop. The ska is not there as it was. The first single, Hey Baby, sounds more like Britney Spears than it does No Doubt. I was singing this song and my friend told me to stop singing Britney Spears. I told him that it was No Doubt and he had two words: BYE BYE.There are a FEW good songs on this record, but if you really liked Tragic Kingdom, and think that is what No Doubt should be, DONT GET THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have just bought the single.","review":"I wasn't crazy about Hey Baby when it hit the radio, but once I heard Hella Good, I wanted to buy the CD. I think Hella Good is a great song and is reminicient of the No Doubt of the 90s. I've always loved their ska base and punk feel. But this album is nothing like that. I hate to say this, but it's awful. The only song I like on Rock Steady is still Hella Good, which is the only reason I gave this album two stars. The rest of the songs are these cheesy lyrics and reggae beats that aren't even fun to listen to -- it's just painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're not even trying","review":"I used to think that Shelby Lynne's \\"Love, Shelby\\" was the worst release by a major artist in 2001, but here comes No Doubt's \\"Rock Steady.\\" I've never heard such a lazy, ridiculous, tuneless, pointless release. Poorly played dance tracks from the band that brought us great introspective rock tunes? It's obvious that Gwen Stefani is now much more interested in being a POP STAR than an being, an artist with anything important to say, and let's face it, with a face and body like her's, that's not hard to do. But give up on No Doubt--it simply isn't much of a band to begin with, and look for Gwen's \\"motion picture acting debut\\" any minute now. WHAT a disappointment. Bye, bye, No Doubt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwen & Company Keep It Rock Steady","review":"After enjoying the dark and more personal \\"Return of Saturn\\", I anticipated a great new follow-up. I recieved what I wanted, a great record, for the exact opposite reasons the previously mentioned disc was good. Energetic, happy, and danceable, \\"Rock Steady\\" takes the group to another place. After some choice collaborations with Moby on his track \\"South Side\\" and Eve on her smash \\"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\\". Gwen takes what she's learned from exploring new styles of music and mixes it up with a dance hall vibe. The result is a pop record with a tougher No Doubt edge, but the energy and danceability of your Britney Spears. It's different from before, but that's something that really makes this shine. Mixing Gwen's lyrics, reggae energy, and some very qualified producers, the songs that really leave a mark include the first release \\"Hey Baby, and the tracks \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Making Out\\". All three are particularly good, and show of the new eclectic sound that is No Doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"If I could have given this cd 0 stars, I would have. What happened to No Doubt's sound? And their songs used to have meaning, which is why they were one of my favorite bands. Gwen had the perfect almost-whiny voice for what they were doing, the punk/ska type sound, but now they sound like just another crappy band. I knew it was going downhill when the first single released had a rapper in it. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Departure into Electronic Music","review":"If you've heard \\"Hey Baby\\" then you know what to expect from this album. Yes, there are dancehall inspired tracks but overall this album is much more keyboard / sequencer oriented than almost any other single song recording in the band's career. In fact, there's really only a couple tracks which sound at all \\"rock\\" comparable to the band's last record, \\"Return from Saturn\\".That said, the grooves and hooks on this album are vast and numerous. The shake-your-booty anthem \\"Hella Good\\" is another monster single to rival the excellent \\"Hey Baby\\".It is time longtime fans realize that No Doubt is no longer a Ska band. But, in the 21st century music climate, that is not a bad thing at all.I didn't think any album could top \\"BeautifulGarbage\\" this year, but \\"Rock Steady\\" does it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst No Doubt album ever.","review":"I am a very big No Doubt fan--I own their last two albums, TRAGIC KINGDOM and RETURN OF SATURAN and love them both! But ROCK STEADY is a horrible album. The only good song is the first single, \\"Hey Baby\\", which happens to be very catchy. Is No Doubt trying to do rap or hip-hop? And sure, the album itself LOOKS cool, but the music on here is not. Gwen Stefani's vocals are better than ever, but the lyrics and music just doesn't live up to their other previous albums. I'll skip ROCK STEADY (I borrowed this CD at my town's library), and I'll just buy the \\"Hey Baby\\" CD-Single instead. This album was very disappointing and I think a lot of No Doubt fans were disappointed with it, too. I think No Doubt is getting desparate for more fans so they are trying to get little teenyboppers into them or something. Sorry, but this album was bad. I think I'll go and buy Shakira's new English debut, LAUNDRY SERVICE, instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst no doubt cd","review":"this cd was a big disappointment, it isnt anything like their old stuff. I couldn't even finish listening to the rest of the cd it was so bad. It sounds like bad 80's pop. do not get this cd if u liked their other cds. I like No Doubt a lot, but this cd is just embarrassing. One of the worst cds I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hella Sedated Society","review":"Man what a farse. Take a very average rock song like Hella Good, and just ram it down everyone's throats 50,000 times a day on every friggin radio station. Surprisingly when I confront others about the epidemic of hearing this No Doubt album dreadfully overplayed on the radio, the response is always, \\"huh, I never hear that No Doubt song on the radio\\". Are you idiots friggin kidding me??? Its not that good! You all know it! Gwen Stefani is rich off terribly average No Doubt songs! The music industry intends to make everything 15 year old girl friendly and aleviate people like me who question the fact that all your friggin No Doubts and Outkasts do not care about being different and effective and interesting, \\"Rock Steady\\" makes me wonder, Gwen, are you the same person that sang \\"I Saw Red\\" with Bradley of Sublime???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing what bands will do for a little more cash..","review":"No Doubt used to be one of my favorite bands a while back, I still had respect for them.. then this came out, it's nothing like the old punk/ska stuff that used to do.. while I've only heard the songs they've taken mainstream, this looks like a total \\"pop\\" cd. I just find it amazing how half decent bands sell out and become part of corporate America.. just for more money. *sigh*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it aint so","review":"No Doubt old stuff was really good, but its obvious all ND cares about is being all over MTV and have a sucessful record then playing the music they want to play. This is horrible the drum beats are very simple u can hardly hear the bass riffs and have u seen the video for \\"Hey Baby\\" the guitarist isnt playing a guitar!! He's playing one of those weird piano things. I dont like labeling bands and im not too critical of that whole \\"sell out\\" thing but its gotten to a point where the guitarist isnt even playing a guitar it sounds like a hip hop track. The only song i like on the record is \\"underneath It All\\" thats a very good song, but the rest is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocksteady is lame-steady.","review":"I can't believe how gimmicky No Doubt has become.

I LOVE it! No Doubt is by far the best band in the world! In my opinion ND has not sold out, they do sound different but still have their wonderful fun sound. This album is a lot happier than ROS (I absolutly loved ROS). Rock Steady does have mechanical sounds but is not techno. My favorite songs are \\"platinum blonde life\\" \\"detective\\" and \\"Don't let me down\\" Those three songs are pretty much the \\"old\\" No Doubt that we all love. But I do recomend this to anyone!! It is not repetitive as some say (buy it don't just stream it to your computer! it's just looped that way and you don't hear the whole song) and I happen to like the intro! It is a clip of \\"Rock Steaddy\\" and it lets you know what you're in for, great fun!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's different, but not necessarily bad...","review":"Yes, it's true, Rock Steady is a lot different than Tragic Kingdom, but it's not a bad album by any means. \\"Hey Baby\\" is actually better as a video, so get it if you can. \\"Making Out\\" and \\"Hella Good\\" are also good.As for why it's so unlike earlier albums...well, it's hard to write punk songs when everything's going well. And life has been good to No Doubt as of late.Oh, and if you download one of these songs from the 'net and find that it's just a chorus looped over and over...that's not the real song. Duh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth downloading from Morpheus!","review":"I was given this CD for my birthday, and I can tell you I'm sorry someone thought this was a nice gift! This was a total waste of money. The music has been done, the sounds are nothing but regurgitated 80's synthesizers and wanna-be reggae. Hey guys, remember when Blondie made it big and then tried the reggae thing? Didn't work for them, and NoDoubt didn't make it work either. The only song worth listening to - Hey Baby - has been played so much I'm sick of hearing it. Save your money. Go buy one of the \\"best of the 80's\\" compilations. The sounds are about the same. If you want the CD, write me and I'd be happy to send you mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DiD TRL kick in?????","review":"WHAT HAPPENED? No Doubt went from playing awesome music, true ska, to playing electronic pop stuff....i know most bands \\"sell out\\" but i mean come on....I would not reccommend this record to anyone who liked the old skool no doubt...it is not ska...it is TRL music...Gwen did Eve change ya??? Terrible....stick to your roots..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sampler CD?","review":"I was highly anticipating the new release from No Doubt. Unfortunately, I am quite disappointed. \\"Rock Steady\\" plays like a sampler CD. Nearly every song begins with a sort of fade-in. Absolutely no intros: guitar, bass, drums, or otherwise. Then the song is four or so minutes of a chorus repeated again and again. One reviewer described it as listening to a broken record. I have to concur.I'll admit, the grooves and sounds on this CD are superb, but there's no semblence of a decently constructed song. Maybe this works for trance, but it doesn't suit No Doubt very well.The one notable exception is \\"Hey Baby\\" which actually has a normal song structure.I'll stick with \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and \\"Return of Saturn\\" and hope No Doubt puts out some better material in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge step in a new direction","review":"No Doubt is never afraid to be different, even when it means doing what nobody's doing at the moment. I think it's amazing to be quite honest. Very new and different while pulling from the past at the same time. Other bands or groups will be trying to copy this new No Doubt sound before too long - just remember No Doubt will always do it a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about repetitive","review":"Let me just say off the bat that I love No Doubt. I think Gwen Stefani rocks, and both Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn stayed in my CD changer for about a year. So I was super excited to hear new material, but wow what a disappointment. If you just play the CD as background music and not really pay attention, then this CD is actually pretty good. But if you stop and listen, you realize that every song is comprised of a 10 second snippet repeated about 40 times to make a 4 minute song. If you haven't heard the album yet, you probably think I'm exaggerating, but I swear I am not. I really thought there was something wrong with my CD player or the CD until I skipped to the next track and encountered the same thing. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, then any No Doubt fan will like this CD. For me, however, it drove me absolutely insane. On every song, I found myself saying: \\"Please please for the love of God, say something else Gwen!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"looped lyrics and pseudo Britney Spears beats","review":"My title says it all.

After seeing \\"Hey Baby\\" released I was worried that the new album would be awful yet I still held out hope that somehow through all this hype and media/fashion coverage of Gwen that perhaps No Doubt would stick to their roots as a blazing rock/ska group. However I got the album listened to them only to hear each song is pretty much the same phrase over and over. It sounds like Reggae meets the 80's. What happened to \\"Return of Saturn\\" and \\"Tragic Kingdom\\"? Why try to fix what wasn't broken?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What\\" Steady???","review":"No Doubt took the rock right out of \\"Rock Steady\\" on this one! With over 600 CDs in my collection, I've never felt the need to return a purchase I've made...until now. To compare this CD to No Doubt's previous recordings, you would never think that this was the same band.Now, if you're into keyboard-laden, disco/hip-hop, NON-ROCK tunes this might be the CD for you. But if it's good guitar riffs, or ANY guitar riffs that you'd expect from a \\"rock\\" CD... keep on looking. Tom Dumont is nearly impossible to find on this recording.This review may sound harsh, but I am actually a huge No Doubt fan. I can only hope that this \\"tragic recording\\" was an experiment, and for their next CD they will \\"return to earth\\" and give us something great to listen to... again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhh","review":"Ehhh is good title. I remember back in the day when I got their first self titled CD. That was good stuff... Hell I still listen to that CD a lot. It's ska... but as No Doubt progressed, their music changed. Ska-Alternative-Poppy Rock-Rap? Can we say NO? Why, I felt someone betrayed during Tragic Kingdom, but this? No... that's all I have to say. This CD would be slightly more tolerable if it had been made under \\"Gwen Stefani\\" because hey, isn't that the only band member who actually contributed to the CD? We had this issue back during Tragic Kingdom when the band bitched that Gwen was too much in the center. Talk about people who just sit by and let things turn to crap. Word of advice-- listen to maybe one or two clips of the CD. Then you'll see what I'm saying and not waste your money on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"HELLA BAD","review":"Sorry, Fans...But even this is maybe my favourite band, i hate this cd. \\"Hey Baby\\" \\"Detective\\" and some others silly songs, are so empty and really bad to me.They wants to be more fun,caribean, and fresh but they don't. Anyway, \\"Platinum blonde Life\\" and \\"Hella Good\\" can be fun. Buy it if you want, but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've totally abandoned the punk ethic...","review":"Call it experimenting, but I call it abandoning the punk code. No Doubt used to be a really good punk/ska band. Now they're hip hop. That is what I'd call selling out. I can understand other people's sentiments if they don't think No Doubt sold out, but I have my opinion, and I'm firm in my convictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Effort","review":"While this album has a few bearable tracks on it, most songs are annoyingly repetitive and easily forgettable. It is nowhere near as infectious as the band's earlier releases. I'm embarrassed for No Doubt. ... Hopefully they will return to their roots for the next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I understand and appreciate bands' needs to grow and evolve out of the styles that propelled them into stardom. Of course, this change is sometimes hard to accept, especially when diehards have become accustomed and attached to a certain style. Having said that, this album falls FLAT. It sounds like every other bit of junk R&B I avoid when cruising the dial."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this if you're a fan of their old music.","review":"No Doubt is one of my favorite bands of all time, but not even I like the change in their music that has taken place for this album. I understand that they need to sell records, though, so I understand why they've changed their sound to something more mainstream. This album is much more hip-hop than their other albums. It's not my preference.If you're a disappointed fan like me, take comfort in your other No Doubt cds. I recommend buying their first self-titled album if you don't have it. It's silly and fun, and it's a great example of what talented and fun people the members of No Doubt are."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"well.. this album is completely different from something like tragic kingdom. I really liked tragic kingdom, I don't really like this. I guess you have to respect them for being willing to change their musical direction. But... unfortunately unhappy heartbroken Gwen Stefani made for better lyrics and music than happy content Gwen Stefani. Most of these songs have a real lack of depth. There is not one \\"deep\\" song on the album. Which can be ok. It's a fun album. Nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a download","review":"I would know, because I did download it. I couldn't risk wasting my money after hearing their last 2 albums and all the filler tracks on them. This CD is no different - Hey Baby and Hella Good are good songs with a creative new No Doubt sound, but that is pretty much where it ends. The lyrics on this album are absolutely terrible, but you can tell that from the first 2 singles (\\"you got me feeling hella good so lets just keep on dancing\\" - give me a break). The only reason those are tolerable is because the music is pretty good. If you like music with absolutely no substance then maybe you will find this CD halfway enjoyable - otherwise save your money and your bandwidth."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFF!!!","review":"This cd has a little bit of everything mixed into one. It is quite a change from their past two works but hey it sounds and plays hella good. Oh yeah and this babe name gwen steffani, shes hella HOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha' Happened?","review":"I've been watching No Doubt for 15 years now, watching their careers from dive-bar-club-dates-and-two-singers-kickin'-ska-band to the current force-to-be-reckoned-with-global-pop-sensations. When I heard \\"Just A Girl\\" on the radio a few years ago, I freaked out and thought, \\"good for them, they've worked hard and made it\\". Tragik Kingdom and Return to Saturn were both great albums that reflected not only the growth of a band but progression and morphing of sound as a unit. Now we have \\"Rock Steady\\" and I am baffled. What happened here, folks? Tons of style (Gwen being a style guru) here, but no substance to be found. I wanted to like it. Really. I did. But I felt like I was listening to Britney Aguilera. Maybe next album will be better. I can appreciate the concept of testing new materials, but it only works when you can back it up with some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this??","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! It was the worst purchase of the year. It made me laugh at how bad it was, or was it the stupid lyrics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt-This album stinks","review":"I could not believe this was a No Doubt album when I first heard it. How can a band that has consistently been so good be so BAD! If you like repetition this album is for you. I have three children so the concept of a phrase being repeated over and over is not a new one to me. I have always enjoyed Gwen's writing ability, that was one of the things that first interested me in the band was the clever lyrics, new and creative ways of saying old things. I was excited to see what they would come up with this time. It took me all of 3 minutes to realize what they had come up with, now it's going to take me 3 weeks to get the ringing out of my ears. I read somewhere that Gwen likes to use a thesaurus when she is writing, but on this album she didn't-believe me it shows! Bottom line-Gwen should go back to using a thesaurus because this recording is bad,amiss,...,dissatisfactory,poor and rotten!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Correct Title shoudl be............","review":"POP Steady, I WAS a huge No Doubt fan untill the release of there last album. Remember way back to the golden year of 1996 when No Doubt was rocking everybodies world with Tragic Kingdom? Well they rock no more, there are just like all the rest of the TRL/MTV Bubblegum pop and there is only one person to blame: Gwen Stefani!!! Maybe she should spend less time rapping with Eve and Moby and more time writing GREAT rock songs. They forgot about all there real fans in order to gain the respect of the 13 yr. old Pop fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"dull, bland and unimaginative.

But this is basically 13 or so tracks thrown together with no emotion or inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock Bottom","review":"Once again another \\"band\\" taken over by main stream pop. This album will disappoint all fans of the earlier No Doubt considerably. The songs are repetitive and bubble gum to the last, without the meaning or intensity of their punk/skaa predecessors. Fans of Britney or N*Sync, will probably enjoy it very much, but other people looking for good music should try elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird","review":"I usually like the half hardcore image and music of No DOubt, which I expected after, \\"Hella Good,\\" but this album spun off in totally new directions. I don't like it...the whole vibe was really strange, especially the chorus of, \\"Rock Steady,\\" which gave me the creeps. I could hardly make it through a single song on it. And after hearing, \\"Hey Baby,\\" forty-five times a day off the radio two months ago, it just got annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic New Wave THAT WANTS TO BE a Facisimile of THE FAINT","review":"Why own this generic annoying rip off? There is no good reason. This is just no doubt trying to be a band they admire. That band-The Faint. This band has been doing what Rock Steady wants to do, for at least 2 albums now, and probably about 5 years. If you want to listen to Rock Steady, and feel good about it, check out Blank Wave Arcade and Danse Macabre by The Faint, the albums are cheaper, more orginal, and way more worth your time.

This is horrible the drum beats are very simple u can hardly hear the bass riffs and have u seen the video for \\"Hey Baby\\" the guitarist isnt playing a guitar!! He's playing one of those weird piano things. I dont like labeling bands and im not too critical of that whole \\"sell out\\" thing but its gotten to a point where the guitarist isnt even playing a guitar it sounds like a hip hop track. The only song i like on the record is \\"underneath It All\\" thats a very good song, but the rest is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy!!!!!!!!","review":"Okay I used to really like no doubt but their first single was horrible so I didn't buy the cd and decided to wait for the second single. Now that the second single is out it sounds even worse and from the 30 second clips that I have heard from it makes it sound even more bad!!!!!!!!! They used to be good alternative rock but now they are just another pop band!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning in mainstream polish","review":"As another review stated, don't compare this to past No Doubt albums. Indeed, their sound has changed --and of course, it's nice to see a band grow and experiment. Overall, this is pretty much a fun and poppy album. But even as a stand alone album, it's heavily disappointing. Not all of the songs are like this, but the majority of it is dull and repetitive. What do I mean? I start listening to the song, it sounds good with a lot of potential and promis, but then it starts to repeat the same tune again and again for the next three or four minutes. Wait, where's the beginning, middle and end? Good as mindless background music or lift-me up/relaxer, but not spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"I'm a big No Doubt fan but I have to admit I was very disappointed with the new album \\"Rock Steady\\". What happened???"},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad goodbye","review":"if ever there was a sad good bye to recording quality music, no doubt has said it with this cd. the punk rock/ska band i and many others once knew and loved has disappeared and in its place a poppy hip-hop group with instruments. a big let down for me and all of the other no doubt fans i know. if you liked tragic kingdom and return of saturn you'll probably think this is [bad]. anyway, i certainly didn't like it. i noticed the transformation when they realeased hey baby and don't let me down for radio play, both poppy and played more on top 40 stations than rock/alt. then the album came out, and my fears were confirmed: we've lost one of the best and most creative bands out there to pop. good bye no doubt, we'll miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock steady review","review":"I was very pleased w this cd. Its one of my favorite no doubt cds! I got almost what I was expecting.... they need to change te im age they are using bc they put a red image down and I received a black one.

Its a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their sound is back","review":"After reading several reviews I bought this cd. At first I wasn't sure how I'd like it, but I loved Tragic Kingdom so I went ahead and purchased it. Well, I think it's a great cd. It's more dance style beats like Tragic Kingdom was. If you're looking for a cd with deep lyrics, etc. then don't buy this cd, but if you want a cd with cool songs that aren't boring to listen to, then this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"All wrong","review":"just so you know the ones that are writing a review of this album, and are stating that all the songs are 15 second loops, didnt actually purchase the album. They are talking about the songs from the album that are in the popular file sharing networks. The songs that are distributed are exactly that, 15 second loops. The real album is not even close to what these people are talking about. So in the future, before you write a review, either purchase the album, or make sur eyou download the correct version of the song. Who in their right mind would release 15 second loops for an entire track????...."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"The good news first - - the music itself I think is an improvement. No Doubt is a band on this CD, not just Gwen's support. But it ends there. Most of the songs consist of a funky little beat with 2-4 lines of lyric...that's it! They repeat the same 2 lines of lyric over and over again, eventually fading out and calling it a song. It's a poor effort, and makes me wonder if they were in a hurry to get the album out...examples: Hella Good, Making Out, Underneath it All, Don't let me Down, Running, In My Head, Platinum Blonde...it goes on...and on...and on...What a disappointment!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On, Rock Steady!","review":"I have always been a fan of NO Doubt, so I bought this CD without hesitation. Many of the critics were saying that the CD was horrible, and not like the rest. Now, I will admit that you do catch a different vibe from Rock Steady, but their initial voice is still there in songs like \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\", \\"Making Out\\", and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". The other songs seem to be fresh and funky, with Gwen's flowing voice. All the songs are great, and I recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a great new CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"thats so great!!!","review":"this No Doubt's CD is so good!! it makes me wanna dance! it keeps me smilling all day long i feel like i wanna run nonstop!! this CD is so GROOVY!! i dont know how could someone who loved No Doubt's other two CDs not to LOVE this one!!well though this CD is really GOOD i have givin it 4 stars cause there's some not-really-good songs... like start the fire.

This is a great CD.","review":"Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn were good, but this CD is great. I'm disgusted with all the music snobs out there that think that a band has to be obscure to be good, and as soon as they've become successful they've sold out. Total BS. This is No Doubt's best album. Every song on this CD is good. The Prince collaboration, Waiting Room, is my least favorite. But everything Gwen wrote is superb. Ignore the whining [people] and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read to see why it is a good album...","review":"First of all, i read alot saying that \\"if you liked 'Tk' and 'ros' stay away from rock steady!\\"... Don't believe it! i'm a fan of no doubt and i have there albums from tragic kingdom up til this album and i like them all. of course this one is SO different from the other two but it's still good and it's not bad as people here claim it is.

Wake me when it's over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"What happened? No Doubt's sold themselves. What happened to the word \\"ska\\" ?! They sound like they're trying to be techno or hip-hop. Maybe change is good for some people, but for No Doubt's change was horrible.The whole album sounds the same. Pop music can just ruin you. Tragic Kingdom was the ultimately the best album. That's where they left their music and turned into.. into what? What happened to the band?What's up with this \\"Hey Baby\\" thing huh? It's sooo annoying. And \\"Hella Good\\" sounds the same. The whole album sounds like it's repeated itself.For those of you who love the album, give it a second listen to.

What happend to No Doubts fun funky style where Gwen did'nt repeat 2 sentences over and over again that talk about \\"keep on dancin\\"? Did they us a pansonic keyboard and a drum machine to make this album?I think they also took some clips out of Nintendo's game Zelda for one track, this album is a complete turn around from anything expected from No Doubt. On they're past albums I could relate to their lyrics, now i feel like im listening to Britney Spears and it makes me sick, if you have been a No Doubt fan in the past, I think you would see where I am coming from. Lets just hope the next album appeals to more than the pop world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably, shockingly, yet not surprisingly BAD","review":"Awful. That's all I can say. The quality of No Doubt's music has gone steadily downhill these past few years, Tragic Kingdom being their springboard into not onky bad work, but shockingly ba work. This album from what used to be a break-out punk/ska band? Excuse me, but I say no. The album is dominated by recycled and unoriginal songs that have no message at all. Can someone please tell me the significance of such crap as \\"Hey Baby\\"? I can't believe this album was allowed to be made. Nothing about it warrants any merit. Gwen Stefani, yet again, dominates the band and music with her highly developed \\"Madonna on Crack\\" performances and dress. All I can say is, this album was a waste of time, and now I realize that being a fan of this band was a waste of time, too. If you have ever liked No Doubt, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not No Doubt","review":"if you really like no doubt, and what they are REALLY about, don't get this cd.

The disk starts out with an intro from the title track Rock Steady, then moves into Hella Good which is just a great song in the first place, then comes Hey Baby, followed by Making Out which is one of the best tracks on the album, you have some more good songs until you get to the song that just shines on the album, Don't Let Me Down, at least that is so in my opinion. You have the single Underneath It All, which is a great song, then you have the new single Running which is the only really ballad on the album. It's just fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"a crash and burn","review":"no doubt's rock steady is a totally different bend in the road. tragic kingdom, return to saturn, the beacon street collection, and no doubt self titled are all 100% better. I loved no doubt, and then rock steady came out. the lyrics are very good, but the music is not my type. on their previous cds, no doubt had a sound that no one else had- now it seems like theyre trying to fit in.... i certinly hope they go back to their old style, the better style, and not more rock steady type cds. hopefully more people will relize that this is a crash and burn, and that no doubt will go back to their ska sounding music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targeted marketing, not music","review":"This album sounds like the songs were written to target different demographic and musical segments.

HOW WRONG WAS I! I skipped along to mvc and bought the album, then wen I got it home I was close to tears it was really that bad. please dont make the same mistake as I did, buy the return of satern instead ull be much better off.I know I have given it 1 star but belive me it's not even worth that.

It's hard to tell when a new song comes on, 'cause they all sound pretty much the same. Very toned down and hard to tolerate. Although some may praise the CD for going into new music territory, I see little reason to congratulate the group for putting it's listeners fast asleep.

The melodies are centered around a handful of notes, typically 1 octave in range, repeating ad nausea. The lyrics are a poor excuse -- Gwen should have just hummed, and spared us the monotony. At least half the songs consist of a SINGLE PHRASE that is repeated 20-30 times, then faded out.Obviously the didn't have enough time to 1) come up with interesting lyrics, 2) come up with exciting melodies, or 3) ponder intros and endings to these songs (several of which just fade in, then fade out). I feel like I'm listening to ELEVATOR MUZAK! (Sorry, No Doubt -- I love your other albums, I do!)Sure looks like they rushed this out for Christmas 2001, to make their record label happy. It won't be spending much time in my CD player..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice chorus...","review":"..but where's the rest of the lyrics?! Every song except for the one's obviously made for radio play (Hella Good and Hey Baby) is one 30 second chorus repeated over and over and over for 4-5 minutes each song. It's so bad that each song fades in and fades out because there is no beginning or end. Where is the musical genious in that? My question is, who decides when to say \\"OK, we've repeated this chorus 37 times, that's perfect! Not 38, that would make it too repeatative\\". It seems to me that Gwen was too busy singing back up on hip-hop songs to spend the time needed to perform on this album, and it shows. The bad thing is that every \\"song\\" is very catchy, and with a little bit of effort put towards more lyrics I would probably be giving Rock Steady 5 stars instead of 1. I'll admit that I was never the biggest fan of this band, but this album has caused me to lose any interest in ever buying another release from them again. No doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't these people in their thirties?","review":"For people as old as they, they have no emotional maturity.

If you close your eyes and make an allegation, someday it might come true...that is, of course, when they wear a little tie clip we're meant to take as a kind of emotional chastity belt.

Personally I'm glad that to see No Doubt is continuing their fine tradition of making each album significantly different than the last, even if I don't like it as much as any of the others.What I'd like to mention is that this CD incorporates copy-protection that for the time being prevents the tracks from being ripped from the CD on a computer. This 'protection' also prevents the tracks from even being played on a computer, and some DVD players (I was only able to get the CD to play on a dedicated stereo or car CD player). I find the fact that it can't be played on a computer particuarly ludicrous considering the 'enhanced CD' features which can ONLY be used on a computer that are included (which by the way work fine, and are a lack-luster screen-saver and the video to Hey Baby). So send a message to the powers that be and don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much MTV influence....","review":"I'm going to have to agree with the reviewer that pointed out the MTV and TRL influences. That can be the only explanation for this disappointing album.I had originally hoped that the atrocious first single \\"Hey Baby\\" was not indicative of the quality of the album. The album as a whole is only a little better than the single. I'm not a music critic at all but this album is missing a lot of the emotion and dare I say maturity of Return to Saturn. Instead, the lazy lyrics and music writing are a giant step backwards to initiate a new generation of Gwenabies that don't expect too much from their music.I really hope Gwen doesn't turn into one of those people that still dresses like a teenager when she is 40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Today's true definition of \\"sell out\\"","review":"You know what? I don't usually whine about bands selling out. I don't feel it's right most of the time. But this is just pitiful.I admit, I used to be a huge fan of No Doubt. I still think most of their other material is some of the best ska-punk of the 90s. Tragic Kingdom and their self-titled are some of the best ska-punk CD's out there. Return to Saturn, although it had some negative signs of turning pop, it still had some awesome songs, like \\"New\\". I then saw Gwen Stefani do a cameo with Eve on her song, and that's when I started worrying. It kind of made me mad. THEN...the first single, \\"Hey Baby\\". The most annoying, stupid song I have ever heard. But, hey...I'm open-minded, so I got the CD, expecting that the first single was just to get attention from the media. BUT...the rest of the CD was just as annoying and bad.So, my point is, after being as open-minded as anyone in the world could be, I STILL call it sell-out material. Sorry No Doubters."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is...","review":"Gwen has gone from lyrics like \\"Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin', so please stop explaining, don't tell me cause it hurts\\" to \\"All the girl wanna get with the boys, and the boys really like it\\". No matter what she says, Gwen is not the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Baby- This Stinks!","review":"What a load of ...- this isn't music, this is a lot of people (who can't \\"sing\\") who just want to say \\"hey baby\\" over and over and over and over... I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY THIS! I have not listened to any other No Doubt CDs, and, judging from this one, I don't intend to any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"When I first heard \\"Hey Baby,\\" I groaned and thought that it must be the new Britney Spears single. How horrified was I to find that it was the newest release from No Doubt? The plethora of producers brought in to work on this album only serve to give the album a confused identity, and it becomes more and more obvious that this little group from Anaheim survives off the charm of Gwen, and not on the strength of their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"No, this is not NO Doubt. This CD is one of the worst CDs I have. There are only 2 songs that I like, and even those songs get old after listening to them a couple times. All the songs sound like pure pop, not hard rock. Even Avril Laveign is closer to rock than these songs. What ever happened to the good songs like \\"Just a Girl\\" and \\"Excuse Me\\". I think this group needs to give up on the whole \\"pop\\" thing and go back to what they were good at. ROCK."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!!","review":"I have heard of no doubt's pervious album, BUT Rock Steady is better and the best of all. In this album, you can hear a lot of energy from Gwen. All the songs are good. My faviorite song is \\"Running.\\" The lyrics in the song is excellent. No Doubt is a great band. Gwen's performance is increadiable. i love her style. She can wear anything and it will look good on her. This album is a must have. No Doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME THIRD RELEASE-NO DOUBT-UNSTOPPABLE","review":"This album proves that No Doubt still is just as popular as they were when they released their first album, Tragic Kingdom. Their style of music has always been superior. Gwen Stefani is a wonderful lead singer with a great group of guys to back her. The album ROCK STEADY is definately not a let down, it is very upbeat. The album starts with a short intro then goes into HELLA GOOD which is a great song, it is full of dance grooves and Gwen's great singing voice. Also HEY BABY is great, this album just makes you want to get up and dance yourself into a frenzy.From Tragic Kingdom to Return of Saturn and now Rock Steady I think No Doubt will keep on Rocking Steady on the top of the charts for years and years, They deliver wonderful and never disappointing material every time. A must have along with their other previous releases all of which are carried with me every day to work for listening pleasure at work and in the car.Ginger Greene"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed for the Worse....","review":"The Britney Shadow unfortunatly has Gwen and the gang in its clutches....It has also captured The Vengaboys (suprisingly) and, more tragically, P!nk. As I understand, No Doubt tries to make each of thier albums different, thier first two albums ska, and Return of Saturn rock with a small amount of rap, but now they have stooped to the lowest terms, pop. The lyrics in the songs are just plain stupid, and music videos show Gwen galaventing around like an [crazy person]. I give some credit to the song H*lla Good. When I listen to the music on this C-D I dont even pay much attention to the lyrics, but on thier first albums I listen closely to what they say...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any way you look at this album, it is just plain old bad.","review":"Is it because No Doubt has moved on and left its old fans behind?

The songs have unintelligent lyrics and don't really say much about anything. You don't even need to listen to the CD to tell this, just look at the song titles. \\"Making Out\\"? \\"Platinum Blond Life\\"? I mean, come on! Music is supposed to be an expression that makes you think. These songs are fit for a seventh grade dance. Real rock fans will know that \\"Rock Steady\\" is a (...) imitation that is trying to appeal to a pop and rock audience. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible disapointment...","review":"As a huge Gwen Stephani fan, I am shocked that she would release this with her name on it. Every song has one verse or phrase that is good, but unfortunately, all that happens is that phrase is repeated over and over again. There is no originality within any song. It's as if you're listening to a broken record. The single \\"Hey Baby\\" isn't bad, but the rest of the album is not anywhere near the talent the world knows Gwen has."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst than ever","review":"....ok when I heard their first 3 album I liked them....but this is a totally wrong thing....it dkfkfj"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR","review":"I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD. I WAS SENT A BURNED COPY AND NOT THE ORIGINAL. I FEEL THAT THE SELLER DEFINATELY MISREPRESENTED HIMSELF AND DID IT PURPOSELY."},{"rating":"1","title":"drives you mad!","review":"This is one of those albums that can drive you crazy. It contains a couple of the best songs No Doubt have ever done (\\"Hella Good\\", \\"Waiting Room\\"), but it's balanced off by a handful of the worst tracks they've ever laid down (leading the way in this category is the immediately grating first single, \\"Hey Baby\\"). Maybe I'm in the minority, but I thought Return Of Saturn was a really strong CD and a great direction for the band. I feel like this is a step backward for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compare this to the older stuff","review":"No Doubt was my all time favorite band. I discovered TK two years ago, and I was hooked. I instantly got ROS, Beacon Street, and their self titled. They were a ska band back then, with some punk influences. They had music you could rock out to.Hey Baby is a really weird song. It sounds like a high pitched Britney or something. THIS ALBUM IS POP. Pop can be good sometimes (barely ever though) but this is sellout-pop. When you were ska and punk, and suddenly go pop because the loyal fans are getting older and the teenyboppers rule the world, you are selling out.I don't hate ND. I still listen to Beacon Street and ROS and enjoy it. But I know that when I go to their concert in October I probably won't sing too much Rock Steady, and hopefully they'll do much more old stuff... I doubt it though. So now my favorite band is Radiohead, who I know will definitely not go pop, and it comforts me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wher Has No Doubt Gone?","review":"I was never a big No Doubt fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed Tragic Kingdom. ... after listening [to this album], I have dtermined this cd a piece of junk.

I think it's excellent that No Doubt have experimented with a new style- it's worked.The songs on \\"Rock Steady\\" are by far my favourites by No Doubt, I especially like \\"Hella Good\\" \\"Underneath It All\\" and \\"Making Out\\".The reggae vibes felt on this album are amazing, the only song I dislike is \\"Rock Steady\\"- it's a bit too slow and boring.\\"Start The Fire\\" sounds very unusual as does \\"Waiting Room\\", but in a good way.\\"Rock Steady\\" might be a misguiding title but the album is still one of the finest of 2002 (although it came out last year!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok...not as good as Tragic Kingdom!","review":"I gave this rating a 2-star because there are still some good tracks in this song such as \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Underneath it All\\", but other than that all the other songs are really not that good to listen to.Some of the songs are really annoying such as \\"Detective\\" and \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\". After listening to their previous albums such as \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and \\"Return To Saturn\\", this cd seemed like a get down for the fans. Songs like \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" were classics compared to the songs in this album! This album is more of pop than rock, which doesnt suit them very well.So, listen to this album only of you are a die'hard No Doubt fan, otherwise your not missing much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is really bad!!!","review":"Okay. I bought this CD thinking it would be the best thing in the world. Tragic Kindom and Return of Saturn kick [butt]...Sorry to say but...Rock Steady really stinks! It sounds all regae and jamacan and the sound is sooooo annoying! It's like \\"beep bop boop weenie weenie\\". It sounds like a freaking video game! This CD may be okay to play at a big party when no one is paying attention to the music. When I heard \\"Hey Baby\\", I liked it but it gets annoying after awhile and so do all of the other songs on the CD. \\"Hey Baby\\" is the best song on the CD but I don't recommend buying this. You'd be better off downloading it. Don't waste your money--you will be very disappointed. If you really want the CD, you should hear it first. ::gag:: I feel bad trashing No Doubt's CD because they totally rock!

I bought it and was so happy that it was like the best No Doubt album out so far as well as Tragic Kingdom which I need to pick up. You got to pick up this cd like all the songs rock. I also love 9: Running, 8: Start The Fire, 10: In My Head as well as many others just check it out it's the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well planned masterpiece","review":"The illiterate fools above me absolutely do not under any circumstances know what they are talking about. This is an extremely well planned masterpiece. I reccomend it to anyone who likes No Doubt. There is a variation compared to their other music, but change is good. If you listen to the words they are very intrigueing. Obviously the reviewers above me maybe listened to half of the songs and did not give any thought of what they were listening to. All of No Doubt show their dedication and love for music in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"This cd was no good I love no doubt but this was horrible they totally sold out like smash mouth, the goo goo dolls, and the offspring.

They need to be ska there arent any trumpets in it any more"},{"rating":"1","title":"....What happened?!","review":"This is the biggest showcase of what money, fame, and glory can warp a band into something totally different (and in this case, HORRIBLE).I mean I will admit, even though I didn't really like No Doubt before, I enjoyed a few of their songs (never bought any of their albums though) and I respected them for being individuals and playing something new in an age of processed bands. But now, the band has degenerated to minor keyboards lines and videos of nothing but Gwen Steffani. The band might as well change their name to Gwen Steffani, because that's who's getting all the attention and recognition for this 'music'.This band went to the generally unheard-of genre of ska, to dance and RAP music?! How did this happen?Oh well, another year, another good band commercialized. Too bad, really..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This Cd is very different than what I expected. But I welcome the energy on this album. It reminds me of an 80's record. Full of fun up tempo songs that you can dance to and sing along with. No doubt has come through again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Steady: different, but \\"good\\" different","review":"No Doubt's fourth release, the up-beat electro-reggae \\"Rock Steady\\", may take some time to adjusting to but it's well worth the effort of listening to and trying to figure out whether you should mosh or grind to No Doubt's somewhat new sound.\\"Rock Steady\\" compared to their previous albums obviously has a drastically different sound. But don't let that mislead you into thinking that No Doubt has lost it's originality. No Doubt keeps their \\"fun ska\\" style but adds some new elements, such as reggae and a trippy keyboard, to make a happy, dance-able album.Stefani is no more coping with growing older and finding herself like in \\"Return of Saturn\\". In \\"Rock Steady\\", she's just looking to get down."},{"rating":"1","title":"one song","review":"I've heard \\"Hey Baby\\" on the radio and absolutely love the song.However after listening to the samples of the other songs online, I surely won't pay the bucks for this CD.Of course the durations of the samples leave a lot to be desired.But what should I do -- hope for the best? Nah, I'll save my money and \\"maybe\\" buy the single if/when it comes out. That is doubtful as well. I don't like an entire CD platter for a single song even if it's great.VERY INTERESTING that they have used CDs for sale when this thing was only released a few days ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!! A Solid 2002 CD Release","review":"I was so happy to hear that No Doubt had a new album coming out. I am not a huge fan, but I really enjoy their stuff. This is the first album I have heard all year that was actually worth the $.... Maybe I'm buying the wrong stuff, but most other releases this year have be Ho Hum. This is a Really Really Good Album. Songs like \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Hella Good,\\" and \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" are just awesome songs. However, \\"Waiting Room\\" is the best song I have heard all year. It was worth the CD just for that one song!!! I will confess I am a huge Prince fan, so it helps that he produced and sings in it. The only thing that keeps me from giving a big 5 stars is a few songs are kinda weak, but the title track \\"rock steady\\" is the worst song. Not an aweful song, just very average on an otherwise excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the party started!","review":"I own all 5 of No Doubt's albums, and this is just another masterpiece! It may not have songs as deep as \\"don't speak\\" or \\"simple kind of life\\", but it does have a lot of upbeat, positive party songs, and a few meaningful lyrics here and there. I'm glad that No Doubt tried something new (and it worked). If every album sounded the same, people would get bored of them. So you should definitely check out this album, it's worth every single penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On","review":"I must say, this is definitely NOT what I expected from No Doubt. Their past two major releases were stunning, and this one more than lives up to the others. Lyrically, it's fantastic. Gwen and the boys have matured a great deal since Return of Saturn. Artistically - wow. After being together for so long, No Doubt continues to keep their sound fresh. They could've played it save by sticking to what they knew, but they took a huge risk by incorporating a reggae influenced sound. \\"Hey Baby\\" sounds exactly lik the No Doubt we know and love, but the rest of the album is fresh, new and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!!","review":"This is the best CD I've heard in quite a while.

I'm Truly Dissappointed!!!","review":"I have always been a No Doubt fan, ever since Tragic Kingdom, their first big success.

What happened to the skaw-grunge-great rock sound known to the bands earlier success??? That was the No Doubt that I loved, and will always love! To me this record is a true sell-out!!! It sounds like all the other hip-hoppy-poppy junk out there! with songs like \\"hella good\\" and \\"making out\\" and not to mention \\"hey baby\\" give me a break! I only hope the real No Doubt comes back soon, I really liked them!!! Oh, if you like No Doubt, do not buy this record!

I love the new sounds and highly reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCK STEADY ROCKS !!!","review":"No Doubt's latest album is great. It is much better than the nonsense being produced today. They have successfuly put together hip-hip- regeea and 80's new wave and make it sound excellent. I would highly recommend this record. I have the great pleasure of hearing the band perform the album live at Cornell U and it reenforced my opinion of the album. All the songs on the album are great. I also loved Return of Saturn. I can't understand why no one loved their last album wasn't a bigger hit or why this one isn't in the top five albums on billboard. I think they are one of the most underrated artists out today.ROCK STEADY RULES !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock Steady is NOT Steady....","review":"....it's more like floundering.I've been a fan of No Doubt since their 1995 release \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" which was PHENOMONAL. Return of Saturn (2000) was a mediocre disc, and so I eagerly awaited their next release.When I first heard the song \\"Hey Baby\\", I was thinking \\"This is a hit- the cd must be awesome. They're experimenting with a new style; this is cool\\". Little did I know that 'experimenting with a new style (styleS is more like it)' meant totally abandoning their ska roots which hooked so many of their fans in the first place.There are a few tracks which are good- Hey Baby, and the predictable current single Hella Good- which totally preaches of this band's need to please. They used to be an original, inventive, and upcoming band. Now that they've hit the big time, they've decided that original is not always good.So, No Doubt, if you ever read any of these reviews, please take a hint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesone","review":"I love No Doubt. Great Record. True to Rock Steady sound in Jamaican music. Was even recorded in Jamaica."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"No Doubt's newest album, Rock Steady, was a big change from some of No Doubt's earlier albums like Tragic Kingdom. The style of this album is more centered on techno and electronic beats, instead of their usual ska-punk-pop sound. Gwen's voice on some of the tracks sounds like Pink, while on others it sounds like Nelly Furtado. A fair amount of the tracks were very tedious and repetitive, often having the same verses over and over again, with no change in the beat or the backround music. Their music seems to be aimed more at the mainstream pop market than any other markets. I found this album dissapointing and not refelctive of No Doubt's many talents they have shown through their earlier music."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"You can picture the scene really can't you?

Don't expect the same old, same old, warmed up and served in an effort to create a commercial success. 'Rock Steady' is a move from No Doubt's ska-punk past into experimentations with grooves and new sounds, without completely forgetting their roots. It's new, it's edgy, and it's utterly different!

But now I got two of their albums, and I have to say, these guys rock! Hey Baby has probably got to be their best single yet, and this album, probably their best too, next to Tragic Paradise. If you're into music from Sum 41, Blink 182 or AAF, then you'll probably love No Doubt too, Gwen ahs an amazing voice, she could probably perform any kind of song with it, from Pop to RnB.And can some1 plz tell me, is it true that they're splitting!?!?!Well, c ya l8rz, luv ya No Doubt!Kirsty xxx"},{"rating":"1","title":"....you're kidding, right?","review":"I remember 1995-96.

Listen to anything off of Tragic Kingdom and then \\"Hey Baby\\" back-to-back. Don't you try to tell me they didn't sell out. Oh, and let's not forget the lyrics. \\"All the boys say hey baby, hey baby, hey!\\" I'm sorry, but isn't this the band that PROTESTED sexism eight years ago in \\"Just a Girl\\"?

Musically, the album is really good at times, but Gwen's slow and quiet vocals just don't seem to match up with what the band is trying to do...on two or three tracks. This could've more appropriately called a Gwen Stefani album, and it looks like that is going to be their ticket to success because all they've got to do is make a couple of videos and the album is going to be a smash...indeed, I'm sure that it already is.Color me disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Described!!

All the other bolts were about 1/2 too short to grab onto the block.Based on the description, \\" For Select Ford 289-302 Aluminum Applications\\", I would think it would fit my Bronco, but apparently not. I gave two stars because I should have contacted the manufacture about whether it would fit or not, but I needed new bolts in a hurry and I couldn't find any info online. These bolts are high quality, so if they fit, they would be awesome, but I have no idea what 302s they fit because they don't fit mine.I'm very disappointed I spent 55 dollars to only use 5 bolts but at least 1 of the bolts I that did work replaced one of my corroded ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality","review":"I ordered this for my harley tool bag and up in SD.

Sam Hooker kept calling himself Nascar man, over and over and over and over again. Get the picture?Give this a wide berth.I've just heard there is going to be a follow-up novel - Motormouth.

No 30 year old woman is anything like that and I cringed as I read passages. Evanovich is a long way past writing young characters.

But when she misspelled Talladega (she had Taledega pg 104 line 16) it was ruined for me being a NASCAR fanatic. The stereotyping of every character was another annoyance, the Hispanics, the gays, the \\"NASCAR guy\\" all stereotyped horribly, even the crime family was stereotyped...it was a story full of clich��s one after another.

The lead character Barney is much more macha than Stephanie and has spent time car racing, fixing engines, kickboxing and other unsual things. So, when the Cuban mafia is on her trail, she's a lethal weapon that they can't control.I rather prefer Stephanie's more feminine way of getting things done, but Barney is a hoot, especially when she joins forces with her gay friend Judey. The romantic lead, Hooker, spends most of his time being a narcissistic jerk, so it's a little hard to accept his sudden heroism. And some of the coincidences and rescues remind me of the cavalry coming around the corner--a little too neat to be believed.Still, I enjoyed the change of scenery and the witty dialog.

I hope she writes another Barnaby book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD SAME OLD","review":"IF YOU HAVE READ ANY OF EVANOWICH OTHER BOOKS THEN YOU HAVE READ THIS ONE TOO BECAUSE IT HAS THE SAME PLOT, SAME HEROINE (BUT WITH A DIFFENT NAME) AND THE SAME LAUGHS.

IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE OF IT'S SIMILARITY WITH HER OTHER BOOKS BUT I DID FINISH IT, THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense,Love,Mystery All in ONE!","review":"This was a good one! I read this book while waiting on the next installment of the Stephanie Plum series, and found that it is just as funny and just as hard to put down. The self centered race car driver who thinks he is gods gift, made for some gut busting laughs and hefty eye rolling. EXCELLENT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex races time to locate her brother","review":"Fans of Janet Evanovich will readily acknowledge her penchant for mixing fast-paced murder mystery with intrigue and female savvy in a cocktail of adventure that doesn't fail to shine in her latest Metro Girl. A brother's disappearance prompts Alex to search Florida for his return, involving a survey of possible hit men, NASCAR racing, and boating alike. The action just doesn't quit as Alex races time to locate her brother and ventures into international hot waters in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"This is *maybe* a little weaker than the Plum series, but it's not bad at all. I was looking for something nice, relaxing, funny, and entertaining to read, and I got it. Yes, it may be not very realistic - but non of the Plum books are either. I was not looking for a serious mystery/detective novel. Anyway - I read all 10 Plum books, and I still enjoyed this one. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanely bad","review":"Let me start out by saying I love the Stephanie Plum series and read all 16 of them in a month. This book however was stupid. The NASCAR Guy references were idiotic and offensive. The references to the gay character were stereotypical and offensive. The fact that a full cast of characters materialized out of the woodwork was mind boggling. I made it through four chapters and couldn't read any more. I skipped to the last chapter and the epilogue. That was more than enough for me. I bought the second in the series and plan to return it.Now I see that Evanovich is starting another series with a main character named Diesel -- hello, already used the name in the between the numbers Plum books. Not even going to pick that one up. She needs to get a little more creative and go back to the first 8 Plum books and see what made those so great because these books and the most recent Plum books have really missed them mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alex Barnaby","review":"Janet Evanovich's new series introduces Alex Barnaby, a big sister out to rescue her missing brother. Several stolen cars and one hot NASCAR driver later, the brother is rescued and now it's the NASCAR driver's turn to rescue Alex, just in time to end the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun","review":"My Mom recommended the Plum series and after reading One for the Money, I've been hooked... eh, addicted even. While the Plum story line remains my favorite, this was a fun- very Evanovich read. Check it out, you'll love the quirky but strong female characters. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BOOK","review":"IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN THIS AND ANOTHER BOOK, CHOOSE THE OTHER.WHAT IS THE AUTHOR'S FIXATION WITH NASCAR AND WHY DOES SHE HATE IT SO MUCH THAT SHE PRODUCES THE TEDIOUS NASCAR GUY.I COULDN'T CONNECT WITH EITHER HOOKER OR BARNEY AND I WOULDN'T READ ANY MORE IN THIS SERIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Metro Girl a miss","review":"Ugh, what a ridiculous book. Very annoying characters and hopeless muddled storyline.This is the first book I have read written by Janet Evanovich, and I doubt I would ever buy another. At least, not with these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"Not funny, not clever and insulting.I am Hispanic. I live in Florida. I am a woman. I do not work in a cigar factory. This book is totally insulting to Hispanics. It is also insulting to gays. I thought society and authors had moved on from using racial or sexual stereotypes for cheap laughs.How old is Janet Evanovich? She writes as if it is the 1960s in terms of the Hispanics in Florida. The women don't all roll cigars, and never did. We don't carry guns in our purses. My mother is a doctor, my father a professor, I am a surgeon, my sister is a lawyer, my brother is a pharmacist. Yes, we are all originally from Cuba and not a gun between us.However, the racial stereotyping wasn't the worst of this book. Nascar man was, without doubt, the worst idea an author has had since the middle ages.The writing was lazy, repetitive and used the same jokes over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks worse then exhaust from a 76 Vega","review":"I have never read anything by Ms. Evanovich before reading this so I don't have her other stories to compare to but I can say this isn't a good one to start with. I give it one star for the overall story. If she would have left out the 15 times a page reference to NASCAR in the first 5 chapters it might have not been so bad. But when she misspelled Talladega (she had Taledega pg 104 line 16) it was ruined for me being a NASCAR fanatic. The stereotyping of every character was another annoyance, the Hispanics, the gays, the \\"NASCAR guy\\" all stereotyped horribly, even the crime family was stereotyped...it was a story full of clich��s one after another. The story had potential (if you took out the NASCAR and stereotypes and clich��s) but it fell flat with the ending. It was so unbelievable and so forced it sucked the air out of me. And to think this is going to be a series for her. I can hardly hold back my enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take A Pass on the Metro","review":"Note - I think the book might have been better if I read it myself. I listened to the audio version and found the voices of the characters to be incredibly unappealing - particularly that Nascar guy who referred to himself as \\"Nascar Guy.\\" That got old really fast.The Plum and Full books are much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unbelieveable and juvenille","review":"This was terrible. I am giving it 2 stars cause I normally like Evanovich books (i.e., the Stephanie Plum series) but this book sounds like a high schooler wrote it. The plot was so unbelievable that I cannot believe a publisher would agree to print this. The Hooker character was extremely obnoxious. It made me hate NASCAR. Who goes around calling themselves Nascar Guy like it was some kind of superhero? I hope I never hear the word NASCAR again because of this book.Nothing in this book is even remotely possible. The entire storyline was so over the top that I couldnt wait to just finsh it and move on to a better book. I only read the entire thing because it was all I had with me on a long train ride. I really wished I had purchased the In Touch and Star magazines instead.Anyway, read the Stephanie Plum series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious characters - embarrassingly bad book","review":"I can hardly believe that this is from the same writer that gave us the Stephanie Plum Series. Ok, the Plum series has become a bit stale, but Metro Girl is absolutely terrible.Barny and Sam are the sort of people you would leave town to avoid. I'd never want to read any book about them again. The whole story was written for 10-12 year olds, not adults. If you are stupid you may like it. I can't believe anyone, adult or teenager, would think it an acceptable book.They don't come much worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metro Girl - should be titled \\"Made You Hurl\\"","review":"Only suitable for the trash can.I disagree that men would prefer this book than women. Crap is crap, no matter what gender, age or sexual orientation you are.It starts bad, gets worse and then rallies onto to an....even more implausible and stupid ending.Sad to think that books this bad can get published.I used to laugh at my wife's Evanovich books, even though the bounty hunter ones are basically all the same, and became boring. Metro Girl plumbs new depths and we are both agreed this is the last Evanovich we'll buy.You couldn't pay me to read anything by Janet Evanovich now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Plum","review":"Pleasent, but not laugh out loud, it's a bit disappointing when you expect the wonderful humor and pizazz of her Stephanie Plum series. Metro Girl is just not up to that fun - but is worth reading. I think I might wait to buy it in paperback when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book ever written, but comes close","review":"I can't understand all the hype about how good Janet Evanovich's books are. This book was really poorly written and it certainly wasn't a page turner. Every time I forced myself to pick it up again I had forgotten who the characters were because I didn't care about them.I would never read another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time!","review":"Because I love the Stephanie Plum books I knew I would love this one too and my finance purchased it for me. Boy was I wrong, this book was given to me I believe in late November or the beginning of December and I haven't finished it yet and I usually finish in a few hours. It is so boring and I feel like reading \\"NASCAR GUY\\" over and over again is the most annoying thing in this world. I try to read a few pages every few days but it is hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Didnt even finish it. I had no emotional investment in any of the characters. Needed more character development. By the middle of the book, I realized that I didnt really care what happened to these characters so I put the book down and never picked it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unbelievable","review":"I picked up this book hoping it would be similar to the Stephanie Plum series, but this was just boring. Not to mention the situations the characters found themselves in were totally unbelievable. Who's going to go out for crabs when there are killers on the loose looking for you? Better yet, why would you sit in an unlocked car waiting for your crabs when killers are on the loose? I did not find NASCAR guy attractive at all, the story line was lame, and really, the only likable character is Judey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"There are some very funny scenes in this book in which I could not stop laughing. However read this on it's own without any expectations from the Plum books, because thinking any book would replace the Plums is kind of unrealistic. As a stand alone novel, this is some pretty good chic-lit for the beach or the park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely forgettable...","review":"To start out, I am a big Stephanie Plum fan, although Janet seems to be running out of ideas for that series. I read Metro Girl soon after it came out. Let's just say that I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it, because I couldn't hardly read it, it was so boring. I have re-read the Stephanie series numerous times and never get bored from it, but reading Metro Girl once was more than enough. I seriously don't even remember what it was about. I can't believe Janet has expanded the series. She has too much on her plate, no wonder Stephanie has grown stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"A librarian suggested I read a Janet Evanovich book.character development: all the characters were too cutesy by 200%. Not just cutesy, but annoying.Plot: equally annoying reminiscent of bad movies or bad tv shows where the cute heroine is always screaming but manages to disarm an A-bomb, ride a motorcycle off a moving semi, and still get the cute hunky guy in the endThis book is strictly for the \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" set"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"I've loved everything I've read by Evanovitch--till this! I got to page 100, and I decided that life is too short to waste on this drivel! Thank God that all I invested in Metro Girl was a trip to the library and not the price of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"This was the first Janet Evanovich book I've ever read and it will be the last. \\"Metro Girl\\" was silly to the extreme, with implausible situations and nonsensical, repetitive dialogue. (Everyone who meets Barney tells her how hot she looks, and \\"NASCAR Guy\\" refers to himself as \\"NASCAR Guy\\" a hundred times). Not funny, just annoying. This book is the sort of pure fluff that might entertain a 13 year old. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"METRO GIRL - What utter rubbish","review":"I am a big Stephanie Plum fan but this Barnaby character was absolutely awful, I would think twice before buying another Janet Evanovich novel. It was pure drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed...","review":"Janet has clearly been influenced by money and her own press. Ten was bad, Metro was worse, and who can imagine how bad Eleven will be? Janet has obviously given up any thought of quality for money.Metro Girl was simple, silly, and stupid-- the ending came completely out of the blue, without any groundwork other than NASCAR GUY, whom she insinuates is modeled after Dale, Jr. in talks. An insult for any real NASCAR fan, because the character comes across as a complete moron. If he has any \\"hairs,\\" as they say in the South, Dale will pull any and all support for this pitiful endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"Like some of the other reviewers I was totally irritated by the constant \\"NASCAR guy\\" references. I began to check how many pages I could get through without reading the word \\"NASCAR\\". I was looking forward to this book because Stephanie Plum was getting a bit same old, same old, but now I would welcome Stephanie back with open credit card. NASCAR guy and Barney were like cardboard cutouts....so not real."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful book!","review":"Complete and utter crap. Sam Hooker aka Nascar guy and Alex (Barney) Barnaby are very poorly developed characters and I would never read anything with them in again. I had numerous attempts at finishing this book because it annoyed me so much. Normally I read a book from cover to cover in one sitting, even if it means staying up half the night. I hated wasting my time on this, but hopefully my review will prevent others buying Metro Girl.I hope there are no more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I agree with one of the previous reviewers - you will have no emotional investment in this book as far as the characters are concerned. On top of that, the dialogue is ridiculous and unbelievable, the plot is predictable, and the writing is terrible. Too many \\"he said\\" \\"she said.\\" And we all know how an elevator works - you don't have tell us they waited for the doors to open, walked inside, pressed the button, went down, then got off when the doors opened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely horrible","review":"This is my first, and likely my last, book by Janet Evanovich. After seeing her on Good Morning America promoting this book, I was dying to read it. From the way she described the book, it sounded incredible. Not the case at all.To me, her writing style was horrible. It reminded me of something a child in Grade 4 would write.I think the plot may have had potential but the events in the story were just too rediculous to ever believe.I think I'll stick to a real author - James Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metro Girl","review":"This has got to be the worse read yet. I have read all her other books and loved them. If I would have seen the phrase \\"nascar guy\\" one more time, I would have burned the book. I would not waste my money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"Classic story of famous author churning out words because her name sells. Unfortunately for us that it. The words in this book would have been better unwritten.If I ever hear the words \\"NASCAR Man\\" again I will personally go and throttle the author. As for Barney from Baltimore. Where on earth in Baltimore are there women like that? Not in the Baltimore I've grown up in, that's for sure.If your IQ is in single digits, you might find this slightly amusing. Unfortunately with the onset of old age, I'm afraid Mrs Evanovich's must have gone senile, because no adult would write this drivel.I can't remember a worse book - ever!!!!!!Try James Patterson, Tami Hoag, Sandra Brown in fact anyone except Evanovich and Metro Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh -","review":"Nothing is more revealing than an author pumping out fodder for the masses rather than writing a decent book. It is awful to see Mrs Evanovich has joined this throng of pulp producers and it is particularly sad for her fans. There is nothing to redeem this book. A jumble of stories, one dimensional characters, suggestive comments, humorous(?) asides, trite and unrewarding.If I were on life support and someone was reading this to me, I would prefer to have the plug pulled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been left in the slush pile","review":"A total mismash. I am really surprised this book was written by an established author. Perhaps Janet Evanovich wrote this years ago and it has just been published before of the popularity of her other books.I think most readers would be disappointed with this book. The reading public is more sophisticated now, and relying on childish pranks doesn't cut it anymore. I never warmed towards the characters and I couldn't care if they survived or not. I particularly did not like Nascar man. Alex Barney was someone I wouldn't want to read about again.I haven't read any of Janet Evanovich's other books, but I would not pick one up now. There are so many good authors to choose from, I am shocked that people actually buy Evanovich's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I couldn't even finish it","review":"Total crap. Relies on schoolyard gags like fake dog poo. Really awful characters - Barney and Nascar Man are vomit inducing.I threw it out without finishing it. I have never done that with a book before, but it was so bad, I couldn't bring myself to endure another word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Readable","review":"I'm sorry. I tried. There wasn't much to grab you with this book. Definitely not up to the Stephanie Plum books and I think I really enjoyed the \\"Full\\" series Janet Evanovich writes with Charlotte Hughes better than Metro Girl. With the Plum books there is sexy Ranger and Joe Morelli. With Metro girl - Hooker in no way inspires lust or like and halfway thru the book the term \\"NASCAR Guy\\" was really starting to get on my nerves. I hope she wasn't modelling Hooker on Earnhart Jr. because it really wasn't a very good compliment to Earnhart the way Hooker comes across in the book. No, pass on the hardback edition and if you really feel you have to - buy the paperback or get it from the second hand store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Metro Girl was recommended by Amazon","review":"I have never written a review before, but I am so angry that Amazon recommended this stupid book to me.I bought it on their recommendation after reading the first spotlight review.I wish I had read the reviews by readers (not those paid to review it).Amazon must think I have a brain the size of a pea. This book insults my intelligence.It was banal, childish piffle.I will never buy a book on Amazon's recommendation again.Amazon's recommending this book has more to do with reducing stockpiles and recovering a margin on the books, not about what the reader will enjoy.This is definitely a no star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of the Plum Series.. Run out and buy them books the day they come out.I opened Metro Girl with an open mind, knowing this was a new character, a new series.There just seem to be many holes.. In Plum Books, there is so much more detail. This seems rushed. Many times I had to flip back to see if I missed a page. The plot is good, but I think that Barney, Hooker, Rosa, Felicia, Bill and Crew need a bit more backround. I don't feel like I know them. Its hard not to compare the 2 series, because its the same author. The style, detail etc, should be comparable.She is going to start writing 2 books a year, hopefully this series will get better and Stephanie and crew won't suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. I have read everything this author has written and this is so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Stephanie and it's no good","review":"I just don't think there's enough in this to support another book, although at the end of the book that's clearly what the author's intending. The action (not very plausible) overwhelms the character development and it is the characters, not the plots (not Ms Evanovich's strength) that have supported the Stephanie series this far. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As It Gets","review":"The only thing good about this book was that a friend gave it to me for free.The writing was pre-adolescent stream of consciouness. The characters were one dimensional, the plot was thinner than Kleenex and I have read better humor on a bathroom stall."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Janet thinkin?","review":"I'm a HUGE Plum fan and have been waiting anxiously for the release of Metro Girl. Janet Evanovich is the only author who I will spend the extra money for hardback. This book was a huge disappointment. I had to force myself to read it which is so surprising! I was irritated with practically every character in the book. It's like Janet Evanovich tried TOO hard to make the people funny and it flopped. The love interest was the most annoying character that I have ever read (and I read a lot!). I cannot believe that I am giving my favorite author one star but this book read like it was written in 1 day.I understand that she was trying something different than Plum but at least give us a likable characters and a good story. She bombed on both with Metro Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie Plum's Alter Ego: blonde, Baltimorian, and boring","review":"Janet Evanovich promised her fans a brand new character. What we got was Stephanie Plum as a race car driver/mechanic with blonde hair. Worse: Alex is not nearly half as interesting as Plum, but Janet Evanovich works way too hard to try to make her to be.The writing is not as natural as the Plum novels. The storyline a bit contrived. And confusing. The love and/or sex story? Nothing like what we have with Stephanie, Joe, and Ranger.I am severely disappointed in this much-anticipated novel. Instead of handing us Alex Barnaby, Ms. Evanovich's time would've been much better spent expanding on the story she gave us a few years ago with Visions of Sugar Plums. Instead of Alex, she could have followed up on the story she started with Mary Alice. Now THAT was interesting.Alex... not so much. Sorry, Janet. I really wanted to like this one, but it was an extreme disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Janet Evanovich's talent","review":"I am a Janet Evanovich fan - love all of her Stephanie Plum series and full house series. Eagerly, I bought Metro Girl as soon as it hit the store and, boy, was I disappointed! It lacked the humor and zip of the Plum series. I plodded through the whole book hoping it would get better, and, at one point, I thought if I read \\"NASCAR guy\\" one more time I was going to either upchuck or start tearing the pages out. I guess this was an attempt to be funny but it sure got old in a hurry. Seemed like \\"NASCAR guy\\" was uttered on just about every page - maybe more than once per page."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was so eager to read this book I bought it and started it the same day, it's been a week now and I just can't continue it's a drudge and I'm returning it. Nascar guy come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - don't buy this book","review":"Slow down Janet. You are pumping out the books too fast. Metro Girl reeks of you trying too hard to be funny and missing by a mile.This book isnt funny, and it certainly isnt clever. It is just plain stupid from the main characters through to the supporting characters. They are all the cookie cutter stereotypes taken directly from Janet's other books, but paler, weaker more annoying imitations. and the book has a really stupid series of plots and situations.Get a fashion consultant circa 2006, no-one dresses like your characters any more.This book made me so angry when I read it as she gets so many things wrong and she tries too hard to make the characters quirky and loveable. They are the opposite. They are boring, annoying and completely repulsive like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"An absolutely nothing book. Easy to put down and very forgettable. In fact I have forgotten most of it, except that nascar man was awful beyond belief. Barny was not a good character. Lots of action, all unbelievable. A stupid book for stupid people by a below par author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Flirty Formula Fiction","review":"Barney (aka Alexandra Barnaby) is no Stephanie Plum. She's a competent auto mechanic, not an amusingly incompetent bounty hunter. And Sam Hooker might not be as mysterious or as hot as Ranger, but he's blond and drives a racing car, which is good enough for me. Although the characters are different, Janet Evanovich's ingredients are similar: fast action and flirtatious dialog, or should it be flirtatious action and fast dialog? Does it matter if we're having fun?If you are looking for deep depressing literature that mumbles on about the meaning of life, find another book. This book is about Florida and one, just one of my favorite scenes, is where Barney gets her hair caught in the door handle of the Mini Cooper and Hooker has to explain to the policeman how it happened. Choice, really choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"why NASCAR?","review":"I am disappointed in an Evanovich book for the first time. I love her books and I love NASCAR. Silly me, I thought there would be some connection. Every time Hooker referred to himself as \\"NASCAR guy\\" I thought I would lose my lunch. Never would a true racecar driver refer to himself as \\"NASCAR guy\\". Really gross. Had I not been all excited about a new Evanovich book coming out and the big lead up that it had something to do with racing, maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed. I am 3/4 of the way through the book and so far, other than just mentioning racing two or three times, there has been no connection. Janet, why didn't you just leave NASCAR out of it completely? If you were going after a bigger market, you just blew it. Sorry... just rubbed me the wrong way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad","review":"I have read just about everything this author has written and this is the worst. I feel used. Thank God I got it out of the library instead of spending money on it! The characters are totally retreads from other books and the plot doesn't even make sense. Someone piloted a boat off a reef with a fatal gunshot wound to the head!? It hurt to finish this book and I almost didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I really like Janet Evanocich and I adore Stephanie Plum but this book was horrible, I could not even finishh it!! Not funny at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanovich is a fallen star","review":"I hated this book. There wasn't one thing I liked. It was published with a stupid bright pink girly cover in the UK and that should have warned me.I resent paying money for something so bad, so I took it back to W H Smith for a refund, and got it. We have something here called the Trades Description Act, and if an item does not meet the description under which it was sold we are entitled to a refund. It did not meet any of the promises and descriptions.I think Janet Evanovich should pay people to read this, we certainly shouldn't be paying her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warmed over Plum pudding","review":"I've read every Plum book and loved them, and I was expecting METRO GIRL to be a fresh, new heroine from the cheese-doodle-stained keyboard of Janet Evanovich. But sadly, this is simply re-hashed Plum. Stephanie Plum (hereafter referred to as SP) has Lula and Rex; Barney has Judey and Brian. SP has Grandma Mazur; Barney has Rosa. Wild Bill looked at girls' (...); Joe Morelli played choo-choo. We have doodahs and doodles and demolished cars. And there are too many lists in this book. Every time they go to a convenience store, do we have to have a grocery list of every item they bought? I found NASCAR Guy to be incredibly annoying. I never felt any emotional attachment to him like I do with Joe and Ranger. I only finished the book because ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Excuse me. I dozed off. I only finished because I hate to admit defeat. In hindsight, I should have waved the white flag at about page 50 and moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I realize some people loved this book, and some hated it. I didn't hate it, but I will not purchase another Evanovich book unless it's part of the Plum series.These rip-off Plum wannabe books that Janet Evanovich comes up with cannot compare remotedly the Plum series. It is quick, sloppy, formula writing that just does not work.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it Lacking...","review":"I have just recently discovered Janet Evanovich (within the last 8 months) and I loved her Stephanie Plum series. With this in mind, I went right to \\"Metro Girl\\" hoping to get the same wit and charm from the setting and characters. Alas, I was wrong. I felt completely detached from the storyline, and there was no feel of being there. The Plum series, though you may never have been to Trenton, made you feel like you were there. Ms. Evanovich's attempt to place us in Miami, etc, were feable at most. Sorry, Janet, but this wasn't up to par for me.I am happy to say, however, that I uncovered a new and aspiring author. I purchased \\"Waves of Deceit\\" by Marlene de Velasco and let me tell you, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happening to Janet?","review":"I LOVED Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series - so I bought this book hoping for more of a great thing. Boy was I wrong. I almost stopped reading this book! The story line was unbelievable, the characters are goofy and there wasn't even any steamy sex to spice it up! It wasn't even a \\"fun\\" book. I feel like I wasted my time!I think Janet is pumping these books out WAY too fast and not spending enough time developing characters and story lines. Her last two Plum books were not up to par, her \\"Full\\" series is ridiculous and this book is awful!Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad writing","review":"I love the Stephanie Plum series but have noticed when Janet writes other books the characters mimic the Plum series, but not nearly as well. I am always disapointed. This isn't a matter of comparing. If the Metro Girl was a great story it wouldn't matter so much. I have also noticed the last two or three books in the Plum series are not as good as they were in the beginning. Maybe Janet has used up all her good ideas. Metro Girl was excruciating to read. I skimmed quite a bit of it hoping it would get better. To refer to oneself as \\"NASCAR Guy\\" repeatedly is so annoying and I do not know any guy that would do this. It is just not realistic dialouge and took away from the story. The characters were not compelling and the storyline was lacking as well. One bumbling crime solving-girl series is enough for this author. I hope she sticks to pumping up the Plum series before her other lackluster books tarnish her name."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I thought it was a good, fun book. Lite, but kept me interested. was worth my time and made me want more in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets.","review":"Plum books took a decline, but none so bad as this. The characters were very boring. I admittedly only got half way through. I just could take it anymore. What a waste of money. Sorry Janet. You need to find an objective editor. This was really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miami madness that is hard to swallow","review":"In this first book in the Barnaby and Hooker series, we meet Alex Barnaby, who has gone to Miami to find her brother after call from him was interrupted by a woman screaming. While she has an office job now, she used to be a gearhead and loves fast cars. It is clear that there are several people/groups searching for her brother, including NASCAR driver Hooker, who has had his boat stolen by her brother, Bill. They team up, with a lot of bad sexual tension. The plot gets more and more improbable, with implausible situations and ridiculous fixes to bad plotting, ranging from sunken treasure, Castro, fruit sellers with guns, and ending with a NASCAR fueled raid on a warehouse. The characters failed to draw me in, and while I am very willing to suspend disbelief for a good story, this was not a good story. This was a disappointment, and I don't know if I will read the second in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"The story in general is good. I found the NASCAR references to be over used and knowing the industry I am certain there is no driver out there that would call themselves \\"NASCAR Guy!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Metro Girl is embarrassingly bad. Mismatch of plots, poorly developed characters and NASCAR man is so awful I felt like ripping out the pages.Janet Evanovich is much better at writing older characters. She is out of touch or very dated when writes young characters. The older ladies working in the cigar factory are funny. The dog and cookie down the pants incident was juvenile and a lot of the other action puerile.Alex (Barney) Barnaby is hard to like and the book is not sexy or very funny. It tries too hard and repeats the jokes over and over.Skip this one and read either the early Plum series by Evanovich or go to another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie Plum Lite","review":"This was sort of \\"Stephanie Plum-lite\\", right down to the tomboyish main character (Barney), obviously forward love interest (\\"Nascar Guy\\" Sam), and crazy sidekicks (gay best friend and Cuban cigar rollers). And I think that's why I didn't love it. While you expect a certain voice and style in a Janet Evanovich book, this was a little too copycat for my tastes. Though I confess that I did like Sam, who was what you would get if Ranger and Morelli had a baby. I'll probably read the second one if I feel like something light I can read in a day, but it won't be something I'll rush to get to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap knockoff","review":"A knock off of the Plum series, but not quite as good.

I have listened to a lot of books in my time and this was one of the better ones. If you like Sandra Brown or Nora Roberts, you will likely also like Janet Evanovich. This book is packed with humor, mystery, excitement, bad guys, etc. This is a light hearted book that only touches on romance. If you are looking for a romance novel, one with graphic sex scenes, then this is not the book for you. But if you like mystery, humor, and just the right amount of sexual tension, then you will likely enjoy this book. I recommend the audio version because the person reading the book has an excellent range of voices for all the wonderful and unique characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This book was really good! I don't know what some of the other reviewers were talking about..this book was a really fun read. Yes, it could probably be referred to as an \\"easy read\\", but nonthless it was good.

Typical Evanovich, Metro girl delivers the goods with a high stakes, sexy, adventure including murder, mayhem, sunken treasure, a Hot bodied woman and a very sexy NASCAR racer!

Also, the story sounds great, but there are huge gaping holes in the plot from start to finish. The hero and heroine go from not being in love to madly in love and then the story is over. You don't get to find out what caused Kieran to fall in love with Syren nor is there any resolution. Yes, there is one great review. If you read it, you pretty much have read the book.Because I was so frustrated and disgusted with the first story, I couldn't even try to read the second. I hate to give a bad review, but I would rather have been warned how bad the story was before buying something rather than only hearing it was great. Especially since the book wasn't cheap.

Although I have a background of human sicence courses from college, I believe the author did a great job of teaching the anatomy of the spine and trunk pertaining to spinal stabilization and back pain. He did a step by step approach of a healthy spine, the anatomy of a healthy spine, an unstable spine, what may be the cause of an unstable spine, understanding what may cause your back pain, and therapeutic spinal stabilization. Breaking the book up into these chapters made it very easy to follow. The exercises are very well explained and easy to understand as well.\\"Overall, the book is a great blend of research-based expertise and user friendly information\\" (Lisa Westlake, Physiotherapist and Australian Fitness Leader of the Year, 2000)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball workout","review":"You need to be in shape, I agree with the other reviewers.

It was my first exposure to Rozz and I instantly became obsessed with the man. The opening monologue just blew me away...so blasphemous and depressing, yet gentle and soothing. The whole album continues in this manner, wallowing in the depths of despair while maintaining a warmth and honesty that is very rare indeed. Rozz's esoteric and seductive vocals dominate this album from start to finish. The music sets a desolate atmosphere wherein his tales of terror and sadness transpire. His often ambiguous and absurd lyrics seem paradoxically wise and consoling. Despite its decidedly anti-Christian sentiments, it sounds very heavenly. I've been listening to it for over ten years now and it never gets old. But then again, perhaps I'm simply a freak."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"this is a must have for a Christian Death/Rozz Williams fan.

I was looking forward to this one, but was sorely disappointed to find that they lost their edge. Gone were the jazzy influences, and the funk, too. We were left with unimaginiative pop.

The Arrival Special Edition reissue contains the complete Arrival album plus plenty of bonus material - live tracks, early Rail & Company recordings, demos, etc. All songs have been digitally remastered, and sound terrific.Rail is a band worth discovering.

The review indicated very good condition, in fact gift giving condition and that it was complete. IT was not! The most important part of the book is a necklace with a small silver ballet shoe charm. This is supposed to be attached to the front of the book. It was not. The envelop was empty! So the main reason to purchase the book and the main reason a child would love it was missing, and therefore totally unacceptable. What a waste of money and what a misleading advertisement!

The reader gets a very clear picture of who these characters are, fromRooster Cogburn to Mattie's late father, and everyone in between. As the saying goes, onceI picked it up I couldn't put it down. It took me all of 3 or 4 hours over 2 days to breezethrough it. You can't go wrong here. If you don't have it in your collection, buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Grit","review":"We saw the movie and the critics said that the Cohen Brothers (we really like their movies) followed the book more closely than the original John Wayne movie. After reading the book we offered it to our friends to see if they felt the same. We are both movie and book fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mattie & Rooster","review":"Having seen both the old and new movie versions of \\"True Grit\\" I decided to read the book and see how faithful each was to the original work. Surprisingly, I found that each in its own way followed the book, although there were subtle differences, especially the endings.That being said, I must confess to have enjoyed this book tremendously. The writing was excellent (the language especially), and the plot kept the reader moving along. The device of using the grown-up Mattie as the narrator works extremely well, especially when she talks about events that occur after the end of the book.Even though, from the two films, I had a pretty good idea of what was potentially going to happen to the main characters, I read on avidly, and grew to love this classic Western work. Even if you've seen one or both of the movies I highly recommend that you read the book. There is more depth to it than a movie can ever bring, and you will discover little nuggets that will make you happy you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even finished and it is an all time favorite","review":"I love novels with first person narrators, and this one Miss Mattie Ross, is really a firecracker. She is Lisbeth Salander, and the girl from the movie Kickass wrapped in one 14 year old girl from America's frontier days, the West. The book is hilarious, and her sharp as nails no nonsense lines and delivery is truly outstanding. The strength of the narrator's voice reminds me of Holden Caulfield and Huck Finn. What a pleasure. In fact, I think i will dive back to Fort Smith, Arkansas, and see what's going on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a great read","review":"What was remarkable to me was how closely the movie followed this book, which is so unusual for Hollywood. There are some differences to be sure -- the book goes into Maddie's later life -- but that part would have been awkward to work into the film anyway since it's little more than a outline of her adult years. TRUE GRIT the movie is surely John Wayne's masterpiece and is one of my two or three favorite westerns. Having a chance to read the original novel as well is something I think any fan of the movie will thoroughly enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Western","review":"Mattie Ross, a precocious fourteen-year-old Arkansas girl, is the unintentionally hilarious narrator of this classic western story. She badgers Deputy Marshall Rooster Cogburn and Texas Ranger La Beouf into allowing her to accompany them into Indian Territory to pursue the man who murdered her father.However unreliable a narrator Mattie may be (that is up to the reader to decide), it is a cracking good tale full of gun fights, desperados and bandits of all descriptions - I don't see how the movie can possibly compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Mattie Ross is easily one of my favorite characters in literature now.This book is filled with great dialogue, and terrific action.The characters are all very well drawn, and have many layers."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Grit","review":"This is a very well written book.

I enjoyed both, and I was wondering whether reading the book would add to the \\"True Grit\\" experience.The cadence of the language in the text was still choppy to me, but the book makes both Mattie Ross, the young girl determined to bring her father's murderer to justice, and federal marshal Rooster Cogburn \\"grittier\\" than either movie. In other words, don't let the fact that you've seen either movie keep you from enjoying this tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for adults","review":"Gripping story, invigorating characterizations, inspiring heroine set in a time when frontier law was harsh, to say the least. I particularly liked Portis' use of contemporary mannerisms in speech to provide a context far different from the usual western. He also faithfully rendered the geography of the area in which the story is set. I read the book twice, despite having seen both versions of the movie. The Cohen brothers were much more sympathetic to Portis' intent than Hal Wallis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Western to Date!!","review":"If you're a fan of the movies (new or old) then you should certainly read the book. Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross hires a grizzled lawman to avenge her father��s blood, and then narrates her adventure, fifty-years later, in a deadpan tone. Charles Portis spins his entertaining yarn with freshness and economy. Rooster Cogburn is truly one of the greatest protagonists in modern literature and the type of lawman you would want on your side. If you are looking for a compelling and enthralling story, then True Grit is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"With its economical writing, sharp dialogue, and suspenseful plot \\"True Grit\\" is a gripping, moving tale of a fourteen-year old girl's remorseless, relentless hunt for her father's killer. It's literary teen fiction, as it sees the world from an unflinching, unfailing teenager's perspective -- there's good and bad, right and wrong, and no grayness in between. The girls' moral clarity in a world of nothing but moral murkiness is ultimately what makes the novel so compelling to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unnecessary Afterword.","review":"Enjoyed the book - but I wasn't overly impressed with the Afterword by Donna Tartt. There was far too much empty praise for the book. This was the best book she and her family had ever read - they couldn't get enough copies to lend to friends - her mother even borrowed one from the library and pretended it was lost. All very subjective and irrelevant stuff.And since an \`afterword' is intended for those who have just read the story, I couldn't see the point of regurgitating all those lengthy chunks of text. The analytical discussions should have sufficed - though again I did not find these particularly insightful.An unnecessary Afterword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was in great shape, just as described.","review":"I really loved the book.

And with that being said I can now say that I loved this novel. I don't read westerns very often, in fact I've only ever read Lonesome Dove before this novel; however, I couldn't put this book down. Portis's sense of pacing is engaging and his heroine is a fascinating character. Not a single character is without grit and yet each remains a distinct and fully realized individual. It is a testament to his talent as a writer that he manages to create such tough individuals without making one character look weak or helpless. I have only one suggestion. Wait some time between watching the Coen brothers' movie and reading this book. They follow the plot and the dialog almost exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Grit","review":"True Grit is a pleasure to read. This would be an excellent book to gift to that cowboy lover in your circle and is great for both boys and girls.

Until the release of this remastered album on CD in 2002, the only copies available were badly scratched albums, if you could find one. Most of her albums were recorded for Liberty, but Capital Jazz acquired the rights and master for this gem. You could say this album is \\"blues noir\\". These tracks were recorded between 1956 and 1957. Stereo was not yet prevalent in recording, and sadly this is a mono disc. One can only imagine what it would sound like in digitally remastered Stereo! Nevertheless, this is a must have. The liner notes to the album were written by James Gavin, author of the biography on Chet Baker, and make great reading while you are listening to Julie sing About the Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true essay 'about the blues'","review":"If one were to write a complete overview spaning Julie London's entire career, 'About the Blues' would stand in the Top 5 of her best albums.Not only does it have a film-noir-type feel to it, but is so haunting, and makes you feel as if you were walking alone at night, it's kinda cold out, and you're looking behind your back to see if any other life form is of existancee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic London","review":"I had forgotten how warm and mellow Julie London's voice was. Having listened to her sing, and having watched her in a few movies when I was very young, I appreciate her music more than ever. It was such a pleasure re-discovering her with this album.

Produced by her husband Bobby Troup, London is first-rate from her take of Basin Street Blues to her last, Dark, which was released only as a single. For most of these tunes, she's backed by orchestrations arranged by Russ Garcia, a little-known arranger who worked with Anita O'Day among others. Twelve of the 16 tracks run less than three minutes, but London knows how to make a two and a half minute tune as melancholy can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"KH","review":"Great artist!

It provides a pretty good cardio workout and is easy on the knees. Two issues: 1) that it does make a squeaky noise, but it's really not too much of a nuisance; and 2) I wish the display wasn't so sensitive as it will reset itself if you press it a little too hard.

It contains \\"An Enemy of the State\\", \\"Wheels Within Wheels\\", and \\"Healer\\". Because Healer is set over a very long time period (the main character is pretty much immortal), Healer was chopped up into about 5-6 shorter parts and set around Enemy and Wheels in chronological order. So its incorrect to state this work contains short stories.There ARE several short stories set in the LaNague universe, but none appear here. They are listed in the intro to the book. 3 appear in Wilson's collection \\"Soft and Others\\". Uncertain where the others appear in terms of collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, engaging book","review":"This book sucked me in.

The attention to detail? The attractive design? No, you noticed the price and thought you were getting a steal, didn't you? Believe me, there is a reason the price is next to nothing. The model can be built in under ten minutes normally, and has almost no paint on it. The picture is one of the model after painting. It only moves in critical places, so it is really only good as a static display. If you have paint markers or actual model paint and like detailing, go for it.

It can look fantastic with a bit of paint, just like in the photo or in the shows...BUT, if you really want a cheap Strike gundam, I suggest looking for the Buster/Sword versions. You'll get the exact same parts you see in the photo of this model kit, as well as the parts to make the Sword or Gun-wielding varients seen in the show, for the exact same, if not a better price.

Secondly, the item twists open but there are still extra poles you must add to it- even then there is no stability. Thirdly, the \\"fabric\\" reminds me of disposable tablecloth... its papery and could tear easily. There is a picture printed on only two sides of this tent- the only two sides visiable in the advertised picture. No matter what the cost is I would not puchase this item even if it was a dollar.

This book was a waste of time and money. After reading the first few chapters, I was unimpressed by the \\"one-size-fits-all\\" technique as well as the author's use of derogatory terms to label \\"Disorganization types\\". Also, the use of 5 broad catagories to label someone is often misdirecting, and might cause some people to become MORE cluttered and disorganized in an attempt to fit a label they don't actually need.

Her mother supports her father in all the craziness. It is supposed to be about a person \\"finding\\" Judaism... there is actually very little information about Judaism in it... mostly her suffering with the cult... it would read better as a depiction of abuse ... the Story of O without the sex.... If you want a book about religion(s), this is not it.

Kane was news director for a Miami Radio Station when he joined the Beatles' press group for the band's first two Amercian Tours in '64 and '65. Oh how times have changed. Tickets for the Beatles' concert went for a whopping $5.50 back then! There's plenty of sex, drugs, rock & roll and hordes of screaming teens but there's also Kane's conversations and interviews with \\"the boys\\". \\"Ticket to Ride\\" is a rare, intimate look at John, Paul, George and Ringo from the guy sitting across the aisle from them on the tour plane. Later chapters about the '65 Tour get more somber and, at times, tedious but overall \\"Ticket to Ride\\" is very enjoyable. So if you need a pleasant escape from the 21st Century, get a tall drink, a comfy chair and travel back in time and hang out with \\"the boys\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read despite frustrations with style","review":"An interesting read, but oh, it could have been so much better had Kane's book been passed through the hands of a good editor, which I can only assume it wasn't.Gone would have been the repetitive passages and chapters - especially the strangely unecessary summary chapters stuck in between the 64 and 65 tours - all of which only mire down what could have been an even livelier, seat of the pants narrative.Also gone would be Kane's frustrating knack for pre-empting almost every story with its own punchline, leaving the reader with a somewhat anti-climatic let down each time.Clear all that out and readers could participate wholeheartedly in Kane's unique and exhilerating ride in the slipstream of the Beatles' American tours - a fascinating set of insider tales from a refreshingly earnest, thoughtful and perceptive storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dateline meets the Beatles","review":"Kane had a wonderful opportunity when he traveled with the Beatles during those early tours. This book certainly gives some interesting highlights of how hectic those days were, but the style of his writing diminishes the work to the level of a Stone Phillips report on NBC. There's way too much foreshadowing, giving it the feel of \\"When we get back from this commercial, you'll hear how the one of the Beatles made an anti-semitic remark...\\"Yes, as one reviewer put it, you'll see how the boys were actually nice, regular people, but Kane writes with an ineptitude typical of our televised society.

It is probably the worst-written book by a professional writer (a journalist, in this case) that I've ever encountered.

My advice is to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels Like You're Reading The Same Chapter Over and Over and Over....","review":"This book seemed pretty good until about the 4th chapter, when I realized that all I'm reading is how excited the fans were at the concert in (fill in city name here). We all know that already, and don't need to hear someone confirm it for us. Larry refuses to get into anything controversial that may have happened, opting instead to \\"fade to black\\", or end chapters with teasing lines about something that was to happen later.

It was full of facts and lots of repetition about each city in the tour. Kane tries to use eloquent language but it comes out as cliches and stories with no relevance to the interest of the reader. There wasn't much new information and the interviews became dull after the first few chapters, because of the recurring information. It seemed that the interviews were just a different way of retelling what Kane wrote about in the previous text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been written 25 years ago...","review":"I had high hopes for this book in that it was being written by a nearly true insider to the world of early Beatles stardom, when they were on the ascending exponential curve of their celebrity and creative genius. Unfortunately, Larry just doesn't remember much. He is eloquent, at times verbose, but offers little in the way of new information, and as another reviewer has suggested, does get some details wrong. He should have written this 25 years ago when he likely remembered more. And the Beatle quotes he intersperses offer little more...comments like \\"Its a drag\\" and \\"Shea was great\\" aren't exactly eye-poppers. If you are an ardent Beatles fan, you will want this book for the few interesting tidbits that do surface, but you will become frustrated as you read it knowing that it likely could have been more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut, paste, repeat...","review":"I have read several Beatles books and this is not one of the best. There are some interesting details, but overall he just repeats the same thing over - wild crowds, barely escaped, fly to next city, repeat. For a professional reporter, the details seem to be very sparse. He also too often mentions something, but then says \\"but we'll get to that later.\\" I feel this would have been a better book if he would have had a co-writer who actually wrote books for a living.I paid 75 cents for this book at a book sale.

Just goes to show you can't always believe the critics, as attested by other reviews here. As long as you're not expecting \\"Children of Paradise\\" or something, you won't be disappointed. \\"Pyrates\\" is just a fun - and very risque - romantic comedy. Definitely not for the kids, but adults who aren't too uptight should enjoy it. Lots of funny lines and the direction isn't bad either. Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick really carry this film along, and their onscreen chemistry wasn't just an act, since they're actually married in real life. Good over-the-top campy entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will someone please release this on DVD?","review":"I never got a chance to see this movie in the theater, but I fell in love with it on VHS and have since gone through 2 copies since the mid-90's.This movie truly deserves a re-release onto DVD.

The same label that started the careers for Mystikal and Fiend (well the bigger names.) When they feed off of each other you sometimes can't tell them apart, but Mz. GB is the rougher one and Tee Tee is the lighter voiced one whom sing a lot more than the other. Production was done by Precise with the exception of \\"Rumble With The South,\\" which was done by Mr. Lee. Precise's tracks go well with the singing, harmonizing and overall flow skills from the twins.

While lacking in depth due to the survey nature of the work, the information presented is relevant, insightful, and interesting. The flavor of the different eras when astronomy was practiced is certainly tasted as well as insights into the people who viewed the skies above. A great book for a survey of the history of astronomy. A useful project would be to append the book with the astronomical knowledge gleaned in the past century, which would show just how rapidly our knowledge of the universe has been expanding in the recent past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and well-written","review":"A fine fictionalization about a fascinating historical figure. I was intrigued by the idea of a young Scottish woman disguising herself as a man to go adventuring in the New World.

I read all the great reviews on here and I didn't notice that they were all from the same month Feb, 2004 (most likely from friends, or all from the same person, so I bought it like a fool. It was horribly written, and needs some serrious improvement. After reading this, I don't think the author has ever been anywhere.

It included humor as well as interesting facts. For someone interested in starting a career as a tour guide, it offers some very important items to consider before attempting to start at career. The most interesting aspects were the real but humorous incidents described by the author on specific tours. After each chapter, I was looking forward to the next chapter for another amusing event. Also, it shows how a career as a tour guide can lead to some very interesting friendships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely readable","review":"This book is amazing in it's awfulness.

Both the novice and experienced traveler can benefit from reading about her experiences.Experienced travelers will nod and smile in agreement at having been through similar situations. The novice traveler can be forewarned of possible hitches while traveling and know that it will turn out OK if everyone stays calm.I especially enjoyed how Joyce was able to resolve every situation by knowing when to stand her ground and when to give in, most often with humor.A very amusing and informative book which even the armchair traveler will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed the way I parent forever","review":"The Prathers laid out the rational for a parenting style that I instinctively knew was right.

Upon a recommendation, I purchased this moisturizer. I used the entire bottle before I decided to write the review. First, this product burns your face, especially if you put in on after shaving. It isn't a minor burning sensation either as the bottle will tell you. I could possibly tolerate the buring if the product results were worth the pain but that isn't the case. The actual moisture is just a greasy film. It is not worth the money. May I suggest a newer product I have found to be really amazing - Kiehls Facial Fuel for men. It is the best moisturizer I've ever used followed by Dermalogica's Active Moist. I would suggest one of these two far superior alternatives. With that said, almost all other Jack Black products I've used have been terrific including their volume shampoo and conditioner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this out recently!","review":"I don't actually hate this, but recently, upon research (A FEW MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT IT), i found this product to be quite toxic to the skin w/ the ingredients contained.Search it yourself with the EWG website: [...] I like it and was going to buy another, but not after researching the chemicals contained in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This scanned copy is a disgrace.

Great for holding blueprints and carrying them from site to site.The pocket can hold smaller sheets of paper and even a thin book. The little clear pouch can hold a few pencils and a scalerule, but not much else. It arrived way before expected and in mint condition. But...

Laurel Masse's willingness to expand her musical horizons has brought forth an astoundingly varied and beautiful piece of work. From the opening notes of the Quaker hymn \\"How Can I Keep From Singing?\\" to the closing track, \\"Lone Wild Bird/MacIntosh's Lament,\\" this ia multi-layered, richly hued CD filled with intensity and heart. The range of selections alone defies classification, and the beauty with which she infuses these songs is thrilling. This is not \\"background music\\"--like all true art, \\"Feather and Bone\\" challenges your senses...and, eventually, opens your heart and mind. Thank you, Laurel, for following your own sacred heart as an artist, and taking your audience along on the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feather and Bone sings to my soul","review":"With this CD, Laurel Masse brings so much more than neat rhythms and snappy vocal techniques: she encircles my spirit with her remarkable voice, so warm and clear, other times softly husky. Her treatments bring surprise to well-known songs, showing me a sinuous beauty I hadn't heard before in Ave Maria and a hopefulness I hadn't felt in Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.She opens windows I hadn't known were there. Beautiful music, beautiful voice - a multi-dimensional delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept","review":"This one should be subtitled \\"Experiments in Sound\\". Perhaps my expectations were to hear mostly, or all, jazz, with her amazing voice, so I was rather disappointed with the mystical bent, with a sparsely or unaccompanied bent. Sometimes she achieved great effects, as with the unaccompanied Bach, and other times the results were flat for me, like Radiant Flame of Gold, with speaking and drums. Overall, I would say it's a little too esoteric for me and mostly a lack of use of her instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few traces of Laurel's jazz roots","review":"I suppose Premonition Records sent me a review copy of \\"Feather & Bone\\" because I'm a jazz writer and Laurel Masse' once sang with Manhattan Transfer. She has an amazing vocal range and a pleasant voice -- but you need to know quickly: This ain't jazz, folks, so don't buy it because of her past affiliation. Frankly, I don't know how you would classify it except perhaps under \\"various songs by a good singer who no longer is into jazz.\\" The minimal accompaniment for her singing is provided by a fiddle, a crystal bowl (I'm not making this up, folks), two frame drums and a bagpipe. There may be a market for this CD somewhere, but not among jazz fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corvette Hype","review":"This book has a lot of good information about the C6 Corvette features and design considerations.

The aluminum handles make them super light, so you can drum harder for longer, and the felt tips on these are both solid and soft enough to use on a natural head drum-skin. I and many others got many nights of joy from the sound of these mallets on a 4ft diameter double-sided base drum in the middle of the woods. The dipped grips have the potential to make a slick grip when palms get sweaty, but not enough to even take off a single star. Very happy with the product.

This story will have you contemplating Washington's action and the outcome of the American Revolution. Specifically, one will be surprised how three young militia men may have saved the whole Contenental Army from certain defeat. John Walsh does a great job of keeping this story alive and keeping the question of Andre's sentence at the forefront of debates. A must for revolutionary war readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanged once, assassinated once...","review":"Long a student of American History and a teacher of it, I am always interested in alternative perspectives on significant events. This book, however, is mere character assassination disguised as historical fact. I have read every available source on the events leading up to and the trial/execution of Major John Andre, and by all accounts, he was an honorable man. Walsh attempts to paint Andre as a narcissistic, self-serving social climber, when according to those who were there (his enemies, no less), he was a genuinely sincere man who was merely out of his league. He was not a spy, and could not have been expected to have behaved as one. That he held his composure so well in the days leading up to his death speaks volumes as to his character. A truly narcissistic man would have done almost anything to save himself. Andre did nothing other than to preserve his sense of honor and dignity. Where did Walsh get his ideas? I read the same material, and I have no idea..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the dustjacket instead","review":"The now widely popular genre of \\"popular history\\" has greatly increased interest in history. Thanks to the great writing of authors such as Steven Amrose, Thomas Fleming, and Joseph Ellis more people then ever are reading non fiction. The Execution of Major Andre should be avoided as pure fluff. The author goes so far as to provide fictional inner dialogue for Major Andre. No background is given to Andre other than some allusions to being dissatisfied working in his fathers counting house. Alexander Hamilton's relatinship with Andre was hardly mentioned. I gave it two stars based on the fact that you can get though in about an hour and a half so it won't waste much of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"HoMedics MAN-50 StyleSpa Traveler Manicure Kit","review":"If you pay more than $10 for this you paid too much.

They gotta be twins. They're identical. However, T.I. knows what he doin' in dat studio.

Well, that is pretty much all you are going to hear, if you buy the album. There are, of course, a few fine tracks, altough the completely lack originality and sound in the very same way that the above mentioned ones do. There are a couple of tracks on which Chingy does an hilarious and desparate attempt to capture the listener's attention by singing.

I mean sure the beats are tight, but is that all what makes hip-hop and rap music today? Why don't these dudes make their music unique?

Chingy got blessed wit the presence of Luda, Snoop Dogg, Murphy Lee, and most of the DTP srew. The hottest songs are Right Thurr, The Remix, Sample DAt Ass, Holidae In and Represent. The CD starts off good until you get to about song 14 and it stats to cool off. If your looking for that fire album then Chingy is the one.The song Sample Dat Ass ( Featuring Murphy Lee) is the hottest song on his album. His first single \\"Right Thurr\\" was a good starting point because its only going to get better. Know your hearing \\" Right Thurr Remix\\" and its probably going to be Holidae In next. and know its all about The Remix. This is the type of CD you could start at 1 and go to 16 and then start all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get This Guy Out of Herrre","review":"This guy sucks. Plain and Simple, He has no skill at all. The single Right Thurr is annoying as hell and should never have been made. Chingy says that his style is different from fellow St. Louis Rapper Nelly, but in truth he cant help but try to be like Nelly who I still think isnt even a good rapper either. The main thing Chingy has going for him on this album is that he has major appearences like Ludacris and Snoop Dogg and the fact that his album has been hugely hyped, but thats were it ends. Chingy doesnt prove anything here and seriously doesnt bring anything new to the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"What more can I say?","review":"Not much really, most of the one -star reviews have pretty much summed up this album in a nutcase. I honestly don't mind this club music IN THE CLUB but when people call this real hip-hop or say his lyrics are good... they need a biaaaatch slap.I really can't stand his voice. I understand he is trying to be unqiue and seperate his flow from others so he doesn't sound monotone but his lyrics are pathetic. I have to admit though these are good for club beats but don't expect some raw hip-hop beats.This is the sad state Hip-Hop has come to these days. I mean I guess this music has it's own section (hip-pop) but it tarnishes what real hip-hop use to stand for. I'm not going to bother going deep because you either already own this C.D., or you're just going to call me a Chingy hater.I'm sure the people who will agree with me are true hip-hop heads, others who don't obviously started getting into hip-hop in the late 90's and think this is what hip-hop should be like. Oh well.Peaaace."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHA","review":"Man that is really funny i wrote a review on how much of a b**ch chingy fan is, told him he has no girlfriend and just sits on the computer and types reviews all day, within less then 10 hours after I wrote mmy review, chingy fan got mad, now u would think he would have wroten a bad review back to me, but no, he went and posted over a hundred bulls*** reviews. This just shows how gay and pitiful this retard is, chingy fan, and whats even gayer is that he then pretended to be another peson and put in 1 star reviews and talk bad about him self, just so that at the end he could say u win chingy fan, go to hell u retard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst hip-pop ever","review":"Chingy sucks. Period. His lyrics are retarded, and his songs sound like anything on the radio today. People got a lot of nerve bashing Outkast, Nas, and other talented rappers (that's you Chingy Fan).\\"Right Thurr\\" was OKAY, but Chingy just got worse and worse. Fast. \\"Holidae In\\" besides having an incorrectly spelled title, is a terrible song that's also a disgrace to Snoop and Ludacris, who are both decent rappers. \\"One Call Away\\" was by far worse than \\"Holidae In\\", which says a lot. The hook makes my skin curl and Chingy's voice makes me want to vomit. And his new collaboration with Houston on \\"I Like That\\"? Bo-rrring. Same ol' same ol' rap about the same ol' stuff.When's the new Nas album coming out? There's a rapper that has talent, and I don't even own the Chingy album (who in their right mind would?), but I don't need the album to tell everyone, IT SUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"This album truly sucks.

The only reason this album got 1.5 stars from me is because I like \\"One Call Away\\" and the fact that some of the beats were hot. I use this CD to sit my drinks on because it serves a better purpose as an overpriced coaster. That's all it's good for.......straight up. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably under the age of 23 or they don't know any better or both. Other than the singles, this CD is awful. Actually, even the singles are kind of wack if you're not in the club when you hear them. When will these pop rap artists learn that hot beats don't necessarily equal a hot album. Chingy is another one of those artists that make file sharing / bootlegging seem like a reasonable cause to get behind. If you can download this album for free, then do it. It's not even worth $5.00Personal Favorites: One Call Away feat. Jason Weaver......and that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst rapper EVER!!!","review":"this album is the worst album i have ever heard. I dont know how chingy ever got signed to a record label. He is a rapper who raps about complete nonsense. First of all, his lyrics are terrible. and second, his flow is the worst. Rappers like CHingy make all us hip hop fans really appreciate good rappers. With a name like chingy, we shouldn't be surprised with what he raps about. Unfortunatly, the lowest rating Chingy can get is 1 star, i would've given him negative 100 if it was possible. Dont waste ur time with this album. Go out and by Jay Z, Dip-Set, Nas, and Mobb Deep albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another overrated rapper with connections","review":"I don't understand the whole Chingy thing and why this guy is so enormously popular. Basically this guy is just like Nelly in that his style is slick and Top 40 ready, but at least Nelly has a somewhat unique flow - there's really nothing distinctive about Chingy whatsoever. The guy lacks talent to the point where he needs other rappers to keep his songs afloat - I think that pretty much says it all.And much like other St. Louis rappers, besides favoring an easily digestible Top 40 style, he also favors the \\"chicks, blunts and forties\\" approach to lyrics, which means that you can expect the entire album to be lacking in substance. There's one song that is decent because of the interplay between the rappers - the grossly misspelled \\"Holidae In\\" - but that's about it.In summary: This guy says nothing new and brings nothing new to the table - he's just another inconsequential MC."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"This is such a tight cd, i love chingy the way he talks, and the way he looks!! this cd just completes the package!!

I have to admit i liked \\"Right thurr\\" a good and catchy rap song with a good hook and beats you could dance too. The next song \\"Holiday in\\" with annoying snoop dogg was not any good though, and if you take a deeper look at the album you'll see that most songs are simular and they are all about girls. It get's quite boring in the end to listen to and my advide would be to just get the \\"Right thurr\\" single instead. \\"Bagg up\\" however is a little diffrent, it sound soulish, and diffeent from the others. But it won't help the album to become much better. Some more serious songs with a message and not so many simular sounding girl songs would make this album enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This makes me laugh","review":"First of...why does this man lack originality. Why sound likeNelly? Atleast switch up your flow. Dont sound like him andrap about the same stuff. I like REAL rap 90% of the time. The other 10% I spend listning to artist like Nelly.

To be honest with you, it wasn't as hot as I thought it'd be. I don't want to hate, 'cause anyone from the Lou is straight with me. But seriously, dog. First off, his voice is annoying. It's no rap voice. But who am I to say what's a \\"rap voice\\", right? Yeah. So, you judge that. But it's annoying to me. I got on track 2 and I realized that I couldn't make it through the rest of the album. But I did, and it's gonna be forever stashed in my CD collection. All the songs were about women, bling, and cars. But what else is new, right? Maybe this CD needs to grow on me. I don't know. But I really can't bear to take it out and listen to it again.

After one listen, I knew my assumption was right all along. This guy isn't that good. He has no substance, storytelling ability, ill metaphors or similes, nothing.

They sound like an over-hyped production team who's name starts with a N (you know who I am talking about...check Kelis's cds). Plus Chingy has no rap skills. NONE!!

Chingy cant rap for gods sake, neither can 99% of the rappers on MTV nowadays. Why did my favorite music genre have to have gone mainstream? Rap is just the next disco or funk, notice how nobody likes those anymore becuase pop culture ruined them for people who liked it. ANYONE who owns a Murphy Lee, Nelly, 50 Cent, Ja rule, Chingy, Lil anybody or w/e is not a hip hop fan but a mainstream loving loser who doesnt know hip hop at all and is just trying to like what everybody else likes so they can pretend to be cool or ghetto.

Along with this joke called Chingy, there has been a nonstop influx of idiots with no talent who are polluting the airwaves with mindless, commercial, garbage. Music is supposed to be an artform. Chingy is showing the world that you can take a mish-mosh of mispronounced words thrown over some wack beats and still make millions because 99% of music fans are mindless sheep who will buy anything that they see on TV so they can blast it in their cavalier with fake 20 inch chrome wheels.

Others include The Young and the Hopeless and others, but Chingy is rapping what most rappers rap about:girls, weed, and being rich in da hood. By now, everyone should know that the best artists in rap/hip-hop are not rapping along the same lines as Chingy.Chingy not only raps and looks like an overused Nelly clone, but he also has an indistinct voice that sounds like too many rappers. To succeed in the game, you have to have some fresh sounds when rapping.I can't tell you everything bad about this album, I can only tell you that there are one or maybe two good tracks on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I ever waste my money on this?!","review":"Look, I like rap, but I can't argue with the people giving this negative reviews.

I'm gonna stick to good rap, like some of the new ones just starting to get popular (Not Webbie, of coarse. Hate him) So everybody take my advice.

Unfortunately, we've already established that this formula is not gonna work for Nelly or anyone else. Just to show how idiotic he is, Chingy uses his \\"pimp game\\" to make him look cooler, it doesn't work. The skit \\"Jackpot the Pimp\\" is the perfect portrait of jus how big of an idiot this dude is. Even my man, Murphy Lee, cannot sav the song \\"Sample Dat Azz\\" from totally bombing. The supposed \\"diamond in the ruff\\" of the CD, \\"Holidae Inn\\" with Snoop Dogg and Ludacris, is still ruined by Chingy's ignorance. So, in all, Jackpot is a worthless CD.

Others are always just talking about cars, women, and money - praising such material things as if they were the apex of their existence. Such shallowness you will not find here. Also, musically, I have only praise for Chingy's immense abilities. He is a consummate musician, whose marvelous voice just oozes delicate phrasing, dynamics, and emotion. Stevie Wonder - watch out! Chingy is Hurrr! A breath of fresh air in an overcrowded and mind-numbingly repetitious genre. Yes, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIP-POP NOT HIP-HOP","review":"The only thing that I have to say about this album is that it is pure bulls@#$#.

Holidae In and Right Thurr are as good as it gets with this album. there are 2 or 3 others decent similar sounding songs (sample dat ass, gettin in, he's herre), but from there it goes down hill. the entire album is repetitive AND i have now permanently sworn off St Louis rap.

Listen to how corny his lyrics are \\"give me what u got for a porkchop, she threw it at me as if i was a shortstop,\\" what is that. This is perfect for a 14 year old girl to dance to in her bedroom. If you want real rap listen to that new DMX joint \\"where the hood at,\\" and stay away from this mainstream bull... i dont know bout you but i think right thurr is a really annoying and played out song.

This is a piece of advice for the people reading this who actually LIKE Chingy... There is way better hip-hop out there, take advantage of the internets scary power.

He has melody in his rap with great hooks and beats that create head bopping catchy songs. This CD and Chingy's style of rap keep you interested in the music, and the guest rappers on some of the tracks give this CD, jackpot, great variety. I think chingy brings a unique quality to hip-hop in his style of lyrics and sound and his connection with other talented rappers, such as Snoop and Ludicrous, make his rap stand out. The songs may not have deep meaning to create social change, but at this point in his career, I don't think that is Chingy's intention. He just wants people to go out and have fun and his music reflects that attitude. This CD will appeal to a wide variety of music listener, even people who would be unlikey to actually buy a rap or hip-hop CD.

Nelly is the real deal, he is what comes across in his music which has depth and truth. Chingy is a kid looking at his idols and trying to copy it.

There's a few moments that gave me a brief smile, but nothing made me laugh out loud.Franken certainly had a weath of material to work with -- George W. Bush's lack of intelligence, lies about the war with Iraq, corporate greed, but that's the extent of the jokes: \\"ha ha, Bush is stupid\\", \\"ha ha, they lied about the war\\", \\"ha ha, corporations are greedy.\\"This could have been much better.

After reading French, Belgian, Indian, and American comic books, I can say that Tintin is still one of the best comic books out there today! The characters are very funny, especially Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus! There is adventure, there are villainous rogues, and there is a sense of having traveled to these countries and lived thru the adventure with Tintin and his faithful dog, Snowy (Milou in French). This particular story about mysterious Tibet, and the Yeti, is very touching in parts, and has all the ingredients to entertain and delight!

Selena also first inspired me to sing, and since I've flourished musically, and I hope to dedicate my first album to her someday! SELENA LIVE: THE LAST CONCERT is a superb and thrilling tribute to one of the world's most promising stars. She was that good...she was IT! Singing LIVE she shines like Venus in the sky; where most lose (especially during LIVE performances when most of the singing is done poorly or is lipsync-d) Selena succeeds tremendously!

It is filled with color and many pictures, which makes it easy to look at. Unfortunately, the narration is written as though addressed to another accomplished biologist - too many big words when smaller ones would be so much easier to understand and equally - or nearly so -accurate. The whole book should be rewritten for a less educated audience and the number and depth of topics should both be reduced. Too much stuff to take it all in although the book is broken down into what appear to be manageable chapters. This might be an excellent second level book on biology, but seems a little tough for an introductory one. Also, make it smaller and lighter and less costly.

Kids will never appreciate the naming of the holsteins, or the authenticity of the Plain Sect traditions associated with Christmas.

I am going to see Seussical in New York in April ('01), so my mother and I decided we'd like to know the music first. Well, as Gertrude says, \\"I was hooked from the start...\\" I LOVE this cd!! The lyrics and plot are very kid-friendly, but not stupid. Lyrics are wonderful, and every song has a different style. If your children are like I was- singing and dancing around the house- you want to buy this cd! It's fun and catchy lyrics and songs will keep you singing all day... after all, it may be a \\"Day for the Cat in the Hat\\"! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect musical for kids","review":"If you go into listening this recording expecting a highly sophisticated, mind challenging score, then you may be disappointed. HOWEVER, you must take into consideration the target audience this musical was written for - kids. I must admit that I was a little leary about this show, myself. After having seen it, though, I was surprised with how entertaining the show really was! The music was fun and unpredictable (something I think modern musicals need more of) and it told a fun, imaginative story with a powerful message. That last point (having a powerful message - that people are still important no matter how small they are) particularly is important to get across to children. Adults may think this musical is silly but it's supposed to be that way. The kids in the audience at the production I saw seemed to immediately enjoy it. In conclusion, it's a fun musical that doesn't take itself too seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids' Musical Enjoyed by Adults","review":"I was not inclined to add to my collection a musical like this because it was not adult. But on an impulse I bought it. I was delighted by the music. There are some things in the show that only the adults will get - and they are funny. Flaherty's music and Ahrens lyrics are catchy, funny and poignant. Children will understand what they mean, but adults also will appreciate them. I particularly refer to \\"How Lucky You Are\\" as a song with allusions only adults can appreciate. The music is attuned to children, but adults will find the score upbeat. This was a happy surprise of a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The critics really missed the boat","review":"This is simply a great musical. Memorable songs with great melodies, a funny story line and a very engaging use of the core Suess material. Over time this will become one of the classic standards despite being panned by the critics. You simply can't like musicals and not appreciate the quality of this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful rendition","review":"I bought the CD because I am doing the show right now. I wanted to hear and learn the music. The CD is wonderful but they made some changes from the original score, so learning from it was a little difficult at times.

I do enjoy being able to listen to it in the car. It's very upbeat, and quite fun to pick out the different Seuss stories. Would recommend if you like musicals or Dr. Seuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, Great show.","review":"I personally love this CD mainly because over 4/5 of the songs are good. The tunes are catchy, the lyrics are good (although Seuss himself should have gotten more credit on the lyrics than was given to him.) The lyricist mainly does a pretty good job of sounding like Seuss, though there are some bad lyrics here and there. Some of my favorites are ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE, AMAYZING MAYZIE, ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE, HERE ON WHO, and HAVIN' A HUNCH. Oh, and you can't forget CHASING THE WHO'S. Horton is great for the part, nice softer voice, very sweet sounding. Gertrude is great, she deserves a tony. David Shiner is wonderful as the Cat in the Hat, although he sometimes sounds kind of strange, but i guess that is just the show. Jojo is great, and has a good voice for an 11 year old, he certainly sings better than I could when i was 11. If you love musical theatre, (and even if you don't) buy this CD!!!! It's well worth your 14 dollars, or however much it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this musical","review":"This is one of my favorite musicals ever written - were I to go into Broadway, Horton the elephant would be a dream role."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low Point in 20 years of Theatregoing","review":"After seeing Seussical, I can honestly say that it tops my list as one of the WORST shows I have ever seen on Broadway. The Music was immature, Horton has no voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't need a plot for a great soundtrack","review":"While Seussical the Musical has received mixed reviews on Broadway, and the shortcomings of plot have almost certainly doomed the show itself from a significant long-term run, that has entirely no effect on the music. The music proves to be the highlight of the show, and I'm sure that at least half of the people who saw the show since its launch late last year would jump at the chance to buy this CD and relive the music. The foot-tapping rock-like beat and catchy, definitely Seuss-y lyrics make for a wonderful listening experience and even if you aren't familiar with the plot behind them, you can certainly appreciate some of the humor and messages in these lyrics. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eww...into the woods, but not quite","review":"Okay, so they've got a really good idea. Except Ahrens and Flaherty don't really have the know-how to create a show that doesn't include excessive amounts of power-ballads. The music isn't as unique as it could be. I highly doubt Dr. Seuss characters sang power ballads. The plot kind of sucks and the characters, albeit some of them being memorable (when bad singers try to belt out the tunes in amateur productions), the show's writing could use a severe tweak. A kick in the head is due to Ahrens and Flaherty who can't write a piece of consistent music to save their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid musical experience","review":"I usually enjoy most musicals in some parts, but this is the only one i have found that i can absolutely not listen too. I have made several attempts to listen to the whole things, and indevidual songs and each time i give up in frustration from the pedestrian music and lyrics, as they grate on my central nervous system. god, i hate this musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seussical Is a Joy","review":"Critics who badmouth Seussical have hearts two sizes too small. Horton is a good soul, keeping both his promises -- to the Whos and to Mayzie's egg -- beyond realistic expectations. \\"Alone in the Universe\\" and \\"It's Possible (In McElligot's Pool)\\" are two of my favorite songs from the show. My wife and I went with our two daughters during Boston previews, and we all loved it. Since I bought the cast recording, my 8-year-old has learned all the lyrics and is ready to fill in as understudy for nearly any role in the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cd, not so good show.","review":"Let me get my complaints of this musical out of my system right now. David Shiner is WAAAAAAAAYY miscast as the cat in the hat.The show was done on way too big of a scale. The costumes and scenery do not represent the inventivness that Dr. Seuss stood for. THERE!!! Now for what is good about the music. Every one on the cd has great voices. The tunes are very catchy and occassionally touching. There is a lot of music on this cd (over 70 minutes i think?). The lyrics are inventive and quarky like the books from which they are based (and sometimes outright taken from). Even if you have not seen the show, you will still enjoy the entertaining mix of styles of music, including: pop, rock, broadway, swing, tango, and soul. buy even if you didn't like the show.

If you take the time to learn the camera it can take some VERY good pictures. The fact that some people have problems with it, I think, stems from the fact that they don't take the time to learn all the features. This isn't a point and shoot camera. (Although it does pretty good at that.) That being said, on to the bad. The autofocus [is bad] Really, this is one area that just makes me more mad every time I use it. If you were just using it for landscape shots or non action shots it would be ok (not great, but ok). However, if you have to focus on anything that is moving around much (like kids).... Forget it. Go to manual mode. One peace of advice... Turn the color adjust up one or two clicks and the images look 200x better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the times","review":"While this camera boasts lots of features, and for the most part that is true, it is not easy to use. There is so many buttons to change to get the right photo, it is time comsuming and awkward.Battery life- none- batteries are only good for about 20 pictures then, new ones must be put in.Quality of pictures are variable and enhancements need to be done on almost all pictures taken.Eye piece and other connected plastic pieces seem to fall off easily and permanentlyThe worst is the video, the quality compared to lesser priced camera is poor and WIHTOUT SOUND.

Sure alkaline batteries in this thing are a joke, but with some 1600 mAh AA NiMH batteries and a fast charger ... I get 150+ shots per set of batteries (30% flash).

For instance, it's got matrix, spot, and center-weighted metering, and I've used them all. If you are an advanced amateur and really enjoy digital photography, this is a great camera. It was designed for you.The not-so-good: like ALL digital cameras, this is not as sophisticated as the current crop of 35mm SLRs. For instance, the focus is slower, and it's hard to use for studio/flash work. If you don't like reading camera manuals, buy another camera. To get the best results, you must be prepared to tinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minolta Dimage 7 Digital Camera -- The best camera ever!!!","review":"I love the Minolta Dimage 7 Digital Camera.

Be sure to have plenty of battery power, however, as your 4 LiMH batteries will only enable you to take about 70 pics (equivalent to about 3 hours of on-standby mode). The manual zoom allows for excellent custom shots, and it saves on your dear power availability. The programming options are good, and if you prefer customization, you can memorize your own settings. As for what really matters, the picture quality is superb. You can really put the 5.2Mpixels to good use, or simply maximize your memory card with lower resultions photos. Natural light dark shots are excellent with the available ISO 800 setting (manual only). Highly recommended, but keep in mind the battery time and necessary charging time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because it cost the most, doesn't mean it's the best","review":"My husband purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for me, and it was my first digital camera. It feels good in your hands, and I liked the look, and I read the book, but after only three pictures, the batteries would go dead. So I was changing batteries about every five minutes or less. This was very frustrating, but not near as frustrating as when I tryed to install it in my computer.My computer never did see the camera, couldn't find the drivers, and after two days of working with it, and almost in tears, I gave up, boxed it up and we took it back to the store, to get our money back.I am now in the process of looking for another brand of camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megapixels aren't everything","review":"I bought this camera and returned it in favor of the Canon D30 (a 3.3 MP semi-professional camera with much higher quality images and the ability to swap lenses). The Dimage 7 has plenty of pixels to be sure. But the quality of those pixels is pretty poor. Lots of noise in my shots and the lens caused quite a bit of distortion (keystoning). The battery consumption was also HORRIFIC. Finally, the case design was very poor and cheap feeling. .... This camera was a great let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Eco-Friendly","review":"Outstanding picture quality, but I wouldn't recommend its purchase. The battery consumption is alarming.

The seat itself is great and a good idea, the magnetic part is very solid, but the jolly seat slips and slides all over the place because its impossible to get the sharp metal wingnuts screwed tight enough in the tiny holes at the back of the toilet to stop the seat from moving when an adult sits on it (and be prepared to get down on all fours and stick your head down behind the back of the toilet every other day to tighten it!). It is constantly slipping over to one side of the toilet and the rubber flange thingys move around all the time and we are constantly having to adjust it. I would have given it one star, it is so frustrating, but I felt generous because the rest of the seat is a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super-lame installation","review":"As a toilet seat, it's decent. A touch of flexing when sitting on it, but not a big deal (the MDF version wouldn't have that problem).But the installation! A typical toilet seat you buy today is installed using nylon bolts and nuts. It's quick and easy and only takes four parts total. What were they thinking with this toilet seat? Each side has a bolt, a retainer clip, a gasket, a rubber cone, a metal washer, and a wing nut. With both sides of the seat, that twelve parts! Why would anyone design such a complicated installation method? It probably took me twenty minutes to install it with the retainer clips sliding out of the gaskets as I adjusted and tightened the bolts."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after just 2 weeks!","review":"I really liked this seat and so did my girls.

The seat is a great concept and my daughter loves it and thinks it is very comfortable. However, the pieces that attach it to the toilet make it an unsafe product. It has come loose from the toilet many times; almost causing the user to slip off the toilet. The pieces have now completely broken and the toilet can no longer be attached. We purchased the Family Seat five months ago and we now have it sitting in the box and had to put our old toilet seat back on the toilet. My daughter has since fallen in the toilet because she was used to \\"her seat\\" on the Family Seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after less than two months!!!!","review":"We happily purchased this when potty training our daughter a month and a half ago. It broke tonight, and I just found out that the return window expired two weeks ago.

Do not by plastic if you can help it. If I could return it, I would, but I tossed the box. Returning a toilet seat seems wrong since it is used. Ok, enough ranting, just trust me. P.S.

It is full of period pieces, to go along with a period tale. It seems to have become standard practice to entice viewers to the screen with music for which they are nostalgic, which tends to make the movie fit solidly into a category and not stand so much on its own. It does ring of Goodfellas and Casino, and even of Forrest Gump. That said, the soundtrack has a lot of great songs, but you've heard them all before, and probably have them tucked away somewhere already, especially the best tracks.

The plot, what little there is, revolves around a legendary killer who escaped from a nuthouse and kills people (campers) whenever there's a full moon.

Stevens and the guys from CIIC. It's almost as good as the Savatage \\"Edge Of Thorns\\" release, but it fails to reach those heights IMO. The only thing I didn't like about this release was the lack of any real guitar solos....After being a huge Savatage fan since 1985, and idolizing guitarist C. Oliva for so long, it's hard to hear someone else trying to match his incredible skills. The guitars on \\"Watching In Silence\\" could have been much better IMO....All in all, if you liked Z. Stevens in Savatage, you'll love this. He sounds great here, and his voice fits this style of Metal very well. I think this is his best vocal performance in a very long time...Try it out. It's worth your attention. Circle II Circle certainly has a future in Metal. It's a four star release IMO...SAVA-LEGIONS RULE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevens' post Savatage career starts off with a bang!","review":"Five out of Five stars.

Zak collaborated with former band mates, Jon Oliva and Chris Caffery to put together a spectacular album. Great guitar riffs, hooks, and of course awesome vocals and lyrics. Hardly a filler on the whole record!This hard to find gem (unless overseas), seems to be only available online. That's too bad, with the right exposure, who knows what could happen?I've been in touch with the CIIC camp, and it seems Zak and Co. are hard at work with the sophomore release which promises to be an even darker than the first album.

Zak's vocals are what got me into Savatage in the first place. This things is strong start to finish.

No offense to Jon, I love his vocals, too. When I read about Circle II Circle on Savatage's website a few months ago, I jumped for joy. It was more than worth the wait.

It is a kindly, if dated, telling, perhaps too much in an older style to amuse today's high-speed youngsters. The natural history presented is, on the whole, accurate.The racial attitudes revealed are old-school (though still much too common in some parts and some people), not out-right nasty but redolent of the notion that black people aren't really able to do important work. That alone could be the basis for an interesting discussion with a youngster of a certain sensibility.There are other natural history books much more worthy of your or your child's time.

He likes to be as close to his human as possible in the car, but I wanted him to be safely tucked into the back seat. It is definitely easy to install and remove. However, no matter how tight I make the buckles to keep it from sagging, my dog is able to very easily push it down to get into the front seat. It really does nothing to help the situation.

I loaded my weenie dogs into the back seat and they are 10 lbs, 8 lbs, and 7 lbs. They are mini's so they are very short. I was driving down the road and the dogs were easily able to jump over the top. I had to pull over and put them in the back seat. So after yelling at them to stay they decided to chew through the cords keeping the barrier in place. They chewed through with ease.

Don is an awesome instrumentalist, but the compositions seem to fall short. It seems that in most cases a catchy guitar riff generated the songs, not the heartfelt desire to write a piece of music. The result is a technical tour de force, not a piece of emotion. Not a bad record, but it is (unfortunately) a bit forgetable after a few listens. Check out Laurence Juber or Michael Hedges if a you seek a more wholistic blend of chops and emotion-pulling composition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a wanna-be","review":"With this album, it is clear that Ross is still inspired by Michael Hedges.Unfortunately, with few exeptions, this album is harmonically poor and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Unique Player!","review":"His playing is very refreshing, and unique I love it and so will you!!!

I appreciate the words she heards every day reaffirming her place in our world and in God's love. I have bought another copy for my sister, who provides a foster home for babies preparing to be adopted, and one for my son's family, who lives in another state. My granddaughter lights up when she hears the first notes of the first song, relaxing into a peaceful demeanor the whole time the CD plays.

This is one of her finest works. I love that these messages, while for children, really speak to us as God's children. Please do another album like this, Twila. We need more songs with this message.

After I got used to the cuff pinching my ear a little bit, I haven't noticed it at all, and the cuff has remained in place on my ear. The best thing about this product: it's made of sterling silver, so if you're allergic to Nickel, even if you wear the cuff all the time it won't hurt your skin.Negatives: The ear cuff did not look exactly like the picture shown; the middle of the band is a much simpler design than what I was expecting to receive.

It's somewhat heavy at around 30 pounds, but it is very sturdy and stable. It's impossible to see the construction in the pictures, but it is a hollow plastic table top (like kids toy construction) that adds a good deal of strength to the top. The legs are metal and feel very sturdy. The legs fold under the top and latch into position so they aren't flopping around when you carry it.

The fold out stove portion is a bit confusing to use the first time, but was very nice for piece of mind while we cooked. It even has a little loop for hanging a trash bag.Downsides? It is definitely bulky, and we've replaced it with a much more complicated, but lighter and more compact, folding table.

For example, Wang's story about the student who got the tone wrong on \\"pen\\" (bi in the third tone) and said \\"bi\\" in the first tone (slang for the female genitalia) when asking to borrow a female classmate's pen, is the kind of illustration that will definitely make a student pay attention to tones from then on!

But, there are some things that have to be said. This is a very little book about a very small farm. It's extremely well written and Mr. Winchester's obvious intelligence and knowledge become more and more evident page after page. Mr. Winchester is highly observant and understands what he observes. The thing is, he observes the quiet, tranquil world of the small, rural farm. This isn't a bad thing, in fact, I think it's a very good thing, but the farm is populated by insects, birds, a few livestock animals and essentially no other people. Additionally, clouds and the weather are significant players in the book. The book almost reads like a series of letters from a distant friend who is highly intelligent and fills you in on the simple aspects of his life on his small Oklahoma farm. Ultimately, this may be the, \\"quietest,\\" book I've ever read about one of the quietest lives I've ever read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is now a treasure of mine","review":"Once in a great while I stumble upon a book that rings of truth and settles into my imagination.

Is it commercial friendly? Yes. Does it have as much thought put into it as \\"No One is Really Beautiful\\"? Most likely not. But if placed in the same situation, what would any musician do? The best he could with the cards he was dealt. In light of this, it is an absolutely fantastic album and on the premise of 2 weeks and $10,000...it's absolutely flawless and intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this CD, support this amazing artist!","review":"I absolutely love Jude's music, all of it.

Eccentric singer-songwriter Jude attempts to expand his fan base with these 11 pop songs, confining his oddball humor (and humanism) to a few near-novelty tracks, and laying on a sincerity that fits him like a cheap suit. Highlights include \\"The Not So Pretty Princess\\", \\"Sit Ups\\", and \\"Teenage Girlfriend\\" (the most desperately funny cuts here).

This is clearly the worst book ever written about him. And it is very poorly written. What were these guys thinking! I'm sure Ali would not approve of the many factual errors, not to mention the way the information is presented. It's obvious that the writers did not interview Ali.

This one is not even worth the paper it is written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I thought this book would be interesting but, really, was just utter disappointing. There were several factual errors, especially the one about the Ali-Liston bout. Also, many statements were made with little justification, quoting third hand sources, people who had little connection to Ali.

Maybe a 3 CD set would've contained them all. Also needed is a boxed set that contains the best version of all of their studio tracks.

This was a wonderful opportunity to put the Stones 40 greatest songs on one set and instead its just another chance to make some money and put out a few new mediocre songs. Its hard to argue the greatness of the music however, since 75% of the songs are some of the greatest rock ever made. The rest are, shall I say, slightly lacking. That the classics such as As Tears Go By, Time is on My Side, Can You Hear Me Knocking, Heart of Stone and Play with Fire are not included proves that these are not the 40 greatest Stones songs. I also could have done without their weak singles from the 80s (not including Start Me Up).

Disc two, on the other hand, has disgraceful songs from the eighties and nineties. These songs have nothing to do with their earlier work from the sixties, when Mick Jagger used to be a rebel. I really can't believe that there is a song like \`Mixed emotions' on a compilation album. Of course there are also great songs on disc 2 like \`Start me up', \`Brown sugar', \`Miss you', \`Angie' and \`It's only rock 'n' roll', but that's it.The Stones made their best songs in the seventies and sixties...

Disc 2 offers several songs in EDITED versions: Miss You (3:35 instead of 4:46), Beast of Burden (3:20 instead of 4:30 and Fool to Cry (3:58 instead of 5:05). The Stones deserve better than this.

Uneven releases by those controlling the Stones catalog are common. For example, every track on the Stones UK Aftermath release are in true stereo and sound crystal clear conversly all the songs on both versions of Out of Our Heads were released in mono only (remaster!).

On disc 1, we get the MONO version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction instead of the much better sounding stereo version that was included on the European version of Hot rocks.On disc 2, the following songs are presented in EDITED versions:Miss You, Fool To Cry and Beast of Burden.This should have been at least a three disc set with ALL songs unedited and in stereo.

Not having ever owned a Rolling Stones album, I decided to take advantage of this \\"new\\" compilation to introduce me to them. For that purpose, Forty Licks is more than adequate, giving me the songs that I knew were Rolling Stones legends -- Satisfaction, Start Me Up -- as well as songs I always heard and loved but didn't recognize (Ruby Tuesday, Wild Horses) and of course songs totally new to me. This was a fine buy for a newcomer like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stones Collection","review":"First of all, the Stones are great!! But I think the best songswould be on the 2nd disc. The first disc is a classic but notthe best though. It contains JUMPING JACK FLASH, SATISFACTIONand START ME UP. Great collection from the Stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great.","review":"Seriously, Forty Licks just ain't enough for the Stones. The following songs have been, quite unfairly, ejected. Some of these songs seem to always miss the final cut (NOTE: These songs were only chosen because I don't own them and I would like to, not to mention the fact that most Stones songs are good.) Little Red Rooster, Play With Fire, No Expectations, Jigsaw Puzzle, Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker), When the Whip Comes Down, Respectable and Waiting on a Friend.So you put those eight on, then throw off these eight: The Last Time, It's All Over Now, She's a Rainbow, Angie, Fool to Cry, Keys to Your Love, Stealing My Heart, and Emotional Rescue.Another thing you could do is just BUY THE ALBUMS!!! At the same point, this did get me into the Stones, and I'm glad it exists. Even then, I'd reccomend Hot Rocks more highly to beginners. But if you want the classics, get it. There are plenty of classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compilation of Greatness","review":"I bought this CD because I had some extra Christmas money and had heard and liked a few of the Rolling Stones' songs like \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Start Me Up\\". What I didn't realize then was this would be the most unregrettable CD I'd ever buy. Both discs are excellent and well worth the money, but the first disc is rock 'n' roll greatness, start to finish. You've probably heard many of these songs and just haven't realized they come from the Stones. VH1 called the Rolling Stones the second-greatest rock 'n' roll band behind only the Beatles, and I think this collection is far better than the Beatles' \\"1 Anthology\\" I also like AC/DC and Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT REMASTERING HORRIBLE PACKAGING","review":"Well just check out my other on line Reviews about the 'stones and you'll understand more what I mean: they've done it again with this one....The remastering efforts like all of that with SACDs is fantastic. However chopping down the songs was uncalled for. Even though I recommend this CD set for a person just being introduced to the group (especially the younger crowd), but even then the Stones could have done something better. 'Don't Stop' is a pretty good tune but you can tell they just did it quickly...no major thought there...the other new tunes aren't up for consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe it should have been 45 licks?","review":"What can you say?

My least favourite song on this CD would have to be 'Start Me Up\\" which does not refer to Mick Jagger's inablity to get going but does contain the Immortal Lyrics \\"You make an old man cry\\" or words similar to that effect.One does not have to be a Rhodes Scholar who Majored in English Literature to produce such eloquence.I can never understand the words when Mick Jagger is singing.Unforunately Jagger's antics on stage are now a parody and caricature of what used to be a good impersonation of jaded , rebellious youth.These guys play Rock and Roll but they are PURE ESTABLISHMENT through and through.

I know 95% of it and the few new titles??? Well, I didn't need to be remined that Mick and the boys just don't have it anymore.For rock'n'roll, you gotta go look elsewhere these days.

It's telling that many of the tracks omitted from this collection -- \\"Harlem Shuffle,\\" \\"Waiting on a Friend,\\" \\"Almost Hear You Sigh,\\" and, most of all, the stellar \\"One Hit (To the Body),\\" are a great deal more interesting than colourless tunes such as \\"Shattered,\\" and the truly insipid \\"Undercover of the Night,\\" both of which were deemed necessary inclusions here.

The remastered sound has completely changed my opinion of Street Fighting Man from decent to excellent, and other songs benefit as well. Playing this straight through is proof that the Stones really are \\"The Greatest Rocknroll band in the World.\\" The songs are just amazing from the dark Gimme Shelter to the beautiful Angie and the attitude-packed Get Off My Shelter. The new songs aren't as good as say, Sympathy for the Devil, but they're not bad either. This album caps off a wonderful year for the Stones, who have proven that they still can rock better than anyone else 40 years into their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few licks short...","review":"I can't wait to hear:* Heart of Stone* Out of Time* the Last Time* Play with FireOh wait a minute these great Rolling Stones songs are not included.

What bothers me is there are there edited versions of \\"Miss You\\", \\"Emotional Rescue\\", \\"Fool to Cry\\", \\"Beast of Burden\\", and \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\". To me, those songs, as well as the others, were never meant to be edited. I do, on the other hand, enjoy the four new songs found here. Also, it was nice to hear a STEREO version of \\"It's All Over Now\\", which you do not hear too often. Despite the edits, this CD is a good addition to anyone's collection, if only for the four new songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Collection","review":"The most well known classic rock band in the world. Spanning decades the Rolling Stones have shot to international fame, but even after forty plus years they have not had that great of a greatest hits collection. Sure there has been Hot Rocks which only captured the beginning of their career, Rarities gave you 16 edited or live songs and Jump Back gave you like 18 songs songs for the same price as Forty Licks. Forty Licks is one of the best collections of any band. It gives you all of the Stones hit songs and a couple other songs. Forty licks has \\"Satisfaction\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" from the 60's. \\"Get off my cloud\\" \\"Fool to Cry\\" \\"Beast of Burden\\" and \\"Miss You\\" represent the 70's. \\"Start Me Up\\" and other 80's classic got thrown in as well. This compilation should fit just about any fan around, I know the diehard fans would just as well buy all the studio albums instead. But for the normal listener or new fan Forty Licks is a great collection to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not be buying this set!","review":"I am a relatively new Stones fan, and a friend of mine burned forty licks for me. but having burned isn't the same as having the actual thing, so I was planning on saving up some money to buy this box set thing. Well, I will not be doing that now. According to the other reviewers, the discs aren't even in a jewel case, which is what I really wanted. This is a bad thing to me.

As a long time progressive music fan I can only say: AWESOME!!!. I think this will turn into one of the Classic DVDs in the genre. The lush and complexity of this music is just thight and perfect, mainly in the venue of Epics Yes style, and executed by Virtuoso musicians. The cute girls in the backing vocals do an excellent job and garnish the scene with simplicity and beauty. Needless to detail the excelscitud of the musicians: need to see it to believe it. They deliver accurately and without gadgets or hesitation. This does not seem a big budget producction. Nevertheless, the picture is high quality, the sound well mixed, making it all together a Proffessional Masterpiece. Now, when you go to the bonuses and the interviews you'll be amazed by the humbleness of the Band and Crew: pure every-day americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the cd forget the dvd","review":"The music is good, the \\"stage\\" is crowded, it actually reminds me of a garage band.

(having said that, i'm going to see him live this weekend - hope he plays lot's of old stuff...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberty is more important than profit","review":"First of all, let me say the music on Ben's latest won't disappoint. It's the same genre skipping, inspirational stuff we've come to expect from him. But I didn't expect Ben Harper to sell out to the lawyers at his record company. His latest CD is embedded with EMI's \\"copy protection\\" coding, which prevents the purchaser of this CD from saving the music to your computer's hard drive, ripping it to an iPod, or creating a back up copy for yourself (all perfectly legal activities, by the way). Yah, sure there's ways to break the code, surf the web long enough and you'll find a way. But that's not the point. And if this came from some shallow, money grubbing bubble gum musician I could accept it. But from the guy who used to sing about giving power to the people? What happened to the real Ben Harper? What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Too much from the past leaving nothing for the future.

In the past i always seem to be disapointed when my favourite artists have released another album, i think i expect to much. I am pleased to say this album was not one of them (which i decided after the first 10 seconds of the first song). Although not his best it is still a reall good album. One thing i like about ben is his ability to change styles which this album shows, however this album could be said to over do it. One other fault it that it is over produced lacking the raw guitar and vocals of ben.Although less folky and bluesy than his older material this is still a very enjoyable album.Over all it is possibly more mainstream than others which can serve to make it easyer to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"All good","review":"This is great album, I like how pretty much every song is different, and not just songwise, but it spans many different genres. Ben Harper is always good. There's a lot of good reviews for this album, so I won't go much further than that.Two quick points:1) I had no trouble playing the music on my computer and converting it into MP3 form. Don't know if it's just some CDs that have the protection or what.2) Ladysmith Black Mambazo has been around forever and have sounded the same before and after Paul Simon's Graceland album. I don't think it's fair to say that Ben Harper copied anything. They're a beautiful sounding group and they always have that sound. I'm sure everyone remembers the Lifesavers commercials..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This is a great disc. Harper draws from a wide variety of influences, from the roots reggae sounding \\"With My Own Two Hands\\" to the Stevie Wonder-ish \\"Brown-eyed Blues\\" to a Cat Stevens sounding \\"She's Only Happy In The Sun\\". A very eclectic disc, with some truly beautiful tones.This CD fits in perfectly with Harper's previous discs, including the great Fight For Your Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Harper does it again","review":"I will start of by saying that this album is probably his third best, behind Fight For Your Mind and Will To Live. However, I consider those two albums to be among the best in my collection, so that 3rd place ranking doesn't really mean anything negative. The variety of genres that this album reaches, shows the amazing musicianship that Ben Harper and The Innocent Criminals have. Lyrically this is yet another amazing piece of work by Ben. Bob Dylan and Paul Simon are the two best lyricists I have ever hear, but Ben Harper is in my top five. This album has a lot of songs dealing with spirituality/religion, as well as a love motif running throughout. People say that this is a more mainstream album when compare to Ben's other albums. I wouldn't say that it is more mainstream than Burn To Shine, in fact, it is less 'pop'. And, if this is the direction mainstream music is headed, then I'm all for the change. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"a surprisingly lackluster album","review":"I consider myself to be a big fan of Ben Harper, have all of his albums and love his live shows. However, this album was a major disappointment. The fact that it deviates from the jamming style of his live performances is not the deciding factor; compared with his other works, it lacks originality in theme, lyrics, and style and simply sounds disjointed. Even more disappointing is the song \\"Touch From Your Lust,\\" an excellent song live but one which sounds terribly amateurish and botched on the album. If you haven't heard the live version of this song you're missing out. Though not necessarily a bad thing, this album is not characteristic of Harper's usual work, and I recommend any of his other albums over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude!","review":"This cd rox.

Having had many GE products in my five decades, I guess I expected a better product and at least customer support for one's questions. Now I am looking for a better quality DVD player and one which also offers customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Problems","review":"It looks like there is a common bug on the chip in this machine. I bought a DGE100NA at Circuit City so I could play a VCD a friend sent me - and because the Apex DVD player I had could not read the VCD, even though it was supposed to be able to. The GE was able to play the VCD.This DVD player does NOT resume properly from Pause. But I've found a work-around. When you are ready to resume, press the Pause button and immediately press Stop. Then press play and the movie will USUALLY start from the place where you paused. If you try to resume by just pressing Pause, the unit locks up, and as the others have said, the ONLY way to get it to re-start is to pull the power plug - even the Power On/Off button is frozen.The fact that it sometimes also randomly starts movies in the middle is another annoyance. This unit will PLAY a DVD, but it is sadly lacking when it comes to reliable functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unreliable","review":"I don't know if this player is still being sold but if so, steer clear of it. When it works, mine works reasonably well but it rarely works. Most of the time it gives me a \\"no disc\\" message when it has just spooled up a DVD that works in every other player I have.More interesting is GE's response to this. They don't acknowledge that it even exists. Could it be some kind of illegal copy, I ask? No response. I think they know there's something wrong with it.The only good thing about it was the price, but on a per-play basis, I probably should have bought a different player. What also bothers me is what this says about GE. Would this be true of all their other products? I wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with others here","review":"I bought this unit because it was cheaper than others and was recommended by the guy in the store. Since I bought it it has been problematic. It's very tempermental about reading the discs. When i called the store about the problem I was told that that was how DVD players worked and that it would work itself out eventually, like a bug in the system. It conitnued, well past the point of warranty and returnability. It refuses to read most DVD's unless I tinker with it, opening and closing the tray 6-7 times. It skips and stops a lot. There is a problem with the pause feature. Now, only a year after I bought it, it's refusing to work entirely and I have to go buy another unit. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fine when it works...","review":"...and that's precisely the problem: it doesn't work very well. From reading other reviews, I see I'm not alone. When it does work, the picture and sound are great. It worked fine for about 2 or 3 years after I bought it, then it started freezing up every so often. It got more and more frequent and is now bad enough that watching a DVD from start to finish is practically impossible. Sometimes it freezes completely so that it won't respond to the remote or buttons on the front panel. It's been like this for quite a while. It has trouble reading some discs that work fine in other players. I recently cleaned the lens very carefully, but it made no difference. I expected more than 2 or 3 years worth of trouble-free use, and I really didn't use it often. I highly doubt that this unit is in production anymore, but if you come across one, whether it be new in the box or used, don't pay too much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete piece of garbage","review":"I have 2 of these and have had issues with both. The first one worked fine for a while, and then started developing a habit of failing to read the discs an hour of so into the film. The second one worked fine for a while, but then it started freezing and unfreezing in the middle of movies. Sometimes it freezes completely. It's unresponsive to the buttons even when it does work, just a unreliable frustrating product. Avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than in person...","review":"I've been listening to Terfel from the beginning - whenever that was. While I am nuts about his voice and I like him \\"personally,\\" I do not want to hear him in any language other than English, Welsh or Deutsch. In my very considered opinion, he has no grasp of Italian. As for his Falstaff, it is an embarrassment, mostly due to that dreadful production. While I know this sounds as if I do NOT like Terfel, that is not true - but he has his limitations and being light and funny and Italianate are not among his better qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as previous efforts","review":"i agree with sandra's review. i was hoping for another heatseeker or something even more techno in flavor.

Not knowing how serious this guy's thought is, it did nothing for me to hear him blather about experiences of pure emptiness, or have him include his fawning fan mail in these pages. All this did was make me feel he was full of himself (or his non-self) and in need of a bit of a spanking. Fortunately I got A Theory Of Everything and began to realize this guy has a brain a mile wide. Sure would be nice, though, if someone less dry, technical, and academic would come along and write \\"Ken Wilbur For Dummies\\" or something. \\"One Taste\\" is not that book.

I think of this as a wonderful result of the flow of Kundalini Energy which is very different from Spiritual Energy. I failed to find evidence of humility, and simplicity and compassion in the book (qualities of spirituality)so I would have labeled it as: Daily Reflections on A Highly Intelligent Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Taste by Ken Wilber","review":"This is an easy Ken Wilber read. As it is written in diary form, we get to see how he thinks and how he spends his days as an integrated spirit. There are some passages about his personal life as well as good Q&A stuff from some students and an esp. lovely commentary on Art (and a few other subjects) as well as a really great interview with Shambala magazine. I loved how easily accessible his somewhat complex intellectual work is in this format. Everything is there in digestible daily journal entries..easy to read one at a time or by the week or month...always fun to think about after reading. I topic-indexed the whole book with sticky notes so I can refer to the references he makes so clearly and succinctly in context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Inspiring!","review":"This is wonderful book that gives us a rare glimpse into Ken Wilber's personal life, he writes this book in a much more relaxed and fun manner. It's a great introduction to his works, there are many brilliant insights and summaries of many concepts. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in a spiritual path. Read everything this man writes, it will change your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Good, They're Great","review":"The Twigs are a sister act, and a very high-energy one. They write beautiful songs with haunting words and catchy tunes, performed in exquisite harmonies. This is their second album, and it features some fun techno-sound-effects, possibly reflecting their move from Chicago to LA. Their cover of the old Kinks hit, All Day And All Of The Night, trembles with passion and is itself worth the price of the CD. \\"Mrs. Green\\" is sort of a social-commentary folk song about a sensitive caring man who abandons a woman and child. \\"Surrender\\" seems to reflect a bit of Eastern religion. \\"Hello\\" is a mysterious song about reaching out to an intimate who is growing apart. \\"It's Alright\\" is an exuberant song of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuck in the movies","review":"The title of the book I read is Creature Features. The first thing that happened in my story is four boys named Simon, Nate, Albert, and Jon go into an old run down drive-in theatre. Then the boys started playing with the projector and get sucked into the films. They have to run away from monsters. Simon somehow gets zapped out when switching to a different movie. Simon can't just turn off the projector because when ever you touch it, it shocks you. The ending was one of the major reasons why I didn't like the book. The ending was Simon just unplugged the projector. Then the three other kids just fall out of the screen but the monsters fall out too and in a movie length of time the monsters just disappeared. The author should have explained why the projector shocked him and I think the author should have put more thought in to the ending. I rated this book a 2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right to the point","review":"Schaeffer doesn't hesitate to jump right into what he wants to say!

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand 20th century people living in the desperation that our society leaves them in. Schaeffer has a tremendous grasp of the historical context of our century, but he doesn't beat you over the head with it or use it to show how smart he is.

These two songs are also the main reason why I purchased this CD. (Well, that and it was on sale.) Track #6 (\\"Is It Love\\") eventually became another favorite of mine. The remaining seven tracks are all okay, but none of them really surpass the aforementioned three tracks.Lyrics are included in the booklet (plus a couple band photos), which is always a plus, especially since I never understood all of the words to \\"Kyrie.\\" Overall, this is a relatively decent, upbeat CD. There are a few duds (which I expect from most CDs), but the handful of good songs on \\"Welcome to the Real World\\" make this CD worth owning if you're a Mr. Mister fan or just love 80's pop/synth rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish Mr.Mister were still making music.....","review":"\\"Welcome To The Real World\\" was Mr. Mister's second album and their most well-known album to date.

I just wish they had continued as a band after their third album,\\"Go On\\" in 1987 proved to not produce any big hits for them. they had everything in a good pop band:great lyrics, musicianship, and song craft. I originally owned this album on vinyl in the 80's and just recently bought a copy on CD. I LOVE this album and like I said before, all of these songs are good! \\"Kyrie\\", \\"Broken Wings\\", and \\"Is It Love\\" were the singles that were hits off of this album but they should have released \\"Black/White\\",\\"Run To You\\", and others as singles because they would have been hits too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An example of truly outstanding 80's music.","review":"While most of the music of the 80s really lacked depth and fine musicality, Mr. Mister stood out as a serious group making serious music.

Do yourself a favor, BUY IT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen To The Non-Hit Gems","review":"I bought this album released in 1985 because of super hits BROKEN WINGS and KYRIE but after listening to the whole album more and more songs on the album captivated me. First pick is RUN TO HER well-structured slow moody ballad which could have been another hit. Techno-pop styled UNIFORM OF YOUTH and DON'T SLOW DOWN are also the album highlight of the first half. On the whole the album direction is somewhat between SURVIVOR/STARSHIP catchiness and MIKE&MECHANICS;/GENESIS vocal style.Verdict: Catchy yet deeply melodic masterpiece.Rating: 96 out of 100Recommended for: Wide range of mid-80s pop rock fans and particularly if you love Survivor, Starship, Mike and the Mechanics, Trillion, Pride of Lions and Mecca."},{"rating":"1","title":"christmas will never be the same","review":"my mom bought me this album for christmas and i killed her what more can isay"},{"rating":"2","title":"The right adapter for the right job","review":"This is exactly the XLR adapter that I needed.

For me I need a lot of time and peaceful moment to read this book. To actually think along. Tofler give the reader trend and fact of what will happen for the next period in our lives. He began with the historic past and the situation now. and provide the reader some idea and evidence for the thing which will happen in his opinion. Some change is inevitable. Many information in this book will take you to another side of your thought. I will not comment whether I beleive him. But one thing I need to hi-light here is that I love reading this book. The book which contain a lot of information and trend which gives you other view to the future-world. the reader themselves are the people to judge whether they should believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening, Life Changing","review":"My first thought after reading this book was why the hell didn't they teach this to me in school. My immediate second thought was that some might see it as destructive. It is of no surprise why authorities would want to keep this book suppressed. The idea of the industrial revolution coming to an end would metaphorically put many of powerful leaders on the street. The people in charge now are benefiting from the second wave era and change isn't something that is going to happen without a fight.If you have no idea what the frist, second and thrid waves are please read this book. This information is very important if you have any care whatsoever to what is going on in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good, if we were in 1980","review":"Here in Brazil, I read this book, thirty years ago, when I was a child. Well, if we were in 1980, I'll would give four stars for this book. Well, we are in 2010 and I have to give two stars for it.This book has many things that became corrects. Others became an absurd future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Trilogy","review":"Toffler's Third Wave uses a bizarre expression of Marxist theory to interpret the obvious: that societies differ in their stages of development and progress in ways that put them in conflict. Readers would have been better served had he condensed the many hundreds of pages into a short story or op-ed article. The analysis is shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding Up After 20 Years","review":"Even though this book was written in '80, a large amount of it still stands up. An important work for us as a society to think about family, work, government and socialization in new ways as we approach the next wave of societal evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Little Phone","review":"My daughter adores this phone. The adorable \\"Bippity Boppity Boo\\" theme song makes getting phone calls fun. My only complaint would be that the top of the phone can be easily knocked off the base, which has happened several times in our home. All in all, though, if you're looking for a fun phone for your young daughter to enjoy, this is the one to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!! Horrible!! Phone","review":"Memorox expected me to pay for the shipping of this phone, which has not worked since we bought it for my daughter for Christmas. Toys rus won't exchange it either because I don't have the recipt and they have only a 30 day return policy on electronics. Its would more to ship this phone, then for what I paid for it. I will never buy another mexmorex prouduct again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful book","review":"I adore this cookbook - I've liked everything I've made from it, which is much more than I can say for most of the ones I've used. She has excellent taste in food, and most of these are very straightforward to make -- the ingedients are all things that are possible to acquire, the steps make sense and are understandable, and the suggestions about what to serve together are helpful. Hopefully, she'll write more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just stews","review":"I've had this cookbook for almost 10 years and it is still one of my favorites! It was one of two that made the cut when we moved abroad for a few years and had to leave most of our belongings in storage. There are meals to please my young son as well as his spice-loving parents. One of my favorite features is that the author suggests salads, starches, and desserts to go with each stew, and those recipes are also included in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alight with Dark Fire","review":"If magic is just undiscovered science, then Sansom's alchemy in recreating Tudor England is the formula for exploring how this century lurched toward the Age of Enlightenment. It provides a fascinating recreation of the minds and hearts of Henry VIII's realm. Sansom takes the time to develop his characters with sharp distinction, and uses weather and smell to give readers a visceral experience of the day. His blend of historical events and the characters playing them out, both real and fictional, is well crafted and exciting. I hope he keeps Matthew Shardlake alive and well for many more installments!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read a bunch of historical mysteries","review":"This book is a tremendous mix of history and mystery. The characters are well drawn, and the author allows glimpses of Tudor England without overwhelming the reader. The mystery is well thought out and unlike many actually makes sense. One only hopes the author produces more in the series. I'd also reccomend P.F. Chisholm for Elizabethan England and Owen Parry for the American Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"When an author's first book is exceptional, I always worry a bit that their second book will be a disappointment. No worries here. Sansom, again, manages to combine excellent characters, sense of time, place and political intrigue, as well as some good suspense into an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good!!","review":"Since I actually know Latin (damnata iam luce ferox, \\"(with life and) light now written off, dauntless\\" is the perfect thing for Elizabeth to write and many an up against the wall Elizabethan quoted it, but Shardlake's translation of it is not near right)I could raise an eyebrow at that one thing. But there's too much to love here--the map of London, the tiring horse trips instead of taxis, the Sugar Party, the horrors of a filthy London summer, the Stripping of the Altars made realer and stinkier than Eamon Duffy ever conceived. A topflight member of a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matthew Shardlake Series","review":"This is the second in the Shardlake Series of books that take place during the time of Henry VIII. Matthew Shardlake is a former reformer and a lawyer. He also does \\"odd jobs\\" for Cromwell, who during this book is about at the end of his tour of power under Henry. Dark Fire, is a name for a substance that was discovered by the Greeks over a hundred years before and came to England with an old sailor. Cromwell has promised a demonstration to Henry and cannot find the Fire. Matthew is set to find it and get the formula. Lots of subplots along with the main theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read every one in the series!","review":"I couldn't put them down. My favorite historical series. Great writing. Great plots. I carried them everyone, and I bought the hard covers. I can't wait for another. I mean it. I adored these, and I'm a tough reader to please. Don't miss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne","review":"The contention that Anne was noble and gave her life for her country is utterly absurd. She was firstly a political pawn moved by her famliy and secondly desperately ambitious. Admiring Anne for her skillful manipulation of court politics is one thing but romanticising her as some kind of heroine misses the point entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the music from the movie?","review":"I watched the movie. It was great!!! Now i just wanted to hear some of the cool dance music that was in it. That plus some of the great punk rock songs (\\"Superstar\\" by Saliva was one of them). I listened to some of those samples. What's with all this rap and R&B stuffz? I don't remember hearing that much of it in the movie? Movie soundtracks should actually feature some of the [actual] songs from the Movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of filler to say the least...","review":"Yes, many have noted that the music here is not necessarily in the movie itself...but then again that's why there are two soundtracks for this film. This is the rap infused soundtrack that exists mainly because Ja Rule appears in the movie. That said, Ja Rule provides really the only track here that's worth listening to. His \`Furious' (which appears on his album under another not so nice name) is the only track I really liked here. The Limp Bizkit remix was never better than the original, and the random tracks by almost every other rapper are just filler at best. Ashanti was nice to see, she's always great, as is Faith Evans, and I found myself starting to like the track by Caddillac Tah, but all in all this is just another compilation of tracks by artists you probably wouldn't listen to had they not been on this soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question about a song title","review":"Does anyone know the name to the music playing at the beginning of the movie where Paul Walker is first seen testing the speed of his Eclipse in that parking lot looking area?

If you do know it, daf@webone.com.au"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"This album gave me so much false hope. For instance, there's a song by some guy named \\"Black Child\\". Well, I immediantly misread it and assumed it was by Black Thought of The Roots, since I didn't know there was some guy named Black Child. I got excited at hearing a new Black Thought so I skipped to the previously mentioned song. I then realized that the guy singing the song completely sucked, so there was no way that it could be Black Thought. I then looked at the back of this case again and, much to my disappointment, realized that it was not by Black Thought.<..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to waste your money...","review":"We are talking about the same movie?

I dont recognize almost any of the songs. The best song in the movie is on there. Where did this slow paced songs come from??"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the good movie music?","review":"Just got back from the theater...the first thing I said when I walked out the door is \\"I've got to get that soundtrack!\\". After coming home and listening to the samples and seeing the artists on the CD, it's obvious that Def Jam is more interested in promoting their own artists than with providing me with a accurate movie soundtrack. Someone please let me know if they ever decide to release the real soundtrack, and who do I contact to complain about the current one. It's pure deception!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This NOT the Movie's Soundtrack...","review":"Most of this CD was not what most reviewers expected like I; all the techno parts that *MADE* the movie are not here. Not even one... If you like rap that is basically a lot of racist talk OVER and OVER again with a bunch of random explatives thrown in, then this is for you... Sad that they would even attempt to push this off as the soundtrack (actually bait and switch). Must have seen a diff movie than I. I use it as a drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED HELP!","review":"does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. =]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Song not on soundtrack","review":"the song they play when johhny trans house is invaded is a song called Debonaire by a band named Dope"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was great; The soundtrack is a joke!","review":"Argh! What is this??!! This can't be the actual soundtrack to the Fast & The Furious.Where'e all the industrial techno rock in the movie?! The music on here is mostly just plain rap. In fact this poor soundtrack sounds more like something I would play at a slumber party!The only reason I give this a two instead of a one is because that I personally thought the F&TF was great. Other than that, this soundtrack does not do the movie any justice! End Of Story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a valid soundtrack","review":"Like all the other people on here, I was lulled into searching out the AWESOME music soundtrack from \`TF&TF\` just for Brian Transeaus (BT) simply superb new musical score, only to find that the soundtrack might as well have been a \`best of hip hop\` compilation! was it just me or did we ALL miss this music in the film?!?!!!Come on Universal, dont cheat any more people out there and release a newer album containing ALL of BT's fabulous energy pumped score on it!P.S BT did include one his older songs that accompanies the desert race section where he loses his VW Jetta to the S2000, called \`Loving you more\` which this particular version appears on BT's IMA album. THAT may as well have been a more faithful soundtrack to the rest of the rubbish on the current \`movie soundtrack\`!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rap music for an action flick?","review":"It's understandable why Ja Rule would have a song (or three..) on this soundtrack, obviously being his small co-role as one of the street racers. However, the action sequences that are spread out evenly through the film doesn't match a 99% rap/r&b genere of the album. I would have guessed 'Fast and the Furious' to be more rock driven than any other genre, Limp Bizkit was featured on both trailers for this picture with 'My Way' and '9 Teen 90 Nine' yet only one song is heard here and it's the [Rap Version] of 'Rollin' (how ironic). Poor soundtrack for a very good movie...think harder on the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This was total ...!

The R&B music does not fit the movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Dissapointment","review":"The movie is amazing ... but the soundtrack is horrible. In the movie, there are 2 songs by Saliva, and 1 song by Dope, neither of which are on the soundtrack. The mix of rock and rap in the movie is great. However there is no actual rock on the CD. If you were going out to race, you want something with high adrenaline fast tempo, not R&B. See the movie, but pass on the soundtrack ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least listen to the samples before you buy!","review":"i'm not panning the movie or even the cd, but did you notice the music used in the ads/trailers? well, that kind of high octane is all but absent in the soundtrack -- in other words even the movie's own promoters recognized that the soundtrack does little to evoke the sheer urge to drive fast and furious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me know when the ACTUAL movie soundtrack is released.","review":"Like many people apparently did, I rushed right out after seeing the movie, which I LOVED, to buy the soundtrack. Unfortunately (I thought at the time), my local music store was out of the CD. However, after reading your thoughts on the subject and listening to the samples myself, I am SO GLAD I do not own this soundtrack. None of the cool tunes from the movie managed to appear on this CD, leaving me wondering whether a second CD will be released entitled, \\"The Fast and the Furious REAL Original Movie Soundtrack.\\" I'm so disappointed but at the same time so glad that so many people warned me through these reviews of what the album really had to offer: NOTHING! I'll wait for the real thing, thanks. In the meantime, I'll go see the flick again."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf???","review":"None of this music was in the movie with the exception of one or two songs....i wanted the hardcore techno beats that were all through the movie...and all i got was R&B and Rap. Very very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth anyone's money","review":"When I bought this soundtrack, I expected to hear all the phat techno beats that dominated the background in the movie, but all there is is Ja Rule popping up in almost every song. I think the only reason they put him in the movie is so they could give us a Ja Rule album instead of a soundtrack. It doesn't even have the song that's playing when Vince and Brian get in that fight in the beginning of the movie, and that's the entire reason I bought the CD! I'm still hoping they'll come out with a \\"More Music from the Fast and the Furious\\" disc. Or at least a score or something. The soundtrack that's out now is just a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was not good ,and there's a reason!","review":"I have listened to this album, And personally I didn't like it because, Well to start they do this all the time!.

Honestly, I hope they come out with a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This soundtrack sucks","review":"I saw this movie and was very happily surprised. It far exceeded my expectations ten fold but this soundtrack sucks. These songs arent the ones I was expecting.

Was this a joke? I am laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"neither fast nor furious","review":"R&B that doesn't make my adrenaline rush or make me want to drive fast.

But i would have really liked it if they had added all the techno music onto the soundtrack which would have made it a lot better that what it is right now.... that music really gets you in the mood for speed. I hope they release another CD with more songs from the actual movie...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here??","review":"Well, if you saw the movie, you know that most of the music in it is good Rock/alternative/dance...but then when you listen to this soundtrack it's very dissapointing. In the movie alot of the music was \\"pump-me-up\\" music that really did want to make you drive fast and kick a**. Plus, Ja-Rule must really have some stake in this soundtrack...3 songs??? I'm sorry but this soundtrack just doesn't fit with the movie at all with the exception of the Limp Bizkit. Maybe for those of you who like rap and R&B, this is the perfect cd...but for those of us who don't really care for that, this just didn't hit the spot. I do hope however, that there will be a release of the actual music used in the movie, because if that were the case I would be the first at the store to buy it!!

I got suspicious when the credits rolled and said that the music was done by BT, but there was no mention of the soundtrack with that particular music on it. So, after the movie I ran to a nearby music store and bought the soundtrack without checking the track list first, the store was about to close, and I was trusting that if the producers wanted to make money off the soundtrack they would put the songs from the movie on it, boy was I wrong! I was more than disappointed when I heard the songs on my way home, actually I was really mad about this. The movie is about drag racing and the soundtrack should mirror that. I am waiting for the REAL soundtrack to come out, the one with all that great techno on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"???????????","review":"I Think One of these songs was in the movie, i didn't recognize any others, I was lookin for the song from the rave at race wars and it wasn't there, its all rap and r&b.

I feel as if I really wasted money on this cd the songs I bought it for aren't even on it. Last time I saw the movie I counted at least ten songs missing from Soundtrack...I mean if its a \\"MOVIE SOUNDTRACK\\" why are there songs on there I didn't hear during the movie?

If you already own these songs, more than likely they're on vinyl (unless you've been illegally downloading them... in which case Shame On You!), so the convenience of having these (mostly) rare tracks on a more portable medium is very nice. I like volume two a little better, but odds are if you're going to get one you're going to want to get the other.Most of the tracks here are from their Hyperdelic phase, with a few tracks from when they were just beginning their acid house phase.With both singles collections, there is a little overlap with Godstar: Thee Director's Cut, but who cares.

The story is set in Sussex rather than London, and the lack of high society \\"glitter\\" combined with the pre-Regency time period make for a nice change.The main characters are artfully drawn, as usual. I disagree with the earlier review in one respect -- Sir Tristram and Lady Sarah Thane ARE the main characters, not Ludovic and Eustacie. The secondary characters contribute to the story rather than acting as filler, as with many authors, and the fist two Bow Street runners the reader encounters have to be among Heyer's best drawn third tier characters.There are two Heyer novels that always make me cry, no matter how many times I've read them, and this is one of them. Even though I've read it at least half a dozen times, I finished it -- again-- today, and I laughed so hard I cried during Sarah's encounter with the Runners.Absolutely entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romantic Mystery","review":"The Talisman Ring is one of Georgette Heyer's better novels, mixing her wonderfully humourous characters with a touch of mystery. Georgette Heyer once again shows her skill at making minor characters \\"come alive\\". The plot is intricate and fun, as our four major players try to solve a murder, and recover the Talisman Ring. The novel moves at a rolicking pace and is amusing from start to finsh. Sarah (Sally) is one of G. Heyers more mature heroines, with a mad sense of the ridiculous that constantly gets her into trouble. This novel has runway heroines, tumbrils, smugglers, secret passages, dashing heros, slimey villains and of course that essential to all period romances the \\"headless horseman\\". All in all a very light-hearted, enjoyable read. A classic Georgette Heyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor version of a good book.","review":"While this has always been my favorite Heyer, this particular version is awful: misspellings, incorrect words, large tracts of dialogue left out - and believe me, I checked it against my falling-apart hard copy.

Her novels are admittedly the inspiration for modern day romance authors.Talisman Ring has much to recommend it: sprightly characters, a mystery to be solved, and two love stories.

The person I was talking to could hear me, but I had complete silence from them. Then if I tapped the phone or made a noise, the sound would come back (so obviously, this was not just me having the volume down too low). The reception is also terrible in my area of Central Florida with this phone.I got a different phone (Nokia 3595) and it has worked a lot better so far.

I suggest you take a listen to this song if you can. Another standout track is \`Over Under Sideways Down' with Slash on guitar.

Still good to listen to, but with hindsight, would have chose a different album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colors are washed out","review":"This monitor is way too light (everything appears faded out), and adjusting the contrast and brightness controls don't help.

However, it makes a HUGE difference in sound output. This thing makes my bike sound like a freight train. I don't use my horn very often, but when I do...I want people to hear it!

I would rather play Double Dribble on 8-bit Nintendo. The graphics are ok, but the control is pathetic. You pass it to a teamate, and they pass it right back to you. Why? Also, there is a foul called on nearly every possesion, usually against someone that you're not controlling. I played a game, Houston vs. Duke, and some guy from Houston shot 14 for 14 from the field. I go to the Univ. of Houston, and I know that no one is that good. I rented the games, so I only wasted $6.48, but I beg you to not buy this game. You'll only regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a HORRIBLE game","review":"The reason this is a horrible game is that the controls are the worst I have ever used. The game play is slow and this is just a horrible game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done game","review":"Although it does have alot of the real teams and players, this game is unrealistic. The player ratings are way off for some players, and in some cases(ie Jason Richardson from MSU) players who are good shooters and players can't make shots and are nearly useless. On the other hand, all you need to do is find a good shooter, even if he is a bad player, and keep shooting threes. If you time it right, you can make every shot. This is a poor simulation game, but could be fun for arcade game fans that don't care about realism. However, it's pretty bad when you can beat Duke by 30 by just shooting threes. With Northwestern."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame and travesty for Playstation 2","review":"I rented this game even after reading all of the reviews thinking maybe it would be better than what everyone was saying. So i decided to play my first game as my favorite team, the Boston College Eagles. Thats when i found its first obvious flaw. No, i didnt find this flaw it just stumbled upon me like all of the other ones. None of the numbers were accurate. WHere is the Troy Bell like point guard? I couldnt find it. My first game was against Brown. I became even more irate when Browns point guard could not miss. Every team you play there is always one player who hardly ever misses which is nuts. Also, the foul level is very high which has already been mentioned in other reviews. The stadiums and atmosphere .... And the players faces are just plain scary.

I am not going to write a huge review, but i just would like to point out why you should avoid this game at all costs. The graphics only look modestly better then a regular ps1 title. There is no sense of being in the game. When I selected Michigan State to play Duke at Cameran Indoor Stadium...there was no sense of the wild and crazy atmosphere you would expect from 2 great schools with basketball tradition. Where were the Duke Crazies? So i shut the game off and never played it again. Please Please PLease!! Save your money! 989 better get their stuff together if they want to stay in business.

Well I couldn't have been more disappointed. I mean, who has the final say as to what games get released for this system? After just one game I was looking at the box to make sure I hadn't accidentally picked up the Playstation One version....no such luck. Even though some other reviewers say the graphics are ok, I say they're down right unacceptably bad. It seems to be a case of lazy programming or something. I mean, after playing the Dreamcast's NBA 2k1 for months (hands down the best basketball game ever) I just cant understand how developers couldn't take advantage of the PS2's superior capabilities. After this atrocity, unless its another Syphon Filter game, I am never wasting money on a 989 title again. For shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is PS1 quality...","review":"in a word \\"...\\". I seriously believe that this game was a hold over from 989's Playstation 1 games. The graphics are laughable. Owning Madden 2001 before Final Four I will admit to becoming spoiled by the facial expressions and the witty dialouge(although sometimes repitious) between Summerall and Madden, but the Quinn Buckner play by play is utterly horrible. And there are only 3-4 facial types. So everyone on the team looks like someone else. Another problem I faced was in recruiting after the season. If I replaced a Senior with an incoming freshman and changed his number from say 14 to 00, the number would be changed in the lineup but not on the player's uniform.

The graphics are nowhere near PS2 levels. It looks almost identical to last years PS version. There is no dynasty mode. I played 8 games into a season as a mediocre team and was shooting 87% from the field and 81% from three. Way too easy to make shots for you and your opponent. You can rarely get a rebound in the rare instant you do miss. Also stealing the ball is very easy but way too many fouls are called when the computer is shooting. This may not be the worst game I ever played but it should go down as one of the worst for the PS2. If you are a diehard college basketball fan the try it before you buy it. If you just want a basketball game get NBA Live 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"989 = Head Games?","review":"Anyone who has had the misfortune of playing any PC game made by a company called Head Games will know exactly what it's like to play 989's NCAA Final Four 2001 for the Playstation 2. This game looks and plays like it was rushed out the door before it was fully developed and finished. The players move awkwardly, much of the time gliding across the court, and the graphics are, for lack of a better term, bizarre. Everyone from the cheerleaders to the players look like they were mated with praying mantises, then dressed up in baskeball gear and motion captured for the game. Without a doubt, the most infuriating aspect of NCAA FF 2001 is the shoot/rebound button being the same. Grab a rebound, then unintentionally shoot from 90 feet away, over and over again. My suggestion would be to buy EA's superior March Madness 2001 for the PS1, and take advantage of the cleaned up graphics when played through a PS2 console."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The worst game on PS2 that I've played yet.

Final Four 2001 is horrible. the gameplay is slow and hard to control; the player images are poorly designed, and the commentation .... the high point of the entire game is the actual court; the court looks very realistic, but if you don't want to sit and just look at the camera circling the court them i would seriously reccomend not buying this game. in fact, i wouldn't reccomend even renting this game. and after seeing how weak gameday 2001 and gamebreaker 2001 both are, we ought to boycott 989 studios altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the time and money","review":"As a frame of reference, I am an avid fan of: 1.

Although the graphics are good(player faces and uniforms are impressive), the controls are far too sluggish. It's way too easy to score on offense, and it's next to impossible to defend on defense. The various dribble and dunk moves are less than creative. The arenas are accurate as far as the hardwood floor extends, but all of the seating is exactly the same.
