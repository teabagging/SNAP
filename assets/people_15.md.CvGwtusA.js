I wanted to like her, wanted to be empathetic, yet by the end I was cheering her husband for getting away from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the title, disliked the book","review":"I wanted to love this book. Unfortunately, Gelman has not learned the art of telling a story without giving her judgements on it. I wish she had given the reader some credit to be able to distinguish what characters are sincere and which ones aren't. Instead, she tells us her opinions of these people, leaving the reader no room for interpretation. I felt preached to. With every passing page, I felt more and more resentment toward her style of writing that proclaimed how her choices, her travel style and her friends were far superior to anyone else's.There are many other travel books that do a much better job of allowing the reader to feel a part of the story. Choose one with, perhaps not as good a title, but with better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road Not Taken","review":"While Rita Gelman describes the countries she's visited and people she's met, her book is more of a travelogue than an insightful travel memoir. The writing is uninspired, particularly given the out-of-the-way places she visited and people she befriended. The roads she did take and places they led her had such potential to deliver fascinating insights into what she learned about herself in the process. But she chose not to take that road and rather gave us her travel diary: first I went here and met so-and-so and then I went there, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I just finished this book & I love it! I love reading about interesting people & I love reading first hand travel stories. Rita Golden Gelman's book \\"Tales of a Female Nomad\\" has both. I am not a writer so I will keep it short, but I totally enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contemptible","review":"I had contempt for this book and the author. She gives the impression of a teenager attempting to be 'cool'. She goes to foreign countries and mooches off families by living with them for months at a time and sleeping with men she becomes so connected to, after talking to them for a couple of hours in a restaurant. Give me a break. The most offensive for me however was her typical and obvious left-wing contempt for her own country."},{"rating":"1","title":"get real","review":"I could not finish this dribble. Who does this woman think she is and why would I care. He r life is so out of touch with the norm that I think she isn't aware of how unresponsible she is.Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of a Female Nomad","review":"This book was quite an inspiring read. The author, Rita Golden Gelman, is likeable, authentic and courageous. She completely changed course in her life during her late 40's. Many of us dream of simplifying our lives, letting go of many possessions and being able to experience endless travel. This read will allow you to live vicariously through a women who actually created this type of life for herself. Like me, I think most of you will be quite happy that she decided to write this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through it.","review":"I was so excited to read another travel book, but this one has highly disappointed me. I have put it down in disgust a few times only to attempt to give it another shot later- only to be disgusted again!I see I am not alone in my feelings; Rita is too self absorbed and I learned nothing I had hoped from a woman who traveled for 15 years. The sentences and thoughts are choppy, the characters underdeveloped, there is too much name dropping to even keep track, too much \\"I'm so special and have so many friends-everybody loves me-yadda yadda.\\"Rita probably enlisted no help in writing this book obviously because she feels so highly of herself. She should of had a ghost writer. The entire time she is just patting herself on the back. Instead of giving a reader the opportunity to armchair travel, she is rubbing her lifestyle and \\"serendipitous\\" moments in their faces.I can describe this book in one word: sickening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mid-life Inspiration","review":"This is the first time I have been moved to write an Amazon review and I'm doing it because I found some of the other reviews a little strange. I loved this book! Everyone in my book group loved this book too, and that rarely happens. I borrowed this book from a library, but I'm going to buy my own copy, as well as one for my sister.On the surface, Tales of a Female Nomad is about the travel adventures of a middle-aged woman. But more importantly, she explores issues that many of us grapple with in our forties and fifties: coping with a life that didn't work out quite the way one planned, remembering the youthful dreams that were put on hold during the years devoted to raising children, looking for new spiritual meaning in the world. Rita Golden Gelman plunges into a life of travel, friends, and freedom with guts and good cheer.Younger readers might lose patience with her musings, but my over-40 friends found her delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech - save your money","review":"I have to echo what others have said, as I want to save you from the way I feel about the money I spent on this book. The author has been to fascinating destinations for fifteen years, yet somehow managed to write a terrible book about them. Her constant \\"taking\\" from the people and places she visited were appalling. Teaching English is not enough of a contribution when you are a wealthy writer relying on the hospitality of others, particularly in the developing world. Help me out and please recommend other travelogues?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, self-absorbed memoir","review":"Another poorly written, self-indulgent, boomer memoir reminiscent of \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" This author chooses to write only what she wants to share with no regard for the storyline, the interests of the reader or, most annoying, a shred of respect for the craft of writing in the English language. A very frustrating read, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rita's an Amazing woman!","review":"I just finished reading Rita's book for the second time and loved it even more. I often give a copy as a gift to girlfriends with courage and determination to pursue their dreams, as Rita did (and continues to do). It takes true gumption to live as a nomad and the payback in magical. She's an inspiration! I'd love to meet her one day... hopefully in some far away local learning from the locals. If you've ever considered stepping out of the safety box, give this book a read and see where it takes you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring but annoying","review":"This book started with a great title and premise, but then goes downhill from there. As one who spends a significant amount of time daydreaming about \\"leaving it all behind\\", I was anxious to hear what promised to be an exciting account of her new life, but the book disappointed me.I enjoyed the first third of the book as she begins her life-changing experience, but found her personally annoying by the end. Perhaps my dislike of her is politically based, but I quickly grew tired of her self-righteous, understander of all peoples, angry at America attitude. Where initially I saw her as a courageous woman dealing with a dramatic life-changing event, by the end she came across as a somewhat bitter, nearly unstable expat. Please just more objective descriptions of your unique experiences and less left-leaning ranting. It was hard to finish.If you're not bothered by the politics of the author, this book does provide an interesting account of a variety of experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Written","review":"It was torture to get through this book, and I must admit I had to speed-read and skip several pages, even chapters, to reach the end. There are several great adventures here, but it's too bad the writing is so poor. Laurie Gough's \\"Kite Strings of the Southern Cross\\" is beautifully written, poetic, and obviously written by a gifted writer. Just because a traveler has gone out and seen the world, doesn't mean that traveler should/can write a book about it. Perhaps Rita Gelman should take some writing classes before embarking on further excursions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting lifestyle, TERRIBLE writing style","review":"The high reader review rating for this book completely baffles me. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it! It has about as much style and insight as a tween's diary entry. There are infinitely better titles out there in the woman-living-abroad genre...don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book","review":"If you have read this far, you are probably contemplating buying this book for yourself or for someone else. Do it. You won't be sorry.The author's experiences are delicious: just the sort of thing we travel readers love to savor. What makes them special is the writer. A middle aged American Mom, not an Extreme Adventurer, moving in with Irian Jaya natives or being stopped by Nicaraguan rebels ... who wouldn't fantasize him/herself in those shoes? And isn't that why we read about travel, after all?The author has a light, deft touch. She is at her best in describing the people and food she encounters. And she does have a way of enabling those encounters, although she would tell us she is merely being open to them.You'll be charmed, delighted, reflective, and envious in reading this. A terrific self-discovery through travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a favorite!!","review":"This book is amazing! It is super interesting to follow the author through her experiences in other countries. It is inspiring and engaging. I read it several years ago, so I bought two more copies to give to my sister and a friend. A must read for anyone that wants to travel or wants to find themselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling All Adventuresome Women","review":"Absolutely loved this book because I have a bit of \\"the Nomad\\" in me, too. Gelman's fearless and economical approach to the nomad lifestyle of freedom makes it seem possible for anyone to accomplish, especially if world travel is your goal! It's mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I found this book boring and poorly written. It was a waste of my money. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book offered the unique perspective of a woman who is mature enough and conscious enough to embrace the warmth of each individual she encountered instead of lumping them in to a cultural stereotype. We learn via Rita, about the things that we all have in common and can see the differences as items of interest instead of the focus of the book. I gave this book to my daughter and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A selfless experience","review":"I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book so I could write a review.Rita, dear Rita thank you for taking us to far away places. Thank you for giving of yourself--you were so vulnerable,grateful and determined. I loved the insecurities you spoke about ie, fear of eating alone,fear of not being accepted by the circle of women etc. I felt the longing in your heart to identify with the country , its people and customs. Your appreciation of different cultures , patience and sincerity was felt by others obviously and me. I would not hesitate to read another book authored by you. I like your style and what you conveyed to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book-read it over and over","review":"This is one woman's amazing story of turning heart ache and mid-life crisis into emotional healing, friendship, travel and adventure.Rita does what every woman desires-to go outside of her own borders and experience many other cultures. She learns spanish, indonesian, and experiences so many cultures (to name a few: mexico, bali, nicaragua, galapagos, australia and israel).She can tell a story and she tells it well. At times it's a little slow, but when you look at the tale as a whole-it's really worth it.It's self empowering. You as a woman can go, travel by yourself and live in different countries and cultures you never even imagined existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best travelogues I've read... spirited, inspiring, and personal!!","review":"I have read travelogues from Theroux to Bryson, and I appreciate the genre as a fellow \\"traveller\\"... I found myself reading this and broadly smiling, relating, and feeling as if Rita had taken me along for the ride of a lifetime... She writes from her heart, with courage, as she lives. I wanted to email all my adventurous female friends and relatives and urge them to read this book!! As an avid reader and world traveler, I recommend this book highly... take it on vacation, you might just consider staying wherever you are a lot longer!! LOVED IT!! Thank you Rita -- you inspire me to live large, pack light, and just go for it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept.... but dissappointing","review":"I was looking foward to delving into this book and learning about various cultures and this woman's spiritual journey. Unfortunately, I only made it through the first few chapters. The cultural experiences she spoke of were interesting but the tone of her book reflecting the high opinion that she has of herself. While it's conmendable and courageous to live as a nomad there was no need for her constant bragging throughout this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it .... but I didn't","review":"I love books about wanderlust. Eat, Pray, Love and Into the Wild to name some well known books. For a woman who wanted to leave her entitled life behind, she still managed to crave entitlement - in my opinion. She always negotiated food with her rent so she was served most of her meals rather than shopping and cooking for herself. She wanted to live with the locals where she went, but then she complained when she couldn't have things her way. I know some will not be so harsh as I'm being with their reviews, but she really rubbed me the wrong way. Lastly, who remembers James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\"? I think this woman also embellished what actually happened. I'm not saying she didn't do all these things, I just think her memory is different than what actually happened. If all these things happened to me, I'd go out and buy a lottery ticket. I only made it half way through the book. I was getting irritated every time I picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Retriever Handbook","review":"I was disappointed in the contents of the book. I expected more details on how to handle puppy problems and more specifics on the Golden Retriever breed vs other breeds. It was too general and I did not learn much having owned two other Goldens it did not offer any benefit to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good and Helpful Book","review":"I found this book very helpful. It has graphs that have trainability, house trainability, etc. that compares them to different breeds. It is quite useful in the training section too. It also has a history on the dog, and just about everything you want to know about Goldens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Most Consistent Work","review":"It took me a shile to fully appreciate this album. But after a number of listens, I finally have grown to love the album. I consider Old Ramon to be their most consistent work ever. Though I love this band, I usually have to skip a number of tracks in their previous cd's to fully appreciate them. However, not this album! My favorite tracks are Golden, Michigan and Wop-A-Din-Din--an excellent and endearing song about Mark K.'s cat.I am a huge fan of RHP and I consider them to be the best band to come out of San Francisco, my hometown. Any band that names an album after my favorite place in the world, Ocean Beach, is sure is a great group!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Fans!","review":"I like the Red House Painters, late at night when my heart is bleeding again. That's my review. But...take a bow RHP listeners. I read all of your reviews and they are some of the best written, most intelligent, sensitive reviews I've ever read about a single album. (Not counting Jazz Reviews) Gosh what a \\"heady\\" group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check Please!","review":"This album fell desperately short of my expectations. Granted, this is the only Red House Painters album I own and others may be better. I actually like the instrumentals, but the lyrics are trite, and the vocal melodies try pathetically hard to be interesting. I actually find the songs painful to get through. Unfortunately, if not for the vocals, it may have actually been pretty good.I can't believe there are so many people willing to praise this band and that there aren't more negative reviews. But here's one for you: For generally loving this type and genre of music, I really dislike this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too self indulgent","review":"This is a great example of how bad cds can be for a band. Just think: if this had been vinyl, they would have only 35-40 minutes rather than this 70+ minute mess.Wow, good band but this one needed editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice academic introduction","review":"robin hood is really best appreciated viscerally, not intellectually. but this book manages to do a nice job of combining the two by analyzing the character thru his cinematic history.delving into the fairbanks and flynn versions is to be expected, but nollen also explores the legend from viewing several other works, many of which might not be known to you. he also does a fine job of tying in the scottish counterparts (rob roy, et al) and explaining their impact on the popular conception of robin.all in all, a fine book of film criticism, and a nice addition to the robin hood bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than previous Flint titles","review":"I was much happier with this disc, because the publisher obviously decided to up the number of episodes being released per disk Instead of the usual three that the first three DVD's had, there were four on this disk.I still feel like this title is missing something important since there is no Japanese audio track and subtitling, but still a great series.As for the episodes on this disk, we have three episodes that each deal with the capture of one time shifter, and one episode that acts like something of a recap, to give people a good idea about what has gone on in the series so far. Each episode is very cute and enjoyable, and the characters are fun and colorful, as always!A great release to add to your collection if you like 'cute' anime like I do. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written","review":"This book is a mid-career biography of Dr. Paul Brand, a leading researcher in rehabilitation for leprosy patients. The book is extremely thorough in its details, perhaps overly so in some places. It begins with the lives of Brand's grandparents, gives a full account of his father's earlier influences, and includes much information about Paul Brand's early childhood in India, as well as his later childhood in Britain. Despite the depth of details, the book is extremely readable, and I found it to be a real page-turner from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Man","review":"Dr Paul Brand was a humble and passionate man who lived to serve.His life is a testimony to the wonder of life and the grace of God.\\"Ten Fingers for God: The Life and Work of Dr Paul Brand\\" paints an excellent picture of this amazing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time and cash","review":"If you've ever used an extension cord on other games, you can just sit back on your couch away from you tv instead of sitting in a chair 4 feet away from your tv crouched over.

There's certainly enough source material!I have another Martial Arts dictionary which is tiny (not quite as thick and about 1/4 the size) with 10 times the number of terms and they are fairly well explained in there. I like reference material, so this will probably get a 2.5 in reality, but I'm rounding down for lack of depth. The explanations are quite nice, however, so if that's what you are looking for, you will be happy.

I can't even imagine how one would break or wear this shelf out. Highly recommended to anyone who has a regular locker, but I can't see myself carrying it in and out of a school or gym on a daily or weekly basis. And the price is right!Note that there are colapsable locker racks on the market also. Some are made of plastic and not very sturdy, but since they fold they would be great for constant relocating or temporary use. For me, this model works great because it won't fold up accidentally.

Bad mixing is at times annoying as are a few of the hair-brained ideas the crazed duo comes up with ('Chord' will either take you to wonderful places or drive you mad)while 'Dance', a component of Lake part 2 is clearly the work of a novice and quite obnoxious.)

I would not recommend this product, sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be one of the worst in the Teach Yourself series. Some of the problems are common to other new titles in this series, while others are unique to this book. The coverage of grammar is extremely weak. Many of the exercises are not challenging at all--matching elements in two columns, circling words, rearranging sentences--and do little to increase command of the language or reinforce material learned. Other exercises require vocabulary that was never introduced and is not even in the glossary. There is far too much English on the CDs, and astonishingly, English words are used as examples for Greek pronunciation. Often there is no time allotted on the recording to repeat the Greek phrases. The author and editors seem to lack a basic grasp of elementary principles of language pedagogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helpful.","review":"I have found this book & cd pack really helpful. I have a lot of experience learning languages by myself and since I was planning to visit Greece I have been into learning greek. (I've already come back and I plan to continue my studies). This book is really useful since it moves step by step. Every unit is about a certain topic and contains dialogs to introduce the new vocabulary in a progressive way. Then, you will find the necessary explanations in order to start speaking yourself. To check your progress, you will find lots of exercises (some written, some of listening comprehension) and you will really be practicing all the skills needed in language learning. Definitely, this is a book aimed at beginners, yet it is not a phrase book. And, if you are a grammar-based learner (like I am), I strongly recommend you to complement your studies with a greek grammar book, yet don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I'm a new student to Greek, my boyfriend is from Athens and is teaching me. I got this book to help me with grammar and vocabulary, but it's turning out to be a terrible book. The dialogues in the book make no sense at all. Everyone in the book is from somewhere other than Greece, so you are constantly learning how to say things like \\"I am from Paris. Do you speak Italian?\\". It just makes no sense. The layout of the book is also not very good. I've done other self-taught language courses and this is by the far the worst I've ever used. I'm now searching for a new book to replace this one. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the casual traveller","review":"I was hoping this book/CD would help me learn some Greek for my upcoming vacation but it is more of a grammar/indepth course than a casual one.

The s-video never worked but the a/v was fine. My original a/v cables are fine, so what I was looking for was an s-video cable. Therefore, I was very unhappy with this product and the fact that when the s-video was plugged in I only got a fuzzy black and white picture.

Very practical ideas! I enjoyed it so much I bought copies for friends involved in ministry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good folk / bluegrass CD","review":"This is a very nice folk / bluegrass CD. None of the songs are to a heavy bluegrass beat. Some songs are more folk and some combine folk and bluegrass. Both Gordons sing solo and together, have good voices, and harmonize nicely.

I have not knowingly heard many of Toscanini's recordings, but I am well aware of all the hype that surrounds his legacy. I'm hoping this recording was made on an \\"off\\" day (actually, two off days) for Toscanini. The ensemble is rather raw and unpolished; individual techniques seem to be top-notch (with the exception of the principal bassoon and principal clarinet), but the ensemble as a whole is rather lacking in clarity and accuracy. Intonation seems to be an issue also--again, with the principal bassoon.Also, the style seems to be rather ambiguous.

She gives the reader a basis to build skills on - something many cookery writers do not. She is very precise about timing, and preparation, and will always tell you - 'Here is the critical moment', and, also, how to deal with it. The book is dense with information.The only quibble I have with the translation, which in every other way is great, is the use of deciliters, when surely a liquid measurement in mls would be so much easier for readers who aren't American, and wouldn't be measuring in the American way anyway!I would have to say that, as an Australian, I was introduced to French cookery, by 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking'and 'Cooking with Pomiane' in the 1970's.'La Bonne Cuisine de Mme E.

I still can't eat certain foods but more foods are tolerable as long as I don't over do it.It is much cheaper than Align and after reading various reviews where customers experienced side effects I decided to stick with the Accuflora.Definitely it is worth a try particulary for those who suffer from IBS, Chrohn's,Diverticulitis, Celiac or any other digestive issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"probiotics","review":"I'm taking a lengthy antibiotic regimen and need the probiotics to counter the effects of the antibiotics.

You'll find yourself hungering for what happens next and the finale is worth it!!! :)The only reason I held back from giving this a full 5 star rating is because I got some glitches on a couple of the episodes.

The characters have all been reimagined, and not in a good way. A lot of the distinctiveness and personality of the original characters was lost in this translation.

The problem with shoulder buttons is the action of pressing them with your index finger forces your thumb to pull away from the D-pad, making special moves very hard to pull off.Well, the 2 extra buttons on the Quantum pad, instead of performing the action of the shoulder buttons, perform the action of the A and X buttons, which acomplishes absolutely nothing. Furthermore, the shoulder buttons on the Quantum are big, and take a long time to push, hindering your timing on special moves even more.

Virtually any combination of cross-pad presses and ABXY can be programmed into these six buttons without a lot of hassle.But be warned-- the six buttons are smaller and closer together than the four on the standard Dreamcast controller, and are not color-coded.In addition, the LR triggers cannot be programmed nor can LR trigger presses be programmed into a button! 6-button Street Fighter-type game players will still have to reach for those triggers if they need to use all six punches and kicks (though C and Z -can- be programmed to hit two of ABXY together, which can be useful)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well enough but not designed with comfort in mind.","review":"I have no complaints about the functionality of the controller.

Not really recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for some games, terrible for others","review":"I am very disappointed with the design and quality of all of the Dreamcast controllers currently available in the U.S. The Quantum Fighter Pad is no exception. It feels more comfortable in my hands than the standard Sega Dreamcast controller and is made of softer plastic in spots, but it is quite a bit bigger. The shoulder buttons are too big and thick for rapid presses, although the standard buttons feel right. The D-pad is decent once you get used to it, but the analog stick feels flimsy. For Capcom's 2D fighting games, this controller is not acceptable. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 plays fairly well with this controller (because of the simplized controls), although it's still only a temporary solution for me. By the way, don't let the six buttons on the pad fool you, the Z and C button's functions can't be changed (they always assume the same funtion as the X and A buttons and can't be programmed otherwise). My final recommendation: Try before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book.","review":"It is good book for someone want learn the basics of JMF.

I only wish it had any ability to control the litterbox odor. There seemed to be almost no odor neutralization, which I notice immediately since I'm in a small apartment and the litterbox is in my bedroom.

It's not dusty and doesn't tend to travel far from the box because it is very heavy.The only drawback to this litter is that it is really dense, so it's probably not as much litter as you think, if you're ordering by weight.

I notice that it's a little less sharp at f/1.4, so I mostly shoot with it at f/1.8 or f/2.0 and that gives me amazing bokeh and subject sharpness.I am primarily a wedding portrait photographer and love to get different angles and styles...this lens provides me with the most creative power."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of he best.","review":"If you can afford it and love the focal length, this is a great lens.I'd like a version ii with weather sealing, and better control of CA (I live in AZ now, so high contrast is common).I'd guess a new version of this lens will be out in 2012, but this one is already practically perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"(No title).","review":"Ronald Smith is the phenomenal pianist and scholar who risked Alkan from oblivion.

My ten year old was upset Christmas night that his was broken. Upon inspection I noticed that one of the \\"plastic\\" posts at the end of the cot that attaches the cross bar was broken. I'm not sure what happened to it but based on my 20+ years experience as an engineer this is a bad design that will not be durable. The metal cross bars will be placing a sheer force on the plastic posts. Eventually they will fail, probably sooner than later. The posts should have been metal or durable plastic, not cheap hollow plastic parts. I noticed other reviews with similar problems. I'm not sure what to do with this now. Might try to modify it.

Focus is extremely fast and accurate in combination of the 5D2 (normally ISO set at Auto)even in very low light indoor condition. The picture quality is exceptional and is so easy to catch a moment with sharp picture in every aperture setting, quite often without flash. F2.8 is not as sharp as the Canon 70-200 F2.8L but it is still way better than anything from other brands.This a very well made L lens and you get what you pay for.

I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light.I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing.I was not disappointed.The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding. Great color, great sharpness. It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed.Does this lens replace the 50/1.4? No way. The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting. But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"Be carefull.

Mine was one of the many I have heard about with \\"soft images\\" - that, coupled with the fact I would need to bring so much equipment with me on the field for good shots, made me exchange it for the 28-135 with IS, which is much more portable, takes fantastic shots, better zoom range, and 1/3 the price. Sure, if you blow up the pics 200% you'll see a difference, but to me, the price, portability and IS make it a much better choice for the amateur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worried about what will your partner will say when they read the visa statement?","review":"Stop squirming and wiggling.

It also does not have images stabilization (IS). The Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens is much smaller, has IS, but has a wider aperture (f4 instead of 2.8) - a welcomed trade-off after my experience. The worst part is I had to pay $50 to return it to Amazon.com since it needed to be insured - and they don't reimburse you for that cost so my recommendation is to go to a camera shop and at least hold the lens in your hands before purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for an L series","review":"I purchased the 24-70mm f/2.8L in early December 2011. I wanted to buy the perfect portraiture and fashion lens for a 24 to 35 focal length to suit my home studio. Though I am relatively new with photography, I have owned 3 L series lenses. The standard I use to judge all lenses is Canon's EF 100mm f/2.8 macro. Tack sharp. I bought the ultra wide 17-40mm L and it was blurry. I returned it. I bought the 24-70mm f/2.8 L and it too was blurry (and not the good bokeh blurry). I am returning it today. At all times I used a tripod and a remote shutter release. The 18-55mm kit lens with IS turned off was WAY sharper in my test with the same lighting conditions. All variables were the same except the lens. I used a Canon 60D. I have sent Canon an inquiry today but I cannot imagine an explanation that would resolve the issue of how a $1400 lens is outperformed by a $150 kit lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"24-70 mm 2.8L Lens Review","review":"I'm an amateur photographer with limited skills.

And this lens is also very sharp, although not as reliably so as the 70-200.The main drawback is this lens is a lot bigger and heavier than the 70-200mm one and as an every day lens it's just too big and bulky. It barely fit in my bag and I found myself not using the camera nearly as often once I put this lens on it. That's the sad truth.In the end I decided to get two non-L series lenses from Canon: the 50mm F/1.8 II and the 28-105mm zoom. Now I am back to using my camera again. I love both lenses because they are small, but the 50mm lens is hard to resist, working on indoor shots without a flash in ways I had hoped my F/2.8 L lens would have. With the Rebel Xt 1.6x factor, I am now considering a 28mm or 25mm Canon lens as well. I love quick lenses: it changes everything for indoor shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor auto focus compared to 24-105 f/4L IS","review":"I have tried two samples of this lens, and they both behave the same: severe back focus. Worse, when I try to compensate using the focus microadjustment feature of my camera (Canon 7D), the focus jumps around +/- several inches from shot to shot (measured at 70mm focal length and 6' subject distance). In practice, I sometimes got lucky and was rewarded with a very sharp image, but most of the time the images were soft to very soft. In contrast, the auto focus on the 24-105mm f/4L IS is extremely repeatable (I needed a +4 microadjustment on my 7D), resulting in sharp image after sharp image. Plus, the 24-105 is lighter, smaller, cheaper, and has an extra 35mm of reach. Yes, the f/4 is one stop slower, but it also has 4 stops of IS, which works very well. Low light motion situations are the only place where the extra f-stop of the f/2.8 would be an advantage, but your photos will still be soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Lens but beware.","review":"This is an excellent lens.

I needed the lens for a few upcoming events, so it went to work right away. After the events, I viewed the images on a computer and was very disappointed. Close images (under 10 feet) were sharp, while images between 10 feet and infinity were almost out of focus. I would get the focus confirmation in the viewfinder, so everything appeared to be fine.After some test shooting, I realized that if I manually focused the lens, the pictures were tack sharp. Luckily, the Live View with the 40D really helped pinpoint this issue as you could enlarge the view and see the focus error. I contacted Canon and they sent me a mailing label so the unit could be calibrated. After 7 days, I have the lens back and it is right on the money now.I am now very happy with this lens and thumbs up to Canon for great service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens with some quirks","review":"I agree with all the positive reviews of this lens. It's a great lens, give's that certain silky smooth bokeh that the 24-105 lacks and gives a nice bright viewfinder.It does have a couple of quirks though--It's very heavy so be prepared for that. A lens of this quality and high speed will need a lot of glass in there.-When you zoom out to wide, it actually gets longer which is a bit strange. Sometimes when you are taking a group picture and you need to zoom out a bit to fit everyone in the shot, the subjects see the lens moving towards them and think you are going in for a closeup. This can be partially remedied by using the included hood which masks the lens a bit and is always extended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens for Events","review":"I've had this lens for over a year and have been very happy with it. I am not sure what the person is talking about who say's that it is not sharp at 2.8, the parts of the face that I focus on are tack sharp at 2.8, the rest depending on the distance will be soft or blurry.

It is a book about battle yes, politics yes, but it can be applied to business, relationships, leadership, and other day to day life activities. It is a book that should be looked at.This particular version and the other books in this illustrated series is awesome. It is so much fun to look at and read and yet we can learn so much from this work.I agree, this is not the best complete translation. Personally, I enjoy the James Clavell translation.

Now I read this one and the Zhuangzi Speaks regularly and it is a wonderful way to enjoy these ideas.My only negative is that this newer edition book, Sunzi Speaks, is downsized from the size the Zhaungzi Speaks 1992 size by about an inch on each size and therefore has smaller print.

The author's writing was too choppy for my taste. And he was condescending to the very people who were trying to help him. I never got a sense of what in the world the man is trying to convey in each place. The goodness of the Irish? No. Rather, I did get the sense that Mr. Hawks was trying to make a buck off writing about his Irish adventure.

As a travel book it offers little in the way of information. As a book to detail the Irish personna as seen from the outside he offers little other than \\"stage irish\\" observations which at times seem to be delivered in a condesending manner which befits his British background.

The worst thing about the unit is that it does not capture as many of the insects as the traditional zapper units and requires the pheromone lure and sticky pad to be replaced at least twice a year.

The historical details are interesting, ex- plaining how the art has evolved during the centuries.

Perhaps I criticize the book unfairly -- I saw \\"Jackie Brown\\" before reading the novel. I have read several other Leonard books, and this was just not my favorite. He has a fantastic ear for dialogue, but here I often found that it overshadowed the plot, storyline and characters. Although I enjoyed Max Cherry's more substantial role, I found it hard to care about Jackie Burke, Louis, Melanie or Ordell. The over attention to dialogue also led to lags in the story. This is ok for a plane ride, but for a better taste of Elmore Leonard (in this reader's humble opinion)read \\"Get Shorty\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT NOT GREAT","review":"Ok so this was my first elmore leonard novel and maybe it's just me but I was dissapointed. The characters were great. Each character was compelling enough to keep my attention. There were witty and funny moments and a little romance witch mr.leonard is suprisingly good at. The bad points well in one word the plot sucked. It is a good premise but it just isint enough to keep my attention for three hundred pages. Its a fairly panned out book for a story so simple. Second is that the climax was'nt much. other then that I enjoyed the trials and tribulations of ordell,louis.melanie,jackie and max."},{"rating":"1","title":"Structural disaster with bland plot!","review":"I have heard so much about Elmore Leonard and how I would love his works. I have a couple of his books sitting on the shelf for quite awhile and finally got around to reading this and am a little unclear as to where the large scale appeal comes from. The plot here is pretty basic and I was waiting for something unique or unpredictable but it never happened. It was pretty basic. My biggest problem was with both the dialogue and the structure of the book. Many many times it was difficult to keep track of conversations and who was talking and what they were talking about. Overall, this is something that I would have been fine skipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Leonard's best","review":"I'm a big fan of Elmore Leonard and Rum Punch is one of his best.The plot: Jackie Burke, a down-on-her luck airline attendant is forced to help authorities nail gunrunner Ordell Robbie after she's caught sneaking cash into the country for him. Of course in an Elmore Leonard novel, double crossing is the name of the game and Jackie, with the help of bail bondsman Max Cherry, devises a plan to take the money and run.This novel has everything we come to expect from a Leonard novel. Great dialogue, memorable characters, and a plot full of zigs and zags. The cops are a little shady and the criminals are as likely to kill one another as they are to kill the good guys. Rum Punch is an unpredictable, rollicking ride; sometimes laugh out loud funny, always entertaining. A great read, from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smart, Sexy, and Original Novel","review":"This is a great book. The plot was unpredictable and it was a wild and crazy ride!

Small wonder Hollywood has chosen to adapt so many of his projects to the big screen (\\"Out of Sight\\", \\"Get Shorty\\") and television (\\"Maximum Bob\\").Rum Punch is the story of Jackie Burke, a stewardess looking at the twilight of her life and becomes involved in an ATF sting directed at gun-dealer Ordell Robbie. The ensuing scramble to clear her name and swindle Ordell out of some money dominates the story, as does her relationship with bailbondsman Max Cherry. Director Quentin Tarantino made a decent film based on the book called \\"Jackie Brown\\", but to truly appreciate Leonard's story and the characters in them one has to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Leonard","review":"Elmore is not one of my favourite authors and this is the first one I have read for years.

'Rum Punch' delivers all this. For the most part this story about drug dealers, gun smugglers, and a savvy flight attendant is a great read. I am always amazed how Leonard seemingly catches every nuance of deadbeats and thugs yet makes their actions comical. The only flaw with 'Rum Punch' reflects the author's tendency to make his plot endings too clever and overly contrived. Yet on the whole this is misdemeanor, not a felony.Bottom line: a great introduction into the world of Elmore Leonard. Recommended for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Elmore Leonard writes as if he understands nothing. He has no feel for his material. Much of the credit for the rewriting of the story is much deserved by Quentin Tarantino. Leonard involves pointless conversations and meaningless details. It is so corny that I COULDN'T stand his words. The plot is much refined when it was made into the movie, Jackie Brown. The author writes as if he is super cool like Ordell Robbie. Basically, he makes Ordell as a joke just the same way he makes a joke out of his work. Rum Punch is too tedious to read that I was dying for the last page. There are good ideas, but he fails to let them flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not his best","review":"I like this book quite a lot, but it isn't quite as funny and snappy as the best Elmore Leonard books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 3 and a half star book rounded up to a 4 star rating","review":"This was my first Elmore Leonard book and I found it to be a pretty good, not great, effort.

However, I did not find the character development or the scene descriptions to be as good as the story. Hence, a four star rating - I'd give it three and a half if that were an option.I may read another Leonard book, but probably not until I've read everything written by Pelecanos and Turow.

Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum.

She found another book for them called \\"A Groom's Guide to Surviving a Wedding: One Groom's True Story\\" by Jim Cutter.

It is non-stop self-promotion and a non-stop confidence game. The author is constantly urging readers not to skip ahead--clearly it's because there is no substance, no program, nothing. There are other alternatives to AA with some substance, such as harm reduction, but this is not one of them. Who is this guy? A complete charlatan.

Incredibly, this is the actual advice of Mr. Carr. He attempts to make arguments with a semblance of logic but all of them are non sequiturs. He offers no independent support for any of his arguments as to why you shouldn't drink. Most people quit addictions on their own (The Truth about Addiction and Recovery by Stanton Peele, PhD.) and for those who are ready to do so, reading this book will only create a minor hindrance. For anyone else, it could be a major impediment. If I could give it less than one star, I would.There are many effective addiction recovery programs (I like SMART Recovery myself).

So don't buy both!If you're ready to stop drinking and need some tools, this book is great. The author is no literary master -- but he targets the real addiction with alcohol, which is psychological, not physical. His premise counters the AA idea that you \\"are\\" an alcoholic -- he believes basically all drinkers, if they lived long enough and had steady access to alcohol, would become addicted to it. (AA people don't need to fear -- he definitely respects AA, just disagrees with its central assumption.)Order it -- for the price of two drinks and a few hours of your time, you could be free from \\"the alcohol trap\\" forever.

Somehow, after reading the book, I just had no desire to drink anymore, and I easily and painlessly quit cold turkey (still quite unbelievable to me as I write this given the extent of my alcohol abuse). For me, the idea of AA or the like was simply too unappealing to really consider, although obviously many people benefit from it.

The IQ is more or less the same without the extender, which is a good thing, the only bad thing is that AF is out with my 400mm f5.6L, which makes shooting fast moving things a bit difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Just Not Enough","review":"I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x. Just keep in mind--1.4x is only \\"40% better\\". It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough. I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead. I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds. I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm. It is an improvement, but not nearly enough! If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you. If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage."},{"rating":"1","title":"canon extender won't interface with Tamron lens used on Canon 30D","review":"How disappointing!

It gives good insight to the attitude of the Red River Tribes, and insight into the amazing personality, Sam Houston. There is even a dictionary for people that do not speak \\"Texan.\\" This book does what some books fail to do: it tells a logical, and understandable story from an eye-witness perspective.

But finally chose 300 f4. 400 f5.6 is cheaper and its autofocus is slightly faster but it lacks IS and its bokeh is inferior to that of 300f4.Mine usage was strictly limited to bird-photography, hence the choice. The sturdy build is worth loving, given the rough field usage it has to go through.Anybody beginning in bird photography should feel a quantum jump in the quality of his/her photographs after using this lens. For its nice price, it's also known as 'poor men's birding lens' in my bird-photographers circle ;-)I am planning to buy a 1.4X tele-converter soon.

It is the perfect size, and the durable cover makes me more inclined to carry it with me. The color is somewhat darker than pictured, which I prefer as even though I am proud of my membership, I don't always wish to be so obvious in certain locations.My favorite part is that it actually contains all the extras which are in my altar bible, including but not limited to space for other brothers to sign, a forward of sorts by Brother Pike, and selections of the bible which particularly apply to masonry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Bible - Great Masonic Gift.","review":"Beautiful gift Bible.

However, today, with the advancements in recording techniques and the availability of a wide-range of performers, these recordings are beginning to sound dated. The studio sound of the recording definately limits the dramatic impact, especially of this Missa Solemnis. The soloists, too, sing in a dated style which only serves to detract and not inspire.The tempi are also too slow and Toscanini inspires very little \\"magic\\" from the orchestra. Again, the studio recording often produces a sawing tone from the strings and a blasting tone from the brass. All in all, listeners would be better suited by more modern recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armadillo studs","review":"This pair of sterling silver armadillos are the just the thing if you're from Texas.

Amazingly solid construction, fixed-aperture, sealing, fast USM (which makes no big differences on Wide Angle lenses, but in noise does) and FTM are pros on this lens. I will not review optics, you can find websites on that much more detailed than here.On the other side I must say the hood included doesn't seem to be very effective, because it's so shallow.

I'm an amateur photographer, so it might be bad hand holding or some other beginner mistake. But, since I bought it, it's mostly stayed on my camera.This isn't a good indoor lens without a flash.

The first lens I bought for my Canon 5D was the 24-105mm. When I received it, I had the similar issues with shapness (or lack thereof), so I returned it to Amazon and got another copy. Again, same problem. It took me sending the lens directly to Canon for calibration to get the problem solved, but who wants that kind of hassle?? Come on Canon, get it together, and improve your quality control. I love my 5D, but it should not be this hard to find good lenses from your \\"L\\" lineup..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's going back!","review":"I orderd this lens a few days ago and I am not keeping it. Here is my reviewPros:* Solid build quality* Fast and quiet autofocus* Well controlled Barrel Distortion even at 17mm.Cons:* After testing this lens for 2 hours. 95% of the pictures were comming out dark with some indoor pictures having dark corners even with my flash on. Picture taken at 2pm on a bright sunny day were dark and colors were dull!!!*My other L lens EF 70-200 f 4 (from 4 years ago) takes amazing picture compared to this one.ConclusionI think this is quality assurance issue. We are in bad economical times and Canon is getting cheap.Now I have to spend $20 to send it back...I am thinking that I am much better off walking into a store and paying the extra bucks and test the lens before buying it...or get a used one from 4 to 5 years ago. In otherwords treat any lens produced in the last 2 years like a Sigma lens test it before you buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"This is my first L lens.

Great color and wonderfully sharp. So I bought one for myself. It was no where near as sharp, it went back, the second was even worse, so blurry my landscapes looked like they were taken with a P&S, even on a tripod at f/11. This third lens is about the same as the second but won't focus right. Sadly I don't think I'll ever get a good copy of this lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing....","review":"It is very unfortunate the one I bought from Adorama renders fuzzy images. Shooting the same scenes, my Nikon D70 kit kens 18-70mm always beat this one.

Given the 17-40 build quality and weather proofing this was really value for money even though it is an f4. I really didn't need to go into a 2.8 for this as I use a couple more lenses if i really need a wider aperture. The picture quality is good and i need to use it a little more to rate this as great, since i'm currently using it with a 40D i may not be seeing the best of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong lens for the money","review":"For the money I don't think there is a better lens. It is very sharp and focuses very fast. It is weather sealed and has a rubber gasket that seals the lens mount on the camera. It is a bit slow at f/4, but given the cost of the 16-35 f/2.8 lens I can deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopped down it matches the 16-35.","review":"The EF 17-40 will not give you f/2.8, and at f/4 it is not the sharpest. Even so, with a tripod at f/5.6 to f/8 and beyond it is a match for the EF 16-35. Therefore, although as a walk-around lens it cannot compare to the more expensive lenses, if you want to do landscapes, it is by far the best buy in the wide angle L series of Canon--and it will not be bested by the EF 16-35 at the apertures where it is most likely to be used for landscape photography. Combined with its light weight, it is ideal for packing into the mountains or other back country.I would like to give it five stars, but its limitations at f/4 would make that less than honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sharpness, color saturation, and depth!","review":"I am really glad that I bought this lens. It comes with hood which can be reversed when not in use so it is very useful. Leather pouch, front cap, and back cap is included.

Be aware that the crop factor of APS sensor cameras makes this lens more of a 27-64mm. If you have one of these cameras and you really want to have ultra wide-angle capability, you might be better off with something like Canon's EF-S 10-22mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens but quite hefty","review":"Bought this lens for a digital rebel xti and it works great.

Coetzee is a talented writer who effectively uses aspects of the English language such as irony and allegory to undermine society's value systems of power, history and language.This novel highlights the power politics of modern society and how it distorts the identity of those in the world who are marginalised.The changing viewpoints show how differently events are viewed by the colonised and the coloniser.This moving novel compels viewers to sympathise with the silenced Michael K as he lives off the land. It is truly an inspirations piece of postcolonial literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Novel of S. Africa","review":"I am a fan of J.M. Coetzee. Of all his books, I found this one the most difficult reading.It is an allegorical tale of a young, somewhat isolated and intellectually slow man who wheels his mother across the South African landscape in the midst of a civil war. This man, Michael K, innocently becomes the victim of a time and circumstance he does not understand and has not participated in molding. Actually, he is a recipient and victim of these circumstances throughout his life.The ending, which deals with his self-sufficiency and gardening, along with his ultimate demise at the hands of the 'system' is beautifully described through the eyes of a physician.The book is both stark and poetic at the same time. I recommend Disgrace: A Novel orIn the Heart of the Country: A Novel if you are new to this author. They are both more accessible than 'The Life and Times of Michael K\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Well J.M. Coetzee attempts to make a statement on the human experience, he did so not through his character but by his simple writing and the lack of plot in the book,and how resilient one must be to read the whole book where NOTHING HAPPENS. The whole book seems to have been written in simple sentences starting with \\"K\\" and then some meaningless action verb. This book is really hard to read because often times one gets lost in the hard to follow sequences in the story, or one gets lost in the mundane activities that the protagonist partakes in. The book successfully avoided any of the problems in apartheid South Africa and focussed only on a simple man who wanted to grow some pumpkins. The book drags on forever. Only read if you enjoy the three D's; DULL, DUMB, and DRAB. My favorite thing about the book is that you can tell where I fell asleep while reading it because all the pages before I fell asleep are crisp and all the pages after it are wrinkled, I fell asleep on page 59."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important treatise on FREEDOM","review":"South Africa once delivered one M.K.(Gandhi) who taught the world a thing or two about freedom and now comes the second one, M.(Michael)K, through Coetzee. True freedom is the state where one can assert \\"I do not belong to any camp\\" and it does not come easy. Freedom also must exclude \\"dependence on charity\\" and the temptations are not easy to overcome at times. Michael K succeeded in both the aspects and the novel enumerates the price one has to prepare for. A remarkable novel. And the language! After Naipaul it is difficult to name another author with such mastery and such effective use of language!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I didn't like this book and I do not see the point of it. Near the end, the main character, Michael K, questions whether the moral of the story is that there is time for everything. But if that is the moral of this story, then it wasn't clear at all. Michael K has nothing but time, but he doesn't do anything. He seems incapable of doing anything. He cannot cope with living in any kind of society; nor does he succeed in living on his own in the wilderness.Read literally, the book is horribly depressing, because Michael seems to be mentally ill or mentally deficient (because he cannot provide for himself and he has no will to survive; he only knows that he doesn't want to live imprisoned), but no one is able to help him. Read symbolically, I just don't get it. If Michael is supposed to represent some greater meaning, as the doctor/narrator suggests in the second part of the book, what is that meaning? The book doesn't answer that question."},{"rating":"2","title":"our good luck","review":"I have both read & taught Michael K. and consider it a privilege & stroke of luck to be alive at the same time as J. M. Coetzee. He is deeply serious; he cuts himself & his reader no slack, which is the greatest gift a writer can bestow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional but pointless","review":"It's easy to appeal to the emotions: show us lost dogs, weeping orphans, cancer patients, lonely nights in the rain. That's what this book does. It has no philosophy. It has no solutions. It seems positive, except when you realize that it is highly critical of the struggles of life, and instead of showing us why life is meaningful, it simply criticizes and then leaves us with more emotional palaver. The judges were drunk if any awards were given for this book, but self-stimulatory works seem popular these days. I would not recommend this to any literate or thinking person. It's a sham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your True Colors","review":"This wonderful little book is full of surprizes and hands-on fun.Not only can this book be read to very young children; first time readers will love it!

Stanwyck gives a beautiful, touching performance, proving that she can not only be the tough lady. The rest of the picture is quite well, but not outstanding. The end is much too moral-driven, because it is never clear why we shall accept that some of the old conventions do make sense. This film suffers from the fact that is risks comparison with the earlier \\"Now, Voyager\\" (starring Bette Davis), e.g. by the appearance of Gladys Cooper in a similar role. I think the not-so-happy end in \\"Now, Voyager\\" is more convincing, because in \\"My Reputation\\", there is really no reason why our couple should not come together.

I normally get about 3 months out of each filter, about 60 gallons... we do have soft water here, so Well Water might shorten the life. If you need, or will only drink, filtered water, and you can buy 360 Gallons of clean water for $52, you should do it. Fact is, you get more. Given the choice of buying water at the store at 60-99 cents/gallon... and lugging it home, I prefer the faucet filter. Even if it did only filter 30 gallons, at the store that same amount of water would cost you $15-$30.

I took the last unit apart and it was apparent that the internal o-ring seals were being damaged by the twisting action associated with activating the filter.

I threw them out for fear they would sell them to someone else. They informed me that they would charge me 25.00 because I didn't have the filters to send back. In essence they thought I was lying. And this is after I have spent over 1500.00 in the last two years with Amazon. To me this is bad business.

So I tossed the filter and installed a second one. Same high flow rate. Then I measured it's actual flow rate, which turned out to be 445 grams in 10 seconds. For comparison, I measured the 10 second flow rate of my faucet without the filter -- 914 grams. So the filtering was doing some filtering, but still it seemed too fast. So today I bought a 3-pack of the same filters (RF-9999) at Walmart, installed one of them, and immediately noticed that its initial flow rate seemed much more normal to me. I measured its 10 second flow rate at 301 grams. So yes, I definitely received a bad batch.

They informed me that it is a solid block of activated carbon. If you are going to purchase ANY type of water filtering system it needs to be activated carbon in solid block form, so I was pleased with their answer. I am now more inclined to believe their claims on the types of materials that it can filter. Go to [...] and check out their products if you're still skeptical and are looking for a different manufacturer.

This is raw stuff...typical AC/DC...and they don't disappoint. The tracs were left in many of their original forms without the benefit of remastering, but if you have a good sound sytem it won't matter. It was an intentional decision by the band to show their raw talent, emotion, and sound from their formative days. Why remaster? We all know what AC/DC sounds like. This is more like a historical journey than a concert, and to see Bon, Angus, and Malcomb in those early clips belting out pure rock and roll is an amazing sight. I highly recommend this set to any AC/DC fan or anyone who loves rock and roll in its purest form. AC/DC can flat out rock the house, and they tear it down in Plug Me In."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic selection from AC/DC's vaults","review":"This three-disc limited set is everything you could expect if you think on video footage from AC/DC. It has an interest footage selection from either Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras. And the extras on disc 3 are just fantastic! Audio and video quality are superb. The booklet is well accurated and the other gifts are very interesting: a poster from a show of '79 tour and a pack with reproduction of concert tickets and stage-free passes. In my opinion, a must have for any average fan of AC/DC."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Stars for Content, 1 Star for Sound","review":"I can NOT believe, in this day and age, that they could release such a DVD set and not even provide Dolby Digital sound.

The Bon Scott years footage is fantastic, with some seriously enlightening early performances as well as the band at their height. I felt the Brian Johnson years lacked something. Perhaps it's the emphasis on later performances, rather than more stuff from Back In Black - For Those About To Rock years. But perhaps there just wasn't much available. Most tragically, whoever ok'd the publishing of the \\"jam session\\" with the Stones was perhaps a bit blinded by the idea of it because the execution is embarrassing. Terrible soloing from everyone, terrible mix, and somehow they decided to carry on after the first attempt to end the song, as if by doing so they could perhaps make up for the mess they'd already made.

I feel certain its made the way it is so that it is virtually impossible to meet all of the criteria for returning this product and having it replaced.

The spring attaching arms are installed on the outside of the spring with the hooks to hold the spring in in place on the outside of the spring. When attempting to use the flood light r/r tool with a recessed can the can usually has a trim ring held in place by springs. The tool then gets caught on the can springs and is almost impossible to remove without damaging the can springs/trim ring and or breaking the light bulb.I took another reviewers advice and removed the spring arms and turned them around so they are now on the inside of removal spring and it works. 1-1/2 hours to do correctly.

The large basket is pretty useless for anything but floodlights and the small basket is too small for standard or CFL bulbs, so this product works poorly on most common bulbs.

The adapter that fits around the flood fit right over easily and I was able to get the bulbs out - and, new ones put back in. Helpful hint - you need to watch the angle when you put the new bulbs in. You have to be more exacting than replacing the bulbs. And, when you install the new light bulbs - use a little vaseline around the base of the bulbs to make sure that they are easy to get out next time. I had no problems getting the bulbs out - but, have read and spoken with people who have. So, to be safe - I added the vaseline this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Irritated","review":"Through Amazon.com I purchased for $15.51 a Bayco LBC-600C Deluxe Light Bulb Changer Kit as a Christmas gift.

Brought this product to change the light bulbs. But none of the attachments seem to work, one would assume that one of the attachments would grip the bulb and you can take it out.

The kit is very easy to use for indoors. For tilted outdoor floodlight, it takes a while to find the correct angle to screw in a new bulb. But I think this is common for long poles.However, the sucking cup is not as useful. Even if it sucks to the bulb tightly, it still can be loosened during screwing and unscrewing. I dropped two bulbs. The first one was when I was lowering the bulb and tilting the pole so that my hand could reach the bulb. The second one was when I was screwing in a new bulb. I made sure it was tight, but when I was screwing, the cup moved away from the bulb! I would give three stars but amazon doesn't allow me to change it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Bought this from Home Depot. Returned it an hour later. Lots of attachments and none really grip the bulbs well. Extending pole does nothing but spin inside itself so you can't really get the bulbs to unscrew. As another review said, big basket is too big for all but flood lights, small basket too small for mini-floods. Tried suction cup and that doesn't really hold well, especially when combined with the ever-spinning extend-a-pole.I was hoping to save the time of dragging out the ladder, moving furniture etc. Instead it took more time fighting with this thing, not even counting the time to go to/from the store to buy and return it.Save your money and just deal with the ladder.

If you are handy and try to replace the battery, there isn't a standard battery holder, just two flimsy contacts that you have pry off the old battery and no straightforward way to insert the replacement battery without doing some modification / hacking. Search the internet for this problem and you will see it is a common problem with ALL Sanyo rice cookers - do not buy any Sanyo rice cooker - bad design, bad service, and you will lose the entire machine for the sake of $3 battery that the manufacturer intentionally decided to make inaccessible and non-serviceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and cute, but takes quite a while","review":"i've been using traditional rice cooker all my life (by traditional i mean \\"da tung\\" brand, not those cheap american brands rice cooker), and i'm just switching to the electric type for the first time.

When you cook rice, especially poridgethe liquid leaks out from the crack (it boils over and the pressure pushes it out from the top)and rice was left uncooked. This product came with 2 inner lids. When the first one brokewe switched to the 2nd one. Now the 2nd one broke as well.

The seven-pound minimum quantity means that I'm stuck with a whole lot of candies that will never get eaten (unless guests pick them from the bowl on my coffee table).

The author used this opportunity to condone homosexual stereotypes under the pretense of fact. I have a monogomous relationship with my boyfriend and enoy anal intercourse as much as vaginal intercourse because we are sensitive to each other's pain and pleasure.

Instead of providing useful information for improving the sexual experience, the author spends his limited expertise preaching to women about how to be more desirable to men. In addition to the aforementioned instructions re: shaving and deodorant and the outrageous comments about the evils of bisexuality, the following excerpt, from a section about bidets (obsolete, in the author's opinion) should be enough to turn away most enlightened women I know:\\"...a woman looks better showering than sitting on a bidet like a battery hen...keep the douche, and the bidet, for cleaning up after menstrual periods.\\"Ugh.Enough said?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed to be male-chauvinistic","review":"The book has some good points.

The Theology Department is down the hall.\\" I know this because my son graduated with a major in history from that school.When one parent complained to a long-distance learning school that was basing its American history curriculum on this \\"history\\" text - because, as the reviewer \\"David\\" notes, the entire chapter on World War II makes no mention of Jews - she was told by the director, \\"Well, lots of people have suffered.

But as an American History textbook it is a joke. Significant events -- such as the 19th amendment and the women's suffrage movement -- are entirely ignored. And if you think it is possible to write about the Second World War and never once mention the words \\"Jew\\" or \\"concentration camp,\\" then this is the book for you. But there IS an entire chapter on \\"no Irish need apply.\\" You'll also have to deal with a prose style that is ponderous and often difficult to understand, and a polemical presentation that is determined not to let the reader make up his own mind about anything.It's worth noting that the author has no credentials whatsoever to write a history text, but since that's not what this book is, apparently that doesn't matter to Anne Carroll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"My daughter got this doodle bear for christmas 2006.

Also, it really is a \\"cram guide\\" geared specifically to passing the test, so it's not at all useful for actually learning Photoshop.

Kind of like \\"dream street\\". The jasmin single is kind of a happy song, singing about a girl named jasmin. They dont have any songs right now like nsync's \\"it's gonna be me\\" they are more like \\"semi fast\\" songs that seem like they can be played by a life band.

Robin Williams is just right as the scatterbrained Prof. Phillip Brainard. He brings a class to the character hardly any other actor could have. This film has the irresistable momentum of a bullet train. There is rarely a low moment. As if the superb special effects and pleasant performances weren't enough, composer Danny Elfman turns in one heck of an enjoyable mamba-tinged score. Overall, this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. If you're expecting a deep cerebral experience, don't even bother.

What clear, simple storytelling -- it makes you care for the people in it, even as it builds relentlessly toward a climax in which every measured cinematic stroke that went before pays off by creating the deepest emotions in the midst of a paroxysm of bloody slaughter. I love the echoes, in that gory and deeply disturbing final battle scene, of two other great samurai classics: HARIKIRIHarakiri (The Criterion Collection)and SWORD OF DOOM (Daibosatsu Toge)The Sword of Doom (The Criterion Collection). Like those two earlier films, SWORD OF DESPERATION is almost morbidly critical of samurai society; but, unlike them, it is not in the least nihilistic.

Now, like others you'll read in the reviews, the safe drains the D batteries within a couple of weeks and renders the unit inoperable until new batteries are used. I'm going to try to use a different power supply however from what I understand it doesn't make a difference. There must be a way to fix it however there is zero support out there for this product. Amazon should remove it.I will say that IF the safe worked properly it would be great.

The original that we received started to malfunction after a few months, and we ended up getting a warrantied replacement from the manufacturer. It seemed to work ok, other than draining batteries every couple of weeks or so. We ended up just running it off of AC power. Now, it won't unlock at all. The owner's manual is no help, and the manufacturer is out of business. I've been unable to find any resources online to help, so I'm just going to cut or pry the open and then replace it with a better quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy, out of business company with no support","review":"Owned this for a year and a half.

I found it best to see the DVD's several times and master one move before learning the next. I liked the explaination of both lead and follow basics. This way no one is left out.Also, the sections are well outlined so that if you want to practice one or two specific turns, there is easy access to that particular turn.This was a very wise investment for me.In addition, from e-mails that I have gotten from them, they really care about their students.Thanks again for an excellent series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Never Expected It To Be So Easy!!","review":"I have to admit, I was skeptical about the idea of learning to dance from a DVD but since my husband's work schedule didn't allow for us to take classes I thought I would give it a try.

I would definitely recommend this collection to anyone looking to learn to swing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine performance, questionable interpretation, awful remaster","review":"It was difficult to decide just how to rate this item. On the one hand, Toscanini's performance with the nbcso was as usual very impressive, although maybe lacking somewhat in understanding of how the symphony should be interpreted - which may account for Shostakovich's dismissal of this performance. Whatever the merits of the performance, RCA's remaster was terrible. I am used to 78 rpm mono remasters, and expect some surface noise, along with mysterious clicks and rattles. But this remaster was so over burdened with extraneous noise and loud repetitive clicks, that it is really hard to listen to. I am going to get Karl Ancerl's mono recording from the mid 1950's. It is almost as good a performance with much better mono sound, per multiple reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"good christmas movie","review":"This is an overall creepy movie. way better than the remake, but not as gory.

Nice direction by Bob Clark (who ironically also did A Christmas Story, very popular on cable during the holidays), with the infamous \\"point of view\\" shots that predate Halloween. The music is fairly subdued, mostly atmospheric piano noise, paralleling Keir Dullea's character. This creates some unnerving tension. Margot Kidder is a kick. The murders are disturbing in that gritty style unique to the 70's. And that eye peering out near the end...it gives me chills and that doesn't happen very often.

I'm ordering my copy later this week! Go see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only movie to scare me since I was 2 years old!","review":"This movie excels in mood and atmosphere. Unlike recent slasher films, this one does not mistake gore for scares. In fact, there is not much in the way of gore at all, but there are LOTS of scares. The sound is the true star of this film. The phone calls and the eerie dissonant piano score are enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up! Interestingly, there was a plan to make a sequel to this film, and it was going to be set around... Halloween!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total classic! Loved it!","review":"I LOVED this movie.

Took me forever, but I finally found it in the local video store. My God, was it ever worth the wait! The plot is original, predating Halloween, and the sound effects/soundtrack are frighteningly eerie. The acting is good, with Margot Kidder stealing the show. This movie was the only one since Psycho (which I saw at 6 years old) to wake me up frightened in the middle of the night. And the ending chilled me to the bone.

One of the things I like about older horror movies is the fact they provide \\"mystery\\" to the movie. Unlike with movies now that have an \\"happy\\" ending.

This one is well worth the watch. I have watched horror movies my whole life and can honestly say that very few genuinely scared me as much as this one. (Yes, Halloween and The Exorcist were also very scary the first go 'round, but this movie affected as much as either of these movies). It may be that nowadays the plot has been repeated ad nauseam but I still feel that the impact of this movie is viable. You will not see gore, so you will have to use your imagination. That is a good thing. Your imagination is far more disturbing than any gore onscreen. The antagonist, whoever did the voice, is fantastic. He really sounds crazy, and not in a good way, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Christmas","review":"I thought this move was alright.

This movie is not on my top 10 list of horror movies. i can see how it would have worked in the 70s and 80s, but having seen it for the first time today, it did nothing for me. although many people say that HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS borrowed a lot of ideas from BLACK CHRISTMAS, they were better movies than this. i will give it credit because the telephone calls were creepy, and the last 20 minutes of the movie were good.

Looking forward to adding this one to my horror collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Night, Hellish Night ! ! !","review":"Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder (fresh from DePalma's \\"Sisters\\") give two stunning performances. Keep in mind this film provided the blueprint for nearly every slasher film to follow (it was made in 1974). Creepy phone calls, a psycho lurking nearby, holiday-themed horror, it would all be ripped off later and many, many times over. Bob Clark's direction is sure-footed, giving us point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective! This too, would soon be copied in countless late 1970's and early 1980's slasher films. A true original and a must-see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy holiday chiller","review":"Bob Clark's 1974 chiller classic, which went on to inspire many elements of \\"Halloween\\" and \\"When a Stranger Calls\\", is definitely one of the better, if not best, horror films out there. Period. Not high on blood, but very high on suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"HORROR AT ITS BEST!","review":"BLACK CHRISTMAS is a chilling thriller that never lets up on suspense.

Phenomena 5.) PsychoForget HALLOWEEN, this is the movie to see if you want to scare the living daylights out of your friends. BLACK CHRISTMAS rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most unsettling movies of all time","review":"I loved this movie. If there was ever a character like this psycho To play, on film again, I would like to play him. So intense, so original. the killer was the best part. What a way to stir hearts, create a mind-boggling Maniac on Christmas. Let it not be unsaid that this movie, heck, I've shown almost everyone I know, they still talk about it. They think that it's me in that attic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Christmas (1974)","review":"I thought Black Christmas was an amazing horror film. It was a definate pioneer in the genre. While I watched it with several of my terrified friends, I thought of so many horror movies that had stolen little bits of this movie. This movie truly did scare me to a point where I checked my house before going to sleep. After watching, I immediatley put this on my top 10 list of horror movies. Olivia Hussey and Margott Kidder both give amazing performances. The other characters are also very unique and believable. The camera angles (including the killer's-point-of-view) were very original too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The order came in on time and in excellent shape .

This 1974 version is a VERY SLOW and mind numbing movie. it takes a LONG while for anything good to happen, very small amount of blood and gore, not that many kills are fun to watch, NO nudity (unforgivable for a slasher in my book). The remake to me was a better movie(see my reveiw of that film) as it had lots of blood and gore, some nudity and acually explains who billy is and where he came from. in this movie he just goes to the house and starts killing without the veiwer ever know why. I can see the elements borrowed for Halloween and yes halloween did things 10 times BETTER then this movie. Honestly im glad i got it nfor just $8 brand new because if i wouldve paid more i wouldve hated myself. Some people love this movie,some hate it, i for one will never watch this ever again and will rather rewatch the remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspect ratio?","review":"This is a 1.78:1 movie, or 16.9 as we now know it.

I do think I need to watch it again and then maybe my review will be different. It does have some scary parts but I just thought the killing of the women could be more of the focus in the movie, way to much soap opera like B.S.,,,,check it out ur self..u decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"BLACK CHRISTMAS is not as effective as HALLOWEEN. The killer is annoying, some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language to get his point across. The direction and editing is weak. How many times do we have to see the woman wrapped in cellophane up in the attic...she's dead ..I get it...Move on! I wasnt routing for the characters or the killer for that matter...this movie just didnt deliver.

Great buildup, sure. And those phone calls? Freaking weird.But it does not have cohesion. Or closure. A movie doesn't need those things to be good, but their absence in Black Christmas wrecks the whole ship. All that suspense and those phone-melting calls are pretty good on their own, but the anticipation of figuring out \\"But who's doing it...and WHY?\\" is the driving force behind the movie. And what they actually led up to? Pllllllbbbtttttt. Totally unsatisfying.It's fitting that this movie is set around the holidays, because watching it is just like opening a bunch of cool presents on Christmas morning, saving the best wrapped one for last, and then ripping it up only to find nothing inside. Black Christmas, definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Confused","review":"I really don't understand why so many people like this movie so much. I consider myself a pretty big horror buff, but this fell way below my standards. I thought it was boring, had weak murder scenes and had an absolutley horrible ending. There was more shots of the house mother taking nips of Mad Dog 20/20 than killing scenes. I liked the killer's dialogue though, haha, but that's about it.I can see people enjoying it somewhat, but to call it the best slasher of all time and think it's the scariest movie they ever saw is just plain upsurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mid-70's Horror Flick","review":"I just received my copy of this movie today and I really liked it. It has a very spooky atmosphere and the Soriority house is the perfect place for the murders. The movie has u guessing to the end and unfortunately, it never properly reveal the killer but the killer's harassing phone calls are so chilling that it makes \\"When A Stranger Calls\\" look amateurish. To sum it up, this movie ranks up there with \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" and \\"Texas Chainsaw Masacre\\". Definately paved the way for other less than stellar horror movies and even though it was made in 1974, it still can give u chills.A Killer on Christmas, what can be better!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACK CHRISTMAS","review":"GREAT MOVIE!

It finally got to the point where the picture would be there for about 30 minutes, then it would get all stripy and then go black. So, I took it to a TV repair shop several weeks ago. In the intervening time, they have been unable to find ANYONE who carries parts for this TV! Isn't it amazing in this day and age that there would be absolutely NO support for a product?

It is written in a personable style and, unlike a lot of personal finance books, it's fun to read. The book exactly pinpointed my own and my husband's financial styles, and then gave insightful and practical suggestions about how to work together effectively without arguing. I loved the \\"Shared Dreams\\" chapter. The author explains that you can accomplish far greater things by working together as a couple than by working individually or at odds with each other. This is a great book, not just for couples that are having money problems or money-related arguments, but also for couples that want to reach higher financial ground. After going through the book with my husband, I feel we understand each other much better, and have a clearer vision of our future together. I LOVED this book.

Unlike another product I ordered, the Nordic naturals DHA, where the labeling was deceiving or at least confusing. it stated 500 mg.90 gels.

Well, you get what you pay for! I opened the bottle and there is a cinnamon scent - but also a soapy/petroleum/weird kind of scent. It's horrible. If you want a pure cinnamon scent - like you're smelling some cinnamon sticks, this is not it. Mine ended up in the trash. I'm not even sure this will do much to make the trash smell better but it's the only place it deserved being put.Update: I tried two other brands and I finally found what I was looking for. Simplers Botanicals sells Cinnamon Leaf oil. This is the best stuff - it smells exactly as you expect it too.

Also, all my neighbors have fallen in love with me. (But that could be more from the lottery than the cinnamon oil.)I have also used it as an aroma therapy oil to help me fight off Lyme's Disease. It worked great; not only did my Lyme Disease go away but it also cured a nasty foot fungus that I had acquired while on an epic Spiritual Quest in the jungles of Bolivia, where they call this aciete de cannela.

Dave receives a letter from a young woman who believes he is her father. The events that unfold are funny, touching, and told from a refreshingly male perspective.

The Little Russian was recorded by the USSR state orchestra in 1967 before the days of digital and sometimes the very loudest passages overloaded the Cold War Russian equipment. It's not all that offensive, but it's noticeable. Additionally, and this is inexplicable to me, the entire CD is half a tone sharp.

The CD is basically a child's album that was attempted to be made for teenagers. This disc is a weak attempt at a rap album and the artist sounds like a twelve year old girl. The lyrics are juvenile and some songs have been stolen from artist of the past. The album includes many interludes and the amount of talking that is done in the album takes away from the music itself. The artist has attempted to make the album into a rap version of pop songs. An example of one song that sounds very juvenile is called \\"How I beat Shaq\\", it's a young boy's fantasy on how he beat a major basketball star at his own game. The song includes many other children yelling and trying to rap but the song sounds very mixed and very unprofessionally edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on","review":"The only reason someone would buy this CD is because they think the little punk is cute.

It rocks my world. I was slightly dissapointed by the sickening lyrics though. Like I said, there are black metal lyrics, which are sickening. And the death metal part made me feel dirty. The rap part? He just cusses too much, but I like his gangsta style. Move over, Dr. Dre! This is the new gangsta in town. Hes a thug too. 2pac aint got nothing on this new thug! Hes living the thug life. Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir and Molevolent Creation better move over too. And hes an AWESOME pop star.

My friend Michelle told me that one day her sister was watching TV and Aaron Carter was singing Come Get It so she started singing along, but she thought she was singing I am Gay.

Why is he acting like a rapper?? Why is he singing about girls?? He is 12 years old, not 20! What he is singing is way above his age level. If he wants to sing this stuff, wait 10 years. Which brings us to the most important part, the music itself. All of these songs are horrible in every way possible, horrible beats, horrible lyrics, and horrible music. Also, his voice has nowhere near matured, even if he wasn't singing what he is, he should still wait until he is at least 20. I have one question: Is this supposed to qualify as music?? I did not like this album, and I don't recommend it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE STOW AWAY!","review":"This kid is known only as nick carter's brother, and that's all he'll ever be known as.

Come to think of it, I'm not sure why I did. I'm not interested in cheesy little kid tunes like this (which, people is pretty much all there is on this CD!) I guess this would count as, um...dance music for 5-year-olds but I think anyone older than nine should forget about it! He sort of \\"sings\\" like he's a \\"dance-rapper\\" but, sorry! It's not working. I suggest to Aaron to think about a new music approach (If he must! Frankly I'd rather he just left us alone, but whatever.) if he even wants his career to work out at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my gosh-this is MUSIC?! Just a kid with no talent.","review":"Ok-it's not music. It has no genre. Pop, no, he is way worse than that.

Ha! That's debatable since he looks about 4 on the cover. He also has the voice (and mentality) of an 8-year-old girl crying about her broken Barbie doll. Everything about this album is horrible. I could sing better than him! And the lyrics are weird. \\"My Internet Girl\\"? The \\"girl\\" is probably some 57-year-old, 875-pound child molester. Please don't give $13.98 to this spoiled brat. His wallet is bloated enough already. And whoever says he's better than the Beatles or Elvis: what? Can you honestly say that with a straight face? That's pathetic.

And I hate her clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Aaron Carter rocks! Sure he got famous partly because of his big bro Nick, but that doesn't really matter, cuz Aaron can sing! His CD is easy to dance and sing to. About the lyrics, some people were critising Aaron because he sings about girls. Hello? He's 12, not 6! You can hardly expect him to sing about Elmo or something like that, can you? ... So no one better give me that as an excuse to hate Aaron Carter. Just get your head out of the 60's and look at present-day preteens. You'll see that 6 and 12 year olds are not the same.

Why you ask? First of all I'd like to say \\"That's How i Beat Shaq\\" is probably the dumbest song I've ever heard. \\"I Want Candy\\" sounds like a dumb remake of Mandy Moore's \\"Candy\\". \\"Come Get It\\", okay, the chorus is so BAD I thought they were screaming \\"I'm Gay\\" instead of \\"Come Get It\\".

And wait till you grow up a little, you sound like a 5 year old singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding me, right?","review":"If your over the age of 12... then this is definitely not a CD for you. Filled with remakes of 50s/60s songs and a few new \\"jams\\", this CD makes you laugh more than anything else. Aaron Carter is a product of his record company. He has no say whatsoever as to what he sings or how the music sounds. Basically they hand him a sheet, say \\"sing this\\", and he does it. They ask him to smile... snap a few photos... go on a few TV shows and WHAM! your a star. There are a lot more harder working musicians who you should spend you money on. Let Aaron grow up and then maybe he should try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful just to listen to","review":"It's unfortunate that after the amount of people it takes to assemble a pop album, its still not possible to listen to without becoming ill. Aaron Carter was fortunate enough to have a brother in the Backstreet Boys, another awful, talentless pop act. Thus, with even less talent than his older brother, his parents whined him into the music industry. Now, we are left with a collection of poor singing and even worse rapping by a 12 year old who has been snatched out of school and given a job which he shall never suceed in-being a decent preformer. Why can't we just give record contracts to people who deserve them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not going to aaron's party!","review":"Perfect CD for a 5 year old's birthday party. The songs are so cheesy that you feel sorry for Aaron. He has no talent and his voice sounds like a girl. Why did Nick bother getting him a record deal? If Nick wasn't famous nobody would've thought twice about giving Aaron a record deal. I mean, GET REAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see post-puberty nightmares!","review":"I really feel sorry for this kid.

I'll start off by saying this cd should be in the dollar store under the coaster section. Aaron has no talent (yet, even though I hate pop music), his lyrics are aweful, and they should've at least waited for him to hit puberty before they let him start singing(don't get me started on his rapping \\"skillz\\"). I'm not bashing young rock stars (Billy Gilman can actually sing pretty good), but Aaron's voice is like the sound barrier being broken 3 feet away from your ears. If you like Rap/Hip-Hop try Jurassic 5, Black Eyed Peas, and Wu Tang. And even if you like BSB or other boybands, you'll probably still think this is a steaming load."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great combination of dance and fun songs!!","review":"This CD is great for the pre-teen fans.All of the songs have a great beat and they make you want to get up and dance!!

His voice sounds like a newborn crying, and his songs are written by little kids probably between the ages of 6 and 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst noise I've heard!","review":"I call it noise because this ... is not music! With so many people with talent, why are they wasting a deal to let this stupid kid try to sing a meaningless verse three thousand times into a microphone, prep up the voice(like Britney's), and sell it to the public?

DON;T JUDGE HIS VOICE FROM THE SINGLE. HIS SONGS ARE HAPPY POP. IT;S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRING LYRICS, THEY ARE JUST SUPPOSED TO MAKE U SMILE AND THEY DO! ESPICALLY BY STARING AT THE COVER.

This music, while seeming harmless, takes on a different look at closer monitoring. I would not buy this CD for anyone younger than 14.

This is absolute trash no matter which way you look at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Has the USA turned into Japan??? In Japan, they have no creative pop stars who can write and play their own songs-everyone of their little teen idols is mass produced by handlers. We are rapidly coming to that point. This is absolute trash. Carter should be in school, not learning dance steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply nuanced and disturbing","review":"Aaron Carter's sophomore effort is a disturbing insight into a psychotic mind. 'I Want Candy' describes the rape and murder of a teacher in grisly detail, while 'Aaron's Party' is a very dark image of a young man, reflecting on loneliness and considering suicide. The guitar tracks reflect this nicely, although there were times I thought that some of the lyrics were written simply for their shock value.All in all, if you're into death metal, this album is definitely for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on..","review":"Aaron is a somewhat respectable performer... if you have ever seen the little kids go crazy over him, you'd understand. His newer CD's are actually somewhat OK, but this one can really hurt the ears. Especially considering his voice has not even sprung to maturity in this album. I consider, if you really want some of his music, get one of his newer CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaron's Party is good but Needs Improvement","review":"One star for techno and style and one star for vocals. The little brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter is following his older brother's footsteps. Don't get me wrong, Aaron Carter is a good singer because little kids aged from 8-14 admire him because his songs give it a \\"techno kiddie\\" feel. (Come Get It and Candy are ok for the little ones) This album seems to be designed for that age group but minus one star for not writing the songs, minus another for undeserved popularity, and minus another star for Aaron Carter being almost foolish to challenge the music industry through his kiddie pop tunes. Hey, Aaron's just a little guy but he'll get there if he can just try to meet these standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion","review":"Dear Music Critics of the world, Most of the sixty reviews I've read were done by people my age and younger who were in love with him because he is \\"cute\\" and \\"hot\\" and didn't rate him as a singer, and the other part were people who dislike pop music and boy bands all together. The smallest percentage were people ACTUALLY who rated his music. Do not rate a preformer or his music by his appearance ro what you feel his character traits are. Listen to the music. I have not personally purchased the CD, but have listened to him preform on television and I feel his music is worth listening to. He has it tough because people are always comparing him to his older and more experienced brother, nick. If your kids like boy bands and pop music, then get this CD for them. It is the true essence of pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Him Some Credit !!!!!!!!!","review":"I read some of the reveiws for this cd and was VERY dissapointed in the additude of the people. I mean come on,Aaron is making a sacrifice doing what he does.He doesn't have a normal life! His brother is trying to make it with his carrer, his sisters are models and he can't just walk into an amusment park and \\"hang\\" with his friends.I enjoyed this cd very much. I dance to practically every song.I memorized all the words and even wrote a song for him. I'm sorry that some of you didn't like this cd...or it's lirics.At first I thought Aaron was so stupid! A guy who can't rap! I know they make change his voice a little but COME ON! It's simple...if your kid is to young...don't buy it! Don't you people have anything better to do then sit here and critisize a 13 year old? He's trying very hard and I enjoy his music throughly!My opinion was that this cd rocked...Ok! I'm sorry if that wasn't your opinion!Instead of putting him down,lets try lifting him up!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Not.","review":"I'd rather stick a potato peeler up my nose and twist it instead of listening to another minute of this styrafoam pop from boy wonder Aaron Carter (brother of BSB's Nick). Everything on this album is bad: songwriting, vocals, and production. The difference between this and a bag of Cheetos is that the former comes in a CD and the latter comes in a bag. But both are made of cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh come on!","review":"What does anybody see in this little boy with no talent? First of all, he wouldn't even have a record contract if it wasn't for his brother. Second of all he can't sing worth two cents. The only time I have ever seen him perform was on the Rosie O'Donnell show. He lip-synched the entire thing and very badly too. But you would think that if it's lip-synched that the vocals must sound good. Not so. His voice is high, squeaky, flat, and just doesn't sound good. He dresses like one of the New Kids on the Block. The material on his albums are completely meaningless. Why buy this album when you can buy something of quality? Go buy Shania Twain. Throw Aaron Carter in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah..aaron carter...right","review":"do you like to set your money on fire? do you enjoy flushing it down the toilet or throwing it out of your car window? well good because doing any of those 3 would be better then spending your money on this \\"noise\\", i don't believe a total lack of talent qualifies as music. Do yourself a favor and dont touch this ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and total trash...","review":"Why??? Why would anyone in the right mind purchase a CD of some twelve year old kid trying to be a rapper. Trash. I slipped across one review saying that guy reviewers are just jealous. Is it coincidence that the person mispelled \\"jealous\\"? Come on, six year olds think this guy is garbage. Who thinks that this kid is talented? He's only famous because he's the little brother of another processed teen idol. They're all fake and it's sad to see that these creations rule the charts. Aaron Carter should just take the money he made on this lump of feces to go to DisneyWorld and meet up with Mickey Mouse, their voices sound the same. Unless you're a fan of Alvin & The Chipmunks, don't buy this. Save your money for real music. Stop judging so called \\"artists\\" on look, and judge on talent. Buying their records only make them more bloated and narcissistic than they already are. Ooooh, Narcissistic, what a big word."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME GET IT--IN THE TRASH!!","review":"This has got to be one of the worst musicians ever! Wait, did I say MUSICIAN? Aaron Carter cannot even rap, let alone make good music. Most of the songs he uses anyway are remakes of ones from the 50s and 60s, but done in a crappy way. And what's with his retarded song, \\"That's How I Beat Shaq\\"?

I, Personally would never buy this CD, but i was hearing some songs on it at a Virgin Megastore, and I realized that the record Companies will prepackage anything to Market it to small Children and Pre-teens, because nobody else will buy this CD if there life depended on it.

My Emerson record player was always well-stocked with the likes of Pete Seeger's \\"Children's Concert at Town Hall\\", \\"The Beatles 1967-1970\\", or \\"Songs of the Civil War\\". I would gladly listen to any of those today. I had my low points, yes - there was a time when I thought Hall & Oates and Duran Duran were the bee's knees (hey, it was 1982), but, getting to the point, it's kind of distressing to think that this is what kids go nuts for today.

I'm not only talking about Aaron Carter, but he's a contributing factor as to why rap in general is starting to be nothing more than a joke. There are so many artists working hard to maintain the integrity of hip hop, but so many are ready to demean it for the sake of \\"bling\\" (as coined by MTV). Money's fine, so I could care less if he makes money off of this album. William Hung makes money off of his new CD too. It doesn't mean it's any good.

I just want to hear about a buncha drunk primates or having an online relationship!Aw, who am I kidding? Being in a REAL rock band myself, I can say that even with my limited life experiance (the people who write Aaron's lyrics are probably in their 30's), I can write and sing much better than Aaron Carter (or his songwriters).

You shouldn't even have attempted it, Aaron. Go sit in a corner and pick your nose, tease little girls, play with toys...just leave the rapping to the grown-ups. The only reason this little boy has sold ANY albums at all is due to air-headed pre-pubescent girls who are too googly-eyed over anything Aaron to realize how much this attempt just plain SUX, and wouldn't know what real RAP or real MUSIC is if it hit them, anyway.

OK, whatever producer thought this kid should get a record contract should never be allowed to produce again. He says his music will never be lame. Well, let me say, \\"That's How I Beat Shaq\\" has to be one of the stupidest songs I've ever heard. And I'm not going to get into how much I dislike the song \\"I Like Candy\\", either. What happened to good music? And when does anyone associated with a Backstreet Boy get a record contract? And when does a producer think that a 13-year-old suburban white kid who's making a pathetic attempt to rap is considered music? Pop music is quickly going downhill, and I hope something comes along and knocks boy bands and all related garbage out of the top 40.

It surpassed everything I was hoping for in a miniDV camera.That's why I bought this tripod: I figured if it worked like the camera it would be a great combo.The guy at the camera store warned me there was a lot of plastic on this tripod and suggested getting a different brand, but I didn't take his advice.Sure enough, the very first time using the tripod a tiny little piece on one of the plastic snaps that keeps the legs achored to the center pole broke, allowing the leg to flop around freely with no bracing.The break is one of those places that plastic shouldn't have been used it all. It was all very aggravating: an otherwise great tripod rendered useless by broken sliver of plastic. That was really poor design on Canon's part.When I take it back tomorrow, I'm definitely going to heed the camera guy's advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy don't buy it","review":"I also have a problem with the base of the tripod head. It doesn't sit level at 0 degree when not tightened and it's impossible to tighten it.I have a Canon 20D with a 16-35mm lens (considered very light) and the base cannot even support the weight such that it collapses and ends up tilting about 10 degree. It's made of cheap plastic and always loose. There is a little screw underneth the base to adjust it but it doesn't really work. You can just wobble it with little pressure by your fingers.This tripod has brought shame to Canon. I am hoping Canon doesn't make their cameras the way they build this tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase! :D","review":"This tripod is everything I could ask for and more.

Needed (note past tense) it for an awards banquet on 31 January. I have great faith in Canon, was gonna put my new Canon digital camera on top of it. I have gambled, and asked for a replacement, not a refund. I neither want nor expect a high end tripod at ~$40. I do expect it to arrive intact, and last a couple of years of infrequent use before it breaks.Keep watching this space! I will report on the delivery speed, and physical integrity, of the replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I got this as my first tripod for my Canon T2i (or 550D). It did a decent job, the built in head barely sagged under my telephoto lens (Tamron 70-300mm), which was surprising. It wasn't that stable as even using mirror lockup and a remote trigger the shots still had some noticeable blur. But that's what you get from an all plastic design. It is very light and a great value for the money. Light enough that I never felt bad throwing it in my bag. My biggest complaint is that after a photo shoot at -30 I brought it inside and it fell off my bed. The mounting plate proceeded to snap in half rendering it useless. Despite that I still feel I got my money out of it and have since moved on to a \\"real\\" tripod.My take: if this is your first tripod it is a good choice. If you have a decent size DSLR with large glass you will want something a bit beefier. But this is the most tripod you can get for under $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this tripod. First, the base isn't level! If you set the legs so that the level reads that you're on level ground, the camera is actually tilted to the left about 5-10 degrees! And no amount of tightening it seems to get mine to sit straight.Furthermore, after just a few months of use the head cracked making it impossible to adjust it. I've superglued it back together and it's OK for now, but who knows how long it will hold up?You definitely get what you paid for with this product - which is to say, not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS TRIPOD","review":"This is a throw away tripod.

The top piece (basically the neck) of the tripod kept collapsing down even after I cranked it to increase its height.Also one day while working for a client I set my tripod against one of the walls, it tipped over, and the head broke off.Must have been really cheap plastic for it to have just broke off so easily.I went looking for a warranty in the box or online and apparently cannon doesn't have a warranty for their tripods.So now I have a $40 + s&h; tripod that has a broken crank and the head snapped off of it. The lifespan of my tripod was 2 months tops.I would not recommend this tripod nor any tripod from cannon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Camera Tripod","review":"We are all looking for the perfect tripod to trust our camera to, well look no further!!!

Included are three special discs, one of rarities, another of duets with various guest artists and a third of songs sung in Spanish. For true fans only, I'd wager.

Just flipped the photos of Lugosi and Rains as Invisible and Phantom, used the same of Karloff's Monster. That and the fact that all the extras were ported over from the DVDs, and that these blu-ray discs hold a HECK of a lot more data - it adds up that Universal rushed this together to get it on the shelves for Halloween.

I was mainly interested in The Creature From The Black Lagoon, as this was the only way I found I could get this disc in the 3-D format.I had read some people that purchased this set had trouble with one or more of the discs, so the first disc I viewed was the one with 3-D.The Creature From The Black Lagoon was nothing short of spectacular! Maybe it was because it was shot in black and white that the depth of the 3-D process made the film look so real.This is an expensive set to purchase, but I feel it is worth the price for The Creature From The Black Lagoon 3-D disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monster movie collection","review":"This is a fantastic Blu-ray collection of the most popular \\"classic\\" monster movies from Universal. The visual and audio quality was unbelievable. If you like the classic Universal monster movies, this is definately worth buying. I've never seen these films in such beautiful quality, like seeing them for the first time. The sound in Dracula is so clear with little or no hiss, you can hear the critters running around. There were 2 scenes in Frankenstein I've never seen before. I loved it and watched every one of the films within 4-5 days. This is one of the most valued Blu-rays in my entire video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIVERSAL CLASSIC MONSTERS: the Essential Collection (Blu Ray)","review":"I Have only watched 3 movies and they look great DRACULA look like it is brand new very impressive work done on it. The Wolf Man looks good also as well as the Creature from the Black Lagoon. looking forward to the rest of the movies.Very impressed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tense, ragged and raw","review":"The problem with this \\"Traviata\\" is not that it is \\"too fast\\"--Maazel's recording of the mid-60s and Carlos Kleiber's of the late-70s were just as fast or faster--but simply that neither Albanese nor the NBC Symphony has the technique to negotiate these passages flawlessly. Thus, we have a Violetta who huffs and puffs through a PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE tempo for \\"Sempre libera\\" (Moffo, Olivero, Sutherland and Cotrubas had no such problems in their recordings of the aria, at similar speeds), and an orchestra that sounds rough and steely at every turn, even in the lyrical passages.This, along with the \\"Fidelio,\\" the 1941 studio recording of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto, the Nutcracker and Carmen Suites, the Schubert 8th and anything by Shostakovich or Sibelius, are the NBC recordings one should avoid. Toscanini made many beautiful recordings--some of them are still unsurpassed after more than a half-century--but this isn't one of them and never will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top-flight book of a complex subject","review":"A truly comprehensive book, enjoyable to both read and look through. It covers the history and scope of air travel, including airport and aircraft design, corporate identities and marketing in a thorough, extensive and compelling manner. It is distinctive in how it successfully melds a global scope and a focused perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building for Air Travel: A must have!","review":"BfAT is one of the most intriguing books you'll find about airports. It covers a lot of airport design aspects- but it is not an engineering book. In other words, you won't have to face boring charts and graphs. All you get is interseting texts, divided into differnt issues, and many rare and beautiful pictures. If you really like airports- you should have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyabl read...","review":"While there are many elements of this novel that bring forth emotional value, the element that struck me the most (reading as a Korean-Canadian male) was the wit instilled by Mia Yun to twins. In reading Mia Yun's narrative, I couldn't help but think back on my own immigrant experiences that remain so vivid within my own mind. The tension between the new and old world for children of Korean immigrants is one that we all have to endure and overcome. Clearly Mia Yun has found a voice for Korean-Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This book is fascinating in its scientific approach to abilities all humans have the capability of developing. Even though there are some people which have a natural tendency towards this talent. It was written several years ago, but it is relevant today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? The 25th Anniversary Collection is 4 Episodes?","review":"Like the other reviewers have already said, 3/4 of the episodes are on other (much better) Shark Week collections. The episode \\"Blood in the Water\\" can be found on the \\"Jaws of Steel Collection\\", \\"Ultimate Air Jaws\\" is available in \\"Restless Fury\\", and \\"Myth Busters Shark Special\\" can be found in \\"The Great Bites Collection\\". The other episode, \\"Great White Shark: Uncaged\\" could have been much better if they would have cut out all the shots of the crew talking and goofing off. I'm very surprised that they deemed the \\"25th Anniversary Collection\\" only worthy of 4 episodes of which, only 1 is \\"new\\". If you're looking for some good Shark Week action, I'd suggest the \\"20th Anniversary Collection\\" or \\"The Great Bites Collection\\". This will be the last time I ever pre-order a Discovery Channel video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Week","review":"Overall I liked this one, It said the host was Jamie Hyneman but he only appeared in the Mythbusters episodes on the disk. Special FEatures are non existent on this disk as well. But I did love the episodes available so overall I was satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"1 Start is for the release the episodes are good and if you don't have any of the other DVD releases it's a nice mix of episodes. The 20th Anniversary DVD set was great it had a ton of episodes and was a box set. Not that they need to do a big box set every anniversary but this is just a bad release 4 episodes and 3 of them are on other Shark Week releases so really if you are a fan and have the others like I do you are buying it just for Great White:Uncaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cry, The Beloved Country was a very interesting book","review":"I think Cry,the Beloved Country was a good book. Alan Paton wrote a wonderful story about Stephen Kumalo and how he spend a period of his life living in Johannesburg. He had went there to find his sick sister, but not only did he find his sister he also went on many interesting adventures. This book really tells how different it was between the blacks and whites at that time. This book was very educational. The story took a while to read, but at the end it turned out to be a good book. I think more people should read the book to learn more about life back in South Africa and to know how much different it is compared to today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it was a boring book the book was for people over 50","review":"Cry, the beloved country was bad. It sucke"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well written book with excellent details","review":"This was a book that I really enjoyed reading. The book was about an Umfundisi, Kumlo, who searches for his son and sister throughout parts of Africa. The book included sad and emotional events that made getting to know the characters easier. This book is very interesting and gives the reader a good mental picture of the suroundings and places that were visited. I loved how The journey consisted of so many different places around Africa, and not just one or two different places. This book involves true events of the past. The Natives are taken advantage, while the European's benfit. Read this book if you enjoy stories of the past interrelated with interesting characters and details."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic tale of one man's struggle in Apartheid South Africa","review":"Paton's Cry, The Beloved Country is probably THE most important South African novel of its time. It reveals the humanity and the struggle of a black man living under the beginnings of Apartheid in S.A. Compassion, for those in need is one of the recurring and most moving themes in this book. A must read for anyone interested in learning about what it was like in Johannesberg before Apartheid was full-blown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated","review":"I ordered this movie through Amazon and since I haven't watched it - I can't give the movie a rating.

The edition that was available for purchase at our school's bookstore also included a book by the authors for using MatLab for solving ODE's, The combination of the two were great. The book is logically structured and generally easy to read. The authors use many examples from a variety of fields. The MatLab book was a phenomenal help: it's the best intro to MatLab that I've found, and was very useful in helping to solve problems. My only beef with the book is that since this is a first edition, there are several errors in the odd numbered solutions at the end of the book, which caused many sleepless nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition","review":"The book was the exact one it claimed to be with no marking only bent corners like it stated when I purchased it. Overall the auth is not my favorite math author but its the required textbook at my college. I felt both the Stewart and Swokowski Calculus books were easier to read through. The book gets the 5 stars because its the book I needed and the Seller was great. I received the book sooner then the expected delivery date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not so good....","review":"My son found this book to be largely unhelpful in his second course on differential equations where this was the course textbook.

You need to be very fit to do this tape (which I am not, so there's no way I could keep up). 2. The movements are WAY too fast. She doesn't give you proper form on the movements, just hurries through them at an extremely fast pace.

Although this album isn't as heavy as their debut, it still is heavy and it still sounds like Skrape! Its just more melodic and sounds better overall! I would definitely recommend buying this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Passion?","review":"I'll start with this: I liked New Killer America (I probably would've given it 3 or 4 stars). But this new one is just plain boring. The songs are typical nu-metal: softer, melodic verse and then yell in the chorus, with mid-tempo, down-tuned sludge rock chugging. The old album was similar in style but had more original riffs, better singing, catchier songs and felt exciting. This new one feels dead and uninspired.Guess they only had enough in 'em for 1 album. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Skrape's debut \\"New Killer America\\" was a surprisingly solid debut album, but their follow up \\"Up the Dose\\" just screams the word generic almost the entire way through. While the band still has a heavy vibe with some killer grooves, most of the songs just have a feel to them like \\"I've heard this before, and heard it done better\\". I saw these guys live on the Extreme Steel tour a few years back, and I felt they had the energy; and judging by they're debut album, the potential to be the next Pantera, but with this lackluster release, I'm wondering when Skrape will show their true colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly decent","review":"skrape is one of those bands that just didn't get noticed on the slimming nu metal radar but their material improved from their last cd drastically.i enjoy billy's voice-not his screams.will's addition of double bass is nice as well.the first five cuts are outstanding, with \\"up the dose\\" and the melodic \\"in the end\\" being my two favorite tracks on the cd.the single \\"stand up\\" doesn't give a good representation of this whole cd, as it is heavier than the aforementioned track.if you have the extra money, go for it.not bad at all.for fans of switched,v shape mind,and sloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall from grace","review":"Skrape really threw it all away on this one. Their debut was strong, with heavy guitars overshadowing vocals (in a good way). Here, the vocals take center stage and the lyrics are quite a step backward.I'm just glad I only spent 8 bucks. This one is headed for the trash. Stick with \\"New Killer America\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a second album from a band worth listening to","review":"If you are a fan of Skrape, and You liked New Killer America, you will not be disapointed with \\"up the dose\\". The songs are Melodic and William Keeton writes intelligent Lyrics, I hate bands that make the same records over and over again, on up the dose your hear a lighter side of the band, but they still know how to rock out, i would recommend this album to any skrape fan, and if your new to skrape you should check out new killer america as well as this album, my fav song so far is Stand up (summer song)"},{"rating":"2","title":"touching story","review":"A perfect book to read around Valentines Day - touches on issue of working moms, farm life, and family love. Beautifully illustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate, distorted view of Zane Grey and his books","review":"Contains inaccuracies about the books, which he fails to understand. His views appear to be dominated by political correctness. He states Zane was \\"conservative to the core'--this about Zane Grey who relishes students rioting against police and has the hero slug an officer trying to arrest a coed for speeding and who never described a sheriff or indeed any law officer he didn't ridicule and despise! As a professional psychotherapist, I am aghast at his inept view of this happily married, good father as neurotic and a failure. Do not read this book. Buy Grey's wonderful Robber's Roost or The Rainbow Trail or The Heritage of the Desert instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Good condition for the age.

I got into Amadou and Mariam with Dimanche a Bamako since I was a Manu Chao fan and dig a lot of Mali and Nigerian music. This album is the tops in my book and a must buy. Much more jamming on it in my book than Dimanche a Bamako. Just great music that has a way of being foreign yet so readily acceptable to your ears (well at least from a Westerner's perspective)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No matter what else anyone says, here's the truth....","review":"First Truth: Arturo Toscanini was a great conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra--back in the forties. It is easy to hear his very mature readings of Beethoven barely pushing through your speakers when you listen to this recording. However...Second Truth: Unfortunately, though the remasterers did all they could, I would not recommend the poor sound quality of this CD to anyone. Unless you are a Toscanini fan (why?), there are way too many other good versions of Beethoven's symphonies, especially the ninth (Bernstein is good, Szell is better...), to buy these scratchy five discs. The setting of Schiller's Ode to Joy in the last movement of the ninth sounds more like \\"Shriller's Ode to Noise.\\" Your CD player hearkens back to a dirty record player in a barrel; this sounds nothing like digital or \\"Living Stereo,\\" and the sound inadequacies make this set impossible to recommend...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winsome twins search for a stolen doll","review":"I read this about 30 years ago and remember it as one of my favorites from childhood. Identical twins named Ophelia and Cordelia (these Shakespearean names were the idea of their English teacher dad) find a doll--and lose her when she is stolen. Playing detective, they tail the thief and get more adventure than they bargained for. In the end, quick thinking saves the day. The spunky heroines are enormously likable, and the book is both suspenseful and well-paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Book For New A+ Test","review":"I read this book from back to front. I also have experience in the field so that help me a lot. If you are new to this I suggestion you look into something else. This book will help you on first test if you buy the unlock code which I did which cost [U.S. dollars] which they refund towards the test. I wrote and passed both test and found that this book lack a lot of information on second test. It covered the first test information but again why should have to pay them extra money for extra questions..?? To all people that are going to take test go to [another website] and get the exam brake down, that will help you understand what's on the test and than look for a good book, not this one. And also you should that the test is only 20 to 30 question and you only have 30 min to write this book is based on old test scheme."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good stuff","review":"I'm surprised that this fine disk still has no reviews. If you had any fondness for the world of Rain Parade, don't hesitate. It may not quite be Rain Parade, but after all, nothing is. The album's sound is definitely closer to the Rain Parade sound than it is to Matt's work with Crazy Horse.

I immediately purchased this book when I bought tests 19-28 assuming that I would need the book to improve my performance. The book has turned out to be unnecessary. Of the dozen or so old LSATs I have taken I have yet to find an incorrect answer that didn't become apparent within a minute or so of reflection. When I initially consulted this book for help in understanding my mistakes I was very disappointed with the superficial reasoning and, in some cases, by the text's failure to actually explain the reasoning behind some of the answers. I gleaned some useful tips (ie, save parallel reasoning questions for the end of the section, etc.) but otherwise it was a wasted thirty bucks. If you understand your mistakes save yourself the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!!","review":"This is a helpful guide to figuring out those troublesome questions in 10 More Actual, Official LSATs. It's great because we all get stuck on at least a few questions that no matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to figure them out on your own. This is where this book comes in handy. I took the test in 10 More, scored it and marked the answers I got wrong. Then I went back and tried to figure out for myself what I did wrong. If I got stuck, and just couldn't figure it out on my own, I went to LSAT Answers to help me figure out my mistake. It was wonderful. I also skimmed over the explanations for the answers I got correct, just to make sure that my reasoning was correct. It has really helped me see where I'm going wrong and right. For the price, this is a book you can't afford to miss if you are self-preparing for the LSAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor in quality","review":"The explanations of the answers provided by the book are superficial and almost never insightful.

But when I listened to this CD, beginning to end, nonstop, I found that each track was great! My favorites are 3. Stay the Night, 4. Yesterday's Letter, and 10. Dizzy. This CD is worth taking the time to listen to, it keeps the listener entertained with it's soft, gentle, romantic songs and cool, hip-hop, beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"98 degrees is the best","review":"I love this album, it is so amazing. The songs are beautiful, and their singing proves that they're not just another boyband. Their harmonies are just so amazing. I love \\"Dizzy\\", \\"Yesterday's Letter\\", \\"Always You and I\\" as well as the whole album. I've been a huge 98 degrees fan for a long time, and this album has to be their best album yet. They keep coming up with great new ideas. I love the fact that they co-wrote most of the album, it makes it more personal.Nick, Drew, Jeff and Justin are going to be heating up the airwaves for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just keep getting better and better!!!","review":"I don't know how to describe how good this album is! I've been a fan of theirs for quite a while now, and this makes it worth it. Each of the songs is very heart-felt and you can feel the emotion in their voices as you listen.

Every track from 1 to 13 is worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff Baby","review":"Honestly, 98 Degrees has never been my fave band, but they're definitely proving themselves. I found 98 Degrees and Rising a tad too sappy and love dovey, but not without talent. Revelation is an excellent comeback. Una Noche is a terrific song as a first single and opening song. The best uptempo songs are The Way You Want Me To, Dizzy, and You Should Be Mine. However, there are a couple of their signature ballads on here, especially My Everything. If you're a die hard BSB or NSYNC fan, this probably isn't for you, but if you like good looking guys with lots of muscle and singing talent then 98 Degrees is definitely yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I love 98 degrees and this cd is AWESOME!!!

Don't get this cd. There is so much more better groups than this. I tried selling it but no one would buy it. They either had it already or agreed with me. The songs were cool. But I just think they should have some one else sing them. Don't get me wrong they are an ok group. Just not on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT AN AWFUL CD!!!!!!","review":"This has to be one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I can barely describe how terrible this CD is. 3/4 of the songs are cheesy love ballads which I can't stand in the least. There is only one listenable song on this whole CD (I can't even call it an album) and that would be My Everything. Yes, I just expressed how much I despise love ballads, but this has that special touch that makes it good. Everything else here is utter trash. Dizzy makes me want to throw up (and it's not just because of the song title), Give Me Just One Night is NOT Spanish at all, and Yesterday's Letter just sucks. I highly advise you don't consider buying this album, because all of the songs suck and I wouldn't consider listening to them even if someone was threatening to demolish my boombox and CD case if I didn't. I don't say that often, which only proves how bad these songs are."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is there Best!!","review":"I always wanted a 98 degrees CD but never got one until recently.

Once again, the guys have amazed me!","review":"I started listening to 98 degrees after I heard \\"Invisible Man\\" and I have never been more satisfied in their music. From the R&B sound of their first CD to Revelation, you can tell the group has gained experience w/out sacrificing the kind of music they love to sing.

If you're a popper-hopper music listener, this (and NSync's album) are the two albums to get! Memorable tracks: Give Me Just One Night, Stay The Night. Captivating single: Never Giving Up (best engineered song - the beats fall into place very perfectly; composers will know what i mean). Romancing tracks: My Everything. N'Sync's style track: Dizzy. 98 Degrees has just sprung to the next level of pop music, and it's a very welcomed revolution in these plain bland years of Spears and BSB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Building Professionals Beware!","review":"If you are an architect, designer, or other building professional looking for a guide to feng shui, something that will help you incorporate the principles of feng shui into your daily work, this is NOT the book for you!This book is little more than a sophistic exercise devoted to convincing building professionals that the mysteries of feng shui are so deep, a \\"professional\\" must be hired; it's purpose is NOT to guide them through the principles so that they can use them on a daily basis.I was deeply disappointed that I had purchased nothing more than 200+ pages of sophistic argument devoted to convincing me that an understanding of feng shui was beyond the reach of those of us who had not devoted our lives to monastic studies of its fathomless mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought for a friend","review":"My wife and I started this book together before our wedding.

Where was Chiun??? He certainly wasn't the guy who used the word \\"maudlin\\" and spoke in such even tones. He certainly wasn't the man who passed up so many opportunities to bust Remo's chops when given so many invitations to do so. One of my favorite aspects of The Destroyer is the relationship between Remo and Chiun and I just didn't feel it in this one. I liked the idea of Remo trying to take on the role of the thinker.

As it happens, while stationed in the vicinity of the main protagonist's--Kolodzi--home village--the unit is detailed to search for a general that was captured by Czech partisans. Kolodzi therefore is torn between his duty and the temptation to desert and return home and shack up with his girl who he hasn't seen for ages, and who incidently has connections with the partisans, etc. Anyway, it is a gripping, face-paced book, and not all that bad, even if the title is a little, well, odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work!","review":"All I can get out of this thing is a shrill whistle.

So we also tried SpongeBob Typing a month later and found it much more engaging. SpongeBob Typing also did a better job of controlling the children's progress so they would be ready for the games and drills, and for moving to the next lesson.

Thanks to Jorma, a rich tradition in guitar blues survives today with a significant following.

First of all, it winds up the spring roll battle where Okonogi surprisingly enough becomes a serious contendor! Food critic Otani has not given up his long-standing grudge against Jan and uses his influence to place the mysterious Gogyo in the Head Chef position at Hotel Mirage (yes, that was Dan's position . . . ).

Right, the early 70's Challenger...the Vanishing Point icon. In fact, today's Challenger is intentionally based on the 70's design...looks very similar except less angular and more rounded here and there. So, you would think this book would devote some real space as well as pictures of these 1970's Challengers, say the R/T and more. Forget about it!The author is devoted to the shaker hood, so the only 2 pics of the Challeger are not a Challenger with the 2 air scoop hood, as is also the hood design of today's Challeger only these butterflies can be opened for a ram-air effect...NO, all we see in this book is a Challenger with the shaker hood. Call me former owner of a 1971 Challenger...and greatly disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School New Wave Punk","review":"I LOVE Adam Ant/Adam And The Ants.

You can get the aftermarket ones for $30-40/piece but have to replace all the time. I will give it to Autozone, etc as they dont even hesitate to replace in warranty but Im tired of the labor to keep replace every year. Buy AC Delco rotors and you will not be disappointed.

I had some high hopes for the film based on the trailer; however it seems that the trailer put every somewhat \\"good\\" part in it. I usually don't mind constrained budgets if the movie provides some level of entertainment. This was actually hard to watch at points and I actually contemplated just turning it off. I kept hoping some redemption could be found eventually, but it never came.\\"Echo\\"-ey dialogue is probably one of my biggest pet peeves. The majority of the dialogue in this movie has one person sounding as if they were in a cave. I'm thinking there was no budget for a second boom mic. Compound that with absolutely dreadful performances, non-existent tension and a completely vapid premise loosely incorporating the Donner Party, and you have one big snooze fest.My advice: save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What movie were YOU watching???","review":"Isn't it wonderful when a filmmaker gets friends and family to pack a film with great reviews???This movie opens with a murder that is stiff and badly acted (even by 1960's horror movie standards). Then it follows a bunch of completely boring characters around a cabin with no action, really bad dialogue and worse acting. (Even the actors seem bored to tears.)Gore fans will be disappointed. The primary horror of this movie is that the viewer is so bored the eyes are rolling back in his/her head before you ever get to any of the fake-looking gore.A complete waste of 90 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT BABES & HORROR = A+","review":"Hot looking babes!!

But over all a good low budget horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"good arguments on both sides","review":"Leventhal summarises a workshop in 2001 that argued whether nuclear proliferation and nuclear power were separable. The book has strong, articulate arguments for and against this claim. Whatever your current views on this issue, you might profitably gain by reading the book. It does not present straw dummies on one side.Overall, it seems from the book that there is at least a weak, causal connection between proliferation and power. Some countries can indeed use the public claim of installing nuclear power plants to aid in the clandestine assemblage of fissile material and weapons. Or, perhaps, without even going so far, to build out a physical and human infrastructure, to enable a later rapid breakout if the need is perceived to arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight Zone Religion","review":"This is the first book by Kreeft that I have read and I find it extremely strange. First he tells us that myths all over the world assume that spirits exist, so it must be true. If this is true then Kreeft must also believe that spirits cause illness and disease. Then he uses out of body experiences to proove that life after death is a real thing. This is generally not believed in the medical world. Out of body experiences can be caused by the anesthetic Ketamine which is chemically related to phencyclidine(PCP). Without any supporting evidence Kreeft suggests that this live is an embronic stage for the next life. It is only because I am so kind that I call this speculation and not total insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but we returned it","review":"We liked this product, but it does not include instructions, so we're not quite sure how to put it on (our previous tub spout was not a slip-on).

He loved the book, the magic, the adventure and the humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piyo Piyo","review":"This volume is not one of the greatest romantic moments in Maison Ikkoku. The first episode in this volume was invented purely for laughs. The whole wacky Maison Ikkoku gang get stuck in a well during a holiday festival.The second episode is all about misunderstandings between Kyokyo and Godia. Poor looser that Godia is belives that he lost Kyoko to Coach Mitaka. This was my first Maison Ikkoku episode that I have purchased. I assume that there must be better volumes to purchase. Somehow to me it seems as if the anime falls really short of the original manga. I have nearly all of the manga and I was prepared for the characters and the situations. If you are just getting into the series buy the first volumes first. Do not go randomly picking videos unless you know what you are getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, great test leads, but...","review":"The pouch is a cheap piece of junk.

The GTB cds that came out,the live concerts that ended way too late,and the alcohol consumed both onstage and in the crowd are the stuff of local legend.

Its working title, which is more descriptive of the contents, was \\"How To Think About a River.\\" He dropped it, he explained, because he wouldn't presume to tell a reader how to think about anything. But it includes a lyrical description of the geography and history of the river's watershed in what many wrongly think of as a rather uninteresting state. It shows how land, water, and atmosphere are parts of a single system. And it is a nice introduction to the politics of water resources. I still recommend it to students interested in environmental journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This disc is good, groin-grabbingly good. It's got the kind of high quality mope rock that all of the flavor-of-the-month dandies of the indie scene wish they muster during their guest appearances on \\"the O.C.\\" and \\"MTV College TV News.\\" It's got bass, it's got cacophony contrasted against big harmonies that manage to be catchy without being dumbed down. As a means of comparison, Overlord sounds kind of like the Magnetic Fields or the Smiths, but definitely distinct. For me, the highlights are \\"warm body\\" (which I heard on NPR's Open Mic thing) and \\"landlubber,\\" but I could listen to the whole disc, which is way more than I can say about a lot of cd's I've bought lately. Anyway, get into Overlord before they get snatched by some big label and sell out and start having guest spots from Ben Folds. This disc rocks (and I don't even feel self-conscious saying that)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can computers compose music?","review":"David Cope is well known for his attempts to induce computers to compose music in the style of various famous composers such as Bach and Mozart.

I agree with some of the reviews I have read. It is neat to see the old stuff, dial phones and such. The car never gets old. I almost bid on one that was from the new movie, but it wouldn't have been the same. I had a Torino for a while, but it was a different year and it was brown.

So cool. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the pilot movie the best on this DVD set","review":"Captain Dobey is played here by an actor other than Bernie Hamilton (who played him in the regular eps).

I am now reading Kittens in the Kitchen and I plan to read Puppies in the Pantry and Goat in the Garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Spectacular ...","review":"This book was pretty good, but it wasn't excactly the best book in the series. I mean, what are the chances that a stuck-up, rich girl wuold want a cute little backyard pony as opposed to a fancy,imported Warmblood show horse or something? Welsh ponies aren't very tall, (I know because one of our horses is a Welsh and he's tiny)and I can't picture someone like Susan Collins riding a little brown brown pony with her heels 3\\" below his barrel!

Then they give tasting notes on vitually every Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey available (or soon to be) in 1995. This book gave me a deeper appreciation of Kentucky's home-grown art, several very enjoyable nights of reading (with a selected Bourbon at my side), and an enthusiasm to try (lots) of new whiskeys. I've given several copies away. Never had more fun learning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It reveals the Conciliator","review":"I disagree with many of the other reviews; simply put, this wraps the glorious Book of the New Sun up wonderfully with terrific experiences of non-Euclidean, non-Einsteinian time.I glimpsed worlds beyond any human's comprehension.It tells the story of the Conciliator, humanity's trial, and the end of the world- the Coming of the New Sun.

I found an old cassette at an auction in New york and listened to it for years. It has the great old time hymns which are classic. I was very happy to see it released on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewers. Although I'm a fan of 30s-40s swing, and particularly of female vocalists of the period, I found O'Connell mediocre compared to her contemporaries. Part of it is her style, which is pedestrian at best; and when she tries to imitate Billie Holiday I can only groan. There is no comparison. Worse, a good portion of this disc contains those awful, insipid novelty songs that became so popular in the 40s - \\"Boog it,\\" \\"I Bought a Wooden Whistle,\\" \\"Six Lessons from Madame la Zonga,\\" \\"Little Curly Hair in a High Chair,\\" \\"Bad Humor Man,\\" \\"Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing in a Hurry,\\" etc. Yuck! CD quality is overall good, but that's about all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cooling but noisy","review":"You can't beat these fans for cooling. The difference in air output between the Tornado and a regular 80mm fan is night and day. I placed 2 of these fans on equipment in an office server room. They provide much better cooling than the old fans. These are the most powerful fans I ever used, but they are also the loudest. The sound is comparable to a vacuum cleaner. I can hear these fans 25 feet down the hall from our server room. I'm considering getting a fan control to turn these down when I have to work in the server room. I definitely would not use these in a home environment without a fan control to throttle them down. According to the specs, the fan pulls 1 amp which is a lot of power for a fan. In conclusion, you can't do much better in terms of cooling, but the noise is likely a deal breaker for many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It does just what it says. I warn you, you should get a fan controller with it if your are plannig to use this for your personal pc, because if you don't i'd always run at 6k rpm and the noise would be unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned up in about 30 seconds","review":"Little noisy for the 30 seconds it ran before burning up (too noisy for a home fan). Made a horrible smell. Cannot really comment on much else as the product did not last long enough to evaluate. The thing plugs in to a normal 4 pin connector that ran other fans before this fan and other fans after this fan. Obviously could not recommend.It is a good thing I was there when it pulled this stunt. The incident makes me think that this fan presents an unacceptable safety hazard. I could see it causing a fire.Oh yeah it stinks really bad when it burns up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"I liked this novel quite a bit. It was a satisfying substitute while I wait for the next Maeve Binchy book!It is similar to Binchy's expanisve style with many characters and storeylines. It centers around 3 Irish women who meet on holiday in Egyot and follows them home to share their families/ careers/ romances.It is one of those books that you can very easily lose yourself in! Lots of fun, if somewhat predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended Summer Reading ......","review":"....if you have nothing better to do. The characters were kind of cute and their settings were probably right on-- but the story as it unfolded, had its ups and downs. I found myself eager for this long read to end. It was not a book you simply could not put down. I put it down and walked away for several days and did not miss the story or the characters at all. But-- when you had time to fill, it was just \\"ok.\\" I think I bought it because the book jacket had a comment from \\"Rosamund Pilcher\\" (one of my favorite authors). So-- there you have it-- if you need to grab a book to fill in some summer hours-- and you've read all the other good reads of the summer-- go for it-- but I would probably have gotten it at the library instead of springing for the full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever been a three musketeer?","review":"Someone Like You is an insigtful novel about an unexpected friendship between three very different women.

During their search, they discover what they were looking for all along as well things that they didn't even realize were missing. It provides an honest and modern depiction of friendship and that search to make life meaningful.

I truly had trouble putting this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"There's a new crop of Irish authors gaining international success -- and Cathy Kelly is one of them. Kelly's literary debut in the US, Someone Like You, is an endearing story that centers in the lives of three rather different women.Hannah: a career-oriented, gym-obsessed beauty with a penchant for unreliable men.Emma: a happily married woman who hopes to have a baby. The doormat of a self-centered sister and a manipulative father, Emma's relationship with the aforementioned family members worsens when her mother suddenly becomes ill...Leonie: a middle-aged divorced mother of three children whose ordered life shatters when her ex-husband announces his pending nuptials.Having met on vacation in Egypt, these women stick together through the rough patches in their lives. Their togetherness makes for a poignant and endearing read. Cathy Kelly is a great literary voice that will capture readers' hearts.

However, I ended up being a bit disappointed.The photos are fine and there is a lot of material included but the author is awfully verbose and some of the advice he gives contradicts with other repair manuals. Reading the book is akin to listening to repair advice by some friend who has fixed his own car a couple of times but who isn't really a car mechanic by training.Sadly, I will still have to rely on a bike tool manufacturer's website for maintenance guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double the trouble","review":"I purchasced the Dual Spray nozzles for all my Rain Bird sprinklers. The Dual Spray seem to spray every where but where you want as they clog very easily. I am always out in the yard trying to fix the spray pattern and end up giving up and replacing the whole nozzle. The bottom nozzle is directed lower than expected leaving a large puddle closer to the sprinkler. The Dual Nozzle sprinkler heads are also more difficult to adjust and do not spray as far as the single spray heads. Some lower nozzles just spray down rather than out. I recommend staying with the single spray sprinklers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Art History Overview","review":"If studying art history of the western world, this video series provides a great, thoughtful overview from Classical Greek through Modern Art, circa 1990.

This book was worthless, and was twice as heavy as any other to carry. Sure, the pictures and diagrams are clever. But when you land at the airport in Madrid or one of the several train stations in Barcelona, you will have absolutely no help from this book how to get where you need to go. And when I took a road trip around Andalucia, ALL of the highways were wrongly numbered and poorly drawn. This is the least practical book you could buy. (But the most expensive.) And you won't believe how much it weighs.

The regional guide to restaurants and lodging is adequate, but rather incomplete and otherwise would have received a 5 star recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful on my trip to Southern Spain","review":"This was an extremely helpful guide during my vacation in Southern Spain. Lavishly illustrated and well organized, it helped us find some of the more remote vacation spots. I ended up reading it cover to cover, just to learn more about Spanish culture. The series must be popular because we ran into other tourists, from France and Italy, who had the same guidebook in different languages. My only complaint is that the authors seemed to focus too much on architectural showpieces, rather than on historical or literary sites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really sorry I bought it","review":"This is the heaviest book I own. I like to travel light, and wouldn't consider packing this book.

However, the low end hotels that the book recomends were very nice, clean, and it had more than a few restaurants as well.The book was written for the **budgetless traveller**, those travelling on busses or renting cars, etc. This wasn't made for those that are actually carrying their stuff themselves for any extended period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have travel book for Spain","review":"During a recent trip to Spain with four friends, all with different travel books, we decided that this is a must-have for travel.

The pictures were very helpful (if you have limited time and want to figure out what to see), as was the easy access metro maps. However, the restaurant guides and hotel listings were a bit limited as were some of the maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but buyers beware!","review":"This eyewitness book is great. The city and attraction 3-d maps are wonderful. MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE PUBLISHING DATE before purchasing. Although this appears to be the most recent edition, it is not.

Since there are a few sensitives in my family I have always wondered what the process would be to educate them as to their gifts. I was relieved to read that there was an ethical instructor for her to learn from. I'm not sure the general public is aware of a code of ethics for Psychics.There were a few grammatical errors, I'm not sure if these were original to the manuscript or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"most of the incidents in this book were recounted in a much more interesting way in this author's earlier works. It almost feels as if she can't really write, it's just that she had better editors at her other publisher. She spends a lot of time retelling her training with two eccentric teachers and her courtship with her husband, renovation of her house, etc. and not much on psychic experiences. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed.","review":"I hoped this would be a great book that I could share with nonbelievers and have them learn about this phnenomenen. Sadly this book probably ranks as the poorest non-fiction I have ever tried to read. The authoress talks so much about herself that the book became unendurable. It is poorly written and boring. I could not even finish it and that is rare for me!

This book did indeed shatter that myth along with many others. Choquette's direct and easy writing style and way of simplifying the subject throughout this book made me aware that not only was it possible to become psychic, but in fact showed me how I was already psychic but was just afraid to acknowledge it in myself. Thank you Sonia for giving me in these pages the power to reclaim the most important sense I have. Not only are you funny, courageous and willing to share your own challenges but you are a great storyteller and teacher as well. This was the best book I've read all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace, Wit and Wisdom","review":"Sonia Choquette, has been a guest on my WLS-TV program \\"Chicagoing\\" a number of times over the years but when she came on to talk about her newest work \\"Diary of a Psychic\\" I was especially delighted.The gift she gives us is one of connection in the most profound of terms. She does this with a style that is graceful, filled with wit and is grounded with a quiet and gentle wisdom. She not only shares from the heart but from the depths of her heart as she defines her humanity and ours. She tells the story of her life in ways that speak my truth too. She offers answers, brings light to darkness and provides compelling reasons to believe that those abilities we all have await only our discovery and exploration. Sonia is the consumate and giving teacher, this her newest book, is proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely autobiography","review":"This book gave me a good sense of where Sonia Choquette is coming from.

Sonia Choquette bridges the gap between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual worlds in a charming and most insightful way.Having recently survived my own series of \\"ordeals,\\" I was awakened by Sonia's unique ability to heal the soul with the power of her words. I became captivated by her tale as my excitement grew and the clouds began to lift. Now, I wouldn't necessarily call it a self-help book, but it isn't far from the truth...at least for me.While this is the only book I've read by her, she instantly gained my trust. I look forward to reading more books by Sonia and anxiously await the publication of its sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Novice to Master","review":"This book traces Sonia's development from a novice psychic to a master. Starting out doing readings based on messages from her spirit guides, through her training, first of all, by her mother, then her two teachers, Charlie Goodman (psychic arts) and Dr. Tully (spiritual law), she advances to a deeper understanding that her purpose is not just to read for clients, but to help them and guide them to a happier, more productive life.Aiding them in tapping into their spirit and their soul purpose, she becomes a guide, teacher, and healer, and writer of books which sell internationally and reach millions of people.Reflecting her down to earth approach and her sense of humor, this book shows another side of Sonia--the hard work and suffering she went through to attain the position she has today.Gives us a personal glimpse into what went into the making of a master psychic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beth R.","review":"Sonia is an excellent writer, you felt as if you were right next to her as she grew both in life and her psychic developement.

And they are light.However I continually have issues with the locking mechanism not locking. I have sent the poles back once. Leki has a lifetime guarantee. They sent out repaired poles.However... having the locking mechanism fail (will not lock at all) is terrible. Once I had to use the poles at their shortest size since I couldn't lock them. Another time I had to abandon the trip.I have Leki traveler poles I use when traveling by air and have had no problems with them.I have given up on these an have just ordered some SWIX fixed length carbon poles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro","review":"Some authors like to expound, some like to dazzle and some like to teach. Armstrong falls easily into the latter category. If you are looking for a clear and motivating book to start learning about group theory, you will not find a better book. It is a short book but covers the essentials. The range of topics covers the necessary ground for an introduction: Sylow's theorems, free groups, matrix groups, presentations are all there with a strong geometric content. He even proves the Nielsen-Schrier Theorem in an accessible manner. All you really need to know is some basic undergraduate algebra to understand this little gem and it will certainly give you the foundation to move deeper. Highly recommended for a starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I have to purchase my chewing gum online!!","review":"I love this gum!!! Why can't I find it anywhere???

The only problem is that the weapon is hidden deep below the surface, the guide recognizes Sogan as an Arcturian and tries to kill him - and, yeah, there are already a number of bad guys looking for the thing. Besides this, the mission is simple.I liked this a whole lot better than the previous, the writing improves continously.

There is much shouting with plenty of heat and not much light. This book will give you practical lessons to apply to your own life and even more encouragement as you take the time to do so.Written in the author's thoughtful style and reflective of his humble spirit, your take away will be a renewed willingness to listen in the manner of the hope you claim. You will respectfully find truth that God is ready to offer you through others. Most importantly, your desire to \\"win\\" through the imposition of your will (not God's) on others will diminish.I recommend this read to you as a modest step that permits you to move the world toward civil engagement while being faithful to Jesus' claim on your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civility Does Matter","review":"How civil are we to our friends, to our neighbors, to our co-workers and to people in genral?

That's pretty much why I bought it :)It folds up nicely and is easy to assemble. The changing table is very useful, with nice compartments for diapers, wipes, binky's and other baby essentials.The only issue (not really a complaint) that I think people should know before they purchase the product is that when the canopy and the changing table are set up it is somewhat difficult to get baby in and out of the Pack N Play. It wasn't an issue for me because we just took the canopy off and it works great.

The satirical, dysfunctional and downright literal but offbeat depictions of modern life appeal to you in the same vein that Gary Larson, Bill Waterson, John McPherson (of \\"Close to Home\\" comic strip)and Berke Breathed's works do. I also appreciated the autobiographical section neatly tucked in at the end of the book; it explained where John Callahan is coming from in case you are not familiar with him. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys offbeat, intelligent, frank humor and cartoons.

It's straight-laced answers are very calming in the wake of some of toddlerhood's scariest scenarios for a parent (illness, etc.). The Q&A form in which it's written makes things easy to find. Once you've read it through once, you can easily revert back to pertinent topics at a moment's notice.

From when to take my little one to the doctor for a certain symptom to how to get him eat more fiber, first Baby 411 and now Toddler 411 have given me answers that get results.There were a couple of times I've read things and thought \\"That won't possibly work\\" or \\"That can't be right.\\" Lo and behold, I tried it and the book was right!I also really like the real life examples that you get from the authors.

Most books out there were of little or no help regarding discipline and this book is just the opposite. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a toddler....and when I say toddler, I mean 12 months, NOT TWO YEARS OLD!!! Go out and buy a copy of this for your library. It will be so worth it.

Based on this perspective, the best way to be the best teacher is to spend time with your children. Christophersen's guidelines are easy to follow and produce immediate results.

The best child-raising book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little People","review":"I was delighted to find this book after being disappointed in the child rearing books I'd read. Little people provides both simple explanations and detailed instructions for specific difficulties (e.g., problems with sleeping, toilet training, and shopping).

Being a big fan of horror fiction and horror films it's rare that i stumble across anything new and unique, this is one of the rare exceptions.Taking it's cue from the old pulp novels and horror comics these stories are all about what goes gravely wrong when you pursue the wrong vice.Some of the stories are truly horrifying simply 'cause these are the worst case scenarios that rumble around the back of your mind when you decide to pick up an attractive stranger or go home with a \\"new friend\\" from the local pub.I was so impressed i sought out the nearly entire collection (11+ collections at this point the newest are contemporary and still spooky as hell!).Great Stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hot, but dosn't make my blood boil.","review":"I gotta say I enjoyed the first volume of hot blood but it wasn't the best nor the goriest in the genre of erotic horror. I am also not much a fan of short stories. I find flicking from one set of characters to another after a few pages to be quite annoying. I decided to read this however because of the fame it has gained of being the most popular erotic horror series.My favorite of these short stories would have to be \\" Chocolate\\" all be it not very horror or bloodthirsty but the story had a very interesting concept to it and explained how the characters were feeling with alot of \\" flavor\\".If you are really into your gross out, throat tearing horror I would probably tell you to pass on this one in specific ( the series does get bloodier) however if you want an easy read with some interesting ideas I'd tell you to give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn how to cook!","review":"My mother gave me this book a year ago, when I left for my second year of college, and I didn't use it once.

For the last month and a half, my grandma and I have teamed up every day to make a different, but always very tasty meal from this book. It's totally fun! At the beginning of the weak I check out the recipes I want to try, buy the ingredients, and I'm ready to cook after a day at work. One of the greatest things about these recipes is that the instructions are very thorough, which makes it hard to screw up. I made my first cake from scratch, and it turned out perfectly.

I can confirm the statements made on this page that you *will* find questions in this book's practice exam that will also be on the test.

The distributed exam that I took was quite a bit simpler than the desktop exam. Thomas is a skillful writer and obviously a master VB programmer. He packs a lot of information in a few pages while still maintaining a friendly, human tone. The tests at the end of each chapter and the big practice test at the end of the book are very valuable in preparing for the real thing. Also, don't pass over the preface to the sample test at the end of the book. It gives good test-taking advise although I was not courageous enough to use his technique of quickly reading through each of the questions before answering any of them. Thomas' book has one thing in common with other good (note the adjective) prep books in that they provide a comprehensive reference that is often superior to the reference books themselves. So this book stays on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the only book you need to pass!","review":"I just passed the VB Distributed test with an 885.

I would go so far as to say that the authors of this book had some how got a hold of the actually test and published it in their book. Actually, the questions in the book were harder than the actual test. I have seen almost all the books on the market for this exam and none of them have even come close to this one. It is precise, straight to the point(no fluff), and easy to understand. I must note, however, that this book is not for beginners.

He oversimplifies it and villifies his dad.Thumbs down for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defrocked","review":"It was difficult to read this book through to the end. While it claims to be the story of a typical father-son conflict, it is actually the story of how a defrocked priest lost his faith and became a sophisticated anti-Catholic pamphleteer.

Over and over this book has definitions for the simplest words. Its too the point of annoyance.

There is such a quality to this work, such an attention to detail. Bendis is really building this series from the ground up, really breathing new life and fleshing out Peter Parker. And while Bendis respects the history of Spiderman, he by no means is hampered by it, and has no problem discarding details that make no sense.Mark Bagley is definitely improving as this series progresses. I have been really quite impressed, it seems his storytelling is improving, and the action is very easy to follow. To me, Bagley has become a part of the book, an integral part of the experience.This is a very intelligent Spider-title, and it only stands that it will get better and better, as has been the case so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I started loosing interst in the newer spider man books after this comic, i found a disturbance with the second one that was more artist than story but volume 3's story is cheezy but spider man is still the man, even if they try to change his persona and twist the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Written for Dummies, Really.","review":"I was disappointed because in the introduction, the author states that he assumes throughout the book that the reader is already a user of powerpoint.

The remaining 4 tracks are more or less filler. More open than musicology and less manufactured than 3121. Prince is steadily getting back to his old form. Could his next album be a real classic again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Planet Earth is an aptly named addition to the Prince collection. What I consider to be even better than last year's 3121, Prince takes more chances here and proves that he clearly a genetic freak. He pulls off country, funk, rock, and everything that is swinging in between. Horns here, a riff there, tasty lyrics that make you want to sing along. Prince blankets us with musical mastery, injecting an acoustic tinged album that rocked my socks all the way off. Strong points are certainly the title track as well as The One U Wanna C, Chelsea Rodgers, Revelation, and Guitar. In the end, the whole album flows and almost reminds of a 21st century version of Dark Side Of The Moon. Check it out, boys and girls, this dude unfurls solo after solo and yelps and screams!

Compared to what most consider the purple ones worst albums such as Chaos And Disorder, Emancipation, Rave Un2, this album is not much more than a fungal side not to these albums. I own every prince album to date. I must admit with the exception of For You, I think this is Prince's worst entry to date. Johovah has killed Prince musically. I say death to Jehovah and bring back Prince. He takes no risks, nor shows any emotion on this album. By far his weakest entry in the past 28 years.

I freely admit I prefer the rockers to the ballads, but it's all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good song..that's it","review":"Except for the title track, the rest of the album is boring and forgettable. Chelsea Rodgers could have been great but it was stuck in a rut and didn't go anywhere. Prince is still the greatest ever but he needs to release the incredible 80's music from the vault.

This CD sounds very well and GUITAR was really amazing. Prince needed a pop record able to invite so many people. This CD is absolutely delicious; maybe the last two songs a little bit weat, but OK.Buy it and you'll have great time in listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For us long time fans, this one is worth it","review":"I bought the CD mostly because, as a major Prince fan, I tend to buy all of his CDs. It's an impulse, not a researched, purchase. My first piece of pre-recorded music that I bought was _Purple Rain_, as a 10 year old...I've been in love with the genius that is Prince ever since.While I haven't been unhappy with the last 2 CDs, I wasn't fully satisfied...and judging by what others on here say, I'm clearly not alone. But upon listening to the grooves of \\"Planet Earth\\" and the subsequent songs on _Planet Earth_, I have to say that this is about as satisfied as I have been in a long time with Prince. Just like _Purple Rain_ and _Diamonds and Pearls_ (my absolute 2 favorite CDs of all time), the songs on _Planet Earth_ hit all the notes: sensual, blusey, gutteral rock, classic funk and R&B...I; am 98% sated. It's not as good as the other two, but it's definitely one to have the in permanent rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Whatever happened to the funky Prince. Jammin' out extended tunes with hints of James Brown. Bring back the 80's and Sheila E. and let's jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Totally dissapointed with Prince. I have heard most of his recordings from the begining of his career and this latest product I barely consider music. After the first listen I tried to listen to it again to make sure I wasn't missing something. This CD is trash when it comes to music. I suppose, to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best.","review":"I just don't get this one. I actually LIKED Musicology. I thought 3121 was just something Prince just tossed off in the studio from stuff in his vaults.But this...this is much worse.Even my kids, who are age 6 and 8 and die hard Prince fans, aren't feeling the album. It is NOT good if a kid picks the Curious George soundtrack over your most recent release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed :(","review":"Like another reviewer mentioned, due to critical praises I expected a lot more from Prince's latest CD, but was let down. I like a couple of the songs, but I'm not crazy about them, which for a crazy Prince fan like me, is a big downer. Oh well, thankfully I have all his previous other great stuff to listen to (which I'm doing right now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm... Not Exactly ....","review":"I have been a fan since I was 11 years old.. yeah back in 1981!Prince is still THE artist of our time, before his time.But I think he missed the boat with this CD.I sometimes have to listen a couple of times before deciding what I like on his CDs, but I can't get thru this CD a second time. I do not enjoy it, and its sad to say, but true.I enjoyed Musicology, but haven't REALLY loved a cd of his since Emancipation. Once you start to see Prince on Verizon Wireless commercials, you know its a different time....Hope he brings the funk back the next time around.. many of us who have been fans from the beginning will be waiting.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I ordered this album largely due to the many good reviews posted here. I expected strong material and some good jams.The album contains neither.Compared to Purple Rain, 1999, or Prince's other early strong material, this deserves no stars at all.Boring. You won't want to listen even a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Prince but....","review":"this CD has to grow on me. It's Prince and I'm a fan.

R.I.P my brother. who knows maybe one day you will come back to thinking for yourself, and get back to writing like the true artist you used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"I have only listened to part of Prince's latest, and it's not at all what I would have liked to hear. I am more of a fan of his funkier and jazzier stuff. This one kind of just lays there and tries to be more jazzy and R&B. It's not bad, just not quite what I anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked On Our First Listen","review":"I've worn my Prince vinyl, cassettes and cd's very thin since 1980, when I first got hooked on Prince via Controversy. For my money, until this album, he has made five truly GREAT albums...Purple Rain, Sign O' The Times, Diamonds and Pearls, The Gold Experience, and Emancipation (his best album EVER, imho). Planet Earth may not be up to par with those albums, but it's damn good. Watching my wife and 6 year old daughter dancing with glee a few minutes ago to \\"Guitar\\" and \\"Chelsea Rodgers\\" in our living room was enough to convince me that this album will appeal to anyone with a pulse, and a respect for amazing musicianship and songwriting. F the naysayers...judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince Plays US again!","review":"Like almost every album since \\"purple rain\\", Prince continues his 'trick' of releasing one very catchy pop/rock song from an album to persuade people to pick up the album. Unfortunately, that one song is the only thing of any worth on the whole album! The rest continues his self indulgent mishmash of \\"funk/slow jam/jazz infused/nothing catchy\\" music.I learned my lesson a long time ago. Sample the ENTIRE prince cd BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Planet Turd","review":"I'm a huge fan from way back and still feel that Prince is one the most prolific artists of our time. Buttttttt...this is arguably his worst album to date, in my humble opinion. For a guy who has written some great pop songs over the years, this batch is embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is the best over-all album I've heard of Prince since his ground-breaking 'Purple Rain' quite a few years ago. From the title of the album, I thought it would be an earth theme package but it's anything but - although the title song is a great piece of work in itself. Something on this album for everyone. Some ballads, others racier tunes. Extreme good orchestra rifts with piano, guitars and sax. Any of these selections could be a hit and almost made for FM radio. My favorite album of the year so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Unlistenable. Emaciated, pale and emotionless.","review":"I've also been a fan of Stan Rogers for at least 20 years. I had high hopes for a fresh interpretation of some of his best works. This isn't it.All the vocalists combined can't match Stan's own range. The opening bar of the Mary Ellen Carter (1st song) gave me high hopes for the rest of the CD, but I was BITTERLY disappointed.The idea of a mediocre tenor singing Northwest Passage would be laughable. But that's what they did here. They absolutely butchered his music.This entire album completely lacked the emotion and passion that Stan brought to his music. It was a cheap, hollow imitation that wouldn't have stood on it's own merits in the absence of Stan, but knowing (and loving) his music made it even worse.It was the equivalent of expecting the finest Filet Mignon and getting a cold, uncooked hot dog instead. Yecch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a nickel would I spend...","review":"If sales of this CD featuring \\"various artists\\" help Stan's widow and family, so be it; but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone to whom this music really means something.I had to listen to one of my old Stan Rogers albums to hear the real thing and get this pale imitation out of my system."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree to disagree","review":"I have been a Stan Rogers fan for over twenty years and I have all of his released works. As was said before, if the selling of this CD helps Stan's family, I can see the value. But despite their apparent passion, these performances pale before the beautiful rich tones that were Stan's. These voices may intend to honor the man and his music, but instead serve only to remind us what we have lost. Listening to these renditions brought tears to my eyes as I remembered the excuisite voice that was Stan Rogers."},{"rating":"1","title":"sunk off bermuda","review":"Couldn't agree more with other reviewers. This cd should be scuttled off the cape and never see the light of day again. Choice of songs was fine, but the execution was dreadful. Best to get the originals, mp3s, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Intensly love the work of Stan Rogers, but not this","review":"I really hesitate to ever criticize any artistry, but I am a die-hard Stan Rogers fan (and of his brother Garnet too, who is great in his own right). However, with a very few exceptions (such as white squall), I'm afraid this is one item I would not recommend. I don't like to say it, honestly, but if you're interested in getting to know the work of Stan Rogers, I really hope you don't use this CD as your introduction, or you'll be completely mislead. I don't wish any bad feelings to the musicians who put it together, but I'm afraid I really feel most of them missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOUBLE ESPRESSO equals double fun!","review":"Tony Bruno's latest is simply an exciting and funny read to experience! His characters are satisfyingly real and funny. His descriptive metaphors are almost as bodacious as Joe R. Lansdale's, they are that funny.I enjoyed this book tremendously, even if I did borrow it from the library. I'm going to read all the rest of his stuff, as much as I can get my hands on. A warm, humane author with genuinely likeable characters. His descriptions of coffee in this book were so alluring and vivid, that I almost was tempted to try a cup (I do not like the taste of coffee at all, makes me instantly nauseous). Now that's powerful writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"I checked this book out from the library and read it the week prior to our family's vacation to Charleston, SC. I found it very informative and I enjoyed recognizing the names of families, towns and historical landmarks mentioned in the book, especially St. Simon's Island, which I enjoyed reading about in Eugenia Price's series of books on that particular area. I have a great interest in women's experiences, pre and post-civil war, and would not think twice about adding this book to my ever-growing collection of that era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Means to get a mold lab test done","review":"This is just a basic kit with instructions, 6x tape strips, and 2x bags for collect mold samples. You then use the envelop provided to mail samples to a lab, which costs 20$ per test/analysis - which takes about a week to get returned. It basically just gives you a real easy straightforward means to get a lab test done. The kit is probably not worth the ten bucks to some, but it could be. The only thing I couldn't find prior to ordering it was how much the lab tests cost, which is 20$, a reasonable amount compared to other places."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this CD","review":"I bought this CD because someone told me it was good powerpop but guess what, its not, it [stinks], I mean it is horrible with ultra cheesy backup vocals and sorry melodies at every turn, this is pure [crud]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the title implies","review":"It is not very interesting.

While this book has 50 charts for bead weaving and 21 patterns for applique, there are only four pages of photographs showing a total of about 26 items.

I learned a lot.I did notice a few minor technical errors in the history of time section. I found another section rather boring.

'The Discovers' has given me handles with which to recall historical events. It has given me a completely new appreciation of the intelligence, courage, and foibles of such men as Newton and Columbus. History is so full of important violence that it would seem that avoiding focus on wars would make a history dilute both in substance and in interest. Yet this book is incredibly readable, exciting, and provides a much deeper understanding of history than I have been exposed to before.

The author starts with the Hellenistic period, and in less than one paragraph cites the contribution of Muslim empires as mere translators and preservers of Greek knowledge, and then devotes the rest of the book to European achievement.What happened to the one thousand years of history from the fall of Rome (Rome included much of the Middle East) to the rise of Europe?This type of cursory \\"brush over\\" constitutes intellectual dishonesty. For a much better dissertation of Discovery read Toby Huff's Islam, China and the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it possible to give six stars???","review":"Boorstin, the former Librarian of Congress, seems to have distilled that entire collection into one book. This is the story of man's inquisitive mind, why some cultures are curious and why others are not. The variety of subjects covered are astonishing - exploration, science, art, politics. Boorstin reminds me of the historian Paul Johnson in that he combines a moving plot line of events with quirky, interesting biographies of the famous and not so famous.This is an epic story stretching from pre-history to the present. One is continually amazed and thrilled at what human beings have thought and accomplished. The author has been quoted as saying that his book was only a prelude to his next work, the Creators.

Frank Barnard has managed to combine a gripping adventure story of Hurricane fighter pilots with a moving and totally convincing account of the tragedy and drama of the phony war. The book gradually builds pace through the skillful use of flashbacks and scenes which contrast the relative calm of pre-occupation Paris with the turmoil of the German advance. The author clearly shares in the adrenalin rush of an aerial dogfight, but equally clearly recognizes the pain and horror experienced by combatants and civilians on either side of any conflict.After reading Blue Man Falling, you will not only have enjoyed a hugely entertaining story; you will have learnt more about the early days of World War II (and probably the Spanish Civil War, too), and very likely wondered how you yourself would have acted in the heat of battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fragile Time Captured","review":"\\"Blue Man Falling\\" by Frank Barnard , is a fascinating glimpse into the fragile, often bizarre days of the \\"Phony War\\", that \\"wishful thinking\\" period of WW II when few believed the Nazis would actually invade France. Accordingly, one day we find an RAF Hurricane pilot engaging in a dogfight with his German counterpart and the next we see him enjoying a drink in a Parisian cafe. This jarring juxtaposition of moods illustrates all too well the surrealistic nature of that period. Mr. Barnard has a great ability to capture a \\"sense of place\\" whether he's describing a French farmhouse, a British barrack, or the Hotel Crillon. He also portrays convincingly the comaraderie and the rivalry among the \\"blue men\\", as well as their romances.

Compounding the sin is a writing style that appears to be trying to be helpful and inciteful but which in fact is devoid of any real content.

I was expecting items/furniture across all categories (not even close). It also seems like very little in the way of new building materials.

This is just money-grubbing on the part of EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"Some of the Sims 2 expansion packs add tons of new features, new jobs, new stuff to do. This is definatly not one of those expansions. For your money you get some new outfits, some new items to buy and thats about it. Not only that but many people (myself included) are having a lot of problems with Sims 2 after installing this expansion. I ended up having to uninstall it just to be able to play Sims 2.

Unfortunately, I could never remember the name of the book or the characters. But finally, I have managed to find it after much frustrated searching. If you have any question as to rather you would like to read this book, just remember that I spent fourteen years or so looking for it because I enjoyed it so much in my childhood...and that's a pretty good recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make you want to keep reading...","review":"I will first say that I love ancient history and especially early works of art and why they were made. So I went into this book thinking I would love it as well. Unfortunately, that was not the case. While the book does present the factual evidence very clearly, it fails to capture the interest of the reader. Boorstin's writing is very dry, and while I realize he was not writing stories here, he could have done something that would make readers want to keep going. The material is fascinating, but certainly not the way it is presented. I believe when I started reading about exactly how long it would take concrete to dry in ancient Rome I decided that watching my fingernails grow would be more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only there were more fire","review":"Boorstin is well- intentioned, serious, tremendously knowledgable. He knows how to choose interesting topics for his work. A history of the heroes of the imagination sounds extremely interesting. The problem is that Boorstin writes with a dry flatness perhaps better suited to chronicling minor inventions of Americans changing everyday life, than great geniuses. I truly looked forward to this work but read it with a certain disappointment. And this when I admire Boorstin and know him to be one of the finest American historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creating an average read","review":"I think I was looking and hoping for stories behind the great works of art Boorstin researched. What I got in most cases was a description of the work. Since I'm familiar with most subjects covered in this book, I kept wondering why I wasn't reading or appreciating the work itself. At times this book is too detailed, recalling too many passages from particular works or focusing too much on one work and too little on others. I suppose the last statement is a judgement call, but this is a source for my dislike of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Creators","review":"I have not received the products that I ordered on 6/8/2012 - I am in the process of contacting the seller, who is not responding or replying to my email attempts.

Murray-Miller's use of imagery is unique, showing that as a writer he does have talent. However, over all the story does not come together very efficiently and can drag on. It appears that the author intends this book to be experiment in prose, imagery, and diction and sometimes the work can very touching (especially during certain family scenes) but despondency, nihilism, a decadence comes through with a louder voice in the writing, undermining any uplifting feeling the reader gets. The last two chapters are the best in the book but are removed from the story line themselves. This is a writer to watch for in the future but his first work seems to lack any feeling of harmony, good nature or cohesiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK, But.........","review":"This functions well but I get a \\"battery door open\\" error message on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"works with a problem","review":"The battery cover causes an open battery compartment error every time I move or touch the PDA.

I heard wrong notes and off key sounds periodically. Finally the suprano crucified Amazing Grace with her screeching voice.One reviewer wrote that it sounds like church music, but the average person on the street can sing better than this.

Previn is bland to the point of incredulity in the first movement, whose slackness couldn't be greater. The same holds true for the sublime Adagio, which here comes off as a limp series of phrases with no conneciton. The Scherzo proceeds proficienlty enough, and the vocal quartet, recruited from the Met despite the London locale of the recording, are fine. but the conducting remains sluggish to the end. The sonics from 1988 are resonant but otherwise natural. Anyway, why bother with details when the conductor is at such a loss?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Tierney at his best!","review":"\\"Mae West Paper Doll\\" by Tom Tierney is among this artist's best works. It is reminiscent of his earlier titles, such as the \\"Marilyn Monroe Paper Dolls\\" and \\"Rudolph Valentino Paper Dolls\\".The portrayal of Mae West is very lifelike, and the detail and colours of the costumes are outstanding.This is a paper doll I would highly recommend to all paper doll enthusiasts as well as to fans of costume design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is important","review":"First, the disc concept is fantastic for a person who is able to maintain his/her own weight in standing but not able to move his/her feet easily to pivot. The disc takes much of the strain off the caregiver assisting with the transfer. That said, while the 18\\" disc seemed appropriate for the large foot size (size 15 shoe) of the client who needed this disc to transfer from bed to wheelchair, it turned out to be too big for the caregiver to use safely. In order to make the pivot, the caregiver had either to step around the edge of the disc or to rotate his/her body in a way which puts the caregiver at risk for back injury.

Although it may not be \\"professionally\\" written, I can assure you it reveals the heartbreak of a mother that was greatly criticized for remaining strong and never giving up on researching her child's abduction. My son grew up during the 80s and went to college in Omaha. He became disturbed about what he heard from young people in Omaha, and is devoting his free time to being a voice for the missing and abducted. He now puts on art shows for awareness and therapy. Noreen Gosch attended his Art Show in Des Moines last fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"This book is in fact reality staring us in the face. So many of us want to sweep this stuff under the rug & not deal with it. Then who is left to clean up this mess the sickos are making? Johnny's mother certainly deserves all the support we can give her - how many mothers have had a similar incident and stuck their heads in the sand? Not Noreen Gosch, she is a trooper and a brave one I must say. Not only is she a trooper but a trailblazer. The story is unbelievable to some people but it has to be true for her to put her heart into such depth of our society. Some of the things she has uncovered should make the headlines! I applaud her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Entirely too dry - and, the author is obviously biased against the West- he seems to think Islam's slave trade wasn't as bad as the Atlantic slave trade - which doesn't sit right considering the Atlantic trade is long over and the Islamic slavery continues to this day. I tried to keep reading but didn't make it to the end of the book. Boring and nonsensical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"This starts out ok, but doesn't fufill the promise of the first few chapters. The flow of the narrative is so uneven that there are several places where it almost seems as if the publisher accidently left out several paragraphs.

Especially read Monette if you're interested in fantasy with gay/lesbian themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted and Choppy","review":"While this book is certainly a far cry from 'traditional' when compared to most fantasy novels, the stilted and extremely choppy writing style, along with the rambling plot left me clueless as to how it could have possibly won the World Fantasy Award. There are far better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing style","review":"Several things bother me here. The writing in general seemed disorganized and choppy. I've read many books, and this one stands out by far as having one of the worst writing styles. The author puts so many mundane details in a paragraph it seemed like she was just trying to fill up some pages. She also seemed to be jumping from one thought to another without much logical progression. Maybe it's just my preference of styles, but I just don't know how this book got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not outstanding","review":"I picked up this book because it had won the World Fantasy Award, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. The characters are bland, and the story seems a bit pointless. There's almost no excitement or drama, and the end is a let down. Still, the author does attempt to offer something more than the typical quest fare, and for that alone it's interesting. If you're looking for something serious, give it a try. Just don't expect too much from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is different from everything","review":"I had read too many fantasy books but this one is different, it wants to seem more realistic than the others, but it's not a history book.

It proved very disappointing. Blanche writes mostly of her own (very ordinary) life, adding a brief reference to, or funny line uttered by, Betty and family here and there. Only the first chapter, which refers to when Betty and Blanche were teens, has even a \\"full length anecdote.\\" Sections that seem promising (for example, Blanche's mentioning she was eager to see Betty after her marriage for details about the meeting and courtship) lead to no further information.

The problem is that most of the people who believe in such a message live it inside them anyway. And those others who are more unhappy in their lives tend to remain unhappy, no matter how many words of cheer- up and encouragement they receive.The simplistic truths of Mr.Everit are definitely truths if they move and inspire people. But reality and its problems are unfortunately far more complex than simple words of wisdom can solve.So while I am not against this kind of stuff, and love a nice turn of phrase and thought I do not think that in the end it will help very much those who really need it.For those of us for whom everyday life is a struggle I would recommend a deeper book of inspiration. The Psalms. They go into the heart of our most painful and powerful realities, and they ideally connect us with God who is our only real hope in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story that lends a strong message, but isnt preachy.","review":"Loved this book from the start.

Although many of his works are ultimately best described as \\"dark\\" (such as Mao II and Libra), Great Jones Street reveals Delillo's surreal comedic edge as he mocks the music industry (among other subjects).

Also, Three Nice Mice is so much nicer to sing than Three Blind Mice (those words are pretty creepy if you think about it).

And, while the book does give some intriguing alternatives to the usual medication regimes, it does not rule them out all together.

And to compare them to LSD is ridiculous. Also to suggest that Prozac turning people gay or \\"making\\" them into hippies is very politically incorrect, because she suggests that those two social groups are inferior.

The main idea was more focused on the top people of this hospital and doctor's rather than Toby and his terrible experience. The ending did not give enough detail as to the outcome of Toby and Suzanne. I thought Palmer did a great job on the character's. This book was not what I thought I was going to read about. Hospital politics is for the birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book, especially as a work of SF","review":"By SF I mean speculative fiction. This is an alternate history, where an entire religion has sprung up around the worship of the dead. Banks has invented a Bible and theology that's highly interesting, and this book is worth reading for just his creation of an interesting world.The book itself is a form of Puritan works, sent by the jailed practitioners to the congregation. Banks manages to capture the austere yet somehow elaborate Puritan method of writing, while at the same time keeping the book interesting for modern readers.The only point I'm really not clear on is...well...his point. This is obviously intended as some sort of allegory; why go to the lengths he did just for his own amusement? But I'm not sure WHAT this allegory is about? Email any suggestions, I'm genuinely curious as to theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put: awesome!!","review":"Really this book opens a door on the subject. It really enlightens one about sigils, how to contact desire, and moreover magick as life. A terrrific read for anyone remotely interested in the subject. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaos Magick for everyone!","review":"Visual magick is not a book for beginner. If you do not know anything about magick, this book is not suitable for you.After you moved the first steps in magick, and you want to know more about chaos magick, then this is the most clear book about this kind of magick. Jan Fries is a very clear writer, and he knows well both easter and western magick traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Magick","review":"One of the great books on shamanism and chaos magick. Get this book !Especially loved the section on automatic drawing. I wish he would expand on it. I wish there was a section on the Alphabet of desire.

Wilson is the inherently fascinating story of Ari Wing Commander Major Robert Tucker and his relentless struggle with the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle. Assigned to prevent the threat of a \\"dirty bomb\\" being released onto America's land, The Triangle carries readers through an action/adventure yarn showcasing Tucker and his men's riveting tale of teamwork, courage, and bravery as they strive to defeat the unknown enemy lurking within the Bermuda Triangle. The Triangle is very highly recommended for those readers with an interest in both the military and the supernatural as a creatively original, skillfully intertwined, engaging crafted and timeless novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song Menu:","review":"1.

Good for you! One complaint though, it's already into the 11th season, why isn't the complete 10th season out on DVD yet? We're waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not come as pictured","review":"This item arrived in the estimated time frame, however it did not come as pictured. I have at least 15 other seasons of South Park that come packaged like the boxed set featured and this item came in a simple DVD case without the fold out flaps and funny pictures that I love and does not fit in with the rest of my collection. All others DVD sets that I have are matching and this one looks out of place. Disappointed in the fact that the picture is not what I got delivered to my door. I will have to buy another one at my local store and will not order it again from Amazon as I don't know what to expect the arrival item will look like. Wasted money as I am going to purchase another one to match my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southpark Clasics","review":"This season was one the moe classic seasons of southpark.

Of course it did not fit at all and I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not rebuy this book","review":"Normally I don't leave bad reviews on a book. However I was disappointed enough with this book that it warranted a bad review.The Cons:The book is paper thin. There isn't even an introduction to tapping and the style itself. A little more background and talk of the technique itself would be very useful.If you don't know how to do some tapping already this book won't teach you. It assumes you know how to tap and can expand on what you know.The Pros:The CD is good qualityThere are some progressive tapping licks in here that sound pretty hip.Honestly if you know how to tap and want a book to give you some more ideas then it's probably worth the money. If however you are knew to tapping then I'd look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could say something positive","review":"I prefer being positive. Sorry, this time I cannot do so. I've found NOTHING useful inside the covers. Cutesy titles and recipes, any of us amateurs could come up with simply by looking in the pantry and frig.I'll gladly mail the book to anyone willing to pay my cost of packaging and postage.My suggestion is do a search or two for wing recipes. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots recipes, but disapointing","review":"I was very disappointed with the recipes in this book, the base of each recipe was almost identical, in other word there were only a couple methods of cooking the wings, which was used in each recipe. Only slight variations were used. Nothing unique about this book or the recipes, wish I knew of an alternative, I was hoping to find a better or more alternatives to cooking wings. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book I ever bought","review":"I wasn't real impressed. It's has some redeeming qualities and if you get it used or on sale it could be worth having. \\"Wings Across America\\" hardly. I would have taken the trip a little more seriously. I do own it, it's OK. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"a patch of blue","review":"the book is about a blind girl who lives with her prostitute mother and drunk grandfather. selina does everything around her house, and her mother hates her and yells at her. she had a very bad life and until one day she was brought to the park and met gordon, who she falls in love with. the problem is that Selina has been brought up to dislike african americans, and she doesn't know that gordon is dark skinned.I thought i was a very good book. i\\"m reading it in english class, and the majority of the class (especially the guys) seem to not like A Patch of Blue, but i found it very engaging. the only problem for me was that the language Selina uses is like old-fashioned slang and sometimes it took me a while to realize what she was saying. and the end of the book was a little confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An o.k. book","review":"The book A patch of blue is a book that does not hold your attention. The book starts off slow. The role playing was o.k. I would not read it again or even a first time, because I dont like those types of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good training for balance and strength","review":"I got this for my 10 year old niece and she loves it. It helps build on her balancing skill and leg and arm muscles.This product would be better if the handles are cushioned so that it wouldn't hurt the hands so much after long hour of play."},{"rating":"2","title":"My guinea Pig is trained!!","review":"This product worked out wonderfully! It was not hard at all for my guinea pig to get accustomed to it. She uses it all the time, even when I let her run around outside of her cage. The success of this litter pan may be the litter itself. My guinea pig has been seen eating the clean litter pebbles, which I believe is encouraging her to use the pan as needed. I definitely recommend this product to anyone in hopes of litter training their small critter."},{"rating":"2","title":"litter training","review":"My rabbit uses it very well. The only problem is he kept eating the pellets. Had to start using a different litter. But the box is perfect. High enough that he doesn't miss. He alsolikes to sleep in it, before he uses it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunny does not use","review":"My dwarf bunny does not use this at all! He could fit in it, but he doesn't like it for some reason and prefers a roomier litter pan. Also, this is the most uncomfortable pooper scooper ever. It's not shaped right for scooping anything, and most of the poop falls out through the slits! You'd think they would consider the proportionality of the scooper to the bunny..."},{"rating":"1","title":"LSAT Explained needs another book to explain itself","review":"I found the explanations in this book lacking, unlike Kaplan and Powerscore where they give specific reasons to why one shouldn't choose an answer or why one is correct, this guide pretty much seemed very novice. On top of that, there were numerous mistakes and typos where the book would list an answer but then when reading the descriptions for each answer option it would indicate the answer as something completely different. The Logic Game portion of this book is very confusing, it doesn't set up the problems very well.This book isn't a total waste, but the small mistakes here and there were so unnecessary especially when paying attention to detail on the LSAT is imperative. So far Powerscore guides are the best for your money. I suggest if you have a budget stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Explanations - Not Worth Getting","review":"As a professional LSAT tutor/blogger in NYC, I can say that you'll need more than these explanations to gain a strong understanding of evidence/conclusion. Not only are these explanations confusing, but this book contains content that is also just plain wrong. More harmful than helpful in my opinion. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed....Left more confused than before the practice test.","review":"I wound up getting above the 90th percentile on the final test, but I give this book no credit for my score. I put this book away halfway through and focused on my other study materials, because I felt like I was not understanding the explanations, and they were confusing me more than helping me.That being said, it could have just been the way that I process things. I believe that it's important to invest in a variety of sources to prepare for the test. However, I would only invest in this book if you have already exhausted your other options.Good Luck on the test!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome series...","review":"Like all the other star trek shows this one is awesome. I would recommend it to any star trek fan out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing scenes","review":"It's a fun episode, but this review is for the streaming video - there's a scene and a half missing at about 23:50. \\"a separated shoulder, two cracked ribs, and a\\" ... then it cuts two scenes ahead. It's supposed to continue \\"bruised ego\\", the scene continues, and then go into a scene where the group learns about the captains' rivalry.

This episode like most of the episodes with that character seemed like just another commercial for his outdated Sinatra rip offs."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FINAL SEASON OF DEEP SPACE NINE April 6, 2003","review":"I think that this season is your average season. There were to many of the last episodes that the Federation was getting ready to fight but never had hardly any major battles like season six. I know with the Breen weapon that Star Fleet had a problem defending thereselves but there could of been more action pack episodes than there were. What You leave Behind Part 1 was a great episode but episode 2 [stunk] because Sisko was gone in the prophets forever. Over all I will give this season 5 stars just because the crew and their lives live on in the Star Trek World and you never know when the crew will met again on DEEP SPACE NINE"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in love","review":"Oh Ezri-Dax those big blue eyes, that goofy confused personality. I didn't think I could like the next iteration of Dax as much as I liked Jadzia, but Ezri is giving her a run for her money. I love the set-up; how she wasn't prepared, but instead the symbiote was forced upon her in a way. I think it's going to be interesting watching her discover herself as well as how to be ready to be a full trill (retroactively)And Once again I agree with AbsolutelyNutts review (something that never used to happen), but there was some filler in this episode. I give it a 4/5 probably because I enjoyed the journey Sisko took to find the orb ( the ambiance reminded a bit of Tatooine in the first Star Wars) And we get to see Worf finally properly deal with the loss of Jadzia in way only a Klingon could. And at the end....well I won't spoil it :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatified.","review":"Extreemly poor quality recording. The brightness of the picture was in continuos flux and mostly dark.

I'd guess this was just filler material to complete the final season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"I wasn't quite ready for an Ezri episode yet. She was too new to the series to dedicate a whole episode to her and her family. The subject matter just wasn't that interesting, even the story with Miles wasn't quite up to snuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Season 7","review":"I spent the better part of a weekend watching all twenty-six episodes in this box set, and I must tell you that this is a magnificent end to a wonderful show. Nicole deBoer, who is new to the series, does an superb portrayal of Ezri Dax, the new host of the Dax symbiont. Also, the final episode (which is a two-parter) does an excelent job summing up the series. I especially loved the \\"Farewell/Memories\\" sequence. This is a must-have for DS9 fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worf and Ezri Can Now Be Friends","review":"The End is nearing, the stage is set. The players are getting to their places. Soon now the war (and the series) will be over. But first we must get through a few things that are laid out in this episode. Cons: Pacing is erratic. I think they were trying to drag a 4-episode finale into 7 episodes. But what a finale. 4.2/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ezri's Mother \\"Mother Dearest\\"","review":"An Ezri Episode. Her family is evil. OK, it's slow, I'm Playing angry birds on another screen. It's all Ezri's family stuff with the Orion syndicate, and to be honest, I didn't care for it. And I love Star Trek. I remember watching this episode with fellow Trekkie's and we all threw empty beer cans at the screen (back when TV Sets could take more punishment). 1.9/5 Stars. If you love Trek, skip this. ~Keep On Trekkin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Baseball Game vs The Vulcans","review":"Although this episode is pure filler, and has nothing to do with anything, it's a very fun one.

They're funny, sad, infuriating, evasive, charming, smart, smart, smart, and honest--they're even honest about being dishonest!!This book is like a primer for life with men--although not polite goody two shoes men, and who wants them anyway. These are a range of men in all their glory and warts. I read the bitch in the house, which, by the way, infuriated people all over the planet. And this is a rocking sequel...just what I was hoping for, and just as in your face. The main thing is, you can't really put it down. Some of the stories are better than others, but they're all compelling. Love these guys or hate them...they've got stories to tell, and they tell them incredibly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow up To Bitch in the House","review":"If you read Bitch in the House, then you'll most likely enjoy this book. If not, read this book and then read Bitch in the House.This book is a good weekend read, but I didn't enjoy it as much as it's predecessor. Why Men Lie is the strongest entry in the anthology. And, the volume's weakness does lie with the homogeniety of the contributors. NY is not center of the world!Besides these pity complaints of mine, Bastard will help give women a glimpse into the pscyhe of the men we love--who sometimes can't do simple tasks! If you read the book- you know what this refers to.Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A self proclaimed \\"bitch's\\" take on Bastard...","review":"I found \\"Bastard on the Couch\\" an engaging collection of viewpoints, some that made me laugh, rage and cry all in one story. It definitely waved things in my face that I had taken for granted in my own relationships with men throughout my life that definitely added a depth to my understanding of those dynamics, even answered some lifelong questions for me. I recommend it with enthusiasm to both women and men. I even read exerpts from it to my husband so many times that he started to say, \\"Not something ELSE from that Bastard book again....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"better than bitch.","review":"I read the female analogue of this book when it came out, and hated it -- the problems of a bunch of whining upper-middle-class magazine writers do not interest me. Now that I've read THE BASTARD ON THE COUCH, I know why. Although these men are pretty shallow overall, they're definitely more interesting than the women in their lives!I do wish there had been more of a range of experience here, but when you draw from a specific socio-economic pool, that is what you're going to get, like it or not. And I don't think people out of that demographic will read this anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Engaging Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this blow-by-blow account of the 1993 World Chess Championships between Kasparov and Short. Although biased (pro-Short - and the author admits to that biase up-front), the book provides the uninitiated with an insight into the world of the chess Grandmaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I started this book and couldn't put it down! It's a wonderfully thrilling mystery and a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakin covers all the bases","review":"Zakin does an excellent job with this book. He is thorough and quite knowledgeable. The book is worth the $ just to view the hundreds of examples by various artists worldwide. Not only does he give you the technical information on clays, glazes and firing - you get the tecbniques of many potters. It would cost hundreds of dollars to participate in the workshops required to learn these techniques. If you are a visual learner and are a hobbyist or teachinng professional this book is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for beginners","review":"I bought this book with the hope of learning something new. Although I did not read it from cover to cover, what I did read was too basic to be worth the money. Much of what is in the book could be learned at a beginning ceramics class in a park district class in one or two sessions. In fact, for the price, a park district class or other beginning ceramics class would be much more inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks purdy - a half-... mouse","review":"I was so excited to see this mouse - as my flat panel monitor, speakers, and keyboard are all black - all I needed was a black mouse.

This is great encapsulation of the favorites from that time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a cheep piece of plastic","review":"Not up to the usual custom brackets quality. It is just plastic and doesn't fit particularly securely on my CB Junior. It will twist around as it has no molding to make it fit securely on the bracket arm. So it only just does its job for me holding a light weight microphone in lace. It would need readjusting all the time with something as heavy as a big flash or large microphone. Looks like the locking shoe mount is much better and costs the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people get it, some doesn't...","review":"This book is great, this book is shocking, this book is at another level. Not the robotic \\"law of attraction\\" stuff. But I'm sure that most people will not get it, at least in the first reading. I believe that the negative comments about it come from those who did not even have enough discipline to try the suggested exercises for a while. Anyway, losers will be losers and will blame it on anything else but their own lack of discipline.This book is worthy every penny, don't be demotivated by the negative comments, try it yourself and judge for yourself. But be prepared to be shocked. I have read all the books you can imagine on the LOA, prosperity, attraction, etc. This is a landmark, a pioneer for the next generation of conscious creators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some parts excellent - others not my cup of tea","review":"I almost didn't get the book due to the title. It didn't seem this was something I cared to read but my spiritual center was holding a class with the book as the tool for learning. I'm glad I decided to get over my own resistance as I did enjoy most of the book.There's a lot about creating our own reality but I don't agree with all the author writes about this. The Hologram theory is good to a point. At least from my perspective.I did enjoy the appreciation process as a way to stay focused on what is really worth appreciating.This is an easy read and yet, there are parts that are somewhat confusing that required I reread sections.The Three Haunting Questions in Chapter 2 are definitely worth considering.Some parts are definitely excellent while others.... just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have read in a long time","review":"Bob goes into some deep and interesting ideas. It is a little far out there, but well written and entierly possible. You can either read this as a symble of how to improve your life, or as something completly true. Either way im sure following it will be life changing. After only attempting to apply it for a few days I notice how it really is a life changing concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most definitely \\"mind-blowing\\"!","review":"This book had me picking it up, and throwing it down saying, \\"No way!\\" and then picking it back up over and over and over again. It was most definitely mind-blowing and I am still not quite sure if I \\"get it\\" yet. However, it did resonate with me and I am confident that it is just a matter of time and integration before I fully understand what it is about. I have tried the exercises for reclaiming my power, several times and for the most part they have been very empowering. I do recommend this book, but be prepared for a wild ride, a huge deal of confusion and a heck of a lot of thinking from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"\\"Busting Loose\\" as an absolutely amazing book! And it works! After utilizing the tools and processes Mr. Scheinfeld outlines, I have noticed a profound change in my interpersonal relationships and my relationship to money. Utilizing the \\"tools\\" outlined in the book, you find that you really are the creator of your own destiny, and not at the mercy of fate. Mr. Scheinfeld has written a book that dares you to let go of everything you believed \\"true\\", release your fears, and create a new more prosperous \\"movie\\" of your own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Money","review":"This book provides very important tools for dissolving barriers that keep us locked out of our true destiny as successful spirits having a human experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busting loose from life as we see it","review":"This is an exceptionally well written book. It puts a new twist on a fact many of us now know, that everything is energy. Everything is made up of the same stuff. Now comes the twist. Life is a game, being played one individual at a time. It's all made up. Nothing we see is real. We create everything. And the abundance of the universe is infinate. Prepared to be made unconfortable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He Never does really say just what The Process Is","review":"I just finished reading Busting Loose from The Money game, and am still not entirely clear on just what The Process he talks about in this book is really all about. Just what is this mystical secret that I paid $20 to find out. It's still not clear to me after reading the entire book cover to cover. If it's just move out of the illusion and create what you want, then I really feel ripped off. I would have liked to have gotten some more nuts and bolts and more specific How To's than a re-statement of Hindu Belief. I thought Gary Renard's book, The Disappearance of The Universe covered many of the same areas, yet was better and more entertaining. Just my two cents worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has He Been Committed Yet?","review":"He is insane - whether he believes what he wrote or not. According to this book, nothing is real. We're simply experiencing a physical presence until we move onto whatever is next. This goes to far. According to what he is saying ... you can commit murder and then wake up the next morning and realize that it simply wasn't real. That's right -- you made that up, it wasn't real. Well what if someone actually does commit murder and then says well this book told me it wasn't real??? There are plenty of desperate people out there who will believe this book. This book is ranked in the 2,000 range on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Mind-Blowing for me","review":"These concepts were way too out there for me to comprehend or even want to pursue any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"This book is simply absurd.

I do believe like Mr. Warren that we are in what you call the Human Game for a purpose, but it is not my purpose but God's purpose.I do a lot of reading and hence have suffered many disappointments in books purchased over the years but this is now at the top of my holographic list.I got through half of Chapter 10 when I finally had to put this book in the trash. You are right, this book goes against everything I believe as true. There is no way I could convince myself that I created this physical universe and all it's particles, nor do I have the desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bustin Loose? You bet!!!","review":"This one of the most comprehensive and easily understandable books I have ever read. Robert takes a very complex subject and captures the integration of the spiritual, science, philosophy and theory behind the most elusive questions known to man and wraps it up with a healthy dose of practicality. I am having more fun than I imagined using \\"the process\\". For those of you who still feel like something is missing or just isn't quite complete...this book is a must read for you. For those of you just wondering why you are here and what your purpose in life is...this book has some very profound, provocative and powerful insight for you. I have also recently ordered the home study course offered by Robert.

I thought it would contain more practical information as opposed to new-agey philosophy. I guess I should have done more research on it before just buying it on impulse based on the hype-lines. Some points in it may be valid, such as how one's attitude towards money affects their reaction to dealing with it (of course), but the core concepts got a little too \\"out there\\" for me to swallow;I didn't feel its claims were supported remotely well enough. I actually couldn't stand plowing through the metaphysical weirdness of it anymore, and never finished the thing.I'm all for open-mindedness to a point, but one has to use discretion, and it just wasn't sounding plausible to me.

A feel sorry for the author of this book as he is delusional and has watched to many SciFi movies. We are all ready a society that is with drawing from reality and this book takes you further down that path.There are enough good wright-ups to give you the gist of the book - all I can say is save your money and don't waste the time reading it - it is time you will never get back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable...","review":"This book has nothing to do with money, finance, or anything related. It is entirely about metaphysics (and it does that poorly). His poorly designed spiritual illusions are so riddled with holes and contradictions that I am amazed at how many copies it has sold.

It is a book full of vain philosophies, none of which are backed with any proof whatsoever.

He then goes on to explain how his program has helped his wife which, of course, of course would be impossible because she does not exist. She was created by his mind or in this case by my mind.

He not only led by example, he brought out the leadership qualities of poor, rural and illiterate Mississippians who then led themselves in fighting Mississippi's \\"closed society.\\" He worked at the invitation of the movement leaders of the 1950's --Amzie Moore, C.C. Bryant, Webb Owens, and E.W. Steptoe-- and established an important link between the older civil rights movement in the state with the student movement of SNCC, CORE , and COFO.

At least make an educated decision. Booth provides a well researched and engaging narrative on the history of cannabis and the foibles of those raging against the dangers of The Devil Weed, including hashish. Included are ancient times and maritime; prohibitions solely based on racism (Chinese, Africans and Mexicans); \\"lumping\\" mary jane in with opium, heroin and cocaine as if they all are the same thing, and the fear mongering of politicos and the press, most often with little or no personal experience or scientific fact.

The concept of a boy being chosen and used as a spy/secret agent was intriguing to me, especially since the story is relatively true. I was shocked at many of the things he was expected to do, but I can't rate the book as bad because some of the characters are barely civilized. It just kept me reading and reading, no boring recitation of the facts and people, like an official biography tends to have. I learned a lot about the people and planning behind many of the WWII battles, and it helped that I knew something of that period of history beforehand. My big complaints are the end, or rather the lack of one, and the lack of a \\"debriefing\\" about how much was true and how the author got his information.

Apparently Owl had never heard of the word \\"internment\\" until Churchill himself points out how such things should be handled. Also, please enjoy the part where English commandos in training are ordered to practice their killings techniques on German POWs.

Gould plays quite well (with touches of early Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, and McCoy Tyner in his ideas), while Talib Kibwe on alto and soprano sometimes comes close to overshadowing the leader. Trumpeter Pharez Whitted has his spots too, but the focus is primarily on Gould and Kibwe. The modal music, much of it based in the 1960s, is well served by these talented musicians, and although the playing is not flawless (plenty of chances are taken), it is never dull. The musicians all show strong potential for the future. - Scott Yanow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program - US version is much cheaper","review":"Loved the program on this - extremely well played and recorded - the US versuion omits 3 of the less thrilling selections and is MUCH less expensive"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great biography","review":"This film is based on a true story and although Hollywood puts their \\"mark\\" on it, it is very realistic of how war impacts wives and children.

These prisoners included British, US, and a few other nationalities living on plantations and generally working in the area, which was overrun by the Japanese. The Japanese were mostly very cruel to the prisoners, but did not treat their own soldiers very well either. War is horrible, and this War affected the world and went on for about 5 years. The prisoners in these camps were mostly released and the end of the war, if they were still alive. This movie is fiction, but accurate in depiction of events. It is worth the time and money. Claudette Colbert was a great actress of this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic War-time film","review":"I enjoy this film. It is a great classic film mainly about a group of women kept in a Japanese concentration camp.

It was about a woman named Agnes Keith and her family, who had to endure the horrors of being captured by the Japanese. Agnes Keith, a famous writer, was well known by the Japanese and this was probably why she wasn't treated as badly as other prisoners. There was a Colonel Suga who seemed to be infatuated with her. He read her book about Borneo and requested a signed copy. One night during a rainstorm, she tried to retrieve the clothes off the line. A Japanese guard tried to rape her. She pressed charges and was beaten for this. In the end the Allies liberated the camps in Borneo, and Agnes Keith and her son were reunited with her husband (his father).

His book, The Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man, draws up an evolutionary trajectory, beginning with atheism and culminating in higher moralities.

This book does offer some useful advice. It encourages the readers to determine who they are and what they want to project before shopping and it does give some pointers for looking for quality garments. These are helpful. They do use a number of technical terms and illustrations and/or line drawings would help to illustrate this and would help people to distinguish between terms. My main complaint is that this book mainly seems to be written for people who are either corporate or sartorially clueless or a mixture of both. Being neither of these, it was only moderately helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some useful info but not worth the effort","review":"The description on the cover made this book sound really interesting but it turned out to be too much a jumble of information.

It was one of those books you could read over and over again and get more and more out of it.Jamar Nicholas adapted Geoffrey Canada's memoir into a graphic novel to urban memoir to be an African American Splender. Nicholas makes the text and art jump off the page.Canada story of life in the streets will make you take notice.My grandmother Esther use to say \\"Comic books are for kids: After reading this, Maus, Lone Wolf and Cub, Preacher and Pekar's Splender..i can say these graohic novels are not for kids..BUT worth getting!Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Read on the Progression of Violence with Youth!","review":"Mr. Canada does an excellent job ot telling a very personal story on just HOW violence develops in our youth. Fist Stick Knife Gun is a first hand look at how society teaches violence to children as a tactic of surivival.I found this story easy to read, the art work of Mr. Nicholas is very good. I did find it troubling at how Canada's mother was portrayed in the story, but that is simply my opinion as I am a black single mother of a son myself.This book is a great tool for youth to open the dialogue about violence and this story certifies that Mr. Canada has NOT forgotten where he came from! In order to serve - one must understand those being served - very good job Mr. Canada!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Believable Portrayal of the Unbelievable Conditions Our Inner-City Youth Face","review":"Fist Stick Knife Gun describes the fantastical nightmare that is the environment and the obstacles Harlem children are born into and must survive everyday. The history of Mr. Canada's youth spent being ever watchful of the real and violent dangers that lived with and around him in his Bronx neighborhood provide the grounding for understanding and even believing the astonishingly life threatening description of those same Bronx neighborhoods now overtaken by guns and drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening about urban violence","review":"A must-read for urban teens and their parents. Plenty of reasons here for conflict resolution and peace education curricula in middle and high schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've heard this story several times but it remains interesting","review":"Geoffrey Canada has a strong authorial voice, and his description of the violent hierarchy among young men in the south Bronx in the 1960s shows long rumination. He describes how he was indoctrinated and the various social cues that determined who would have to fight whom, and who might have to just be beaten. He recognizes that the specific lessons that he learned were long ago rendered irrelevant by the introduction on handguns, but that others may benefit from his understanding of the implications of constant fear for young men and women.I live in central Harlem and I have heard Canada tell these stories before, and I feared this comic might be a redundant waste of time. However, the format serves the content well and may make it more accessible to the youth who really ought to read it. My only complaint about the book is that the text becomes unreadable against a black background, and some pages were partially cyphers as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Read Account of Inner-City Violence","review":"Thanks to Goodreads and Beacon Press for sending this to me through first-reads.I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to booktalk it for my 9th grade students. Jamar Nicholas does a wonderful job of adapting Geoffrey Canada's memoir of learning the codes and conduct of violence as a boy growing up in the South Bronx. The simple language and powerful themes will appeal to both reluctant and enthusiastic readers, as will the incredibly expressive drawings. It would be great to pair this book with two other must-reads: Our America (Jones and Newman) and Yummy: The Last Days of a Southside Shorty (G. Neri), which unlike Fist, Stick, Knife, Gun take place after the rise of crack/guns epidemic."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping tale of how to survive a S Bronx boyhood","review":"I had heard Geoffrey Canada interviewed before about his memoir Fist Stick Knife Gun and was very impressed by his thoughtful memories of his S Bronx boyhood. This graphic novel, beautifully rendered by Jamar Nichols, is based on Mr. Canada's 1995 memoir of how violence pervaded his entire childhood in the S Bronx. The narration is very clear, matter-of-fact, and shows that a boy either fights or else becomes a victim. There is no place in-between-- a boy has to fight to protect himself, his friends, every single second of his waking hours in the S Bronx.I would have liked to give this graphic novel to my 7 year-old to read so that she can learn about how other kids grow up, but the numerous profanities will delay her introduction to Mr. Canada's work.Overall, very powerful and gripping. I read this in a single sitting and couldn't put it down. I was reading this book at the dinner table..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory Reading for a Better Society","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. Not only does Geoffrey Canada explain in gritty detail the inner workings of ghetto society, he also lists solid solutions, which would enable inner city youth and residents to rise above poverty and despair. We, the people, have turned a cheek for much too long. This book should be required reading for high school and college-level students."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEART WRENCHING TRUTH ABOUT URBAN LIFE","review":"This is a must read for all who work with children of the inner cities. It should be compulsory for martial artists desiring a road map for teaching conflict resolution to young adults and children. I have never before read a depiction that was so lucid about my growing up in NY City. Cananda describes the tight rope that is walked for us who grow up on or around the mean streets and end up in ivy league schools and corporate environments that leave us still disengaged, alienated and disenfranchised. To be healed we must become healers. Cananda outlines the why and how to make a difference. We need now to heed the call. There are solutions......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jarring","review":"This book reminds me of This Is the House that Crack Built. It is an honest at times heart-breaking account of growing up quickly in the Bronx in the 60s. I'm happy to know that the author has continued to use his powers for good as a mentor and community activist. He is a community leader and in a sense a first-responder.This adapted graphic novel allows a new generation of readers to learn from his past, his story. This book is perfect for use in the middle to high school or college classroom in a variety of classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very deep book","review":"Awesome story about life growing up in the Bronx. Those who grew up in the Bronx, can definitely relate to many of the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"I read this constantly waiting for drama, a new and inspiring message, anything. Here's the poop: Impovershed neighborhoods are dangerous places filled with young people who grew up fighting and now have firearms. If you visit certain streets in Harlem, sounds like a bullet proof vest is in order. It sucks to be poor. The author is a good person who has helped many in need. This book should have been a pamphlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prize Stilton","review":"L'Chaim!

I know it did not get great reviews, is a story that has been told many times before and we know how it will end, yet it is endearing and funny. The dog reminds me of a dog I loved very much. Alan Arkin is a hoot as the dogcatcher and the Canadian scenery is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was warned, but did NOT listen...","review":"I only buy DTS concert DVDs. My setup is top of the line. I apparently did not want to believe the reviews which hammered the DTS recording quality of this concert, but they were right. The vocals are incredibly muddied, and the center channel seems to be dedicated exclusively to a snare drum. I basically have to turn my center channel off to hear lyrics, and they still don't sound that great.Compared to the Eagles, Steely Dan, Orbison DTS recordings, this concert sounds [bad]. The video quality is very good, but there's no point in cranking the sound. If DTS is your thing, you've been warned..AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was a damaged item","review":"when I received the product it was wet and rusted. I sent it back because there was no way I could use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better listen to the Two Channel Version forget DTS","review":"I purchased my DVD player the sole purpose of enjoying high quality pop and other concerts. I bought the Bee Gees \\"One Night Only\\" after listening to one or two tracks played on radio here in G.B. I was delighted with the whole production whilst listening on my high quality two channel stereo amplifier. I recently invested in Pioneer's best DTS and, having heard the concerts in digital 5.1, I must say it's not as enjoyable to listen to. The sound seems rather confused and lacks the warmth the stereo version has. Still, a great DVD by a great group. But just the two ears are enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An EASY 5 stars for this!","review":"This live event captures at the MGM is absolutely flawless. The sound and picture is the best that one could expect. Although I skipped through the disco numbers, there was all a ton of top quality production left for me to enjoy. The introduction of the graceful \\"Celine Dione\\" who does an incredible job with this trio is a bonus to this piece of GENUINE GOLD. The crying vibrato voice that only Robin Gibb can claim fame to is exquisetly stunning in \\"Massachussets\\" and \\"I started a joke\\". The tribute to Andy is also comforting. This is a DVD that everyone should have regardless of taste. We, that have been alive during the last 20-50 years have witnessed the finest music that this planet has ever delivered. This DVD is a prime example. Buy it........you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The BeeGees are the best and this is another example of how great they are!

The Bee Gees were a \\"Supergroup\\" BEFORE the disco \\"infection\\" ever began!!! And they are still pumping out great music today!!!

Definitely a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bee Gees' Greatness","review":"Before seeing this video, I couldn't even name the Bee Gees but this music was so great and the variety so overwhelming that I am now hooked on the Bee Gees and can't get enough of them.It makes me wonder what I was doing in the '70s. I'm 51 years old. Same age as Barry. I do truly believe also that the Bee Gees sound better now than ever before."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEE GEES \\"ONE NIGHT ONLY\\" REVIEWED JAY-R DONASCO","review":"THE BEE GEES HAVE CONTRIBUTED A HUGE DEAL IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. AND NO RECORDINGS, ANY PAST CONCERTS OF MOVIE COULD SURPASS THIS EVENT. THEY DEFINED THE SEVENTIES AND WROTE BRILLIANT SONGS FOR OTHER SINGERS. ALSO FEAUTURED IS THE TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO THEIR BROTHER, ANDY. CELINE DION ALSO SANG THRILLINGLY. AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THEY STILL GOT IT. THE FALSETTOS AND THE HARMONIZING ARE IN FULL RANGE IN THIS VIDEO. THE BEST: \\"ALONE\\", \\"WORDS\\", \\"ISLANDS IN THE STREAM\\", \\"OUR LOVE (DON'T THROW IT ALL AWAY)\\", \\"IMMORTALITY\\" (WITH CELINE), \\"NIGHT FEVER/MORE THAN A WOMAN\\", \\"LONELY DAYS\\", \\"I CAN'T SEE NOBODY\\", \\"HEARTBREAKER\\", \\"NIGHTS ON BROADWAY\\", \\"TRAGEDY\\", \\"I STARTED A JOKE\\", \\"HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE\\", AND \\"STAYIN' ALIVE\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I have always liked the Bee Gees but wouldn't have considered myself to have been a big fan. This DVD might just have changed things. It is a fantastic concert and everything about it is first class. The music is great; the audio is excellent; the video makes you feel like you are at the concert. If you like the Bee Gees, buy it - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio problems explained","review":"To those of you that have complained about awful DTS or DD sound with this DVD, I have found the answer.I rented the DTS DVD from a rental club and it was AWESOME! I couldn't help but think that folks here that were describing audio problems with this DVD had defective systems somehow.I just BOUGHT the DVD and the sound quality is horrendous -- exactly as it was described by others here (no center channel audio, etc).Evidently there are some copies of this DVD in circulation that were manufactured improperly. If you get one that was done right, the DVD is INCREDIBLE! The bad ones are truly awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"TALENTED FAMILY","review":"BEAUTIFUL, enjoyed it tremendously, one of the best concerts (based on songs) that I have watched.Cant rate it high enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Hardcore Fans only!","review":"The Bee Gees have a great legacy of music, but I purchased this concert in hopes of enjoying the hits from their best album sound track \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and their other great 70's hits.

A big disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"I purchased this for a friends birthday and watched it with him and it was outstanding!!!

I really can't remember ever seeing anything any better than the superb musicianship and showmanship of the Brothers Gibb.Their talent is unparalleled, and their unique familial harmony, which has often been remarked upon, couldn't have been more obvious, readily confirming the truth of that observation.Everything about this DVD was superb - from the camera work, and particularly the sound, to the pace and variety of the music selections, but most especially to the incredible talent of the Bee Gees.Their band, too, was fantastic. The drummer, lead guitar, bass man - everybody - was just incredible.I am continually blown away, to think that we can, for a few dollars, possess and amass a library of entertainment by the best artists in the world, and have it available for us to enjoy any time we want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have if you are a fan of the Bee Gees","review":"Great DVD... they are at their finest... They take you back to their beginnings in music to the present all the great songs and some of the later ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Major Reason To Buy DTS!","review":"The Bee Gees have always been great performers, but this is their career topping concert. Four decades of songs are showcased here with impeccable harmonies and a first class band. The highlights are the guest appearances whether ala 'Nat King Cole' style or real like Celine Dion. Yup, Franki Valli and a tear-jerking Andy Gibb can be heard here as well as the Celine highlight. There is too much and too little as great songs like, \\"Nights On Broadway\\" and \\"Guilty\\" are cut short, but the typical 'Bee Gees song medley' and the 'Night Fever/More Than A Woman' segment made up for that. In retrospect, the concert could have had more lighting effects, but, geez, the sound is just so good, you wonder if it really makes a difference. This was a historic event."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRRRRRRREAT","review":"THE BEEGEE'S ONE NIGHT ONLY WAS A VERY GREAT MOVIE I SAW IT ON PBS. OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN WAS VERY HUMOROUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bee Gees- One Night Only","review":"This was a very good performance. The Bee Gees perform most of all of the songs that made them famous. Some of the songs were not performed in their entirety, such as \\"Nights on Broadway\\". There was not much showmanship other than the Bee Gees standing on the stage and singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DTS Sound","review":"I rate this concert 2 stars. I would give it 4.5 stars if the DTS sound was anything like it should be. My stereo system is all kenwood top of the line with 4 grand in jamo speakers and all my other DTS movies and concerts on DVD sound great. This DVD in DTS sounds like ?hit. That Is all I have to say and that is that. DO NOT I MEAN DO NOT BUY IT FOR THE SOUND. If you buy this buy it cause you like the band but not for the sound. If you want good DTS music buy roy orbison black and white you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below avarage sound quality and cinematography","review":"I am a fan of The Beegees so I bought this dvd despite some of the bad critics. Well, unfortunately the critics are true, at least to the Dolby Digital only version I've got. Vocals are weak and instrumental sounds are neither sharp nor clear, with too much noise from the crowd.Video quality is as expected from dvd's but there are just too much zooming and panning from the back of the audience towards the stage that you think you are looking at a home-made video.Also, most of the songs are not full-length, therefore it can be dishearting if you expected otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"We've seen it 4 times and can't wait to watch it again!!!!","review":"The best non-stop entertainment we've ever watched. The tribute to Andy Gibb was heartwarming. Celine Dion (the French chick) was a plus. Watching Travolta again took us both back many years to the time I sold paint in my father's hardware store in Surrey B.C. (Canada)."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor recording","review":"I have both DD and DTS. I found both are poor recorded. Very disappointed. I have CD of Bee Gees from 60 up.

This recording is NOT acceptable for a good Hi-Fi equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! Disappointed!","review":"Almost all the songs are out of tune. I guess they don't really care about how they perform. If you compare Eagles' new DTS DVD - Hell freezes over, it is really shameful.

I remember from the concert,not the album,that at one point,Maurice introduced the band. One participant was Barry Gibb's son Stephen. This is one of a handful of concerts that was both seen and heard by those who were or were not in attendance at Las Vegas,Nevada's MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on November 14,1997.

Admittedly jazz flute isn't to everyone's taste and if your looking for a blow-out then look elsewhere. A lot of this music falls into that gentle-flute arena but the ideas are well-conceived and supported by a standard piano trio that has Ron Carter on bass - and anything with Ron Carter is worth checking out - with an additional percussionist.

They may not be exactly the same, but they are close enough. It is a pleasant change from potato chips and snack crackers. I am surprised that more are not crushed in pieces now that they are packaged in a bag, but they would probably be more expensive if they still came in the canister.

It does not come with a simple set-up sheet, which meant that it took me 15 minutes to figure out why it would not even turn on. ANSWER: you must turn the monitor upside down and flip the main power switch which is invisible unless the monitor is flipped. The front power switch only works then. Also it came with two sets of cables to attach to the cpu and (as they were unmarked save in Korean) I erronesouly attached the analog ones and did not know that.Documenation aside, it is a very nice looking all-black simple monitor, the stand adjusts nicely, (vertically and you can flip the screen from portrait to landscape), and the clarity is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no...","review":"Reiner offers driven, humorless, unrelenting performances of this wonderfully playful music.

It's great fun when he's alone or with his friends.One complaint that I read was that it had to be on a perfectly flat surface to work properly (or the ball falls to the ground). All you have to do is find a stick or rock to place under the low side and it works perfectly. My yard is not flat and I've had no trouble adjusting it in this manner.I'm not sure how durable it is. I've found that if the ball is too low, the tube gets hit alot and has to be re-adjusted. One corner of the plastic tube has broken off, but it doesn't affect the operation at all.

Right before I started to cook 10 strips of bacon I checked the temp and it was 330. After adding bacon the temp dropped to 190 and never got past 250. I was using my laser temp to check. I also checked my laser temp to make sure it was correct by boiling water to verify the temp. I was hoping that this griddle was going to be great, but that was not the case.

The power cord is pretty heavy and likes to go where it wants, the surface heating seemed pretty even, and heated up quick, it'll never replace my old cast iron ever! I have used it once so far and it seemed adiquit enough, I have had a lot of nonstick pans over the years and they were nice as I said before while they lasted, over all a decent product with some good points as well bad ones, I haven't found enough wrong with it to send it back but will use it somewhat conservatively to protect the nonstick surface, would I run off and buy another one absolutly no way, but am going to enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Griddle","review":"Love this griddle, although I find the guard piece useless.

I then ended up having to wait about 60 days before using it, and then was so confident in it that I just tossed the box, etc. Really dumb, I know. Anyhow, it doesn't work. Heats up to only 250 and just stays there. Tried a different cord/controller from another grill, same results. There's another review on here that had problems with its operation.

Seems to clean up easily too.It replaced an aluminum Farberware electric griddle that I had for 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"I bought this to replace my \\"old\\" griddle.

The casting is so rough that you could cut yourself just carrying the grill. My husband filed off the sharp areas. The finish was not uniform. There was a rough patch in the upper left corner that probably won't affect it's performance. I also had trouble inserting the control. Then when I brought the grill up to the recommended temp of 325 for pancakes it seemed to drop way down and didn't maintain 325. The pancakes turned out tan instead of brown. It did OK on the eggs and I didn't have to wait long for it to cool off because it hadn't maintained 325.I would have returned the grill but we had already thrown the box away. Maybe I just got dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Known manufacturer's defects","review":"I have cooked over 50,000 pancakes in my life (7 kids helps) and at one time or another have owned almost every griddle you can buy. This one is a little smaller than some others but has wonderfully even heat distribution - a real problem with most cheap griddles.The Bad - The temperature probe shorted-out and smoked. We are both lucky and happy that no one was electrocuted.The Ugly - although Broil King boasts of their warranty, and the griddle was within the warranty period, they said it did not apply to this part (there are only two parts to a griddle) and they charged me $30 for a replacement part. Interestingly, the new part was an updated, and hopefully safer, design.UPDATE: I got the new temperature probe and it also failed. In a conversation with the company they admitted that they had a defect and basically said \\"tough luck\\" but not very nicely. STAY AWAY FROM BROILKING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great griddle!...especially for large families","review":"We used to have a griddle attachment for our Jenn-Aire stovetop. When we replaced the stovetop last fall, I really missed having a large griddle, especially when making large batches of pancakes or french toast. After reading the review on Cook's Illustrated, I decided to try out the Broil King.Everything they described is spot-on. I turn it on before I start getting the ingredients together so it has plenty of time to warm up. After 5-10 minutes, it's ready to go and the temperature is consistent across the entire cooking surface.The size is perfect. I can fit 8 good size pancakes on the griddle and every one of them is nicely golden brown. This griddle is so good that I fire it up even when I only need to make a couple grilled cheese sandwiches.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon","review":"I really like this product and was given a recommendation by my Son & his wife.

It is very loose (and has been from the start) is getting worse and the only way to keep the griddle hot is to hold the plug in manually. I am very disappointed and I think it should be replaced, but I don't want a big hassle. I am thinking of ordering another one, hoping that the same thing doesn't happen again...."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints","review":"I do not use the splash guard. There are little plastice pieces you can use to tilt the griddle, but I honestly do not use them either. Like other reviewers, I notice the finish is not smooth and pretty, but I do not care about that. The instructions clearly state one side is hotter than the other, so I do expect that. I learned to work around it! I set the temperature about 10 degrees lower than the recommended for most items and it cooks everything nicely. The temperature control is heavy duty -- which is a nice surprise! Nice thick cord. So far, I really like this. I cook 6 decent size pancakes on it at one time. A whole pound of bacon.

One is 27 to 28 inch, the other is 25 to 26 inch. The exterior fabric is wearing very well and looks good. The zippers are well made. The problem with both suitcases is their semi-rigid plastic interior full frame/liner to which the retractable handle assembly, wheels and exterior fabric attach. This plastic is falling apart like a brittle, dried clay sheet. (It appears to be decomposing.) Obviously, without this plastic structure, the rest of the suitase is no longer usable.

Sims, who thrived in this sort of informal environment, is wonderful throughout. Hall and Raney, especially on \\"Spuds,\\" create some very exciting interplay. Brookmeyer (the notes hedge on his identity, but I think they are correct) has a wonderfully sui generis piano solo on one of the tracks featuring Zoot. Excellent reproductions of some of Young's paintings, some great photographs taken at these sessions, and some funny reminiscences from the participants. Howard Mandel's intro, though, is a rehash of the usual cliches about the 50s. I hope we get to hear more from these sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful cakes","review":"This is a great bundt pan. The cakes are so impressive with the detail.

She again delivers a strong and moving performance with her \\"Lake of Dreams\\", though I would advise her fans who would purchase this book solely due to Linda's legacy to not procure the book as the story is the same one in \\"Everlasting Love\\". However, u definitely have to read one or the other, meaning \\"Everlasting Love\\" or \\"Heart's Desire: A Colle..\\". \\"Lake of Dreams\\" is an incredible story of a man and woman who have had 12 lifetimes together and still fail to make it in love. The story is about their last chance and how they learn that only through trust can their passionate and lustylove survive. Incredibly moving and touching. It's definitely a Linda keeper.

No complications. It breaks down a simple 12 bar blues and provides plenty of 2 bar riff ideas that you can use over the backing tracks.

It's a great learning tool and worth buying just for these jam tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another riff book","review":"After reading the reviews and looking at a pile of riff books I already owned and never used it sounded like this one would be different. No way--same ol' same ol. I was especially disappointed with some of these riffs being so short. My ideal would be riffs that comprise more than 10-15 notes. It may be my bias that I do not find riff books to be that useful. The idea of working on and memorizing 70 very short riffs and then somehow stringing them together--10-15 notes at a time does not appeal to me. My bias, I guess. If you like riff books, fine but do not expect this one to offer anything more than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It","review":"This is definitely good value for money. It's my reference on riffs, just as the title says: By the bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't get all this hype","review":"this is a good licks book, but a few warning must be made. The licks are all played with the same backing track, at the same tempo,same time signature, a slow blues piece of music. The explanations of scales used are two pages long, and confusing, as most books. The rest is tab, purely tab.If you think you'll find different licks for different blues progressions, you'll be disappointed.The licks are categorized in bars of the 12 bar blues, but that doesn't mean you'llknow when to improvise licks, because unless your are a natural born talent, you will need a little theory for that, something you won't find here.Anyway, you'll get many licks from the book, just don't expect to be the bible people are claiming.When the book arrived, I was like \\"what about those glowing reviews?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Twinkie blues","review":"Okay, this book is only 10 bucks but I still feel ripped off. It takes one 12-bar progression in one key -- G, C and D -- and tabs some very basic licks for each bar of the progression. As for the \\"cool riffs\\", I routinely come up with better stuff than this just noodling on the couch in front of the tv. There are a few good ones, but most are very basic and uninspired, sometimes as few as two notes per bar, and relies heavily on bends in place of more interesting licks. The book is only 32 pages, with lots of white space that could have been used for detailed explanations but isn't. With a little reformatting the page count could easily be cut in half. But my complaint isn't about quantity -- this is just a very low caliber publication with a slick cover. If blues books were desserts, this one is a Twinkie. Unless you're a complete novice, save your money for something better. And keep this in mind the next time you consider buying a Hal Leonard book.

It is a typical guy movie with plenty of T&A;, flatulence, and crude jokes to keep a guy entertained.Rather then recap the entire story, I will highlight some of my favorite parts.The strip poke game with Pondo was a classic.The best guy scene in not only this movie but in all of these type of typical guy movies is with the beautiful Italian girl the the problems she experiences on her date with Pondo. His reaction is priceless.I rented this movie so many times when friends stayed over that we knew the movie line by line. When the video store closed, it was lost forever (or so I thought). Thanks to Amazon, I now have a DVD copy which I'm sure will be a hit whenever my 40 something buddies are over and having a few drinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"**facepalms**","review":"I remember this film from my youth.....I just don't remember it being this bad.Good thing there is a decent two man male stripper scene which runs for several minutes near the front of this very sophomoric film.This film is the cinema version of riding in a shopping cart which has been shoved over the edge of a cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than Troll 2","review":"Party Animal is a truly horrible movie despite a few scenes that make it \\"watchable\\" (and I use that term lightly). If not for the awesome soundtrack, the role by Jerry Jones, several nude scenes, and creepy/hilarious homo-erotic tendencies, I'd declare this movie unfit for anyone. Watch at your own risk unless you're into this type of movie, but at the cheap price it's not like you'll break the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy flit","review":"this is borderline soft porn today,and the racial comments are done in a kinder time,it is hilarious,makes porkys look tame,"},{"rating":"2","title":"the party animal","review":"one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. i have been searching for it for a very long time. full of laughs. most people will just love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pondo is a God","review":"Hilarious movie.

Nothing special about the interface, just a still image like the case cover with navigation to the movie, scene selection and the trailer.The disk is the old two sided flip flop type with standard 4:3 on one side and 16:9 on the other. The widescreen is simply the standard frame expanded and cropped. This will look nice on widescreen TVs but you will watch the standard side to get the original effect.The picture and sound are great especially compared to my Lightning Video VHS release from 1985.Maybe someday they will release a soundtrack. After searching for a year I am still missing a couple of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy, predictable 1980s film","review":"If you like the Porky's series and other 1980s films where male main characters struggle and succeed at losing their virginity, then you will like this. It is a bit of \\"the nerd finally gets his.\\" Still, it has predictable jokes. It's really just for people who want to see a lot of female nudity. There is a token black guru in the film. He does say a phrase that may stay with you for a while. Near the end there is a stereotypical gay character that is only there for homophobic audiences. This film was made before there was a broadscale outcry against displays of the confederate flag. The unthoughtful display of that item may upset modern viewers. Face it, this film is not for people who watch the Oscars. It is very much meant for immature watchers like the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as funny as i remembered it","review":"Granted, this is not classic film making; it is low budget and looks it.

Though extreme, the movie shows the lengths a guy will go to pick up some chicks. I saw this movie in high school at the theater, and thought it was one of the funniest films I saw in an endless line of similar plots, topless women, and low budget films residing in the where are they now file. This film is just funny. I have several friends that I see about once every 3 years who still quote it. This film should have been lifted into cult status, but I don't think enough people have seen it, one thing is sure, if you find a guy who did see it, they will remember it fondly.Not a good film to watch with a female, or your children. Not really all that bad, but I have figured out that most middle aged women do not want to view topless women from the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can have a","review":"I have waited so long for this DVD to be released.

Although it has not been DVD yet i have seen the whole first season on TV and from my prospective it was one of the worst season of the show so far, because it was a brand new show and the story lines were not so intresting. The hiar, mackeup, wardrobe, and dialog was really off and the little \\"Joan\\" moments where every thing pauses and joan has a on camere thought in hear head was really the worst part. although in my opinion the first season was the worst, I WOULD STILL BUY THIS DVD because wonce the sales of this set goes well it will give Paramount the green light to release the other seasons, (witch were way better) you see how long it took for the studio to even consider to release the show on DVD. The show is now in its 7th year as one of the longest runnig Upn shows ever. It now continues on The CW."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!!","review":"My DVDs finally arrived in the mail and I am so pleased. One of the best shows on Television..Love it.

When it first aired I was thinking it was going to be a corny show with no substance. Usually shows that depict African American women are too stereotypical or they are totally unrealistic. This show gets it right FINALLY. I love Tracee Ellis Ross and the other actresses on this show because they keep it REAL. I knew Kelsey Grammer was a winner when I watched his show Frazier (another good sitcom) and I am pleased with his job as producer of an all black show. He has done an excellent job of portraying black women in a positive light which isn't always the case in Hollywood. Go Tracee, Golden, Persia, Jill Marie, and Reggie! This has been the best black show on television since the Cosby's and A Different World!!! Keep it coming!!!!BTW-CW when are the REST of the seasons coming out? Don't make the fans wait too long!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seasons 2 thru 6 Were Fantastic!","review":"Although season 1 of Girlfriends was a tad off the mark, they were probably just going thru growing pains. They really hit the mark in seasons 2 thru 6. Why they took 6 years to start releasing the first DVD is puzzling to me. I started taping them about 2 years ago, but gave that up due to the bulkiness of vhs tapes. I will be ordering the season 1, and hopefully they will release the other seasons.

Didn't use the video at all, and it ran perfectly. Sounded great. I used this product for a year, and I finally got a receiver with enough optical inputs where I do not need this anymore, but it's not because this thing didn't deliver. The only thing I would say for this that kind of is lacking, is the fact it does not auto switch to the new source. But hey, like I said, I used it for audio only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Purchased this product because unfortunately, one of my setups is a projection TV that was made before HDMI became the standard. I use it for the video/audio switching of my Xbox 360 and my PS3 and it works great. Sound is great (I use digital audio) and so is the video. Picture looks great, even the BluRays. Highly recommend, especially for the price and the convenience of not having to switch wires when switching from one component to another. Also perfect when you run out of video/audio inputs on your receiver (which happened to me). So now I have just a \\"game\\" input on my Denon for the Xbox and the PS3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works... kind of.","review":"This switch will allow you to increase the number of HD component devices you can use. However, this convenience comes at a drawback. The picture and sound often black out for several seconds when using this device. It mostly happens during commercials but sometimes happens during actual shows/movies. It also happens occasionally while using my PS3, both for gaming or watching movies. I think the blackouts are caused when the video quality switches as it usually happens when the camera angle switches. Also, it does not appear to happen on standard definition channels. I tested different cables to make sure that was not the issue. I requested a replacement device and found the same problems in the second device. I hope I can get a refund because the blackouts are quite annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just as described","review":"When Panasonic didn't offer an HDMI after-market circuit board for slot 1 on my 50\\" plassma, 8 series I ordered one of these switchers to get three component inputs.

Very easy setup and the unit is very small, so does not take up much space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves Its Purpose Well","review":"Looking for a component video switch, I was concerned as to the quality of signal after passing through the switch. I was been pleasantly surprised to see no deterioration in quality for the XBOX and DVD player that are run through the switch. The fact that my Harmony remote can control it makes it all the easier to use. My only suggestion for improvement is around cable management. Because the unit is pretty light, the cables plugged in to the back of the unit tend to tip the unit slightly. I'm definitely happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs well.","review":"This device is as advertised and works well. Build quality appears good. Connections seat solidly and do not feel loose. The remote has the functions you would expect. A pleasant plus was that the Harmony remote can be programmed from the database to run it. I have had no problems with visible or audible signal degradation with signals up to 1080i (the TV to which this connects does not do 1080p).I would purchase this again.

The true nature of this book is the spiritual journey a young man takes and how the things that were part of the formation of the individual shapes the man's belief system. As with all of us of that generation, as we age we become more aware of the really important parts of life. God, family and self are the relationships that are explored and defined through Doyle's eyes.

I love Wynonna's singing, and there are some fine performances here, and many great songs, but this is the worst engineered live album I've ever heard (although audience noise is inevitable and even welcome, as part of the listening experience, here it is almost as loud as the music - not good). Maybe the DVD would have been the way to go; the CD was a huge disappointment, as far as pure listening pleasure is concerned.

This LP is a concept album, van der Linden's musical interpretation of an old Dutch legend about \\"The White Ladies,\\" which dates from the Middle Ages. Van der Linden recruited a few associates from his old band Ekseption, including bassist Cor Dekker and drummer Peter de Leeuwe, as well as additional musicians. The record is a mixture between clasical music (The leader's reworking of classical compositions by Beethoven is very nice and powerfull)and progresive rock with enfasis on the keyboard's work by Rick van der Lynden (moogs, Hammond organ, synth and piano.

But Jesus said, \\"... except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\\" There must be a change of heart. There must be a turning away from all sin. This book addresses an issue that is not heard from the pulpits of today's churches nearly as often as it should be. This book speaks not only of what true repentance is but also the importance of genuine sorrow over sin. Every believer in Christ should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puritan Work","review":"Every professing Christian should read. I thouroughly enjoyed it. Other than the replacement theology present I found the work sound in its definition and application of repentance in conversion and sanctification. A must in every Christians library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking","review":"The kit came with everything I needed for my H2 except instructions. The larger clearance lights are easy to install - a single phillips screw driver is all you need. The middle marker lights were a PAIN! This isn't the \\"fault\\" of the manufacturer but I do wish they had included some directions. Make sure you attach the included seals to each light and select the correct bulb before installing. My other wish would be for IPCW to include LED bulbs (194) and not normal bulbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!","review":"Nice item, we use them in front of our machines (were a machine shop).

Third, it really provides a lot of traction and pressure support, you can feel it. Fourth, the holes in the middle are great for draining out anything wet, in order to preserve traction, and trapping dirt. I highly recommend this product. One downside is that I found a very similar product (same size) for about $15 cheaper than on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells fine - WAY too strong","review":"This was a blind buy for me (never do that with perfumes/cologne)The scent actually isn't bad, but one little spray and you'll still be smelling it after your next shower.It's so strong that after a couple hours I get a bit nauseous.If you're taking a trip & can't bring cologne with you, just squirt this stuff about 3 times before the trip and it should last all week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good deal for 30$","review":"Joob, as usual is a strong statment, joob jump is a little extra on the statment.. my recommendayion, do not go out once u wear it.. just give it 15 min to ease a little. other than that its not bad for the value at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Too Much and it Ruins Negatives","review":"I ruined several 1950's 3x3 film negatives that I wanted to clean prior to sending them out to be scanned and printed. Unfortunately several negatives had difficult-to-remove stains; it seemed that using a little too much on a clean cloth left rub marks that couldn't be removed. It made the negatives worse than what they were. I ended up cleaning the rest of the negatives with warm water and a little mild soap which did a far superior cleaning job. Use this product with great care!"},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful","review":"I too believed what the media wanted me to believe at the time: That michael was a cold hearted man who had wanted Terri to die for his own benefit. I was wrong. I cried the day she died. After reading this book, I finally have an understanding for what HE went through. He was the one who cared for her the most! He wanted her to live, but at a certain point, you need to let the person go and be unselfish.What I learnt from the book?That the man was offered tons of money to give over his guardianship of Terry to her parents- and he refused. That when he tried to get a DNR for her, and everyone thought that it was bec he would inherit her money once she died- it was false. He offered to give that money to charity, just so long as she could be at peace. He didnt get a divorce, nor marry his long time love Jodi, bec of Terri.I feel for this man, who spent years fighting inside himself. I hope that now that Terri's at rest, he can finally move on with his life- and never forget her."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame...","review":"Having read many of the reviews before mine, I am of the opinion that reviewers who have not bothered to read the book should refrain from giving their \\"opinion\\". They are totally worthless to those readers who might want to read something worthwhile!I read the book. I found it to be interesting, factual, and backed up by the sort of legal documents all such books should contain. I thought Michael Schiavo was right to protect his wife from the onslaught of cameras and bystanders who knew nothing of his situation. The testimony of the priest was most enlightening. In fact after reading his words, I actually changed my opinion about Catholics in general. A good read all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really the truth ?","review":"This man wanted his wife to die so he could move forward in his adulterous affair. Terry deserved to live and be with the family who wanted her, no matter what! Shame on you for putting to death a woman you were bound to the end. Your affair was more important then a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Not Worth the Money","review":"I still wonder, if Terri wouldn't have wanted to have been kept alive,why did Michael Schiavo try so hard to win the lawsuit to keep her alive. Also, why didn't he just let her parents take care of her after he got tired of having to do it. Would he have had to part with some of the money from the lawsuit? I doubt that her parents had that in mind at the end. All they wanted to do was to keep their daughter from going through a horrible death. He seems like a heartless man. Most people wouldn't put their pet through anything so cruel let alone a wife that he professed to love. Again, he is out to make money by writing this book and that is the bottom line."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about him","review":"Wow, what a hero? A man that spent 12 years trying to end the life of his wife, while he had two children with another woman. We call that something other than Hero in this country. This book is all about him and his contempt for anything other than what is good for him. I found it appalling and full of lies. I can speak directly to this as I was a friend of Terri's. Unfortunately, we must all remember that because Michael \\"won\\" we must not mistake that with him being right.

What about his promise to love and cherish her, in sickness and in health... for as long as they both shall live???? How on earth did the Catholic church condone his extramarital affair with Jodi and even having two children with her? He should have divorced Terri if he wanted to date, marry, have children with someone else. Not perpetuate this pathetic lie that he loved her and was fighting for her.The book is also badly written and very boring, expecially the parts about all the details in the courtroom. I'm glad I only paid $1 for it at my local Dollar Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth of lies","review":"Terri: The Truth is an oxymoron. If you look at the depositions in which Michael Schiavo is on record of saying he needed the money to take care of his wife for the rest of her life, yet as soon as he receieved the medical malpractice money, the start to end her life began. Why did Terri go 10+ years with zero rehab of which Michael was awarded that money to rehab her? Why did it take Michael 8+ years to suddenely remember or come out with the notion that \\"Terri and he talked about this situation and she didn't want to live this way?\\" There are so many holes in his version of the Truth that it really makes you wonder what did happen the night Terri collapsed. \\"Terri: The Truth\\" is a bunch of lies according to Michael Schiavo's court testimony and what he's saying now. The public records of the trial are better reading than this hogwash. Don't waste your money on a guilty man trying to clear his conscience for murdering his wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful read","review":"This book was a painful read, considering it is nothing more than a desperate attempt to place blame for Terri's death onto her father - a serious point which is ever so cleverly introduced to the reader early on in the book. If that point is missed, then the reader will be led down the garden path, believing the book to be about Michael and Terri's great story book marriage. But if the reader reflects on that point, the rest of the book is seen for what it is - a man painting himself as a good and noble husband - with him as the hero and Terri as the victim of an insensitive father. The only reason I gave it one star is because there were no zero's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic only begins to describe this book....","review":"Don't waste your money - if you must read...go to the public library; but don't give this heartless man a dime. What a sad commentary on Terri's legacy. This wasn't a tribute to Terri, but a last stab at the Schindler family. If Schiavo had any decency at all, he would of just given Terri back to her family (PERIOD!!) AND, for him to write \\"I Kept My Promise\\" on Terri's headstone...he knows, full well, that that wasn't meant for Terri...it was yet, another stab at the Schindler's. Yes, he \\"kept his promise\\" to kill Terri (keep her money) and keep her from the Schindler's (you \\"won\\" Michael...does it feel good??). Schiavo will meet his maker and Terri will be sitting to the right of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having the LAST word again.....","review":"Michael Schiavo's need to control situations at all costs is apparent again. The book starts out well but he often lapses into hurtful accusation. He recounts anecdotes that even IF true need not be told now. It seems that once he decided to move on he was obsessed with claiming that Terri \\"asked\\" him to terminate her Life if left incapacitated. Schiavo took an \\"excuse\\" and ran with it until it became a mantra. Even on Terri's grave he has inscribed, \\"I Kept My Promise.\\" Still about Michael. Poor Terri!

Why did I give just one star? I started buying these vitamins in May. The lowest price offered by third party sellers (of a range of prices) was 38.19 for the 240 tablet bottle, this very ASIN.In July and August, the price had climbed to 49.95. Now, the price is 68.50. Not only is it 68.50, but every seller, ALL 31 OF THEM, has them priced at 68.50. A few weeks ago, all but one seller had them priced at 68.50. That sole listing's different price was not visible until you added the item to your shopping cart. You know, one of those situations where the manufacturer sets a restriction on the lowest advertised price, and you can only see the price by adding it to your cart. What was this lowest price? 67.50. One whole dollar less than 68.50.These vitamins are still in production. They are no rare commodity. Why is there no competition on here? Yeah, I believe the manufacturer is pressuring sellers to raise the price on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Riker's Last Dance","review":"A great DS9 episode featuring Jonathan Frakes!

It has good sci-fi, and a human story to fulfill our Trek needs. The episode is directed by Jonathan Frakes, whom keeps the pace of the episode going. And of course there is Quark who tries to create a fantasy holo program of Kira. I liked this one. There's mystery, aliens, special effects, love, pain, and a lot of laughter. Too bad it has nothing to do with any storyline, and there's really not much character building either. But, it is a memorable episode regardless and I recommend seeing it. If you like Star Trek, you'll like this episode. 4.3/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jem'Hadar Baby","review":"Good DS9 episodes like this mostly start the same: Quark does something, and then the station is in trouble again. This time, it's with the Dominion, or at least, one of them. My favorite part is about Jake, not the Jem'Jadar. This is classic Star Trek formula, and, in my opinion, essential to the Dominion story arc. 4.3/5 Stars. (I really liked it) Nicely written and thought provoking. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trouble With Trills","review":"I'd consider this to be one of the finer Trill episodes. So if you're interested, check this one out. I love the acting of Terry Ferrell, who plays Jadzia-Dax. So I must give this a 3.9/5 stars just for her.

I, personally, prefer TNG and believe Picard could kick Kirk's bottom all over the NCC-1701 *and* the NCC-1701-D. So, while I prefer TNG, I do enjoy DS9, and this is a well done season with some great development and good stories, but what is with the casing? It has to be the cheapest multi-disk DVD case I have ever seen. The tri-fold design lost two flaps after being opened and closed less then five times (that means the case will fall apart when you're about halfway through the season).So, ***** for the show, and * for the case.

It's fun and light hearted and you get to see the DS9 crew and company be out of their cookie-cutter roles.

While the main plot circulates around Sisko and his Early Bajoran space ship, it's the subplots of the episode that are worth the most notoriety. Actually, the sail barge part was pretty boring and a little far-fetched even for Star Trek (can't be at warp without inertial dampeners). But I did like the Bashir and Jake subplots. 3.6/5 Stars for that.

However on our carpet, there's no way she can spin this thing even if she wanted to. Which, by the way she doesn't want to because she's scared of the chair. She's 18 months and doesn't get scared very often, but Elmo does the trick. I tried putting a blanket over it and that worked, until she realized she's more comfortable on the floor.

The bottom is slightly rounded so your child can make it spin by using their legs. Even with their legs to power them it more slowly turns than spins.We could never really get it to turn well with the carpet and even at the store on the hard floor. Oh well, we bought it anyway because it talks and she likes Elmo. She loves to drag it around the house and sit in it.

When the battery recharged and I tried to view the pictures again the next day, when I turned the camera on, it said \\"Memory card error\\" and it occassionally said \\"Memory card error Card locked\\". I first thought there was something wrong with my memory card, but then I looked it up online and all these Amazon reviews came up that it's their Canon, not the memory card. Fortunately, the pictures I took were still on the memory card when I brought them to a photo store and they were able to burn them onto a cd for me. I'm really not sure what to do now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD is big but fragile","review":"Think twice before buying the Canon SD 200, SD 300 or any SD series camera. The LCD displays are large but extremely fragile. Mine was cracked on the second day. It was NOT dropped or abused.I also have a Canon S110 and have taken just over 5,000 photos with it since Christmas 2001 without any problems. Apparently, in an attempt to make the new models light and the displays large, Canon sacrificed durability.In some cases Canon will \\"waive\\" the LCD repair cost. In others they demand $165 for the repair.Canon repaired mine as a favor. And I've since purchased a 'da Protector Model 104 - LCD protector. A thin plastic shield that fits well over the LCD window and is stiff enough to shield the LCD from any contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD screen broke","review":"We had our SD200 for about 6 months and kept it in a small camera case. Had lots of fun with it. Somehow the LCD screen (see other reports) broke with just minimal pressure to the camera. When turned on the LCD screen is grey with a purple splotch down the middle. It still takes stills and the movie mode works but you can't adjust the settings without the screen. Frustrated, we just sent it in to Canon. If they charge us to fix it will not pay it, just get another camera that won't break like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value and quality","review":"This camera is perfect for anyone who is looking for a user-friendly device. It gives enough options (speed adjustment, light adjustment, video) for everyday use. The rechargable battery alone makes it a great buy. You save tons of money on batteries and the charger is easy to use and quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"My LCD cracked too! And this was a replacement! Total JUNK!","review":"I bought this camera before a trip to Hawaii. When I got there, as soon as I went to take my first picture I got the dreaded \\"E18\\" error. If you don't know what this is, just Google \\"Canon E18\\" and see all the thousands of hits. Basically the camera lens stops communicating with the body, which makes the camera a paperweight. Luckily I was able to return it and get a replacement while I was out there. Fast forward two months, I turn the camera on one day and the LCD is white with a black blob in the corner, with what look like cracks going across the LCD. The plastic isn't cracked or scratched, this is a problem with the how the LCD was manufactured. Now I am screwed. I have a wedding to go to this weekend with no camera.If there is any kind of a class action lawsuit, count me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great camera right up until it failed","review":"The LCD display failed after only 6 months.

I would steer clear of this camera but if you do buy one, make sure you get a really good case. The problem is that having a decent case makes the camera too big for your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD Broken","review":"The camera takes wonderful pictures. I purchased two for my adult sons in December 2005. As of right now, both have broken view screens. This seems to be a major design problem for this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Camera Ever For a College or High School Student","review":"When this camera first came and I opened the box it was smaller than I expected it to be.The basic reason I wanted a camera was to click prictures when I am out partying which means that the camera is not handled with care. But this camera was so sturdy that during Halloween the button to click the pictures fell off but it was easily reattached.Another reason I had heard was that higher mega pixel cameras require a lot of stabilty in your hands which is not usually the case during partying or just chilling when you actually need the pictures to be clicked to preserve the moment. This camera clicks pictures which are very good. I mean you dont need detailed functions which take time to understand and use as special moments do not last for ever.This fits in easily anywhere and the battery lasts for ever. Its definitely worth the price you pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Screen, Broken Heart","review":"Camera is fun to use and takes great pics for its size. But if you're looking for something pocketable and take-anywhere this isn't necessarily it. The screen breaks way too easily. I had it in the front pocket of my jeans and it cracked while I was tying my shoes! Cost to repair is 2/3 the cost of a new camera. I've had a few other cameras, bunch of cellphones, and PDAs, put them through much worse and never had problems with the screen. Canon wants me to pay for the repairs but instead I'm gonna put the money towards something that can survive a few shoe-tyings."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD Screen is too fragile.","review":"I have to be honest the Camera is the perfect size, takes OK pictures, but not great, would be great for casual pictures, and home shot. The main drawback is that the LCD screen is WAY too fragile. It literally takes nothing to crack it, and Canon will not cover it under warranty. My LCD broke in a case with a plastic lcd screen protector on it, I have been very careful because I was aware of this problem. Canon built a pocket camera that is too fragile to carry in a pocket. I highly suggest you find and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed like a great little camera...","review":"I bought this camera for my twenty year old son for Christmas. The LCD screen broke within two weeks. He sent it to Canon and they said it was caused by impact/pressure, and he would have to pay $150 to have it repaired. When I bought the camera there were no negative reviews on this site; now there are at least seven regarding cracked LCD's. I think this is a defect that Canon should make right. Until then, I would not recommend this camera or any of the same line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible service","review":"After having this camera for only 5 months, the infamous E18 message showed up on my camera (something having to do with the lens) and the manufacturer refused to fix this problem without me first paying a $108 fee when the camera itself cost me just under $200. That's like paying for half the camera again. I definitely do not recommend buying ANY canon powershot products."},{"rating":"1","title":"E18 renders camera useless","review":"The camera itself works very well, and I would recommend if it weren't for the notorious E18 error (search Google for it) - which occurred at a particularly unfortunate time for me. Canon charges $250 to fix the problem if it's out of warranty, and denies that there is a design flaw in the camera (which there is - thousands of people are experiencing it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera...except for Red Eye","review":"I love this camera. I've owned several point and shoot digital cameras, and this is the best of the bunch. Everything about it is top notch except for it's red eye reduction. Red eye is almost always present. It's not that big of a deal for me as I can remove that with software fairly easily, but it's worth mentioning because it is a major problem. Other than that, this camera out performs every other mini digital camera I've owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use with good results","review":"Very small and easy to use snapshot camera.I like the LCD screen and lots of manual functions, too.The automatic controls are a bit off when taking pictures in the dark and also in moving vehicles, but once you switch it to manual, then you can take nice pictures in all conditions.For some reason, it does eat up battery. I find myself using up a battery with one days picture taking. Maybe turning it on and off drains power because I didn't even come close to the number of pictures taken for a full battery. More like half.I brought it on my Peru trip and went backpacking with it. It was awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE my camera","review":"I just needed a camera that was small, easy to use, and took good pictures. This camera fit the bill perfectly.

This camera was never dropped and always traveled in a hard case.I was told that I can send the camera to some place in IL for repair, but I need to find the warranty card.I find it incredibly annoying that a consumer products company with the tenure of Canon would refuse to acknowledge an obvious bug in their camera, and force everyone to dig the warranty card out of the junk drawer. Nothing is more irritating than a company putting the burden of repair on a consumer when the defect is in the engineering.It's not like I dropped the damn thing into a pitcher of beer (oh, memories of my old cellphone - *sniff*) or got thrown into a pool with it in my pocket (farewell, old camera).In any case, I wouldn't buy this camera again due to the sheer number of people experiencing the E18 error.For that matter, I may just avoid Canon entirely in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Camera","review":"I brought this camera for my presonal use and now after using it for a month now I think its worth investment I have made.

Great pictures, wonderful size, would have rated it a 5 star until the flash quit working. Canon is charging $100 for repairs because there was a tiny dent in the flimsy housing so that voids the warranty. I won't buy another Canon but I can understand why those who don't have problems with it would love this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet aother LCD problem","review":"Couldn't resist the free Coach bag promotion and got this for my daughter. Took 3 pictures on Christmas and two yesterday as it was carefully carried in its Coach bag.Upon next turning on, the LCD is locked with a frozen batwing that is also visible when it is turned off.First Canon CSR gave instructions on sending it back without mentioning the possibility that LCD is not warranteed. Second CSR said it's a judgement call by the tech as to possible camera abuse and to send a clear note about camera history.It's on its way to repair depot. I saw previous 1-star LCD comments and hoped to be lucky. Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Simple Camera","review":"The Canon SD200 goes everywhere in my wife's purse.It takes great pictures, indoors and out. The only setting my wife messes with is flash. This camera is perfect for her.The viewfinder is a plus as it enables her to steady the camera by holder her camera hand against her face. Using the viewfinder, rather than the LCD, extends battery life.This camera is great for short videos of our granddaughter. With a little care, it is suitable for natural-light photos. It focuses in low light. Shutter response is good. Digital \\"Noise\\" is a bit better than what one should expect.This is our 4th digital camera, and our favorite for casual use. It just works."},{"rating":"2","title":"User friendly","review":"This camera is great and really easy to use and understand.

Yesterday during a site-seeing trip the LCD cracked leaving a white screen with a purple blob. Horrified, I looked online to see if this was a common problem and found HUNDREDS of reports of broken LCDs. I can't believe Canon is not taking responsibility for their poorly constructed product and doesn't order a recall or at least cover the LCD under warranty. The camera works fine otherwise, but is essentially useless without the menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon sd200","review":"Flash stopped working less than a month after buying, camera was sent to be repaired and fixed. A couple of months later the zoom stopped working again had to pay shipping to get repaired. Now a little over a year camera will not power on at all and is out of warr.

It is here one can see why Rubinstein was such a genius of a pianist whose standard is yet to be surpassed by even the most talented. Ten stars would not be enough to rate this performance. The label seems to be discontinuing various CDs where both Rubinstein and the Guarneri Quartet performed together.

It is written for those who are unable to accept the fact that we are not in complete control of our bodies. The book makes the ridiculous claim that one can heal by wishful thinking and ridiculous rituals. It offers no reasonable explanation why these rituals work; it simply states their powers as fact.It is simply a manual for the followers of Choa Kok Sui, who liked to be referred to as Master when alive, and now after his death is considered a deity by his followers.If its authors thought the techniques worked, why is there a disclaimer in the book (in small type) that these techniques are only to be used as a supplement to real medicine; this from a book that claims its techniques are far superior to western medicine?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!, Add a flat-fee MLS","review":"This was HIGHLY INFORMATIVE. It really helped the most! I recommend reading it in it's entirety. If not, you will miss out on much needed tips. However as a FSBO, to really get more online marketing exposure for your home, you need a flat-fee MLS service. With that and this book, I am sure you can be sold soon and without paying an agent a full 6% commission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference book!","review":"I was clueless about how to proceed in selling my home myself, but this book has provided me with all of the information I need.

Do not expect it to stand up on its own.It doesn't fit my four-year-old child, but it does look like it was made by one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome looking, but too tight","review":"I bought this for a halloween costume for an adult. this hat barely fit my head and did not fit his either, so I had by grandmother let out the back and it was still tight. For someone with a smaller sized head, this should be perfect. I mean, this looks like the real deal, no fake looking ones I was comparing this to. Quality if 7 outta 5 stars, but I have to give it a 4 because of the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have made this better","review":"Based on the reviews, this item seemed like a decent purchase, but i was quite surprised at the low quality when I received it. It has threads hanging out all over the place and the hat looks way too shallow and doubt that it will even take the shape of a head. I would return it if it wouldnt cost me even more money to do so. Just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction Quality","review":"The quality of this cap is very poor. The fabric is about as thin as a handkerchief. the clasp on the back is not velcro. It is a white plastic fastener with multiple holes for adjusting.

This book does not qualify. By the end of the story there was a likely villian and only one likely villian, both in terms of events and in terms of character (which is usually Haddam's strong suit). There were no surprises in the ending. I was dismayed that so good an author could produce this story.If you are a fan of Jane Haddam, you may want to read this for completeness. But please don't expect much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good....for the first week.","review":"I got this product to help improve my speed and calf muscles.

I could buy better weighted ropes at walmart for a quarter of the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This item is a piece of shit, it is not adjustable easily, in the slightest.

Then I dropped the other handle (this while trying to get the rope straightened out) and it also broke completely. More duct tape and I was back to skipping.

In hindsight, I wish I had waited. The rope functioned fine for two workouts, but before I was able to use it for a third, I accidentally dropped it from about thigh high onto linoleum flooring. The end of one of the handles shattered on impact. While it still functioned as a standard jump rope, it could no longer hold the weighted one pound insert.

I've bought 6, yes 6 study guides for this exam and they have all fallen way short...with the exception of this and the MS book. I found the first half of this book to be excellent. Especially the chapters on Classes and Active X. The sections on ADO and common controls were a bit dry, but nonetheless complete.

This book is invaluable for helping you focus your studying efforts, and the practice questions are a great resource. I'd like to give this book a 3.5, but opted for a 4, because I passed the exam! There are numerous errors, some inexcusable, and clearly this book should have been better edited. Also, the book is light on the Packaging & Deployment Wizard, VSS and VCM, which make up at least 25 percent of the questions. Use MSDN and Transcender exams as a supplemental resource. Overall, this book provides good summary information, good practice questions, and helps you focus. A worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book is good. I think, the people who rated it 1 star, used this book as scapegoat for their lack of preparation. I found only a couple of very minor mistakes. I rate this book slightly better than the Distributed Cram by Micheal Lane Thomas. The sample test at the end (70 questions) is the best out of 5-6 tests that I used. My advice : Buy this book. Sit on the Computer. Try out each question, concept, etc until you understand it 110 percent. Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"I am probably beating a dead horse but this book is a complete waste of time (or worse as it actually does damage). In the first chapter alone, there are at least four glaring errors (not typos - real conceptual errors). There are additionally some really bad explanations. It is hard to believe that this guy holds himself up as a VB expert. Coriolos should be ashamed. Luckily it appears to be out of print so it will no longer pollute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary to pass the exam","review":"This book has a lot of good info in it. Alone, it is a good VB reference book. However, it has more info than could possibly be on the exam. Therefore you spend too much time learning what might be on the exam and not enough time on the exact exam material.In the end, I used the Microsoft Mastering Series CD-ROM, Transcender, and MSDN. This was just the right amount of reference material to help me pass. I would spend my money on those, and not on this book to pass 70-176.Also, I used the same materials to pass 70-175."},{"rating":"1","title":"i passed, but no thanks to this book","review":"Good points: Alot of the necessary info is in the book, in one place or another. The \\"Cram Sheet\\" is a good last minute review for topics that slipped through the cracks.Bad points: The info is poorly organized. The material is not presented in an easily understandable and comprehensible manner. The package and deployment wizard and its functionality is a big part of this exam, and yet it is not fully explained here (at least not in sufficient detail). The sample test is an interminable exercise in finding the trick to the question, and is not representative of the actual exam. I passed the actual exam by 150 points, yet the day before failed the practice exam here by 250 points.Use Transcender and the Microsoft Mastering Series CD.

About 1/3 of the material covered in the book was not even on the exam. Plus he did not cover some key topics that did happen to show up on the exam. The author of this book should really find another job. He even had the gall to boast about how good a VB programmer he was.

Some chapters are not explained well so I could not even tell it is right or wrong.If you have plenty of time and know VB very well, you can sharpen your proof skill by reading this.

It's a recording of all originals, recorded solo, with references to jazz, folk, classical, new age and pop stylings without falling easily into any one of them. While his writing is beautiful, it's Cullen's playing, exquisite, but always in the service of the music, that carries the day for me. There's a weird sort of joyous bittersweetness to the compositions, that drew me in from the first notes.

It is positive in itself that the future is there to write the entries.

Unfortunately it was still too outdated. Almost nothing on electrics which is probably the most popular now. It also does not go into much detail. I thought I would learn something about Gyro's but very little on that subject and they are still talking about Gyro's with spinning wheels. Also was looking to learn something about building and adjusting but they pretty much say to refer to manufacturer's manual.

It is the surest, fastest way to understanding God, and allowing His love to shine in us through what I have learned to be the Key to Salvation, which is forgiveness. This Course, narrated by our Lord Jesus who still reaches out to us even in these modern days, shows us how to forgive the seemingly unforgiveable in an approach that assuages our sensibilities with renewed and truthful perspective.

I use my copy of this book often and find what seems to be an endless number of places in the book where I am able to feel God's unconditional love for each one of us. This book has been the bridge to calmness for me. I have been reading this book for several years and continue to study the book.

The profound yet simple lessons provided in the workbook have really helped to bring my life to an orderthat, without such insight received from the Lessons, would not have been possible otherwise.This 'book' is deep and demands seriousness from the student...one's intent and approach to reading is what differs, to go beyond the idea, it is essential to get some background to CIM. I suggest any book or tape from Tara Singh, this contact can open up a whole new world and help directly to bridge the gap between one's 'conditioned-brain' and the Thoughts inhereit in CIM.As Helen Schucman, the \\"scribe\\" of CIM once said;\\"the course is to be lived\\"..... it is profound ..but it sure is not easy.

It's true what Jesus said - \\"The Kingdom of Heaven is within.\\" Now I don't know about you, but I needed a step-by-step method of getting there. (After all, if I knew it was already there, and how to get there, I wouldn't have been lost out in the cold, all lonesome.) This book will most definitely open up your \\"inner sense\\" to hearing God's voice for yourself.

This mammoth treatise is just about one of the most confusing and impractical things I have ever read. The one good thing about it is that it urges the reader to be done once and for all with the idea of a vengeful, angry god. It also states (appropriately in my view) that behind most negativity is fear and a call for love. Yet that could have been said in one page. Another problem is that the course never truly explains the concept of evil in any meaningful way. Oh, I know that it says evil is an illusion, having no true reality, but one look at Adolph Hitler, Osama Bin Laden and 9-11, and you are forced to deal with this \\"illusion.\\"The reading of this book is akin to the feeling one gets after eating cotton candy-for a moment it is there and very sweet, and then in an instant it is gone because there is no true substance to it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary book","review":"I love this book, it helps me everyday, because of the deep thoughts and the essential words it contains.Thank you Best regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Course of Miracles","review":"Received the book way ahead of time for Christmas.

A Course Miracles makes the person of Jesus Christ nothing more than a way. A Course in Miracles receives it's only credibility from using the name of Jesus. Unfortunately it ends there. The use of Jesus' name is an obvious attempt to attract Christians, but this book is far from Christian.For anyone seeking good Christian literature, this is not it! A Course in Miracles is much the same as other new age writings. It is warmly presented as a great revelation of truth, but falls short quickly after you pass the dust cover.If you have been hurt, ill, or lost and seek guidance from a Course in Miracles, you'll find yourself in the same place at the end.

It gives us all the answers we need, yet to me it seems there are books out there for people to search for a way to get what they want and do as they please with no thought of anyone yet themselves. The mediations always mention HIM, yet not God, nor Jesus, so if I am going to read something and mediate on it, I would at least like to know its to God, and his name is mentioned in the exercise's with this book, which they are not. I have read this book, and as far as I feel, if you notice above the mediation exercise's it does mention God and or Jesus, yet in the meditation exercise's it does not. You are to meditate on Him, which does not led me to believe its God, nor Jesus. Also, this book is sold in the occult section.

Beautiful, powerful, it is my favourite book and one that I am grateful to have found. The language in this book is extremely rich, and although the teaching can apply to anyone, the book itself can be intimidating or confusing for some. For myself, who has been seeking the kinds of answers and loving image of God that I couldn't get from my traditional Christian upbringing, this book changed my life. It is a book of profound love, peace, and wisdom without equal. Like many sophisticated spiritual texts, it can be easy to misinterpret or misunderstand some of the Course's principal ideas so I recommend reading the commentaries published in Kenneth Wapnick's books for further clarity (especially his \\"Most Common Questions About A Course In Miracles\\"). I wish you all well on your spiritual journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a blessing this book can be.","review":"What can I say? The book somehow simply IS. It invites you to come to it. It speaks of spiritual principle without ever telling you how to be or what to believe. Its message is simple: allow God to turn you from fear to love. Most of the 600+ page text expounds the simple idea that forgiving each other is the way to be freed from the pain we feel in life. If one adopts the 365 page workbook into one's spiritual practice, profound changes in one's life will occur.

I bought this book at least a year ago. I cannot get through it. It sounds like a bunch of gobbledy gook for the most part, and there isn't enough explanation to begin with about how the author(s) came to write this. It's like a Bible, even the paper it is printed on, and somehow, supposedly, the author(s) have been given this divine inspiration to write it. After you get through the first part, the rest is supposedly a course you take, and throughout the book I think the intent is to enlighten you spiritually somehow so you are prepared to leave your ego and self behind and become God or one with God. I'm going to continue to attempt this, but it may take me a very long while because I think I had better start over.

I am dubious about things which talk about channelled messages etc but regardless of that the book is very helpful, to my mind at least, in making the reader feel more calm, forgiving and peaceful. This is not done by 'DO NOT..' commandments, but by picking up on aspects of conditioned thinking and making one re-evaluate them.I would recommend people to look at it with an open mind. But until this book (if ever) is proved to be a fake, always choose it above anything by OSHO/RAJNEESH, the man who showed his contempt for material possesions by having a fleet of Rolls-Royces.

Psychology is an empirical science and deals with realities. As a psychologist, therefore, I have neither the inclination nor the competence to mix myself up with metaphysics. Only, I have to get polemical when metaphysics encroaches on experience and interprets it in a way that is not justified empirically. (...)

Finding the book is a miracle in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hoax That Can Drive You Crazy!","review":"The logic that this book uses is circular thinking; You first get a sophistry that weaves it's falsity with a thread of intellectual stimulating thoughts. Then you come back to the premise which still intrigues you but has no basis. There are some profound truths sprinkled through out the book in order to entice you into believing all of the lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must I read this?","review":"Okay well before I begin I will apologise to anyone who likes this book or actually believes in it.

Sorry but that's my verdict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Jesus from the Bible","review":"A Coures In Miracles was \\"channeled\\" to Helen and the Bible is clear about what it says about mediums. The Course re-writes Christian doctrine. Lots of it is non-sensical like \\"there is no justification for the unjustifiable.\\" If you read any of it, you will see nothing but contradicitons within its own text. If sin is just an illusion, why does it say \\"Sin proves that the Son of God was evil?\\" And, if one does not need to forgive anything that God created, why does it require one to forgive a brother? Purchase the \\"real\\" Word of God called the Holy Bible and don't waste your time on this false text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit Spirituality","review":"This book was supposedly dictated by \\"Jesus,\\" yet it contradicts every cardinal tenet of Christianity. 1. God is not a personal being, but an impersonal force or principle. 2. Sin is not a moral offense against God and others, but a lack of knowledge. 3. Forgiveness is not letting go of the bitterness caused by real wrongdoing, but realizing there is no such thing as sin or guilt. 4. Salvation is not won through the achievements of Jesus Christ to forgive our sin and free us from bondage, but is found by looking within ourselves. And on it goes.The book used Christian vocabulary (God, Christ, sin), but not a Christian dictionary (the Bible). It is a counterfeit of the miracle of redemption offered by the genuine Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Christian Scriptures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing","review":"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing I don't know how Christians can read this book and give favourable reviews, without realizing straight away that there is something not right with it. The book is a new age work written with Christian terminology and is quite obviously not compatible with Christian belief. For example, The \\"Jesus\\" of \\"A Course in Miracles\\" is not the Son of God, never had a physical body, and therefore never really suffered on the cross. The reporter Tracy Moran has written a very good review of this in the EWTN file library for anyone who is interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a pre-copyright edition - no section or line numbers","review":"A Course in Miracles is a great book, but when I ordered this particular edition, I was surprised to find that it was NOT published by The Foundation for Inner Peace and did not have Section or line numbers. It is a copy of the Course that circulated before Helen Schuchman and Ken Wapnick edited it and organized it. If you are interested in it for that reason, then buy it. Otherwise, you're better off getting the official copyrighted version, which you can use at a study group because you'll all have the same page and line numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Course in Miracles","review":"I have tried to read this book three times. If I had learned anything from the first 2 readings it would have been to trust my intuition to not read it a third time. Maybe I just don't get it, but it seems as if its an attempt at hypnosis with the emphasis being on \\"we are not hypnotized\\". I love to read new age spirital books, but this book, while lengthy and complex, (I give the author points for the sheer volume of it) still leaves me feeling like it's not real bright. The main premise being, \\"Love is the opposite of Fear\\". Personally I don't agree with that, isn't love the opposite of hate or apathy perhaps?

What I found was a book that was entirely too interesting to use simply as a reference and ended up reading it in just a few short weeks. The book serves as a great history lesson on the life of Washington and includes several quotes and writings from Washington himself, as well as Jefferson, Adams and Hamilton just to name a few. The books follows Washington all the way from Birth to Death and highlights not only his greatest achievements, but also his many admitted shortcomings and errors thoughout his life. The book does wonder off of the subject of Washington at times for a whole chapter, but typically only to drive home a point in the chapters to follow. I highly recommend this book as well as the others in the American Classic Series.

I guess George broke the mold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction","review":"For someone who knows little about the father of our country, this is a good read. I expect there might be better books on GW though. To me this book had certain drawbacks:1.It is written at a 6th grade reading level.2.It is fawning of GW with absolutely no criticism. (Was he really perfect?)3.It insists that GW was a religious Christian. Given these continuous assertions supported by doubtful quotes from GW's correspondence, one can conclude this this is a point of contention in the assessment of GW.This is a very good introduction to GW and to the history of the beginnings of the US. It inspires one to read more, including perhaps a more realistic appraisal of GW."},{"rating":"1","title":"High-school level reading and often off subject","review":"This book is easy to read and very well organized into small 1-5 page sections for each part of the story, but it is written at more of a high school level than a serious historical biography. The most disappointing aspect, though is that the book often drifts away from its subject for a few pages or even whole chapters! It ends up being more of a revolutionary era history book with emphasis on G. W. than an actual biography of Washington. I would recommend this book for a first read about the era but it is a poor choice for the serious scholar or history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xcellent - easy to read, makes Washington come alive","review":"This book was recommended by Glenn Beck on his radio program. I read lot of history and this is one of the better biographical type books around. It is easy to read and it is written like a story - being told in a large part by the man himself - George Washington. Much of it is in his own words (from quotes, speeches, etc).

I think that our growing concerns about America's current political and economic course are motivating many of us to learn more about our country's roots.

I remember the cherry tree story, but my knowledge of this gentleman was pretty sketchy beyond that. I had the impression that he was a good and honorable man, but again, I had few specifics.This book took care of that. This amazing man makes all of our contemporary Presidents pale in comparison. His interests were in strengthening our country and helping it to grow, PERIOD.

Despite the fact, proven through numerous documents, and thru Mr. Washington's own writings, that he was a Christian, this book purposely voids all traces of this from this story. Shame on the author for this as the very fact that Mr. Washington was a practicing Christian is a very powerful part of his story. Shame on the author for promoting distorted truths as facts. Shame on the author for declaring his book as \\"The Real George Washington\\" as it is NOT!

They have to try to stop it in an airplane all in the middle of a tremendous hurricane. Everything that could go wrong does and Nance's ability to make an action scene is amazing.

I would have enjoyed the book much more if the author would not have hung one of our heros out on the wing of an airplane (way too \\"yeah, right\\" for me!), then landed the plane in the fashion described (way beyond \\"yeah, right\\"!).

Just the very slow moving and boring main plot. I think the writer just had some weird Odo fetish and really wanted to see him naked again.

This movie is set at night as youhear the crickets...but filmed during the day with the camera iris down a bit to make it look like night. Lots of running and more running. At least the script written for the tennagers is pretty funny as they use words no heard since the late 60's. The creature is not too bad and looks a bit better than Robot Monster.

Note the pinky ring on Chris (Ralph baker jr.). He never worked in Hollywood again.The mutated ape, which looked like someone got the wrong head for a Halloween costume, is also bullet proof. He is an acting and dance critic and kills bad \\"B\\" movie actors. Typical rift between Feds and local authorities. The film was fairly bad all around.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

In this album, recorded live with, as the title implies, just a solo classical guitar, he divides his time equally between Bach and originals. The Bach is gorgeous! His playing is as fluid as the greats, and is unmarred by the fretboard noise that so many wind up with. And the originals are terrific as well...jazzy, with enough harmonic nuance to grab your attention, and keep it from falling into the merely New Age, but not so much that folkies should be wary. A favorite is the concluding gem...a cover of Zawinul's Birdland, in which Cullen keeps the bass and harmony moving while letting the melody sing through...and it's all solo live guitar!

I had a hard time lifting the slide to drain the water through the motor/airflow valves. For the price payed I would expect it to be more durable. I have read both positive and negative reviews for this product. My children really loved it however it was a lot of work to take down.

I have another product the slide that goes into the easyset pool and it works great 3 years later. A few improvements that could be made is another drain in the pool, and a larger carrying bag. I bought a plastic bin with wheels and put vents in the lid to protect the slide while going in and out with it. IT NEEDS PLENTY OF DRYING TIME!!!

It is very hard for one person to set up or clean or put away. You can't fill it as deep as you see in the pictures advertised, but the kids love it anyway. Dogs like it, too. However, be warned that if you don't clean it well or check for tears or leaks, you'll have a huge headache trying to fix it or contact customer service. The number provided no longer works, and we can't find the manufacturer online. I don't think this slide was made to last that long, which is sad since entertaining kids is a hard enough issue.I've had to spend extra money buying patch kits and what not. This will also destroy whatever grass you have, so if you like grass don't buy this. It's also a huge waste of money in regards to the water bill. The pool doesn't really hold that much water.

Having the pool at the bottom is good too since they use that area to fill up their water guns and just rest from time to time from all the climbing. The slide takes up an area about 16 feet by 16 feet on the lawn.

We used it about twice a month for our grandchildren- so it got little time in the sun and was not ever put away wet. We used it two summers. At the end of the second summer it began to leak air from all the seams. This unit was never abused - only two kids at a time and they were under 6 years of age. Now, at the beginning of the 3rd summer - it is unusable!!! I notice this current model says \\"2009 Model\\" - not sure what that means but - hopefully it has better UV protection. We paid almost $600 for this slide and it should last longer than a few months for two summers. The ad mentions \\"years of family fun\\" - that's NOT true.

It was a great slide for my kids the first 2 months, then a leak sprang. No big deal as I patched it up with the kit provided. Then soon after a tear in the seam occurred at the wall near the bottom of the slide. What happens is when the kids slide down at a good rate of speed, they first brush/hit the wall on their left as they enter the splash pool. After constant hitting every time the kids go down the slide, it ripped the seams apart and is unpatchable. I am trying to get Banzai to help me out on this, but their warranty is only for 60 days, and mine only lasted 90. I have seen many others out there post similar concerns, and I had only wished I read them before I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I bought this 4 years ago and just threw it away because I did not keep it stored properly. Interestingly enough it was almost $300 dollars cheaper in 2008 than it is now. My son and his friends (and some adults) had a ball on this each summer. It was very hard to keep clean and store (plus we were lazy) but other than that it held up quite nicely. My now 11 year old son would have a birthday party every year and at least 25 kids would have hours of fun jumping, sliding and splashing on it without serious incident.I understand some of the critisism because well its plastic and it is going to have holes.

They were very excited about it and loved the curved slide and pool at the bottom. This is nice because I have children of different ages that can enjoy different features of the slide. The little ones can play in the pool and the big ones can slide. But....The second time we got it out, we noticed a 4 inch place where the seams had come apart; the thread had just ripped or broken and there was a hole leaking air. As a result, the slide didn't inflate to the maximum amount and the water leaks out of the pool. This is not the type of problem that can be patched; it is a defect on the slide. We are contacting customer service; we'll see how far we get."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SLIDE WORTH THE MONEY!!","review":"Probably out of all the slides this one is the best.

The cheap ones break down too quickly. Buy 3m spray adhesive. Turn on the air pump and with a wet hand feel around the areas that get the most traffic like ladders, exit areas or water cannons. Mark the leaks with a marker and deflate. Get the areas very flat and cut the tarp to at least a foot bigger than the areas that leak. Spray the tarp area fully with the adhesive and wait a few minutes until its very sticky and stick on the tarp patch. Wait a day.

I tried several recipes in this book, and I did not like any of them.One of the recipes, \\"Tempeh-stuffed cabbage rolls\\" were so bad that my husband and I threw them directly into the garbage.

I couldn't even pronounce some of the ingredients used in her recipes, let alone find them in a grocery store.

If you've decided to go macrobiotic and have access to ingredients like rutabaga and arame, this book provides you with many recipes, but for me it was totally inapplicable. I was expecting the guidelines for macrobiotic eating and cooking that I could apply to different ingredients at hand and thus was very dissapponted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, OK for macrobiotics, I guess...","review":"Somewhere in this long title should appear the word \\"macrobiotic\\" so that people who are not interested could avoid buying the book!Macrobiotic food is boring and even though often it has no meat or dairy, it is by no means similar to the lush and mouthwatering vegetarian or vegan food.The book is huge so I thought I would get a bit from my money and I tried several of the recipes... to results from mildly disastrous to really bad. I've been a vegetarian for more than 15 years and can usually cook to the applause of meat-eating friends so I don't think the fault was mine...As someone else said, if you a vegetarian and looking for a book with lots of recipes... don't bother with this one.

The index is poor.Finally I would guess that most people are wanted to use these test in Excel, so Publishing tables of P vales Is not the best way - I would have liked a section on how to duplicate these results using Excel.Having said that however Its a Valuable reference - but requires thoughtfull review - the tests are not that accessible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Aucune démonstration mathématique mais ouvrage infiniment utile à avoir dans sa bibliothèque.

The acting is brilliant and the story line has a strong foundation of truth and meaning. It definitely made me cry, however, the length of time spent \\"moving rocks\\" in this movie is way too long. I think the director got his point across after the first 10 minutes of it. The ending will hit you hard for sure, and the \\"love scenes\\" leave you with something to think about.

But I do know it had a big impact on me. The way it was made, the way it showed you this world they lived in and how it was so quickly taken away. The movie isn't perfect, but for some reason I wouldn't change a thing. McJagger is dead on as Greta/George, and Clive Owen is amazing. Actually all performances in this film were excellent. And the title \\"Bent\\" is a word that means homosexual (as opposed to \\"straight\\"), and certainly not referring to the shape of the main character's penis as was stated in a previous review. I don't know where they got that idea. the movie is hardly so shallow as to focus on such an insignificant thing as the man's penis when the emotional scope of the film is simply epic. 5 stars. see it if you can handle holocaust 'downers'"},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING & SAD","review":"It's a compelling story of 2 men in a consentration camp that are not able to share a love; but find a spiritual way of doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptionally well cast movie","review":"I have read some of the lengthier reviews for Bent, and I see they contain a galaxy of spoilers. I will just say that this English/Japanese production is one of the most powerful films I have seen - the casting is wonderful - Clive Owen is a revelation and Lothaire Bluteau - the French Canadian actor who starred in Jesus of Montreal gives a heart rending performance. As others have noted, the theatrical roots of this story are evident - but this is no bad thing. I think the production is excellent - from the scenes of decadent (pre-) war Berlin, to the atrocities committed on the train to Dachau to the harrowing scenes at the concentration camp itself. This is a film you will want to watch more than once - which is an extraordinary achievement given its confronting nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on Realism","review":"I'll be fair and say I only watched this film once and this critique is an initial response.The film falls short on realism. I found the sense of humor in Clive Owen's character weakens the overall seriousness of terror one would feel in concentration camps- exspecially when history books and documentaries exposed such bleak, morbid pictures of this ugly time period. The film editing doesn't pick up speed and has a dragging effect. However, the outdoor shots (buildings, ect.) add dimension and realism to the film. Overall, good attempt but needs polished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bent","review":"This is the first - and so far only - example I have ever encountered of a film being better than the stage play on which it was based! I saw the orignal production on Broadway with Richard Gere. I shied away from the film initially from the prejudiced position that it would be inferior to the play. We can thank the producers (or the stars, if it was not by choice) that the film was not created until a time when social mores allowed a truly honest presentation.This is an extraordinary film, with extraordinary performances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting a good story...","review":"The premise grabbed me; it is about a gay man sent to the concentration camps during WWII. I was expecting some really good things from it; \\"gay entertainment,\\" as well as having the Nazi attrocities against gays highlighted for starters.To say I was disappointed would be an understatement; it's a bad sign when I wished the SS would just shoot the main character and make it a movie about his boyfriend instead! I despised the main character...he was everything I could possibly dislike about a person all rolled up into one.He's a multi-time cheater on the same person, a coke-head, a jerk, very promiscuous, makes (unwelcome) decisions for other people...throw in some domestic abuse and you've just about covered it.He's someone I'd be ashamed to know...needless to say, it was impossible to sympathize with his wretched character.

You'll see what I mean if you waste your time with this one. 90 minutes of two guys in their pyjamas carrying rocks back and forth from one pile to another.

Although Mick looks FABULOUS in a sequined dress."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bent every day, until the end of our days.","review":"In a decadent, Nazi Germany of the 30's an almost total urban and social ruins portrayed this film in the beginning. They must live almost as rats, and in a bohemian atmosphere, a theatre without roof and its walls dilapidated, the music and dancers with a drag queen hanging in a trapeze rim, the scene is mostly dantesque. The central character (Clive Owen) is excellent. He makes this film takes a portrayal of the naked human nature in its almost dehumanized levels to get an introspective revelation of its need of love and liberty. Even today, there is Bent every day, until the end of our days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"The story of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany is one that deserves to be told. It is a pity then that this attempt falls flat with its inability to decide whether it wishes to be a movie or merely a filmed play.Self-consciously stagy, burdened with a tedious, over bearing avant-garde wannabe of a score, and saddled with a script devoid of any nuances, subtleties, or refinement, the film works only as a vehicle that will play only to those already aware of this aspect of this devastating chapter in human history.Nice try. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocks in My Head","review":"At the films opening I really did not know what I had gotten myself into, then quickly the film takes a dramatic turn when a HOT SEXY GUY has a tragic run in with the Gestapo and our lead is on the run. The Movie had a couple of Very Powerful Scenes (train scene), there were times when the Dramatic Tension built to a Powerful Crescendo and some Strong Scene Structure, Scripting and Directing, however I really felt this movie did not reach its potential and I felt that Clive Owen performance was a bit weak. The Movie had much potential; however it fell a bit short of expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince Leopold: The Untold Story of Queen Victoria's...","review":"I have read many royal and historical biographies, but I must say that this book did not live up to my expectations.

The story line is so ridiculously far fetched - President of the US on the LAM due to world-wide conspiracy from a witch-like cult who has a mad scientist Dr. creating viruses that kills people while masking the fact that they were poisoned.Other annoying aspects of this book besides it being so far fetched:1. The President of the US and a civilian who befriended him calling each other 'COUSIN\\"2. Writing out the entire name and title of the characters who were in the conspiracy (it was a list that takes up practically a page!)3. So unbelievable (sorry can't let this part go)4. The unending and unnecessary details5. Timestamps of events occuring SECONDS apart! and with the same characters!Even though i paid $1 for this book during a used book sale, i still think i overpaid!I cannot believe people liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"How anyone can give this book a four or five star rating is beyond me. The only reason I gave it a two is that it does have an occasional moment of compelling action and a conspiracy scenario that in other hands might have been made into something semi-reasonable from a plot perspective.Even as fiction it is totally unbelievable, as are most of the characters. You alternately want to laugh or throw the book in a garbage heap. It really is a weird concoction of disjointed and ridiculous plot lines that all culminate in a rather predictable ending (which out of shear frustration I skipped ahead to read about half way through this way too long book).In summary--not on my recommended reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-numbing Repitition","review":"Why, oh why, did I keep listening to this? The wooden characters would all do something, then think about what just happened, and then tell someone what just happened - using the same words each time does wonders for memorizing the story, but little for the craft of story telling. And, the pedantic use of the full title and name of the list of conspirators - every time they were mentioned - was outright painful. It felt like the story was written for people with no memory of what just happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time with This Book !","review":"I went into this book based solely on the description on the dust jacket. Big mistake! After about 20 pages it became painfully clear that the writer lacked any imagination and his writing any originality. The book read like a cliche festival but I had hopes that the plot line would improve and the pace pick up. No such luck. After clawing my way thru about a quarter of the book I gave up. The characters are so unbelievable that it simply wasn't worth going any futher. With writing this bad you don't care how the story ends or what happens to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no, what's happened to him?","review":"When I started reading Allan Folsom's THE EXILE, I couldn't put it down...when I did (after reading it in two marathon sessions) I ran out and purchased (not at Amazon but at full retail price) THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and THE CONFESSION.I was amazed by his intricate plotting, the continued surprise twists, the breakneck pacing. Here was an author who was a clear master of the genre - imaginative, facile, talented.Sadly, The Machiavelli Covenant was disappointing. I kept waiting for it to take off, and it never did. I was 200 pages into it and I asked myself \\"When is this going to start\\" It was interesting, but didn't generate the excitment his other books did.I will definately read his next book when it comes out, I'm just not salivating for its pub date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"An unputdownable read! One of those books that gets you from the first couple of pages and keeps you wanting to read right through. For those of you readers who loved the DaVinci Code, I know that you'll also love this book. Full of action, surprises and adventure. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly conceived and written","review":"As a huge fan of Mr Folsom's 1st book - The Day After Tomorrow - I anxiously awaited follow ups from him. I am beginning to believe that the author has but one good book in him. This book was akin to reading a book written for children - but poorly even for that audience. Implausible is putting it mildly. The dialogue is extremely poor.Extreme disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the Editor?","review":"I picked up this book largely because of its title and thinking it would be a kind of roman a clef with regard to the Bush administration. Instead, I found it slow moving beyond belief with too many extraneous details and descriptions, 90 percent of which could have been eliminated. With proper editing, this could have been a winner. Instead, it reads as though someone let Folsom loose with the word processor with no restrictions. A disappointing read. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and skimmed the final 1/4. The translations of foreign languages insults the intelligence of the reader. Either don't translate them or don't use them. I don't actually read a great deal of fiction. This book didn't change my mind about taking up reading so-called \\"thrillers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and poorly written.","review":"Like other readers, I was blown away by the start of The Day After Tomorrow. Folsom's following books have been less engaging, and this one is truly BAD. Like another reviewer, I think it smells of laziness. Not to mention poor copy editing - there are more misspellings and punctuation errors here than in a third grader's book report. The characters and plot are unbelievable, and I quickly grew tired of Folsom's plotting structure: 1) extreme inexplicable event happens 2) character spends five minutes thinking about it, wondering what the hell it meant. Reaches no conclusion. 3) plot moves on. 3) repeat until end of book.Folsom and Dan Brown ought to start a competition to see who can write the dumbest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy effort","review":"I suspected that the book was lazily written due to some plotting issues and repitition. However, the horrendous translations confirmed my analysis. Beyond bad, they actually made me laugh out loud. Free translation services are not advisable.\\"Mosca encima\\" does not translate \\"Fly over\\" except in the most literal sense. It means fly (insect) above! The jarringly bad translations made this novel difficult to take seriously. It is just too easy to get a valid translation.Having said that, Mr. Folsom did keep my attention well enough that I read to the end. It was tough going at times to finish the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced thriller!","review":"I could not read fast enough. It grabs you and puts you right in the middle. This was right along the lines of Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code; a book you just don't want to stop reading. I found it very interesting that I could look up the locations in which are referred to in the book and get a better visualization of the images so brilliantly written of throughout the novel. This made the book that much more intense! It is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Please - Get This Man a Copyeditor!","review":"Amid other chronically annoying grammatical and style errors, the author's repeated use of the description of someone speaking \\"in a sotto voice\\" rather than \\"sotto voce\\" was one that fairly leapt off the page. Add to the poor writing a plot with numerous unbelievable twists, characters who often behave in ways that make no sense, and a \\"setup for the sequel\\" ending unworthy of even my 7th-grade daughter's stories . . .The book is readable, if only as a way to kill time, because the characters are generally well-drawn and engaging. If you're expecting anything more, I think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly ROTTEN!!","review":"Whew! The fact that a book as wretched as this can receive favorable reviews from so many sources has given hope to my own literary aspirations!I was a minor fan of Folsom's until I had to suffer through this latest endevor. Previous reviewers have this book nailed - the characters are wooden and completely unbelievable. The premise is ridiculous. We have the president of the USA running around with a former cop turned gardener who uncovers a major plot based on a few whispers from a dying friend.The plot does not develop in a natural way, but is forced and amazingly contrived through countless repetitive discussions, memories, and deducements from the poorly drawn characters. The writing is lousy. If I have to read one more \\"conversation\\" between \\"Richard\\" and \\"Victor,\\" I'll shoot myself.Spare yourself this read - go get a root canal instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing, poor argument, worst editing","review":"This is one of the silliest books that I have ever read. The argument is weak (to say the least), the flow horrible and the characters' decisions plain dumb. There are numerous repetitions all over the book and a few times I thought that my bookmark was misplaced! This story could have been contained in 80 pages and still wouldn't be worthy to read.It is also infuriating the lack of interest that the editors have shown on this book. I guess that the author may enjoy showing up how good he is in using language translators to put a few (simple) sentences in Spanish or French... but it's the editors' task to make sure that these sentences are correctly written and that they make sense!! Not to talk about the names of some secondary characters more Hispanic than Spaniard...If you can get your money back when you buy a defective appliance I wonder why Forge Books shouldn't reimburse us for this very defective... novel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wholly\\" annoying...","review":"Am I the only one who noticed (and was very annoyed) by his over use of the word \\"wholly\\"? It's like he attempted to jam this word in as many times as he could just because he liked the sound of it and it totally turned me off. Flat characters, ridiculous amount of repetition (really, the entire list of conspirators EACH AND EVERY TIME???) and dull scenes that were either totally preposterous or just plain stupid. 100 pages less and this book could have gotten two stars from me instead of just one.That being said, I've been a huge fan of Folsom up to this point (The Day After Tomorrow is one of my favorites) so maybe he was just having an off day/year with this one. Don't be completely turned off by him until you've read The Day After Tomorrow...a much better read and truer to his style than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers who were less than happy with this book. I gave the book two stars instead of one because the idea was good - people in positions of high power run amok - but it was poorly executed. I think Mr. Folsom's editor didn't do him any favors. The book probably would have been good had it been pared down by about 150 pages or so, and the editing stinks. I finished the book, but only out of sheer will power. Spend your money elsewhere. For sure, wait for the paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGH! Not the follow-on The Exile deserved","review":"I really liked The Exile. This book stinks. You ought to read the original which he tried to emulate: Seven Days in May, by Fletcher Knebel and Charles Bailey. Now that was a classic! This book isn't. I never did get the connection between all the elements and if you read the book you will see what I mean. I also found myself skimming long passages that related to nothing except more pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever written","review":"I patiently suffered through 531 pages (out of 690) before I through the book in the trash. I kept hoping that the repetitive tedium would eventually turn into something interesting. I would recommend that you avoid this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book. Save your money.","review":"Allan Folsom and Forge Books have taken what might have been a good premise and turned it into an amateurish exhibition of truly bad writing and editing.A knockoff of the DaVinci Code and the Illuminati Trilogy, this slow-paced piece of nonsense exhibits a singular lack of attention to detail, particularly in the (mis)use of foreign languages.Call me a nit-picker. Maybe I am. But when I read things in German orSpanish that are totally wrong, I find it difficult not to be repulsed. Mr. Folsom would be much better served to just write in English and not put in pretentions misquotes on foreign languages.It's a total piece of crap.

I tried 3 different brands. Pictorico from Adorama here through Amazon, also Inkpress and Legion, both from B & H. The Pictorico was so thin, I could see right through it, before and after I had printed on it. This is not a canvas that can be stretched, or mounted to a board without showing its nasty back. The Inkpress had a wheat color back and was heavy. Unfortunately, it curled after printing and even more after sealing and glazing. I doubt that it will adhere to anything, but will probably stand up to stretching over stretcher boards. The Legion was by far the winner for me. It printed true, is a good weight for mounting or stretching, and the colors were rendered nicely. Given the small universe for cut sheet inkjet canvas, I hope this helps. BTW, the Pictorico was by far the most expensive of the three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio KL-100 Label It printer","review":"I have owned this little gem for about two years.

Plus there are short questions at the end of each story/poem, so you can have a good review over what you've read. The book is not that large; it's a little larger than a half sheet of binder paper, so not too heavy, but bulky because of the condensed size.

I would suggest putting down a tarp before putting the tent down to minimize the insect activity. I started to return it but the struggle to fold it up and get it back in the box was too much for me.

It does not have a narrative, linear story to connect the many interesting and exciting battles together. It is written as a first person view of what was happening within this one officer's eyes on a very small scale and has none of the sweep, suspense or bigger story of the battles he describes. Roughly half the book reads like \\"the 12.SS was withdrawn and the 4.PG was pushed foward.\\" If you want to know about the SS, or tanks, or the battles in Russia, there are much better books by professional historians that will introduce you to the many characters, plans, and other interesting matters.

The victories described in the early part of the book are contrasted with the fight for survival at the end.

They fought in the worst cause in modern history (with the Confederates of the American Civil War a close second), slaughtered scores of millions of people and should all have been hanged. The overwhelming majority of WW2 books are written from the pro-Nazi point of view, fueled by the Cold War hysteria.A fine example of instant whitewash is Werner Von Braun: from SS Major to icon of NASA. Never mind the 10,000 defenseless civilians his rockets killed, or even worse, 10,000 more who died in slave camps to build his rockets.There was nothing noble or partiotic about such beasts in human form.The only value of the memoirs of these vicious thugs is for us to identify them much quicker before the next generation rises up again.

What's good about this transmitter is that it does have decent sound quality, considering its size and the range of FM stations that it broadcasts. It does have a 2.5 mm audio input jack. (It would have been more useful if it were a 3.5 mm audio input jack.)Pretty much, though, what you see is what you get. Remember that it's for mp3 players, and not for flash drives. Just because you can store mp3 files on a USB flash drive does not mean that it contains the instructions to transmit music through the FM transmitter. All in all, it's not the best and it's not the worst. For the price, if you have one of those no-name mp3 players, this could be what you're looking for. Also, do make sure that you read the instructions and convert mp3 files to the appropriate KHz rating for optimal playback."},{"rating":"2","title":"MP3/WMA FM Car Modulator with USB Port/Audio Input","review":"Reception is lacking - not sure if this is typical on these types of devices.

All but the most benign nudity is gone and so is the more agressive violence. This leaves it a pathetic kiddie version of the original. Unfortunately, there probably is not an original copy left as in the old days, once the movie was cut for TV then the original was often discarded as no further use could be seen for the complete movie.

I really liked the energy of the band on stage. The sound isn't anything new, but this cd has a couple catchy songs. Overall this studio recording is average at best. The instrumentation on most of the tracks is tight, especially the drums. There is something extremely annoying about the lead singer's vocals. The band's songwriting skills are what turned me off the most. Did you guys get your song writing inspiration from Dr. Seuss?

They are very good for a local band for sure, but on a national level really fall short.First off, almost every song sounds the same-very similar vocal paterns on every song, same song structure, same dynamics ect...there was really no need to write more than one song.They fall in with the generic radio nu-metalish (on the way light-side though) crowd but their music seems even more annoying than most of that crap.

There is really nothing original about this 311 meets Incubus sounding band. In fact, the vocalist tries real hard to sound like 311's lead singer and fails miserably. The guitars are far from being heavy (as my friend suggested) and the vocal harmonies are just average (stick with 2 part harmonies my friends). The lyrics sound like they were written by a 10 year old. The first track on the cd isn't bad, but i'd definetely suggest checking out 311 before Agents of the Sun.

I'm sure it would mix really great in a blender if you are making a smoothie (which this vanilla flavor would be great in a fruit smoothie).

I would give it four starsThis on the other hand is so funny I laugh every few minutes.It's just what I needed. I suffered my second miscarriage in eight months three weeks ago. I wanted something that would make me laugh and let me know that we all go through crap but we come out the other side! This book delivers. It's so my life and I love that she is candid as I am. She lays it all out there and tells it like it is. She's human and vulnerable just like the rest of us.I am a mom and I can relate to A LOT of her stories dealing with men and children. I know she doesnt' like making new friends (she says so) but I would love to just hang out with her (she's clever, funny and bruatlly honest!!!)I am so glad I picked this book up. It has made all the difference in a really sad time in my life. Laughter is the best medicine and she is a freaking drugstore!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and fast read","review":"She has done it again. Couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud.

I agree that the books cover random subjects, but life is random and I can relate to and appreciate everything she talks so openly about.

This one has next-to-nothing about kids. In the chapter about Jenny's ex, the author emphasizes that the divorce was amicable and the ex-couple is friendly.

This book is another stepping stone in the downsliding career of someone who had great potential (and thankfully still does). Ms. McCarthy's talents at comedy which were in witness in the failed sitcom \\"Jenny\\" (though the show's producers and editors failed to allow her to \\"Lucy-like\\" develop laughs out of situations), and her other two books.This book is a poor attempt at humor. Case in point (and only one of many examples) is a chapter on the darkening of one's rear end exit spot (hopefully my description is clear enough while remaining tasteful...hers in the book is not). The humor from this sharing is practically non-existant...unless you are the type to stand around a toilet bowl with a friend, look at what is inside, and laugh as you flush it down.For those with even minute discerning tastes...save your money on this one, while simultaneously sending Jenny the message: \\"you are better than this.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Money","review":"Although I'm a huge fan of Jenny McCarthy's books, this one was disappointing.

But, reading it is wicked fun! What is it about having a baby, that suddenly gives everyone and their brother the right to bombard you with unnecessary advice? What is it about motherhood that makes us feel oh-so-guilty 24/7? This book will certainly help mothers lighten up (and believe me, we all need it). Jenny tells it like it is, and she's quite frank as well as absolutely hysterical! I felt like I was overhearing a juicy conversation with her closest girlfriends - she just says things that no one has the guts to say - and I admire her for that. I hate to say it, but it's great to see a beautiful star so humbled by her inept attempts at parenting.

It features the band's classic lineup: Alan, Alex, Mauri, Elias and Charly. But most of this disc consists of the original recordings of the group's greatest hits, which already are available on other CDs. And of the two new songs, one is a remake of \\"Vuela Vuela,\\" which is hardly imaginative or original. And lead singer Alan's voice doesn't sound anywhere as strong or potent as it used to -- perhaps part of that has to do with the fact that he's seen smoking in the booklet, so maybe taking care of his voice is not a priority for him. This could have been really special; instead, it's a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"We bought this faucet in the summer of 2009, the handle its loose now, and hard to use.

The first time I put it in my cd player I thought I had accidently gotten a defective one where they put some other bands cd in my case. I kept popping it in and out and trying to figure out why I was listening to what I would call \\"pop\\" music. I understand now that this was some wild attempt on Opeth's part to do something different but if I had wanted to listen to soft, spineless stuff I would have ordered The New Radicals or Lit.Booooooooooooo on this one. I LOVE the rest of their stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"First off, i will listen to this album again for the third time and see if my opinion changes, if it does I will change my rating: in the mean time, this music is annoying and outdated! i want to smack the guy who called this black metal. Oh, and yes, I do have one of their other albums, which is way better than this one, so i do like some of their stuff (I got blackwater park) anyway, i never wanted to eject a cd out of my player so bad in all my life. There is no emotion in this music, its terrible! Its not angry, its not sad, its not happy, it does not have a good beat, good riff, good anything! If you like \\"we had joy we had fun, we had seasons in the sun\\" maybe this is for you, then again, even that song is better than this stuff...did I say that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Opeth fan. I enjoy both there \\"softer\\" songs and there heavier songs. I was intrigued when I heard that they were going to release a album full of all soft slower songs. When I purchased this album and threw it in, I was extremely disappointed. I was expecting to hear songs reminiscent of Credence, A Fair Judgment, the slower parts of songs like Deliverance, When and The Drapery Falls ect. What I got was this bunch of crap. This is a worthless release by one of the best bands in the world. I can only hope that this is not a sign of things to come.I recommend purchasing any and every Opeth album released before this one and leaving this one on the shelf. It is not even worth the curiosity, it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?

I have been an Opeth fan since Blackwater Park and was ever so shocked to hear them do an ablum of such emotion, darkness and hope at the same time without the screams and grawls which has it's place and time. It took me awhile to adjust to the mellow and yet dark theme of this album and once I did I could not stop playing it over and over again. It's too bad the music scene in the states is so pathetic and it's not about talent anymore but rather the $dollar sign$. I am so thank for the Sweedish and the talent that continues to come out of Sweeden. Buy this album not because of the other Opeth albums that are Death/Black metal but rather for the mellow, dark, and emotion behind it. Listen and let your many emotions flow. I hope they do another album like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School Opeth Fans Beware!","review":"Old school Opeth fans would not have expected this. I certainly didn't. While the bands musical talents are definately showcased in this album it most certainly isn't something I wanted to spend my \\"death metal\\" money on. I have come to expect classical interludes and clean vocals in Opeth albums but I didn't want an entire album of easy listening music. I'm a huge fan of Opeth (and Bloodbath) and I appreciate all good music but have to say that I was expecting and/or hoping for something with a punch. Opeth did not deliver the sounds an old school Opeth fan would expect on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic work of art","review":"The beauty of Opeth lies in the band's ability to conquer many different styles of music. This album, while it lacks the variety of their older releases, maintains a constant flow of mellow songs that prove to listeners that Opeth can master these as well as they can master the heavier material. The first track, \\"Windowpane,\\" is the best (in my humble opinion) and is one of my favorite Opeth songs to date. \\"To Rid The Disease\\" is another good song. In all honesty, they're all good songs, but those two stand out to me. If you're looking for anything heavy, then this is not the album for you, as the vocals are all clean and the heaviest parts are about as heavy as what you'd find on a Genesis album. But if you need a nice long break from the maelstrom of metal, then this album is definitely for you. Nothing extreme, but nevertheless, Damnation is pure musical mastery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"An absolutely stunning album! The allure of Opeth is multi-faceted, but a key ingredient has always been their ability to intermingle haunting melodies and beautiful clean vocals with a more brutal, metallic approach. This album, seen as a companion to 2002's Deliverance, focuses solely on the clean vocals and less on the death vocals and riff driven, metal sounds, to create an amazing album that is positively trance inducing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music does not get better than this","review":"If you are looking for a death metal CD, this isn't it. Regardless, you may not find a more impressive set of tracks then those found here. Its the preverbal \\"pop it in and forget about it\\" CD. Every track is amazing. I personally think its there best outside of maybe Blackwater Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique And Powerful","review":"This is the BEST space metal CD ever done! It is lyrically as dark as any death metal but musically closer to Pink Floyd and early King Crimson. The band uses some fascinating chord progessions and time signatures to create a consistently creepy atmosphere that is second to none. This CD is really an art rock masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"A wonderful mellow CD. This is Opeth's expermiental CD and I must say that I am impressed. The CD is softer than their usual songs. Many Opeth songs either start out with death metal taste and move into softer melodic moods, or start out songs soft and then turn into harder songs. However, this CD is mellow. I think it is wonderful to listen to when pondering things or if you just feel like chilling and listening to something soft. The band did a fantastic job of playing the instruments in wonderful ways that make the music flow smoothly and keep you interested. Though everyone has a different opinion, this CD felt somewhat comforting and mentally soothing to me. I highly recomend it to all but make sure to sample songs but be warned Opeth is known for having long songs so 30 seconds is not enough time to really appreciate the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is just mind blowing. This is art to the finest degree. I got this album recently after deciding to venture into the serenity of the best death metal group I have ever heard (and truth be told, the only death metal group I can stand to listen to).Listening to this album was mind blowing. I loved every single second of it. Somehow Opeth manages to fit crazy riffs and solos in this amazing album. What really did it for me though, was the DVD. Lamentations makes this album 50,000 times better than what it already was. If you don't have this DVD, get it now. Opeth are one of the best live bands ever, and they make this album come to life.I have hated death metal my whole life, I am a very devout progressive metal fan and crazy guitars impress me a lot more than angry vocals. Opeth is the one exception to the rule. They are simply amazing. Get this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark.","review":"So.. Wasn't sure about buying this album 'cause people say it sucks? That it is not METAL? Well, that's correct. There's no single scream by Mikael or even a heavy guitar. Does this make it a bad CD? HELL NO!I truly love Opeth's metal stuff. Really, I do. And I find this CD complete perfection. But.. Let's just cut the crap and ask THE question about you liking this CD or not.Like heavy stuff, uh? That's all? All you care about is headbangin' and wearing black t-shirts? If yes, then don't even listen do this CD. BUT. If you like Opeth brutality AND some dark, beautiful, atmospheric, clean and cool music, like Anathema, for instance, then, yes, buy this CD.I assure you. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting turn","review":"This is not your typical opeth album. Instead of the awesome black and prog mix we are used to we get treated to a very smooth and murose album. All the songs on this album are soft and melodic but don't let that stop you from picking it up. I think it would have been interesting if they put one hard song in there (like they put one soft in deliverence) but still no complaints. 4.5 stars if you are an opeth fan it will not dissapoint. favorite songs are track 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Softer side of Opeth","review":"Woah...I just got the cd and listened to it twice in a row. If your an opeth fan this abulm is a total mindtrip. No heavy growls or crunchy gutairs that you would expect from a death/black metal band can be found. Now I was unsure at first if I was going to like an Opeth album that was totally \\"soft\\" but it blew me away. Opeth fan knows that some of their best songs are fairly \\"soft\\" but this abulm totally indulges itself with acustic dark melodies and modern \\"trippy\\" stylings. The vocals despite the lack of growling are some of the best Opeth vocals to date. The vocals are chilling yet soothing at the same time. I bought this abulm not knowing what to expect and found myself completly blinded by it's brilliance! Opeth actually changed their typical sound and didn't sell out. A must for anybody not just opeth fans. This could be the best ablum of 2003 in any genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I don't own anything else by this group but I really like this album. I guess this album is completely 180 from their other heavier stuff, but this is a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was unfair to them!","review":"I saw them in concert and I was disapointed. Still think the singer talks to much and does not keep any surprise in his show. Honestly, that cd is wonderful. I would not venture to go in their previous albums as they are too heavy for me but this one is mellow. Favorite song: hope leaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Never saw this one coming, though in retrospect it was almost impossible to miss. Opeth have always been heavily influenced by strange, 70's music so it shouldn't have been a surprise when they released an album emulating it. Pretty good mellow music, nice to listen to when your hung over. There is nothing heavy about this cd so people who only like the harder aspects of Opeth should stay away. If you like the softer parts of Opeth than you'll love this cd. Steve Wilson, from Porcupine Tree (an obvious influence for this album) produced the disc and does a bit of singing on it. Sounds nice, if you like this album I would recommend checking out Porcupine Tree since their entire catalog is music similar to this. Overall, Damnation is a nice change that hopefully won't be permanent."},{"rating":"2","title":"After three (3) listenings........","review":"It's the Heaviest SLOW Metal Band I've heard.For sure buying a couple more of Opeths CDs.Specially after reading that this is their weakest or softest Release.None the less, being a Porcupine Tree fan & quite old (50 Years, for this generation).I'm impressed and loving Opeth.The more I listen to this; the more INTENSE it becomes (regardless of the acoustic dominance), incredible musicianship.Patience is \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" (from a Gentle Giant).Keep it up Boys NICE WORKJust 4 Stars till I hear the other CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth - the other side","review":"Purchased this based on the bands association with Steve Wilson of the band Porcupine Tree. I heard the instrumental passages and the mellow vocals of Mikael in some of the longer Opeth songs. It was the death metal \\"singing\\" style that turned me off. BUT all of the other stuff was great. This Damnation album is a tad too mellow for their core fans but it's a great standalone listen for anyone who loves good music. I wish the band would abandon the cookie monster vocals and just go straight forward singing - his voice is so great to begin with. Anyway - LOVE THIS ALBUM ! BUT IT !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wait a minute---","review":"opeth is my favorite band out there... and yet i give this four stars, not five, like all their other albums. dont get me wrong, this is a wonderful album in its own right. however, theres something missing: diversity. i would be saying the the same if they did an all \\"heavy\\" album, with no clean guitar sections or serene vocals. what i like about opeth is that thier songs are constantly changing, always keeping the listener hooked to what will come next, and they never disappoint. they broke that with \\"damnation.\\" but really, ho hum. they tried something new, and theyve done a VERY good job. my only criticisms are my own personal little gripes which, sadly, hold me a back a little from this album. anyways, this is brilliant, this is OPETH."},{"rating":"1","title":"wut is this?!","review":"i only got to listen to the samples, but it sucks!

I love it, but it takes time to get used to it. To Rid the Disease, Closure, and Windowpane are my favorite tracks. If you love the hard, metal Opeth... this album is not for you. If you love all sides of Opeth, i suggest you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"For all fans of the softer interludes and passages residing in most opeth albums, especially still life and blackwater park, I highly recommend this cd. Hypnotic, trance-inducing, psychedelic, emotional... Simply put, this album is an incredible testament to the musicianship, eclectic nature, and overall genious of this band, possibly the most talented progressive outfit in music as a whole. Fans of opeth, pink floyd and 70's progressive/psychedelic please, i beg u buy this cd. It will become one of yer most cherished. An absolute and amazingly beautiful 40+ minutes of mind tripping sonic bliss. Music lovers take note, if like me and u are into everything from soilent green, cryptopsy, and dying fetus to soulive, medeski martin and wood, and 70's era miles, to the roots, then this needs not to be passed over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth delivers another Masterpiece","review":"Opeth is the best unknown band in the world. If you read this review, you must get this album. Opeth, traditionally a death metal band from sweden, goes a completely different direction with this album. With beautiful melodies and instrumentation, this album has it all. Lead singer and guitarist Mikael Ackerfelt is a genius. In previous albums he has shown the ability to change from death metal screaming to singing with no problem at all. But on this album he leaves the blood and gore at home, and delivers a stunning epic. MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth Damnation is Damn Good!","review":"Damnation is the softest album Opeth has put out. It's haunting melodies with Mikael's beautiful voice over acoustics is just awesome. If you like Opeth, but dont really care for the low growls or \\"black metal\\" side, then you'll love this album. Definately a must have for any fan of Opeth or mellower music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet.","review":"I own every Opeth album, and \\"Damnation\\", oddly enough, easily stands as my favorite. It is absolutely loaded with phenomenal melodies, tones, and lyrics. If there was ever going to be a \\"soft metal\\" album, this is exactly what I would want it to be. It perfectly creates an atmosphere that IS Opeth. It's dark, dramatic, and emotional. There's some wicked guitar work throughout the whole album. As I mentioned before, the tones they've managed to create are perfect for the mood of this album. If it weren't such a lame thing to do, I would absolutely try to rip off the sound of this album for my own band, and stick with it forever. I would fail anyways because I don't think anyone that isn't Mikael Akerfeldt can create masterpieces like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damnation","review":"Damnation being Opeth's 7th studio album and is a radical departure from their death metal sound and has here created a sound that is very reminiscent of progressive rock which was a sound that was very prevalent in the 70's. For a band not to stagnate it needs to experiment with its sound. Sometimes it fails but in this case it is one of the better albums I have heard in a very long time. The lyrics are well-written and the melodies are almost dream like in quality. Damnation met with great reviews from the critics. Allmusic and Sputnikmusic both gave it high marks. The booklet contains all the lyrics and a list of whom plays what.5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"Imaging A Perfect Circle and Alice In Chain's Jar Of Flies having a child together.

The songwriting is terribly simplistic and not progressive at all. Some songs have catchy melodies like \\"In My Time Of Need\\" or \\"Hope Leaves\\" but after the 10th listen you'll be bored to death by even those. This is more in the vein of Nick Drake, Sting and Neil Diamond than progressive-rock/metal. Nothing wrong with that if it wouldn't go under the moniker of a band who gave us prog-tastic masterpieces like \\"Still Life\\", \\"Morningrise\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth's \\"mellow\\" album","review":"is a very conscious effort to incorporate the influences of both metal and the progressive bands of the late sixties and early seventies (such as King Crimson) into a powerful noise. This is, to put it simply, a masterpiece.While long time Opeth fans will see this as a departure (for better or worse) from the death metal that is their metier, for newcomers such as myself this is either a brilliant stand alone album that ought to have been the album of the year, or the doorway into Opeth's past catelogue. In either case, Opeth is a force.Buy this CD and the live DVD \\"Lamentations\\" and hear and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another perfect cd by the greatest band ever","review":"Once again Opeth has managed to deliver and bring forth an amazing album despite the fact that its missing the growling vocals and distorted guitars. However, this cd is just as enjoyable and still contains the brilliant songwriting that I have grown to love from each release. Every song is excellent and most have an eerie mood to them. Overall this is one cd that you must get if you are a fan of Opeth and don't be turned off just because they went with a more mellow approach on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!!!","review":"Of all the opeth albums that I own and heard this one is probably my choice for the best one. All of them are outstanding in their complexity, but on damnation they decided to change the pace to mostly an acoustic album with no gutteral vocals and barely any distorted guitar. But what good about this album is that it is the most intelligent of all of their albums and it seems that all of the elements are put exactly where they were supposed to be. No misproportions. very balanced and the songs are PERFECT! this creation is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to be true.","review":"This could be the best album that came out in 2003.

We have all that MTV rubbish polluting our airwaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Opeth experience","review":"I bought this album on a whim having never heard Opeth, but having read acclaims to their work. It sounds like it could have been made 30 years ago. I hear the King Crimson album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" and early Sabbath stuff like \\"Planet Caravan\\" and \\"Solitude.\\" The songs are mellow and the guitars sound great. The drumming sounds great. The mellotron and stuff really give it an aged feel like that first Crimson album. I later searched the Internet for other Opeth stuff and was surprised at what I heard. I now realize this is a special release and uncharacteristic of what I've heard on the \\"Deliverance\\" album. If you like Opeth before, this may be different for you, but it sounds great. Give it a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrivaled.","review":"This is without a doubt the finest album of Opeth's amazing musical lifespan. Haunting, filled with melancholy yet strangely soothing, Damnation is a true work of pure passion. To think back on past releases, it is hard to imagine that this is the same band that released Deliverance and the fantastic and cathartic Blackwater Park. From the opening track, Windowpane, you will be lost in the Opeth's music, and trust me it is a trip well worth taking. Mikael Akerfeldt, whose painfully deep growling has littered their previous albums, now chooses to embrace the lighter side of music, melody, and meter. Every song on Damnation takes a journey, and each path taken is a different one eventhough we always seem to wind up back where we started. Not to sound too cliche, but this album truly is a work of art, and one that every music lover should add to their collection.Standout Tracks (All of them are, these are my personal favorites)WindowpaneIn My Time of NeedTo Rid the DiseaseHope Leaves"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical? don't be.

It seems unlikely that nobody wanted to revive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Football in the deep-South is taken as serious as religion.","review":"Great story!

Its a very visual song (if that makes any sense) but I think you have to hear it to understand.If you are not familiar with this band, I would compare it to Belle & Sebastian's newest record \\"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\\" - both have a variety of singers (both male and female) with that sunny 70's AM rock feel. I really love Sasha Bell's voice, so I'm also planning on getting Essex Green's \\"Long Goodbye\\" to hear her contributions to that cd.I rated this CD 4 stars out of 5 because I enjoy it and it definately has many strong songs, but there are a few songs that I'm not entirely fond of.

I'm not talking about Limp Bizkit! I'm talking about Mortician. Here are the things that make this album just as horrible as their last one. The first thing that makes this album horrible is that the bass and drum machine are to loud. It is hard to hear Roger's guitar playing in some of the songs not that it matters any way, because all he does is play on the same frets in every song, but in different tempos and sometimes different tunings. The second thing that makes this album horrible is Will's bass playing. Just like Roger Will plays the same frets in every song, but in different tunings and tempos. Don't be tricked into buying this album, because it is horrible and I wouldn't even consider it music. Mortician have a brilliant use of horror samples, but horrible music if you can even call it that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dying of laughter","review":"This is very amusing, no really this is a great joke that went way too far, but it's very funny.this is the funniest thing i've heard since ill mitch or vinnie vincent invasion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch lyrics of this karaoke cassette on your TV!","review":"All you need is the Super K player.

I actually ironed pleats into my curtain when I first got it so that it hangs like a drape when pushed back against the wall. The pleats do not wash out. It is quite lovely. Don't worry about stains -- mine has never been stained. I wash it about once a month. If it even looks like mold \\"might\\" grow on it I used bleach in the wash, even though the tag says not to. Never had a problem. After I shower I let it hang opened on the outside of the tub. It can be pushed back again the wall in about 30 minutes -- dries very quickly.

When I further read the reviews at Amazon, a couple of them also said the liner was weighted. I was looking for a liner with weights at the bottom because when I turn on the shower, the curtain leaves the side of the tub and wraps itself around me..... very annoying! So, I purchased the curtain in good faith and installed it and when I took a shower, the liner wrapped around me. After speaking with a representative at Amazon.com, I returned the liner, thinking it was defective. A replacement liner was sent. I installed it and jumped into the shower. The curtain wrapped around me!! If you are looking for a liner that will stay against the side of the tub rather than wrap itself around you, then don't get this one.

Scientists are NOT going to be convinced by his arguments (it's certainly not but together in that fashion), but correspondingly, experienced energy healers aren't going to learn much about physics, or the natural world from that viewpoint, either.The title's great ... but it's sort of downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories","review":"This book compiles dreams from Saint John Bosco's memoirs, which makes it easier to read than the memoirs themselves. I especially enjoyed, Deadly Nooses, A Fiendish Elephant, Death's Messenger, The Snake and the Rosary, to Hell and Back, and Two Columns in the Sea. This is a good starter book for anyone interested in the dreams of SJB. His dream imagery is out of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and priceless graces are waiting in this book","review":"Those who have faith shall receive great and priceless graces if they read about these dreams especially: The Snake and The Rosary, A Pack of Monsters and The Two Columns in The Sea and make use of graces God shall give them after the reading.What a book for what a price! The same holds true for \\"AA-1025\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even a child can see the shortcomings","review":"Bottom Line: get Walking with Dinosaurs, which is superior in every way. My six year old son was interested in what the paleontologists were saying, which actually was fairly interesting, but the reconstruction of the dinosaurs themselves was beyond lame--it was dishonest. How often did we see the same shaken camera technique, the blurred head with teeth and red eyes, the plastic looking tongue? Too many times. It didn't fool my son, and it just annoyed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"you send me somthing that does not fit!","review":"i purchused this item for a 2002 ford explorer xlt and the item did not fit!

Thanks for nothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess video must see","review":"Our four year old daughter loves this story! Although she has viewed it several times she still asks for it first during our designated childrens viewing evenings. This film teaches the importance of individual responsibility. A princess is really more than a crown. Action speaks more than words. A young lady is expected to be more than an ordinary kid. The reward is two fold in that she will be respected by all who know her. We are looking forward to more videos based on the Jewel Kingdom books! We now have ten in our library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching....","review":"We rented this video from the public library and my 3 and 5 year old girls couldn't get enough of it. It is certainly geared toward the female crowd though with princesses, jewels, and some sentimental singing. And it's a little corny for the parents to sit through too, some really low budget special effects and makeup, but overall it was a good family show. We can't wait for them to come out with another episode. A brief synopsis; The Princess Roxanne and her three sisters are about to go through the coronation ceremony when Roxanne decides she's not ready to rule the Red Mountains and runs away. Out on her own she runs into the Darklings, evil creatures who want to rule the Jewel Kingdom, and they steal her magic ruby pendent. She also befriends Hapgood the Dragon and two jewelers from the Red Mountains who show her what it means to be a real princess. In the end the rag tag group uncover the Darkling plot, rush back to the palace and save the day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do the book justice","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this video especially because all the other reviews were 5 stars. The acting and make-up left alot to be desired. The Ruby Princess sang well, but others in the cast did not. My husband left the room because he found it so nauseating. My 9 year old daughter seemed to enjoyed it, but fast forwarded through most of the musical numbers. She said that the video did not give as much background on the story as she would have liked. The story taught a good lesson and did not contain anything offensive or controversial, but I don't this makes up for the poor quality of the production. In the future we'll stick to the books and let her imagination draw the pictures. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misjudged the size","review":"There was nothing wrong with this item.

If you enjoy very funny historical romance, then I can highly recommend this author. This quick book was funny, heartwarming, very adventuresome and as a bonus-a paranormal romance as well. The introduction of Merlin in the story was inspired. The hero and heroine are enjoyable and realistically portrayed. The hero is a hunk of an alpha male-who never sways from his arrogance-but he has good reasons for doing so. The heroine is great-beautiful, adventuresome and brave.A very fun book that I recommend you pick up ASAP:)5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this puzzle","review":"My ten year old daughter and I have put this together twice, and we love it. It's challenging, with lots of different colors and unique shapes to sometimes confuse and sometimes to offer hints. And it's not TOO hard for her to join in (in fact, she's much better at it than I). And at the end, the picture is lovely, with fun \\"hidden\\" images to find.

Yes I know it's a bunch of episodes put together to make two feature films, but be thankful George Lucas bothered to put it on dvd. If we were able to, we can march to Skywalker Ranch and protest Mr. Lucas to actually putting the entire series on dvd (including the Great Heap episode).May the Force be with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays like an old Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie","review":"I also was a huge fan in the 70s and 80s. I bought this dvd for my kids to introduce them to some of the greatest characters and stories in SF movie land. What a disappointment. It plays like an old Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie. The dialog is disjointed, rushed, and difficult to follow. The scenes are one jam-packed action event after another. I felt like it was running at 125% fast forward. They attempt to incorporate extra information in the dialog to tie the stories together and it sounds like a rushed blathering with a confusing jumble of space ships taking off and landing, characters running here and there, getting captured and escaping, and good guys and bad guys changing sides like flipping pancakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars DROIDS finally released on DVD.","review":"It's great to see Droids cartoons re-released on dvd and whats even better is that they are in movie format.Not sure why some people dont like this, it makes perfect sense, as 4 episodes made up one story. I hope they release the remaining 4 episodes and The Great Heep episode real soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Star Wars related thing I didn't realy care for.","review":"This was really bad. I had to force myself to finish the first \\"feature film.\\" I now realize why this only lasted a short time. There was really no point. Compared to the Clone Wars this was bantha poodoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"When I was younger I actually remembered watching this show on TV. I was big into star wars at the time and even though the music was sort of cheesy, I loved it. Naturally I purchased it the moment I saw it in stores only to be hugely disappointed. They had completely redone the music including that great TV opening theme that I loved. I then immediately grumbled at the $10 I wasted on it and then gave it to my friend's kid.As for the animation, it was targeted for kids so do keep this in mind as you view it. As adults you will find the animation to be simplistic, but your kids if they are into Star Wars will love it. As for me a fan of the original, it was a huge letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD","review":"The droids cartoon in the 1980's ran for 13 episodes (along with the Ewoks) and had a prime time special called The Great Heep. This IS NOT it. This is the same kick in the teeth they pulled with VHS. They put four or five episodes together and call it a droids movie. If you want the best release of droids (or Ewoks) look for the old tapes from the early 90's that show only two episodes back to back. Even this was really lacking, but you got to see the droids with original credits and music. Why can't they ever do it right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth $10 not $40, small and difficult to read","review":"Wow was this a disappointment. The pictures make it look as though this is a large bound book with fantastic drawings and handwritten notes from Dickens. It is not! This is a tiny, tiny book with tiny print and unreadable notes and drawings. I might have been happy to buy this for $10 but $40 is outrageous! It will be returned immediatly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Orginal","review":"I wanted to read the orginal Christmas Story to see how it compared to the movies and plays that have been made from it. Sometimes interesting seeing what changes they have made to the story to make the ghosts able to be played by people. The ghost of Christmas Future is much more scary in the story, but he does not seem to be Death as they have shown him in the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great to have the classic so easy to use.","review":"Used it at a Dickens dinner where the whole book was read. This was the classic version, not adjusted or abridged so it was perfect. Very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"What can one say about this beautiful timeless classic? I have lost count of how many times I've read it. And each time I read it, I fall in love with it all over again. I am not that familiar with Charles Dickens (something I need to work on!), but his prose is simply captivating. Each detail is described with simple clarity, from the horror of Marley returning from the grave to the humor of Scrooge's encounter with Bob Cratchit at the end of the story. Further, Dickens makes the characters as real people, and as the reader you can't help but get swept up in their lives and learn to love them, beginning with Scrooge's loving nephew Fred, and the innocent Tiny Tim, to the original \\"Grinch\\" himself, Mr. Scrooge. Emotions range from joy to fear to sadness and back again, and it all concludes with that heart-warming and unforgettable quote, \\"God bless us, everyone!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome Christmas read","review":"Loved the old English and enjoyed the original descriptions used by Dickens. Will read this every year at Christmas as a tradition to mark the holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected at all","review":"While it said original manuscript and pictures, no pictures were included. The style looked more like a rough-draft than a book. Complete lost of $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Images of Dickens's handwriting are illegible","review":"I got this for a family member who is a huge Dickens fan, wooed by having his handwritten comments shown in tandem with a printed version. To be honest, I'd seen a similar book online at a \\"high end\\" retailer and came over to Amazon to see if the same thing was available cheaper-- sure enough this book undercuts the other one by $20 plus shipping but there is no comparison in quality. I ended up returning this one and paying more for the other one, and that would be my recommendation for someone looking to get one like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture of paper shredder is not the same one I got","review":"When I received my paper shredder PS60-2 I thought it was the same one that is pictured next to their description. How wrong I was. If I knew it wasn't the same as the picture I would not have gotten it. Buyer beware. They show you one thing and sneak a second one in. Amazon isn't what I thought it was"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is missing one thing","review":"I owned a shredder before this and it was a cross cut shredder, and when I bought this one, I guess I didn't pay attention to the fact that it wasn't a crosscut shredder. I like the cross cut because the paper is shredded to the point where nothing can be recognized. Needless to say, this does a good job, you just have to make sure that you put the documents in horizontally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Wads Up Beyond Shearing Wheels and Blocks Shredder,","review":"We got this as the new office shredder. It is much quieter than our old shredder. My 1st shot at using it I fed in what looked like appx 12 sheets of paper - not perfectly straight. They kinda went sideways and I experienced exactly what the previous poster claimed as far as the paper bunching up within the shredder. This is a common defect of this shredder.

Fantastic! Can wait to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel","review":"Sal must've been weaned on the tales of Calvino, Borges, and Marquez. A fine weaving on ever sadder tales tie into this meta-fictional novel. It contains: a celestial war, a luchadore saint, a women whose lovers are scarred with papercuts, a fictional history of Rita Haywoth, excessive bedwetting, mechanical reptiles, swarms, gangs of flower pickers, lead poisoning, depression, the death of many sea creatures, perpetual stench, strange motel regulations, voodoo, the Vatican, the Swiss, a meandering order of monks, mind shielding, murder, financiers, stigmata, immolation, and kite flying.It is written with Calvino's prose and Danielewski's stylistic tricks. Tricks man not be right word as the actual format of the novel does add to the story's worth; I suppose he uses the page as an apparatus.See also: if on a winter's night a traveler, One Hundred Years of Solitude, and House of Leaves"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing","review":"Reading this reminded me a little of Murakami's The WindUp Bird Chronicles in terms of the surrealism. There was a time when people were made of paper. A boy's cat is butchered and the grieving boy revivifies his cat by making paper organs and becomes the world's first origami surgeon. A woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. A baby Nostradamus is born. A man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to America with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker. It's a story of lost love, of planetary wars, the struggle for free will and ethnic issues.Certain chapters are told in columns which, to me, adds to the experience.This is not a book for everyone, and I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already appreciate bizarre stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel I've ever read","review":"After suffering through an array of confusing storylines that don't seem to have anything to do with one another as well as numerous spelling and grammatical errors, I was sorely disappointed to discover no real resolution for any of the characters involved. At first I was impressed with the author's use of real facts as metaphors for love until I got to page 168 and discovered that after all his talk about astronomical bodies, he doesn't even know what a supernova is, assigning it a description that couldn't be further from the truth. If you want to read a great love story that will tug at your heart and really bring forth powerful emotions, check out Theodor Storm or Leo Tolstoy. Don't waste your time with this new-age drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"This is a wonderful book for modern mages and witches. The book appealed to me because I was searching for a more indeep, no -new-age crap type of book about runes. This is a very refreshing take on the subjects of runes and magic indeed.It's chaos magic in the sense of ecclectic modern magic, not in the sense of mind-game egotistical magic.I'd like to read more books like this one, never mind the label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Was This Trite And Unremarkable Book Published?","review":"This was a bad read; the plot is an old one and the author did not do it justice. I found it boring which, for a horror story, is unforgiveable. I have read two other books by this author that I liked a lot but this one was amateurish. It simply does not hold the readers interest and there is no one to root for or- for that matter - to identify with. It's odd that the authors other books could be so good and this one so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Delco Part - but missing an option","review":"First let me say that this is a genuine AC Delco part not a generic replacement so that is a big plus. There were no issues with the fit and quality of this product .However I did have a minor issue with an option being missing, even though Amazon indicted that it was the correct part for my specific car. This part was used on a 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix GT V6 and although the wiring harness fit correctly it was missing a pair of wires and associated connector for the ignition switch key release solenoid. In this particular case I was able to salvage the wires from the old connector and insert them into the new one and everything worked fine.So if you are a Grand Prix owner be aware that the solenoid release option is not there and you may need a different part number than this.Other than that issue, this wiring harness worked great and fixed my crazy intermittent blower motor, automatic headlights and rear defrost all in one fell swoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of credibility","review":"Apart from the detailed accounts of V weapon launch site, the book contains mostly circumstantial evidence and a staggering number of assumptions especially in the use of rare materials. It lacks credibility in the key areas particularly uncorroborated evidence of nuclear tests by the Japanese & the Germans. Credibility is also lost when the author starts discussing Nazi UFOs & underground power plants running for 50 years. There is too much rehashing of information from previous books & not enough following up on interesting leads, this book will be improved by reworking for a second edition.As well as the lack of follow up on some sources, there are important additional sources that the author has omitted.

The overmatched heroes (levels 3-5) will find themselves in an horrific underwater adventure that plays more like an espionage movie than an AD&D adventure - flashing blades and spells will get them all killed in a matter of minutes.

Without a good understanding of the Church and Christendom, there simply cannot be a good understanding of the texts or of the society. Even most contemporary Roman Catholics have forgotten (or never understood) topics such as the medieval concept of sin (mortal, venial, original), monasticism, fasting, the use of psalters, rosaries, breviaries, etc. To fill in the knowledge gaps in these and other areas, I use and strongly recommend this book. I discovered it 8-10 years ago at Cambridge University where it was wildly praised and widely read. It may not be a book you'd want to read straight through (though you could do so because it's not that long), but it is one that you'll want to consult again and again as a reference text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused about the importance of Measurement in Schools?","review":"I'll have to read this book several times more. However one only needs to get to about page 5 to appreciate that the topic of space and measurement is complex and encompasses far more than mastery of dividing kilometres, litres, hours etc into handy sized bits. This book might help explain why space and measurement gets a separate rating on your childs report and may give you some hints on how to interest your child in the subject.It is, I think, a common misconception that this part of Math is for those who will do practical things in the \\"real\\" world. But where is the \\"real\\" world? If something is so small that we are not able to measure it can we be sure it exists at all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"This book sparked my interest because I am one who also wonders about the mind's relation to the physical world. Penrose believes that the physical mechanism behind consciousness underlies new physics relating to quantum mechanics. He also believes that this new theory is not computable or programmable. This book is meant for general audience, no physics background needed. In fact the conceptual physics are actually explained well by Penrose. So if your curious, or an actual mathematician/physicist attempting to understand consciousness this is a good book to get some interesting ideas from. Its not polished out, the writing is in lecture style, but I like this, it gives a better down to earth feeling.

That being said the album does try and go after the Hendrix sound whcih is a respected trait for it but I was not really that impressed. The album has some good to it but too much changes to his great hits was not needed.

If Hendrix were still alive we would thorw it out with the garbage. Artsits like Clapton, Santana, Hooker, and Vaughn, make decent efforts but still should not have even attempted. Tribute albums almost always suck, and this one files right into line. Artists like Cee-Lo and Lenny Kravitz (who has immatated Hendrix for years, very very poorly i might add) have no business on this album at all. Hendrix was more than a legend, he was a God. and for these artists to make these terrible covers is blasphemy.

The search for the Lost Fountain mirrors the search for meaning and healing in each of their lives. How they get there will keep the reader turning pages.

The plot's pretty unimaginative, with the greatest disappointment being the ending, but considering it the anti-war era when the film was made, not unexpected. You'll wince when you see a character attempting to return to Allied lines wearing a German officer's uniform, which is incredibly stupid, considering that, with the simple expedient of removing the jacket, the German army desert uniform of this period looks substantially like the Allied uniform.

A couple of basic accounting courses are all you need to read it. It is redundant. It didn't tell me anything new although if I were a sophomore in college then maybe I would have learned something.

I couldn't see any compression artifacts - like I did at the mid-quality setting. Apple better announce support for AVCHD soon, or I may go crazy not being able to edit this gorgeous footage. I love the menus - the user interface is very intuitive. Being able to shoot the game, and erase the at-bats where nothing happened was awesome. 40 minutes was plenty when you can erase bad takes. My only annoyance: Safeco field has a retractable roof, the light was a combination of field lights, and natural light. Twice the camera decided to change the color-balance setting on its own.

I considered waiting but decided against it -- from what I can tell, that camcorder has the same imager and video data rate as the SD1, so I'm guessing the increase in recorded resolution (to 1,920 x 1,080, from 1,440 x 1,080) will not make much of a difference in image quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronic","review":"Some reviewers go on about what a great laugh this is.Sorry, but if you want a laugh watch Seinfeld or something.Horror should be horror, and this feeble excuse for a horror film doesn't cut the mustard.It's absolute rubbish of the first order.

The movie lacks any type of suspense. Half of the killings happen without the killer ever even being seen at all. The direction and acting were very poorly done. This movie could have been a lot of fun but the majority of the movie is a bunch of people just sitting around talking with no action. The sound quality goes in and out all the time.

In my opinion (and Jessica Treuhaft's, too!) the best biographies are those in which all of the subjects views and actions are laid out, warts and all, and the reader is allowed to make his/her own judgement. Pryce-Jones editorializes constantly.I am certainly not disagreeing with the fact that there was much that was despicable about Unity's political views, associations, and actions.

When this happens I have to pull the top off and clear the blades with a leatherman. It's extremely inconvenient and somewhat messy.I never had this problem with the cheaper smaller model and I haven't really changed my shredding habits all that much.My theory is the cross-cut blades are prone to jam.

To be fair, I bought my shredder used - it worked for about a month. Then it jammed one day after shredding 2 sheets.I opened it up and realized (just as others have said here in the previous reviews) that my shredder jammed because it collected paper pieces between the clamps that hold the metal shredder. These clamps are plastic and broke a soon as I loosened the screws to release the clamps. Now its rendered useless since Fellowes doesn't have replacement parts.I would NOT buy this shredder new or used. Even if it lasted 5 years, the steep price for a new one is not worth it. Its going for $160+ new now so it would cost me approximately ~$32/yr. You're better off buying a lower-end one for $20-$35 each year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shredder - GREAT customer service","review":"This shredder does a great job and does it quickly and quietly.

No matter how I try to manipulate the unit into compliance, it won't adjust so that the arm is free.Cheaply built, impossible to adjust to compensate for bad manufacturing, and thus not worth the money.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not able to be used","review":"This scale is a joke. It didn't fit together, there was no customer/technical service, and the instructions are vague and poorly illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful intro video","review":"Roustan is by far one body artist that stands out among the rest, his step by step instructions are very easy to follow using live models... DVD worth every penny'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD","review":"This DVD is a must if you want to get in to body painting. I didn't know much about body painting but really wanted to try it. Did some research on line, learned about Paul Roustan, saw his portfolio on line and was blown away. I bought his book and this DVD. The DVD walks you through different techniques from basic to advanced and is easy to follow along. It's been a few weeks now but I find myself coming back to the DVD the better I get. I haven't attempted the advanced stuff yet but it's cool to see what's actually possible. Again, great buy, thanks amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"scan and cartridges","review":"Format for scanning directly to email is not automatic. Converting to the email program that you use can be cumbersome, and may require tech support. I do not recommend using replacement cartridges from discount suppliers. They may look the same, some may work and some do not. Better stay with the Brother cartridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this expensive maintenance hog!","review":"Owned the unit for a little over two years. Always paid the big bucks for Brother ink cartridges. Last year, I had to replace the print head which must be done at a repair shop for a cost of $.... Now the printer can not correctly sense the amount of ink in the black cartridge. The printer says the black cartridge is empty after only 20 pages. And the printer message is more than just a warning. The printer software requires replacement or it will not work. And Brothers tech support's only option is to take to the repair shop. I'm not going to waste any more money on this printer."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-68200c9a"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/15.md","filePath":"people/15.md"}'),L={name:"people/15.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
