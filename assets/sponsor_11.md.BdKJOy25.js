This was not too difficult to assemble, however, the screws for the right hand support do not fit leaving the support very loose. It feels as though one is leaning forward, making it difficult to use the machine effectively. Per other reviews, placing boards under the front end of the machine does help correct the problem, but when looking as the machine in use one can easily see that the foot pedals are angled down in the front when in use. Please do not be a naive as I was when buying this item. It is awful and a complete waste of money even if the price is only a little more than $100.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK","review":"I had this thing for only a few months and it fell apart.

The machine eventually made a grinding noise that sounded like it needed lubrication, and the friction made it unusable.So, thinking it was an isolated incident we bought another one last week. Well, I am sorry to say that the machine made the same clicking noise right out of the box. We can still use it, but the noise is very loud, just like the last one we purchased, and we expect this one to wear out just as the last one did in a very short time.We tried to save money but you get what you pay for I guess.

One or two others are required to help, hopefully.....I have a friend willing to come by and get it together, but I don't expect much, frankly...Since I have not yet used it, I cannot be a real critic of it's use.

It is a waste of money and space in your house. This elliptical trainer is manufactured with defects and not worthy one. After a month, you will start hearing sounds in the pedals and the wheel will become so tight that you can do anything with this elliptical trainer. This product should be banned and the people who bought should open a dispute against this seller or the seller should recall this items and give atleast 50% of the money spent to buy this.

So please dont buy this if you really care about your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine for the value","review":"This machine provides everyone in my home a really good workout. We all love it. You do have to tighten the bolts and screws though that's just because after continual use they become loosened.

Or, the device has a cache buffer too small to offset slower transfer rates of 802.11b.In my setup, the music server PC is connected to a wireless bridge. The wireless network is infrastructure where communication between two network nodes goes thru the AP, so the streamed data traverses two wireless segments before reaching the WMLS11B box. With this setup, the WMLS11B playback freezes every few seconds, which makes the device totally unusable.

I have to re-enable the SSID every time I turn the device on to get an initial connection. From then on, streaming music stops and starts as though the connection were spotty, even though my laptop (also on the wireless and sitting next to the device) is streaming beautifully.In addition, the WMLS11B will only receive Internet radio stations that broadcast as strict mp3's. Which means no .pls, no .asx, etc. Unfortunately, this is what most streaming formats are in.Luckily, the speakers are powered and are connected to the wireless device by standard RCA jacks.

It doesn't really give a person any new ideas on customer service it just reminds them what good service is.

I thought that the author did a very good job in both retelling the history of Nordstrom and conveying their way of conducting business. Through telling the story of the Nordstrom family, giving examples of good customer service, and sharing personal stories of Nordstrom employees, the author does an excellent job of helping the reader understand what Nordstrom is all about.

It is about 1.5 inches in diameter on a disproportionately light chain. I was expecting a pendant perhaps less than 25% the size. Size is a critcal element left out of the add. This is an important consideration because of the taste of the buyer and the style that best suits the wearer. I returned the item disappointed and out the cost of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap!","review":"I purchased this for my girlfriend, and even I was shocked at the low quality of the flower pendant. It is much larger than I expected and the metal looks like steel. The pendant and chain did not match well at all!.

It has been on my wishlist for a while and my M-I-L gave it to me for Christmas. I love it. I don't see any problem with the chain, it's fine so far. I love the size, but I knew that it was large thanks to the dimensions given and the reviews.I'm not much into high end jewelry, but I don't like \\"cheap\\" looking crap either. This is just a nice piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful pendant.","review":"I purchased this for my mom for mothers day, she loves silver.

It found an outlet in his books for children and camaraderie with the 'Inkspots'.This is a revealing biography because it is written for young people. A suitable vehicle for finding out about the author of the Narnia Chronicles! I found it much less precious than other books on Lewis - probably because this was written by a fellow native Northern Irishman, rather than a fan.It also wrecks several pompous academic careers by including a letter from Lewis to a young girl, explaining what each of the Narnia books is about.Moving, heartwarming and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Safe","review":"My girlfriend was adamant that I purchase a snorkel vest because I go out in the water by myself for hours at a time. The vest offers high visibility and provides you with pockets so you don't have to leave anything too important on the beach... like a hotel room key. Once when I used it without a rash guard, I got some chafing. I have had some issues with getting air out of it while in the water which caused me to have to come up sooner during a dive, but I feel that is a trade off for a vest that could really do me some good if I got caught in a situation that I needed to use it for floatation. This is a nicely made product that can still fold down nicely for travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are wonderful","review":"This product is very attractive and looks great on top of your counter.

Further, even though I moisturized, this stuff went on streaky (even with a slightly damp sponge). Granted, it's been a while since I've used powder foundations, but there was a time when Oil of Olay was making one and it applied like a dream (sort of creamy, even though it was a powder). I got extremely light coverage with this, and no real avenue for building in areas where I might need a little more. It just streaked and was hard to control. My experience with powder foundations is that you can easily get medium coverage, with the option of sheering it out. This product went on streaky and very sheer. I could buff out the streaks, but was left with ultra sheer coverage...akin to a tinted setting powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"I use this brace to keep my knee warm to prevent injury while running.

It uses a 3/8\\" drive but it doesn't \\"snap\\" onto the wrench so it can fall off easily. As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem and it will save you a lot of time when changing your oil filter.The prongs can be adjusted by holding onto the \\"base\\" and turning the socket with a wrench. The prongs rotate around the base depending on the direction you turn. The way it works is that at the widest position, turning in either direction will cause the prongs to \\"close in\\" on a certain direction. That way, as long as you have the prongs closing in on the proper direction, when you are trying to remove an oil filter, it will grip harder as you turn counter-clockwise. If you have the prongs closing in on the wrong direction, then turning counter-clockwise will actually widen the prongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this, too easy to slip","review":"This is bad, very bad.

Those who remember Louis Lane's fine performance of the complete ballet with the great-sounding Cleveland Orchestra will be surprised that this Russian Orchestra sounds more deftly controlled in this music. Fedoseyev has treated the various ballet scenes like important musical episodes, and if they seem a bit freighted thereby, somehow he makes it a passing problem, and not a real annoyance. The result is that it seems to be what it has -- to my ears -- never seemed before: a tight coherent work from start to finish, A great bit of craftsmanship and creative re-jiggering somehow having to do more with accent than any thing else.

I am sure I could spend a lot more money for Zeiss, or something, but, these are top of their category. Would be good for hunting trips, too. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hunting binoculars","review":"These seem like a very good product. They work pretty well in dusk lighting. They have a nice long range and an easy focus knob to set your distance. They seem to be of sturdy construction and also have a nice neck strap, carrying case, lens covers, and a tripod mount.The downside is that they are very heavy but that is the price you pay for good quality long range binocs. It would be a nice to have if the knob was labeled with the focus distance so you'd know how far out you were focusing, just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on these","review":"I got these as I love the Nikon Monarch rifle scopes.

The first of the two albums would unquestionably be worth getting on its own--great live music from an under-represented period of the band's history, although personally the jazzier, more saxophone-heavy Crimson isn't to my liking as much as the later, proggier bits. When you stick the second album into the mix, it's a crap shoot. If you really like early 70's King Crimson improvisations with lots of saxophone, you might like that second album. Personally, I've listened to it two or three times, generally wishing halfway through that I hadn't stuck it in the cd player and only listening the whole way through because of some combination of laziness and determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not contain the title song","review":"If you're jonesing for the classic song \\"Ladies of the Road\\", the CD you want is _Islands_.

Now, we'll both go outside: me to jog, and the bike to the garbage.Like others said, it started dropping black shavings; then it squeaked; one day, it just seized. I took the casing apart and loosened some bolts, but there are so many broken parts (ripped belt, destroyed plastic), it's not worth any more of my time.I will miss it. But I will buy a better one next time.I wonder why this bike has so many positive ratings--either they were written during the three-month honeymoon phase (the length of the return policy), or the writers didn't ride it long enough to find out.Amazon is good for books.

It is easy to assemble etc., etc. My problem is that I have used this bike for a total of 23 days. On most days I have burned 900 calories per day. Low and behold I need a new bike because there are some rubber pieces/ashes falling out of the bottom of the \\"wheel\\", and now every time I pedal there is an annoying jerk that occurs, which messes up my speed/time.

After a problem with shipping (the wrong product was sent the first time), I put it together, but didn't use it for several months. I started using it regularly, riding an hour every other day, about a month ago. First there was a knocking sound, then a hideous squeak that went away after a minute or two. Today, after a month of use every other day, the bike completely locked up. Since it's been more than a month since I got it, I'm out $140.00. Save your money.

One cannot be too critical, considering what she paid for this product. The assembly was straight forward and went well. The X-Bike will definitely exact the exercise you need.

Fairly easy to assemble - you have to search for all of the parts though so look thoroughly. I'm thinking of getting one for home too - because it is quiet enough to ride and watch tv too without turning up the sound. Around $159 with shipping - definitely affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"This foldable exercise bike lived up to its description and for this price, its a steal.

The seat is not adjustable such that I would have liked one more drilled hole so the seat is higher by 2 inches. I am 5 foot 6, but my knees are still bent a lot on the highest setting. I called the company and am waiting for a call back from the company, hoping for some assistance to see if the seat can be higher. I spent three hours assembling the bike, which was eventually successful. I called the company who said I had an outdated instruction manual. The instructions were not matching all the parts. It referenced spring washers, which are no longer used. Customer service gave me some assistance. The Nyloc nuts took a lot of effort, over an hour, to thread with the wrench.

This bike satisfy's all those requirements. Also I want to note that assembly was extremely easy. I was expecting something much worse.

Then it began making a rather dreadful grinding noise with intermittent cracking sounds. Eventually it stopped working altogether.I was frustrated by the lack of information on the internet. Apparently the manufacturer does not have a website. Because the bike worked for awhile, I exceeded the thirty day return period.

Save your money and buy one from a company that stands behind its product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has gone down hill. Do not buy!","review":"I bought one of these bikes 5 years ago and had great experience with it. I gave it to my girlfriend a few months ago and bought a new one for myself. It was not the same!! First the tension on it was very hard! I liked to ride my old bike on higher tension. I could only ride this one on the lowest settings! Second, it was much louder! Finally, just a week ago, there was a grinding, grating sound causing uneven tension (from hard to harder). Felt like something broke.The bike is essentially unusable at this point. I only had it for a few months, riding 3-4 times a week. I contacted the company with my problem and received no response.Do not buy this bike, unless you find an older used one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, but remember you get what you pay for.","review":"This is a good bike if you're just looking to be active. Basically, it works how I wanted it to. It doesn't take up a lot of space and I can use it 30-60 minutes a day to get some kind of exercise.The difference between 1 through 8 on the resistance dial is negligible.The seat is incredibly uncomfortable after about a half hour. I would suggest a different seat or a good cover.Assembly of the bike was simple. The computer that came with the bike turns on, but it doesn't seem to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality product","review":"I put this bike together today. It was simple to build, although some of the small parts that were supposed to be included, like spring washers for the seat, were missing. I used it for about 20 minutes, and it had a good tension range and the monitor worked for speed, mileage, calories. However, I put my hand on the monitor and it fell off, with the thin wiring inside popping out of the monitor, with fine wires broken inside so that I cannot repair it. It broke very easily, and basically makes the bike about half the value of what it would be if it was able to give mileage and speed info."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bike!!!","review":"This is a great stationary bike. It is quite small and noiseless. I was able to put together very quickly, no tools were necessary.

It appears to be well built, takes up little space, is easy to assemble and extremely quiet. The seat--like most factory seats--isn't too comfortable after a while and the \\"Sunlite Cloud Nine Gel seat cover\\" I purchased doesn't make much of a difference--(but it does fit perfectly). Think I'll try some memory foam under it. The computer is adequate if you're not too \\"techno\\"--I got the bike to get exercise not for another computer. The The bike itself gets 5 stars. It probably isn't adequate for the super serious cycler in training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money!","review":"The bike is great, exactly what I wanted.However, the small bar that locks the bike into a folded position came bent...so it doesn't go through all of the holes...and I cannot find a manual that came with it.

My husband is an engineer so I lucked out. He had to completely rework the flywheel part of the bike because it would not even turn! The ball bearings on pedals are bad as well.This bike is made for a tall person, which I am not. The lowest setting on the bike seat is still a bit hard for me to get up on and I am 5ft 1in.

The computer did not work. I called the company on the shipping label. After two weeks of phone calls I was sent a new computer. It still did not work. I called again and was sent another computer. Then I was sent a new bike. None of these computers work. I contacted the company. In order to get a refund I need to return the bike and they will deduct the shipping charge - $42 for a product that doesn't work!.I think this is a terrible product and the reviews are inaccurate and misleading. The 'gift' has been a headache for me and a dissapointment for my children; I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing it.

I was worried that it might be dangerous so I looked into it. It turns out that it is made in China. Given China's history or selling products made of unregulated, dangerous materials that they sell to the US I grew more concerned. I contacted the manufacturer asking what the bike is made out of. They rudely said steel and plastic and that there is no such thing as an American Made exercise bike. It clearly is made out more than plastic and steel so I guess I just get to wonder what is causing the toxic smell from the bike. Also, a 43 second search in the internet proved that there are lots of exercise bikes sold in the US that are not made in China.I would not reccomend this bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied, but it's not perfect.","review":"Other reviewers had problems assembling the bike, but I thought it was easy to set up. It looks cool and takes up very little space. I was surprised with how sturdy it is. It is virtually silent and pedals smoothly. I am satisfied. However...- The pedal radius seems a bit smaller than normal. So if you are taller than, say, 5-8, you might have problems with this and the max height of the seat post.- The seat is hard. A seat cover would would be nice, but I just fold up a small bath towel and sit on that.- There seems to be a huge jump in resistance between settings 2 and 3. A previous reviewer said that they get a \\"casual workout at 5\\". Wow. I must be really out of shape.Summary: I like it and would buy it again. But if you are taller than 5-8 or a serious cyclist, you probably want a different bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy.","review":"I bought this bike because it was handy and portable and didn't take up much space.

This is not a long term piece of equipment. The computer is extremely inaccurate except for the timer. It is still pretty heavy, so don't expect it to be light to move around. So, I don't know.

My only complaint is the extremely hard seat that is uncomfortable for me even with a padded cover and a pillow on top, which causes me to have to limit my riding time to about 20 minutes or a certain part of my anatomy goes numb.

If your wanting the same quality of the mp3 as the tape this is not for you. as it is playing the cassette the sound is great but when you play back the mp3 it is pretty bad. I think they need some static removal and something to fix the speed. The mp3 sounded more like Alvan (of the chipmunks) than it did of Dolly Parton or Rodger Whittaker.

They jam away and then tell you everything they did was within that scale....but that's it. Then there's a theory section that just boggled my mind. This DVD was a major waste of money for me. All it did was make me angry. I thought I was coming along on the guitar. This just made me feel totally incompetent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"This article spends little time on the cross cultural aspects of leadership.

While the narrative has a nice flow, and the characters are developed well enough to appear three-dimensional, the author's research of the names of the Soviet historical figures borders on amateurish, considering the way they are spelled. The premise of the book is also not particularly believable; in the years immediately following World War II, Russian people were too thoroughly indocrinated and feeling too patriotic to undertake any type of action that would undermine the power of the nation as a whole, and in this light the assassination of Stalin, even in such covert manner, would be highly unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lantern Painting","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter to paint for her mom and for her aunt for Mother's Day.

I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could get the metal piece since it wasn't worth the money to return it.

St. Louis deserves to be spotlighted much better than this.

The dialogue is not terribly clever and the characters aren't very interesting. Plus halfway through the murderer is revealed and the book muddles itself into a standard woman-in-jeopardy climax.

Don't know the longevity of the fix since I haven't used on my own vehicle, but the concept seems to be a good one. Make sure you have a pair of pliers to set the plug. A cheap pair will do just fine. You can also use them to pull any nails or screws from the tire when needed. Just throw them in the carrying case the kit comes in. The carrying case is great and heavy duty.I enjoyed using the plug gun, but from the video I guess the plug handle kit will work just as well. Oh, there are two kits available. One with the plug gun and one with a plug handle.

The stories are often fantastical, with a great deal of horror and humor, but they speak to real situations, fears, and life. Recurring themes are of dreams (especially nightmares), family, hands and fingers (or the absence of such), types of cloth, coincidence, sex, and death. The characters use each other (most notable in the story of a soucouyant), often acting cruelly. They then have philosophical discussions or meditations about good and evil, right and wrong, god, and the purpose of life. The stories do tend to end abruptly, with a sense of things left unfinished, unsaid, and unexplained, but this serves a purpose and leaves one feeling unsettled rather than unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks like painted plastic","review":"While I love the picture of what might be a real metal prototype,mine looks like painted plastic.

To make it look like the heads will produce a faster shave, they reduced the area of the outer ring to make room for two additional cutter rings inside the outer ring.The problem? The inner rings have a slower surface speed than the old, larger area, outer ring. So you actually have a smaller high speed cutter area while the inner rings end up pulling your beard hairs when you try to shave as fast as your old Lift-and-Cut shaver.Why can't you buy the old lift-and-cut heads to fit you new Smart-Touch shaver? Like all Norelco rotary rasors, each model uses a slightly different drive pin to make you buy the newer, more expensive, heads.

Although their blades do an adequate job, their shavers are not quite as clean as the Gillette or Schick blades. Nevertheless, one cannot beat convenience of electric shavers and the quality of the Norelco shave is very close to the blade shave.Norelco recommends the users to replace the head once every year.

With time (less than 2 years in my case) the electrolytic capacitors fail resulting in catastrophic failure - burnt parts inside.Warning - A thermally impaired person may be involved the design of this power-supply.Also note that Antec does not advertise the efficiency level of this PS - simply claims that this is 25% more efficient without divulging any numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience.","review":"Maybe I got a bum unit, but I bought an Antec case with this powersupply (the SP-350) and it emitted a high-pitched, annoying, continual humming noise, rendering the PC unfit for any purpose except maybe on a factory floor where noise is not an issue, or among the deaf.Replaced the power supply this afternoon, and problem was solved.This is a heavy unit that leads one to think it is quality and durable. But whatever may be the case on those two scores, the noise factor was a deal-breaker.If you look on Antec's web site, they brazenly boast of their quiet power supplies. I found this very ironic to say the least. An email to Antec explaining my problem in detail received no reply at all.Don't expect any support or help from Antec.

It generally would reference anything that a dog could contract, but did not discuss what the Shar Pei breed could run into. I found that to be lacking.Also, it spent many pages about training for Sport which you may or may not choose (beyond sit, stay, etc.) To tought yourself as a Shar Pei book, I did not find that it discussed Shar Pei specific topics.

There is definately enough room for the camera, with a lens attached, plus additional lenses and even other accessories. My husband has enough room to keep our video camera in this bag too. So all of our photography equipment is in one place. I believe you have to remove the lens(s) from the camera to fit in the 2400 SLR bag, which can be a hassle.

There are several pockets to hold memory cards, batteries, cables/cords, etc.There is a feature to hook this bag on top of a rolling suitcase (for travel, or a photographer that has a lot of gear).I gave it 4 stars for the simple fact that I cannot attach my tripod.

However, over the last two months the plastic to metal couplers on the straps that hold the lid shut have failed. The plastic half of these fasteners have worn to the point that the couplers will not stay coupled. You can still carry it by the shoulder strap, just don't forget and grab the top handle because the top will open and dump your equipment. Called Canon and they told me that there is no warranty on their bags, so I will be replacing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issues with metal to plastic latches","review":"I bought this bag based on the positive reviews and was sorely disappointed. The left hand latch does not release unless you tug, wiggle, curse,and tug some more for a good couple of minutes. The right hand latch is normal and releases immediately.In the photo it appears that the latches are metal- not quite. The top part of the latch is metal and the forked part that clips in (picture a dog's collar or harness- it's the same hardware) is plastic. I think this may be causing it to jam as I have dozens of dog collars and harnesses for my dogs that have never had this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good looking bag","review":"order from Amazon.

There is plenty of room in this main section. The side bags are very nice and they even have a strap to hold your extras firmly in place. I can even put my monopod on the front of the bag.

Not good at all.","review":"I am so disappointed to be writing this review! MHC is one of the only mystery authors I will give any sort of attention to and typically when I pick up one of her books I'll have it read in 3 days max. Up to this point, her success rate in the world of me has been 100%. Without really having to say anything else, I'll tell you that this book took me 3 weeks, 3 WEEKS, to read.She definitely has a formula with her books: Grim Incident at the Beginning + Interesting Explanatory Story in the Middle = Super Suspenseful and Thrilling Ending.Although the formula can make for simple reading, it always makes for a great mystery. However, with this book, the formula went more along the lines of:Quick and Bland Explanatory Story at the Beginning + Very Bland, Predictable and Mildly Grim Incidents throughout the Middle= Anticlimactic Ending. The book read like a bad murder drama you'd see on Lifetime Television for Women.So so so disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Belong To Me","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I truly enjoy reading mystery/thrillers, but found the author's need to hold my hand throughout the story annoying. The main charaters internal dialogues were patronizing at best.

She begins to unravel more and more as bodies of witnesses turn up, and the story gets more and more suspensful! You dont know who the killer is til the end! But this book is hard to keep up with, for each chapter is about a different character, and MHC throws tons of characters and subplots at you, causing a bit of confusion, but when you remember the characters as the story continues, it gets easier! I definatly recommend this book, it was AWESOME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Airplane Book","review":"This book is suitable for mindless wasting of time and/or airplanes but little more. The bad news is that the story and characters are immediately forgetable. The good news is that you can read it again with only a vague, lingering sense of deja vu. I don't think Ms. Clark need worry about that Pulitzer, but then, with a fat bank account from turning out bestsellers, she probably isn't worried about leaving a substantial literary legacy. And she shouldn't be. This is the stuff that builds publishing houses.

This is definitely the worst one I have read by her, however. I agree with some of the other reviewers who say that the identity of the murderer was obvious. There is no character development in this novel. What I found to be the worst part about this book was how perfect most of the people were: Susan is beautiful, charming, intelligent, well-dressed, has perfect hair, etc. etc. Plus most everybody was filthy rich.

One good thing I will say about it is I did not know who the killer was until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fast read but predictable.","review":"I have read all of MHC's books and have been disappointed by the last few. As an author she is very predictable. It is always the person you suspected least who did the crime. I've figured out her villians in the beginning of her last few books. This one, while a page turner as usual, disappointed me more than the recent others because of the ending. Once Dee, the desperate sister, was aboard her ship she was thrilled to receive flowers from Alex. The next chapter she was pointing him out to the cops from the ship and he was arrested. Where's the middle? A forthcoming explanation was never given. How did Dee, who was smitten with him, know he was guilty and how did the cops wind up at the ship. I was very disappointed in the ending of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Mary Higgins Clark's best!","review":"I have read many of Clark's books and this is one of the best.

Fortuneately, I had the Reader's Digest version. Quite frankly I can't imagine having to read through any more pages of garbage than what I had. Not only was the plot predictable, but the characters were completely ignorant. The dialogue was ludicrous. The author creates ridiculous situations for the characters to be in so she can wrap up the plot so very nicely at the end. It was infuriating that the most annoyingly, despicable character, Susan Chandler, should live, while just about every other character has died or will die. There is no evidence of character development; although, one-dimensional characters fit perfectly into this weak, contrived story. In addition, I have yet to derive any logical solution as to why the antagonist has set out on his mission, even after we get the lame background involving his mother-in-law."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete dissapointment","review":"I thought that \\"You Belong To Me\\" was absolutely void of suspense.

The characters completely fit the mold of her other novels and the plot is predictable. MHC is sticking to her plot formula a bit too closely and has forgotten to make it interesting. In her other novels she leaves you guessing until the last minute. Not this one! If you've never read a MHC then I suggest that you don't start with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixture of bland writing and implausible characters","review":"Mary Higgens Clark's popularity remains quite high but her recent books do not measure up to earlier offerings which offered intricate, suspenseful plots and characters and settings which were richly described and quite believable. In her latest book, You Belong to Me, the main character is in danger from a psychopath and the reader is forced to guess which one of the seemingly normal men in the story is the villain. The heroine, however, is not developed enough for us to care who is after her; in addition, the three suspects are merely paperdoll characters and one gets the impression that the author simply said \\"eeney, meeney, miney, mo\\" and picked the bad guy before she wrote the final chapter. No matter what the hype, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Oh, Win!\\" Oh, Please!","review":"I haven't read a book of Mary Higgin's Clark for awhile, and now I remember why I haven't. It seems that every female character from book to book is the same. This book is merely a cardboard cut out from another book. It was simple to see who was the killer. The only reason I kept on reading was to see what the killer's motivation would be. Some of the characters seemed so dim. \\"Oh, Win!\\" Oh, Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable beyond belief","review":"This was the most predictable suspense thriller I ever read - if you can call it a suspense thriller, that is.

An utter dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable and therefore boring","review":"If you read only two books of M.H. Clark they are great !

Being a white-knuckled flier, I like something that will keep me on the edge of my seat. This one didn't. I have to agree with those readers who pinpointed the serial killer from the first scene in which he was introduced. As several have said,Ms. Clark's books are becoming more predictable. Before purchasing one, I always check the copyright date to make sure I haven't read it -- the characters are so interchangeable that it's easy to forget which is which. They even resemble each other physically and wear the same style clothing. I agree also that Susan Chandler and her psychiatrist friend seemed unprofessional. But I can see the Chandler character becoming the start of a detective series of her own, with more Susan Chandler stories spinning off from this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a zero if I could","review":"If you've read anything she's written recently, you'll recognize the killer the minute he enters the scene.

(I highly reccomend The Anastasia Syndrome for a change of pace)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I read this somewhere before?","review":"Ah, yes. The same plot existed in \\"Loves Music, Loves to Dance\\" (which WAS an excellent novel). The heroine's Mr. Right, the last person you'd suspect, is actually an insane murderer. I had the killer in \\"You Belong to Me\\" pegged from the start just on a hunch. The fact that MHC didn't explore his personal life in the story confirmed it. I found this story rather disappointing compared to MHC's previous novels. I thought \\"Loves Music, Loves to Dance\\" was quite riveting and suspenseful, which is what I enjoy most about MHC's style, but the most that can be said about \\"You Belong to Me\\" in comparison to other MHC books is that it is nothing more than PREDICTABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Higgins' Worst","review":"In previous books, such as Where Are the Children,The Cradle Will Fall, and Stillwatch MHC has been able to engross me with her suberb character development and always unexpected plot twists. This is not so with You Belong to Me. The characters are extremely one-dimensional; their motivations and personalities are barely explored. In this book, more than any other, the standard of living portrayed and the attitudes of the characters are extremely pretentious. The characters are absolutely out of touch with the type of lifestyle that most people live. There are also many sterotypes prepetuated. I was extremely fustrated with this book and am increasingly displeased with MHC novels. They seem to follow the same plot line and have the same characters in each one, with only the names changed.

On the one I bought, it did not provide enough pressure to hold the ratcheting mecahnism down when trying to pull in. I had to use (2) hands and manipulate the mechanism.When I went to release the tension, the unit would not ratchet out. It worked when I tried it unloaded before actually using the unit. Again, I had to use (2) hands.I bought the unit to bend my exhaust system so I was not anywhere near the advertized capacity.I did not contact Cummins about the problem so I cannot comment on what they would have done to rectify the situation.

I started my insulation job and it jammed on the eighth staple. I had to dismantle the stapler to clear the jam. It then jammed again about every eight to ten staples. It appeared to be jamming because the stack of staples (ARROW T50 Heavy Duty - 1/2 inch) were cocking over in the chamber to a 45 degree angle. Another extremely annoying feature is that the staple stack is 4 inches long out of the box but this stapler will only accept a three inch long stack. After clearing jams about a dozen times it began to jam every third staple. At that point I quit the job, losing a day's work, and tossed it into the trash.

I have attempted to use this for a few simple tasks: reattaching the thin cover on the bottom of a sofa, putting up holiday decorations and reupholstering a few chairs. Each one of these led to the most aggrevating time ever, wasting at least 75% of the staples due to the design of the \\"launch\\" mechanism. It either fails to retract completely, or it fails to punch the staple with any force.I just went through 2 strips of staples, and only ~10 staples actually worked.Do not waste your money.

It would not fire at all. I could squeeze the handle fully, but it just compresses like a grip exerciser, and the staple just pops out weakly when the handle is released.4.

Went through three full clips of staples(T-50) without any problems at all. Purchased it because of the design that makes more sense than the traditional type IMHO. Better to have pressure directly over where you want the staple to drive into. Does take some getting used to if you are accustomed as I am to the traditional style. Mostly in the sense that I'd naturally want to hold it backwards quite a bit.Was a bit disappointed to have purchased it then see how poorly it is rated on here but for my application today it worked just fine.

The very first time I used it it \\"broke\\" inside after only a few staples so that I had to tear it apart and then figure out how to put it back together.

The main character is very relatable and the author sets up all too real situations that can be scary, funny, interesting, nerve racking, or all of the above. If you ever played sports in high school but were never good enough to be on the team and thus maybe turned to drinking and doing small-time drugs while listening to some Skynard in the woods, I recommend this book to you. A at times funny but more importantly scary first novel for Lee Durkee that dives into lost innocense and failed realities. Would have given five stars but two crucial relationships ended kind of unclearly and abruptly.

Then I thought to offer the book for sale to the first person who reads this review, responds to my e-mail address, and forwards me the cost of postage (DianCG@aol.com). If you are looking for Pornoy's Complaint (maybe, and a book I never cared for) set in the 70s with the addition of mega drugs and phonography, this is the book for you. If you are looking for truly good writing, and writing which dares to call itself \\"Southern writing,\\" this is not the book for you.

Clark coming to grips with his true destiny is what the show is all about. I felt the Lana in the middle of the crusade thing was a bit drawn out but at least she didn't cry in every episode. I am new to the show this season- started tuning in an hour before Supernatural and got hooked! Amazon has seasons 1-3 on sale cheap for x-mas - buy them for a friend and get Smallville some new viewers to keep the show going !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The worst season so far but still a great one!","review":"Smallville is my favorite show I have watched every episode since the show has started and I still am wondering what is going to happen next. I have seen every episode of all 5 seasons about 6 or 7 times each. I am probly the biggest fan of the show of all time. If you are a superhero fan get this for sure it is like nothing you have ever seen. I can't wait for the 5th season to finish and get it on dvd I will get it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 4","review":"The beginning of the fourth season I felt was very weak. But after January I thought the series took a different turn, which I thought it was great, not only developing the characters but also the man Clark Kent will become.I think that the end of this season defined the show as being different from any superman story ever presented to the public. It makes the show unique. It was a very good idea how instead of using Lois as his main love interest they kept Lana as the love of his life. As well as how Lex's intrigues confuse more and more the viewers whether to see him as the enemy or friend. The last episode is the best finally from all of the other seasons because everything unleashes and the true personality of each character comes out clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait untill this comes out!","review":"I want to see the Flying,and where he meets Lois Lane,and Krypto."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Relationship?","review":"I have always enjoyed watching the Smallville series. Season 4 adds another insight with the entry of Louis Lane. Her presence brings about more suspense to the reluctant relationship between Clark and Lana. Will they ever be together or would Clark ends up with Ms Lane though there is no such sign yet? However, prepare to be disappointed with the TBC ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"smallville season 4","review":"I bought the smallville season 4 for my husband as a christmas gift and the seller said it was a new item. i received it and when he opened it you could tell that it was a used item that had been repackaged. the box binding was badly creased, a couple of the discs had scratches on them and were all dusty, the plastic insert that holds the disc was broken off, and the whole dvd box was in poor condition, including the episode book that came in it. i am extremely disappointed and am returning the item for a full refund. i refuse to pay $23 for a dvd series that has been used and repackaged and in poor condition when i can buy the same thing elsewhere brand new for cheaper. i do Not recommend to purchase this item from this seller, they ripped me off and sent me a used poor condition product and tried saying it was a new item. i will not buy anything from them ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smallville: The Complete Fourth Season","review":"When I received Smallville: The Complete Fourth Season I opened it and watched the first disk and it worked fine. When I started watching the second disk it wouldn't work because of scratches. I decided to check the rest of the disks. The third, fourth, and fifth disk looked fine. When I looked at the sixth disk it looked to be covered in ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Smallville is one of the best things on TV now so the minute the series is out I have to grab them.As an avid fan of Tom Welling, I am crazy for him and I've never been disappointed with any of Smallville's shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Season Yet","review":"I own all 4 seasons of Smallville, and season four is by far the best one. It contains Clark's first flight, football, his first wife (yes, he gets married), and a whole lot of sex. Oh and did I mention Lois Lane and witches? Mayn, this is a must buy for any Smallville fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show went downhill with the arrival of Lois Lane.","review":"The first three seasons were great . Many of the changes to the revamped origin of Superman were an enhancment to the Superman mythos like the kryptonite meteors playing a significant role , new characters, Lex Luthor's increased involvement, and especially the relationship between Clarke and Lana Lang.I don't mind if the producers and writers change things in the established history of a character if it actually improves the characters and the stories, especially an iconic 65 + year history. For 3 seasons it has worked. I would even let the fact that the show never adressed the issue of where in America Smallville is located. It's supposed to be in Kansas but it seems like Metropolis is only a few hours drive away if you know what I mean.The producers however crossed the line when they brought Lois Lane in. Lois Lane is a important character in Clark's life as an adult. Lana Lang is Smallville. Why ruin a good thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"writers alienate their conservative, family audience","review":"One of Smallvilles best qualitys in the early seasons was the relationship between Clark and his Dad (John Schnieder)andclarks progress in becoming a great man.Nowadays Dads are portrayed as either non-existent or idiots. Bringing in Witches, Vampires and more sexual content was a big mistake, I know many people who ended theirSmallville experience with this Season. Thankfully the series got somewhat away from this in later seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"smallville 4th season","review":"Tom Welling did an excellent job in this fourth season and so did the rest of the cast.My kids got a kick out of seeing him fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville season 4 objective","review":"I know smallville, had started as a family show, but i believe it has taken a turn to the adult world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad presentation. Smallville Season 4 DVD box set","review":"I was really looking foward to adding season 4 to my collection. I wasn't expecting the DVD to be in new condition at all. But when I opened to box case, the disc holders (clear plastic ones) were falling out, hanging only by the sticky thing that the company usually puts on the case. Also, some discs would actually fall out. Overall, I did not really enjoy the presentation of the item but I did enjoy having the season, I just thought the case for the DVDs would've been in better quality than they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Smallville","review":"I love my movie. I can't wait till I own the whole collection, which should be very very soon. You could say I'm Smallville obsessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I love all the Smallville shows! The HD connection with Amazon is superb! Sometimes the loading takes a little long though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season","review":"I'm a big fan of the show and I thought season 4 was extremely good I definately reccomend this for all the collectors of the seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"smallville season four","review":"This is Clark's story moving forward toward the end of high school, and you get to see the changes in the major characters, different sides of them some times darker and some times softer. I found it full of unexpected plot twists and geat use of imagination in bringing out the secret lives of the people we come to know and care for. The season ends leaving you needing to know what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Eye on the Ball","review":"I've seen every episode of SV since it's inception and I admit I was mesmorized by how great the writing was and direction the show was taking, but S4 lost it. The direction for the show is to get us to Superman. How does Clark develop his self sacrificing persona, that defends the weak and beleives in the best about mankind. None of that exist. It is Martha Kent who creates Superman, when Clark greives over the death of Jonathan Kent. Lex Luthor is not only rich, but he's smart, the level of genius portrayed by Lex is far below the comic nemisis of Superman. Lex' desire is to take over the world, I don't see that. The story is How Clark Kent and his best friend Lex Luthor become such bitter enemies that the world shakes, that's the story!!!S4 lost its way and S5 dosen't look any better.The writers have lost their originality and will lose their fan base as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm 53 freakin' years old and...","review":"haven't looked forward to a season opener (season 5!) nor enjoyed a season ender (season 4) since Captain Picard was 'borgerized'. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best season ever","review":"This is the best season so far. 5 and 6 were good, but season 4 rocked! The evolution to the crystal was brilliant! You must see this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punch Packer Season 4","review":"I think I am addicted to Smallville. I bought the first 5 seasons on DVD at one time and I was hooked at the first episode of season 1. Season 4 continues the saga of the coming of age Clark Kent aka Superman. It has some really good off the wall story lines as well as the continuing developing story line and relationships between the main characters - Clark, Chloe, Lana, Lex and Pete. All the seasons are good on their own but to get the full effect of Smallville you need to watch it from the beginning. Season 4 really packs a punch to the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for the family!","review":"Though I'm not a huge fan of Smallville, my family is, especially my son. Got this for his birthday and he locked himself away for a week with his cousins to watch it! Less rampaging through the house, lol!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the packaging??","review":"OK, so the packaging in all of the seasons has been sub-par. In every season I have purchased the plastic trays have detached from the cover before it's even opened. With season 4 however something seems to have gone even worse. The trays are much thicker and heavier than previous seasons, and even the later seasons. This caused the box to be much bigger on the shelf than all the others. Disc 5 in the set I received came so badly scratched it will not play any of the episodes. What's strange is that the disc was not loose, it was still attached to the tray when I opened it. It looks like a cat went at the back of it with it's claws. I'm not sure why they went with this horribly worse packaging for season 4, but it was a terrible idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart doesn't Forget","review":"I was surprised that I enjoyed this episode. I'm not completely thrilled with the storyline that Clark, Chloe and Lois pursue in locating the person that caused Clark to lose his memory. I think I didn't like this because I thought the guest actor was not very good....so it always colors how I see this epi. Despite this, our main stars make up for what's lacking in the story with their emotional portrayals. I loved all the scenes between Chloe and Clark....Lois and Clark...and the most memorable one...between Clark and Lana at school. Tom Welling as Clark Kent portrays innocence and love for Kristin Kreuk's character, Lana, in the most heartbreaking way in this scene. That scene makes up for what is lacking in the main storyline. This is also one of the few times when I felt Kristin Kreuk hit the nail on the head. So, kudos to our main actors...not so much on the guest actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville Rocks","review":"I love Smallville so couldn't get enough of it. I am devastated that I have watched them all now and can't wait to get onto the next series. Series 4 was not quite as good as series 3. He didn't learn any new powers which was disappointing and the focus seemed to be more on Lex becoming evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville Season 4","review":"Smallville - The Complete Sixth SeasonThis season I thought had great episodes it started out in a very freshand fun way. It was very entertaining and the rising of Louis Lane's Character was genius. Louis always knew how to make me laugh and although Kristein Kreuk( Lana) is a very hot girl she tends to get boring at times. Louis brought the funny back to the show. Although Lana was not as boring this season as previous because of her frequent possessions by a witch of the old times. Lex Luthor also starts to show his true feelings towards Lana. Overall it was a good season. Specially Chloe becoming a cheerleader."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER!","review":"Smallville season 4 was really great and as i go through the seasons they keep getting better and better. if you at all into superman. I STRONGLY urge you to buy this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville Season 4","review":"Great Season. Finally, lois lane is introduced in a very interesting way. Clark Kent comes back from Jor El naked and Lois ends up finding him. Hilarious entrance. I really dont want to spoil the season if you havent seen it. But, this season is well worth the buy. The seasons just keeps getting better"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment...","review":"We've watched Smallville episodes from the first season and I have to conclude that this fourth season lacks the luster of the other three!There is WAY TOO MUCH \\"SKIN\\", sex, witchcraft, and other debauchery taking place in this fourth season. And get over the Lana Lang thing, already, please!! Bringing her back into Smallville from Paris was OK, but enough with the Clark/Lana love tangle. It's stupid.The only positive thing about this series is the introduction of up-beat, funny, Lois Lane. Gotta love her. Her quick witted character adds a lot of charm and grace to an otherwise disgraceful season."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen - from Classic to teeny bopper drama","review":"This show rapidly went down the toilet season 4. I love this show and we used to watch it as a family (my children, wife, and me). However, I no longer recommend it to anyone. Apparently the producers got the bright idea to have a plotless teenage drama instead of a superman show about superman as a teen.Lex, by far the best actor and most intriguing character, disappeared from this season. That was a terrible shame.The writers are out of ideas. Kryptonite this, kryptonite that. Lana whine, Lana whine. The interesting characters, Chloe and Lex, are sidelined for stupid plots. The show obviously has a very teeny bopper feel now.If you are a teenager, you might like the show. However, if you like Superman and good plots I strongly recommend the previous 3 seasons. So sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lois & Clark 2.0","review":"Three months have passed since Clark left with Jor-El. In that timenJonathan Kent lies in a coma, Chloe is dead, Lex needs constant treatments due to his poisoning, Lana is in Paris and Lionel is in Prison. When Lois Lane comes to town looking into Chloe's death she meets an amnesia striken Clark mere moments after his return. a despairing Martha reaches out to Virgil Swann for help which comes in the form of Onyx Kryptonite (called Black Kryptonite in the series). This Dark Matter variant splits Kal-El from Clark with the Kent persona emerging the victor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good episode","review":"Episode was really good.

I love paging through my most recent edition of the Star Trek Encyclopedia and regularly pick up Star Trek The Magazine so this was a no-brainer for me to have. As a big fan of astronomy it was satisfying to finally get a 'definitive' map of the Star Trek universe in all its incarnations. This book, though thin (only 100 pages in length), is so beautifully illustrated and designed that it provides hours of diversion. I only wish there was more text! A must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome guide while watching","review":"this book is neat to have handy while watching any episode of the star trek series.how neat it is to look up a map location of the particular episode youre viewing..4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charting the unknown...","review":"...would've been fantastic for this 'Complete Atlas'.The inside is very pretty, and the pull out maps are well done, although the quality of the paper on the pull-outs could've been better - I opened them once, and now dare not do it again as they may tear.As a customer who wanted these charts to enhance game play in the Star Trek roleplaying game, I was disappointed to find there were a significant amount of omissions of planets and star clusters (the Lorenze Cluster, for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST PERFECT","review":"I will be brief ....... this book is GREAT and shows a LOT of the maps and locations of planets mentioned in the star trek series and movies , but as some reviewrs said before it has some GREAT location errors and some thinks are missin. but i recomend this book to ANY STAR TREK FAN and people who like SPACE in general since most thinks mentioned in the book are cientifically based, and very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am glad I found the Star Trek Atlas.","review":"Overall, this book was entertaining, and is worth every penny. The color charts are appealing, and informative. I know where wolf 359 was, I know where founders' homeworld is, I know how close Cardassia is to the Earth etc... Now that I have a map, it makes sense whyThere were a few things the book should have included: A 3-D map since space is not 2 dimensional; a map of the entire galaxy on a fold-out would have been nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAR WARS, eat your hart out","review":"What a book, no one has ever seen this, so compleet, so unbelieveble.

The game is that I catch a snippet-a planet name or such-on TV or a movie, and quickly look to see if it's in here. I have yet to be disappointed. It's all here. While it would seem short for its steep price, this atlas is worth every penny for the pedantic Trekker who needs everything just right. My only gripe is that I wish there had been more details regarding some of the more important destinations. An index would have been nice to help find some of the more obscure places, too. Regardless, this is great for those who enjoy both the scientific and political aspects of Star Trek. There's something for everyone. Here's hoping there comes an updated edition in the future that features some of the spots Enterprise has visited."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"If you're a fan of any of the Star Trek series, you must pick up this book!

This game does have 5 games in one, but they all suck. I bought this game for the portal game, the game I thought was the king of all 5 games. It's not. It's the lamest thing I've ever seen. It's a bunch of rooms that randomly open and close, it's a puzzle game. The other games are Half Life 1, 2 and 3, but they're really all the same lame game. The 5th game isn't playable unless you're online, so I've never seen it work.By the way I'm a 34 y/o dude from NYC. Call of Duty 4 and Tony Hawk Proving Ground are games worth buying. This one isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame game","review":"I bought this game used in late 2008.

It will test your intelligence, logic, and general abilities in this FPS puzzler. It's a little short, but the extra challenges beyond story mode are good enough for you to continue playing it even after you're done with the story mode. The villain in this game is just awesome and even the final credits are amusingly creepy.For Half-life 2, I have to say that although I'm not through with it, it gives you hours of fun and vertiginous excitement.With the Orange box you will have a great deal and you won't regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Valve put together a great package here.

This is a great game, it's really 1 game, Half Life 2 and 4 small sub games. The production, design, graphics and game play are all top notch. My only real complaint is that this is kind of incomplete, I want more! First off Half Life 2 is an old game that I think most people have played before. The two episodes of Half Life 2 and Portal all feel like incomplete games, like Valve just released what they have so far and not a complete game. I don't understand why it takes them so long to complete 1 game but by the time they finish Half Life 2 ep. 3 I may not care anymore, we may be in a next generation of video game consoles by then. And Portal has so much potential as a complete game! Still, what they have so far is amazing and I would recommend everyone check out this game. Team Fortress 2 is a lot of fun to play online too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprising","review":"I mainly bought this game for Portal.

Enjoying it for the second time. Played this game year ago and realized I should not have traded it. WOn't make that mistake this time. Also, great cheat codes for this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great games at a bargin price.","review":"The Orange Box is 5 great games in one package on one disc. All of the games are first person shooter style games. However Portal doesn't have much actual shooting because it features a unique puzzle/strategy twist to its gameplay. Team Fortress 2 is exclusively Xbox Live or system link and has no local multiplayer, so it is useless unless you have Xbox Live pretty much. All of the games are very fun if you like first person shooters, and at the price of one game for 5 games, you can't afford to not buy this game.Some general advice I have is to just never buy preorder games from Amazon, even with one day shipping you will get your games anywhere between 3-14 days after the game has come out. Amazon consistently has \\"stocking problems\\" and says that the shipment is allegedly \\"late\\" but if the game is already out then by all means buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun game according to the grandson","review":"We got this for our grandson for his birthday.

Of course, I knew they would because Sunbeats were the first Clark's shoe I ever bought. That was at least fifteen years ago. And they're still going strong, with the same cushy comfort soles and soft leather uppers. In addition, I appreciate their three adjustable straps, since my right foot is half a size larger than my left. Because hammertoes and bunions have caused some deformities in both my feet, I haven't worn sandals for a long time. But these cover those problems quite well, allowing plenty of wiggle room for my toes at the same time. At the moment they are the only shoes I have besides my other Clark's mules that don't irritate my toes.

The sole of the sandal is the same size for several sizes--they just adjust the strap closer in the back to make the correct size. How disappointing. This was my favorite summer sandal.

Gradually, things grow tamer and more whimsical, until the story is muddled and meandering. The ending leaves too many things unresolved. I found that the first half of the book was intriguing. Kim was a murderer, and he draws Lynn in. This alone lends him a certain dark mystique. The rest of the book seems to be an attempt to justify his crime, when no justification is required.

There's room outside these dividers (between which the mounted lens belongs) for the lens caps and extra battery.

It's a pretty good grab-and-go bag, although I no longer keep my SLR in this bag; it's been appropriated for holding telescope eyepieces and miscellany! I actually prefer this bag over the larger Canon backpack, but that one holds a lot more stuff and is easier to hike with. This bag is better suited for road trips and family events.

This bag easily held that stuff after I changed the adjustable inside pockets around. I could easily put in another lens (for a total of 4) plus a few other odds n ends in the side pouches and front pouch.

To my disappointment, the bag was much smaller than advertised and in fact the tag on the bag stated the dimensions of 9.5 x 7 x 6 inches which is vastly different from the 11 by 8.7 by 7.9 inches (width x height x depth) advertised by Amazon or should I say as stated by the company that Amazon represents. Regardless, it is Amazon's site that presents this bag's incorrectly stated dimensions and after returning the bag for this reason (which Amazon took care of professionaly) and after pointing out to them in an email that they have not changed their site to reflect this fact, they continue to falsly advertise this item. I in fact stated to them that to make a mistake is okay, but to continue to do so false advertising. After six months they are still do so.

My only negative feedback (and it's silly, but I'm looking for something negative) is that it's a little difficult to get the dividers exactly where you want them, as they stick to the sides when you're putting them in.

However, it does not give any detail of what situations base stealing is used, what the pitcher and rest of the defense do to prevent it, how the manager gives direction to the runner to steal through the use of signs, etc. I expect Dummies books to cover the basics and explain things in easy to follow terms.

The discussion of rules is decent (starting with the most basic - like which direction to run around the bases), but it still misses some rules altogether.Too much of the book is spent instructing the reader how to play each position, or how to organize a team - nothing wrong with that, but it's a different book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"jargons to explain jargons","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews.

The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. \\"Big Scare in the Big Easy\\" and \\"Lights! Camera!

I'm embarrassed to admit my daughter has roughly 25 Barbie dolls (many were second hand and very inexpensive though!), and this is the only one that has broken a joint.

In my opinion this is not a book about a love story but it is about the phases of a relationship. Many factors influence relationships and the characters in the book go through pretty much all of them. During the process, the author describes why we do the things we do even though sometimes we may know that it is not the best thing for us to do. I usually don't like reading novels. So, the reason why I enjoyed this one so much is that it includes factual information about human psychology.The content is not \\"deep\\" but if you are looking for a good book to read in just a few days to relax your mind and to learn a little, then this one is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete mess","review":"I am only giving this even 2 stars because some of the stories in it are interesting.

It's pretty much a complete mess and it's hard to believe it got published in this form. To top that off the author seems to think he's the only person on earth who knows anything about bike gangs.

I didn't spend a lot of time studying the bracket prior to ordering, but I wish the \\"u\\" clamp was deeper. It's not deep enough to clamp on the top rail of a chin link fence. The mount has still served me well by slipping it between the fence rail and wire (actually clamping it to the fence wire along the top edge of the fence).I've since discovered the Kodak 1764471 Adventure Mount, looks like it would probably work much better for my situation, especially at fields where the top rail is covered with a safety guard, but I'm still very pleased with the UltraClamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"UltraClamp is perfect","review":"I needed a camera mount to use while solo mountain climbing, cant carry a real tripod.

Its useful to get an idea of the things you can do but only if your fitness knowledge is at an advanced level. The explanations are confusing, the suggested workouts assume you know certain things, there are exercises without images, or even not included just named. Another criticism is that even within the same chapter the exercises are named slightly different so it becomes again confusing.Over all it is not an easy book to use, it is badly edited and missing basic information when in others are overdone. In the end it is useless to have something complicated explained to such detail when the basics are not clear.Really it was quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"book during pregnancy","review":"I enjoy reading about fitness and exercise!

Anyone with a dog knows that's not going to happen. Dogs have certain kinds of dog bodies and just can't move that way. Still, it's hard for me to say the CGI dog doing karate was worse than the dog speaking English, although it was very bad. Dogs don't speak English and everyone knows it's because they don't have to. I can't help comparing this movie to one of the all time great movies, Bingo. Now that was a dog! They didn't need to make Bingo speak English or any other stupid things because Bingo was cool.

It was a great story. The history was great and sort of wished that I had read it before going to New Orleans. I would have picked up more from the city. And yes, not a great plan to travel some of the places away from the main strip. I have to find another book that will be as satisfying as this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been much better!","review":"I keep telling myself to look at the genre and judge accordingly. This book, however, doesn't make the grade for me in any way except the genre. I like a romance when I want light, mindless reading. As for as mindless reading, it filled the bill. As for character development, not so much. The characters are lightweight, stereotypical and insipid. So is the plot. It could have been so much better, given the location and the premise. So much for my Ciji Ware experiment. I was hoping she would get better but only gets worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy...","review":"This book is readable, but I found it to be really annoying. The actual story is interesting, but it was the characters I couldn't stand, especially Corlis. I'm going to begin work on my Master's degree in September so I was happy to see a novel about historic preservation, but unfortunately it seemed a bit far-fetched and at times almost laughable.I enjoyed the parts of the story that took place in the past the most, the historical details were fascinating. But Corlis drove me crazy with her reasons on why she kept being able to see the past, just accept it already! Also, the kidnapping of King seemed to kind of just come out of the blue, and it seemed to be solved and wrapped up too easily.All in all, I wouldn't say that this book was unreadable and there are some fascinating elements in this book, but the characters were just hard to get past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solidly satisfynig summer read","review":"Romance novels are not my usual fare, but in this case the title was so interesting, I bought the book anyway--and discovered a fascinating historical novel woven through and around a present day romance. Not only does the author capture New Orleans in sight, smell and attitude, she deftly peels back layer upon layer of history and culture, from the Free People of Color who lived and prospered in New Orleans before the Civil War to the present day struggle between preservationists and developers. In the process she holds a mirror to current society which makes it all the more believeable. The result is a book that offers something for everyone--a modern romance with a sassy TV reporter for a heroine intertwined with the thoughtful development of a historical novel. I can't speak for how well it reads as a romance, but as a historical, it's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take on time travel","review":"I really enjoyed the concept of this book.

Definitely looking forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absorbing Read","review":"Midnight on Julia Street by Ciji Ware is an exceptional read. It's a love story on more than one level. In the developing relationship between King and Corlis, the reader learns of the fight for the preservation of The French Quarter. Ms Ware's meticulous research is reflected in the accuracy of the portrayal of New Orlean's unique history, especially as it revolves around the Free People of Color and their major contributions to the city's founding.It is a complex love story: not only between King and Corlis, but also the degree of passion and dedication required in preserving specific real estate from the wrecking ball. Midnight on Julia Street is two stories, seamlessly told as one, an absorbing read, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight on Julia Street is just so good!","review":"Ciji Ware weaves unusual journeys back and forth through time like no one else! This story grips you right from the start and carries you through the interwoven fabric of the past and present with an energy and excitement few authors can master. I wish my history classes could have been presented in as powerful a way...maybe I would remember at least some of what was taught back then. The main character Corlis is engaging and believable and I thoroughly enjoyed her story. I can't wait to read more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the history","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

The Axiom had to go back to M-Audio within a couple of weeks because certain keys were putting out full velocity at all times.The pedal lasted a little longer, but eventually failed - during a gig. I opened it to see if a repair was possible. The pedal is generally well designed for a product at this price point, with one major weakness: The linkage between the treadle and potentiometer is made of flimsy plastic that is destined to fail under even the most optimistic conditions.This is planned obsolescence of the worst sort. Because my pedal was (just) out of warranty, and M-Audio doesn't stock parts for it, I was told that \\"it would be most cost-effective for you to just buy another pedal\\".

For $22 it's not worth the headache of returning with the probability of getting another DOA. It's not the fault of the vendor, their prices and shipping expedience are tops. Just be aware if it fails, that's a good place to start looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth what you pay","review":"This is a nice little expression pedal, but don't expect the highest quality or durability. On the first one I got, the armature that connects the rocker pedal to the potentiometer inside the base broke with the first two movements. It's a small plastic piece and appears to be very easily broken. The rest of the pedal seems to be operational enough and I don't understand the reliance on a fragile piece of plastic to make this work.

I only wish I had read this book first, or better still, taken it with me. I am not a gambler, but after reading THE COUNTER, I feel I have some insight into the mind of a professional blackjack player.Don't get me wrong; this novel is not just about the fast paced world of casinos. If it were, I would've been lost immediately. No, the story touches on many universal themes such as relationships, redemption, and regrets. I've read everything from romance to horror and I highly recommend you buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"I enjoyed reading my first novel ever where the main character, Raven, is a card counter and card counting itself is central to the story line. Mr. Blackwood is or was a professional BlackJack player, his understanding and knowledge about big time blackjack play is quite evident in the realistic portrayal of his book's characters. As a serious card counter myself, I found Raven's thought process quite similar to how my own thought pattern works in similar situations.

Granted most of the things that he mentions do happen,but on a much smaller degree than he illustrates. If someone were to take his advice to heart they would be more apt to kill them selves than go through the indignities that he describes.

The author uses \\"sources\\" at various times, however all sources are completely anonymous which makes their claims laughable and brings into question whether or not they are fiction.

This book is blatantly racist and gives false information about the racial demographics of incarcerated men who rape and incarcerated men who are victims of rape. At the same time, I strongly disagree with a couple of other reviewers who claim that this book exaggerates the horrors of prison life. One does not need to have any particular political viewpoint to acknowledge that U.S. prisons violate human rights on a massive scale. Read any ethnography about prisoners' experiences, or any of the reports by Amnesty International and other groups that specialize in documenting human rights issues.

Just 1 year before we watched the family struggle on long road trips and it was a learning experience. Suddenly it is all limos and handlers for the kids. I watched season 4 to see what happens, but I sure would not want to watch it a second time. The first 2 seasons are fun to look back on andI feel are very re-watchable.

It's a shame to see what was a family trying to raise their kids with values taken by dollar signs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry","review":"This family is such a sham. Notwithstanding the fact that Jon and Kate are having affairs and won't break up because of the cash cow that the show has become (it should be called Pimp my Sextuplets), this season is one big commercial. No normal family gets to do the quantity of trips and outings they do. I don't begrudge them these things but the show is supposed to be about a normal family, not some made for TV Monkee-esque family that deals with fame- not at least when they are crying \\"poor us\\" to churches and accepting love offerings and $20/pic of their kids. Save your money for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same family","review":"I absolutely agree about this show. I used to love watching them in their everday normal life. They all seemed so normal clipping coupons, the kids going to school, the family always doing stuff together close to home.

Recent publications impressed upon me that things like split infinitives are not so bad, that the \\"rules\\" of writing were made to be broken in our modern age. Really? Have you read an email or text message lately? The more of them I read the more incomprehensible garbage I find. Like many of you, I was introduced to Strunk and White in college. I've never been without a copy since. I wear out one copy and replace it with another.

What's more, it makes sense and instructs with minimal grammarian jargon, so you won't have to jot down any funny-looking equations on your hands, create acronyms, or memorize it like a secret formula.

The book is not only useful, it is remarkably readable. The authors advocate clearer, simpler prose, and this slim volume reflects their minimalist philosophy of writing.E.B. White brought similar honesty and grace to his still classic essays and to beloved children's stories such as Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little. Literary-minded readers of Elements of Style might also be interested in Ernest Hemingway or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Both writers were journalists before they began to write novels, and both are well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you write, buy this book","review":"An essential book for everyone who ever writes anything - if you want your reader to understand your message.

The advice is so commonsense that it is often overlooked. The writing itself is written in plain language that often jumps off the page. The detailed examples of fallacies and correct grammar usage are essential in any writer's understanding of proper structure on the way to developing their own style. This book, along with Stephen King's \\"On Writing,\\" will be the two books that I, as a writer, will always defer to when speaking to another writer about how to write. This classic will live as long as our language does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on composition","review":"William Strunk's first publication of The Elements Of Style was in use at Cornell University in 1919.

I still have my copy from college, and it should be a good resource if I ever decide to write something again. Lots of specific examples and not overloaded with the pretentious junk editors tend to put in. It gets right to the point!AND it doesn't weigh you down like big fat history or physics books.Still, I'll admit that I avoided using it at times when I stupidly and stubbornly believed that my style was superior - so I feel somewhat guilty when I see it sitting on my shelf, almost hidden between big books.

When I got home and perused it, I was vastly disappointed it didn't measure up to all its hype. Why? It is too simplistic! When looking for information regarding numerals, all it carries is a small paragraph about numerals in dates. I was also looking for uses of the apostrophe. Again, it only contains very limited data. In continuing to look through this book, I have not found a single answer to my questions!A person who already has style basics under their hat should not spend their money on this book. Instead, they should gravitate towards a larger style manual, which gives much more detailed information. That is what I have done.

The rules and rules of what is correct writing just didn't help me. It is good to know rules, but the inflexible manner of this book was not very useful. For instance, some books have to be grammatically incorrect. Sentence fragments, run-on sentences, etc. all can build tension or a feeling in a book, but this isn't allowed according to Strunk and White.

I personally enjoyed the no nonsense \\"attitude\\" in getting straight to the point. The Elements of Style is a powerful tool to assist writers in every aspect of expression.

However, I found that the tone and composition of the book lends itself to an audience of insiders,' those who are already well-versed in the basic principles. It is not of much use in teaching those who are confused or need more clarity on the subject. Furthermore, the tone of the book is rather haughty and elitist, which was a turn-off for me.

In order to use a framework, you need to start somewhere, and their focus on clarity and simplicity is a good one. Why try to aspire to the obtuse and the impenetrable if you haven't the basics of cogent writing? Interested in being a sedulous writer, and not an earnest one?

Expressing correctly that the path of the Druid is primarily an individual one, she goes on to discuss the current trends of it's followers, and presents helpful practicums for the initiate. The only drawback is that the book's use of British examples in the lessons, but the readers in other parts of the world can adapt these to thier own circumstances easily.

My first problem was that the authors chose to use the book as a vehicle to spread their misguided brand of evangelical Christianity. This was an affront to my intelligence.Secondly, they clearly had no idea how to conduct a proper scientific study. The information presented in the book was based on an amateur survey and should be given little or no credence.I would recommend to the authors that if they wish to publish further works on topics like this, they should go back to school and learn about statistics, random sampling and how to conduct scientific studies. Then, they should realize that there is no place for religion in books of this type.If the authors want to write about their religious beliefs, that's fine, but the title should clearly reflect that so people who have a genuine interest in the workings of the human brain do not waste their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"common knowledge","review":"This book was a waste of my time and money.

It's a constant battle, and one that is never won. A married man is always at the mercy of a woman's often violent mood swings, and can never win. Then, God forbid, comes menopause.

At the beginning of the book the author tells us that he is a christian, and many of his insight are directly from his beliefs. After that, he does mention religion a few more times, but it is not pushed terribly hard. My criticism is ... there is entirely too much religion expressed in this book.

Very thin (more so than others I've used) but more problematic for me was the \\"anti skid\\" substance seemed completely ineffective. The bottom of the cover is colored in a pattern that looks like traction. In reality, this seemed to me to provide no grip whatsoever. Is there any grip? Maybe. The cover is sewn with a piece of rubber along the bottom center. As the thread which covers the rubber begins to wear off and before the rubber has worn off, that little strip can give you a little traction. Bottom line, depending on your needs it could work but the anti-skid claims seem deceptive/questionable. As to sizing, my size 10 mens fit in the XL no problem and a worker was able to get his large work boot (maybe size 12?) into it but very tight fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Language.

The fact is my 5 year old daughter is very hard on toys, yet this Ken doll after a year still has his head unlike the other reviewers and he still even has his clothes and crown on. Maybe it's because she doesn't play with Ken as much as the Barbies. My main complaint about Ken is that his legs are not jointed and therefore do not bend to allow him to sit and have dinner or ride in the carriage with the Barbies. Mostly he just naps. His arms also do not bend which makes it hard to hold Barbie when they dance.

We're supposed to care about a total loser who is trying to get finishing funds for his crap movie that nobody likes. Every aspect of this movie is poorly done, even the narration sounds amateurish. I can't figure out what the filmmakers had in mind with this. I had heard about it getting lots of attention when it showed on IFC. Now I know why: the movie is a big cheat. It tries to seem \\"real\\" and has what would be a very tragic ending, if it actually happened. But it didn't happen, none of it happened.

It's all very much in bad taste and completely unbelievable.

However these elements are used with purpose, usually to continue exploring the parallel drawn between contemporary hip-hop and gangster culture, and Edo period Japan where the story is set. The use of graphic elements remind me a lot of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, and no, it is most certainly not for kids -- that's why it's rated 'mature'. (And I must agree that this is by no means the most explicit anime ever produced, though it's possibly the most adult themed anime to show on Cartoon Network.)Incredibly well written, beautifully drawn and directed (though I don't care for the zombie episode on this disc), with just amazing action scenes, it's just an extremely well crafted anime.

But it is well-worth your time to at least view it one time and accept it for what it is ... a different type of story and setting, but nonetheless, very well done. Not all movies are going to be as wonderful as the Jane Austen productions ... but they are still very entertaining and so much more wholesome than the trash on tv now.

I used to buy 100 heavy duty bulbs at Menards which would last 6 months to a year. Menards has dropped the 100 watt for 60 watts now. I need the extra illumination for my long dirveway.I bought these based on the specs I read on the website. I installed the 100 watt bulb which lasted lest than three days. The bulb exploded in the light head fixture. I replaced the bulb and the same thing happened to the second bulb. Even though my light head fixture is sealed, my guess is that condensation or moisture is causing the bulbs to burst. I called the manufacturer to resolve the problem. His only solution was to reimburse me.I am now using a 100 watt CFL bulb, even though it is not as attractive as the crystal clear bulbs, I have had no problems with my light polls lighting up my driveway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I bought a six pack of these clear light bulbs to use in outdoor decorative fixtures. I was impressed with their construction especially the filament and supports so I replaced two out of three lights surrounding double garage doors. One blew after a day so the other five will need to last 23,998 hours to break even.The interesting feature is that the light - compared to the normal 100 watt clear bulb that was in the third fixture - is much dimmer and a yellow/brown color. OK, I suppose, to use outdoors but you will have to replace all the lights visible at a time because the difference between these and regular clear is very dramatic. Don't think I will use them indoors or order them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good start","review":"I purchased 12 of the 96001 Decorative Chandelier Bulbs rated at 9000 Hours plus some ULA-22 types hoping for long life bulbs for some hard to reach places. I installed 8 96001s and 2 of those burned out within 24 hours. Looks like a gas leakage based on the discoloring of the bulb's glass. They claim to be the \\"only manufacturer of 20,000 hour rated, long-life incandescent bulbs left in America today\\" which may be true but the 9,000 hour 96001s boxes I received are clearly stamped \\"Made in China\\" and the infant mortality rate isn't good. On their site there's a small, not very obvious link that says \\"imported\\" by these but clicking it doesn't give any info. Don't like companies that aren't upfront or hide details.They did refund my money for the 2 burned out bulbs (not any of the shipping) but I'm skeptical of how long they'll last. The other 8 96001s have been running roughly 90 days at 8-10 hours per day without more failures. The jury is still out on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dim and yellow","review":"Not impressed.

My 11 year old son is very interested in car design but this was a big disappointment. Not only was the product somewhat misrepresented but: the activities were aimed at a very young level (Not 7 yrs to 99); the expert level was the worst of all; way too much packageing (also misleading). Great idea but not advertized accurately. Don't buy it unless your child is under 8, even then its too much money for what you receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Advice From A Big Ego","review":"Ms. Evans supports the view that women should help women just because they are women. Well, this girl-centered view is just as bad as a good old boys network. Discrimination by any other name is still discrimination, but Gail Evans puts her blinders on in this rather dopey book and says if women just help women discrimination is okay. By this thinking it would be okay for white people to help just white people and Asians should only help asians and let us not forget that fat people should help only those who weigh 200 pounds or more. You see the idea is really silly and Ms Evans needs to be less concerned about trying to sell her book and more concerned about writing a good book with a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gender Warfare Here We Come","review":"Never have I read such a book that attempts to pull men and women apart instead of forming a basis that they can work together.

Now in the product description it says my caliper will fit just fine, but I had to cut out about a 1/2\\" of hard dense foam to get my caliper to lay in it correctly. Also as a side note, I bought this case because I thought the caliper that I bought from Amazon (starrett 1202-6) didn't come with a protective case, but it does. So you don't have to go out and buy this case which is not any better at protecting the caliper than the case that came with my caliper for free.

The idea seemed to be that everyone has a dark side but there's no redemption for that darkness. There was no resolution to all the badness and there were no likeable characters. The only attempt at resolution was when the lead character returned to his hometown and had a weird psychological experience. He basically had to accept that life sucks and learn not to hate in spite of that. Apparently he was helped in accepting the darkness of life by believing in a B grade monster. It was really dumb. I was disappointed that the Dove foundation put their label on it. I hope no one else wastes their time watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie","review":"Movie was not great.

What it does is take many important aspects of Japanese culture and it compresses it into a brief and enjoyable format. Very entertaining but also very informative and you really get insight into why and how the Japanese act, feel, behave, and how it all came about. If you are wanting to learn about the culture in general, get this. It also has many good tips for when you conduct business with Japanese business owners and that their aesthetic sense overrides outlines and rational on a first meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As a serious language learner I thought it would be about phrases that are uniquely Japanese. Instead it was a collection of trite stereotypes that have been repeated over and over and frankly don't really represent the modern country that much. Most of the rest is simple stuff that only someone who started learning about the Japanese culture a week ago would not already know.There are a few things that most people will probably find interesting, but it's not worth spending money on. Get it at the library if you must, but only buy it if you have extra spending money you feel like wasting. I checked it out from the library myself, and it was barely worth the time I spent to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting bites of culture, but what's with that font?","review":"I am enjoying this book, and learning a lot. As others have said, the short essays are great. My only complaint is about the font. I find it hard to read because it's a fairly strong serif font, in my opinion. And maybe it's just my copy, but the ink has a bit of spread, though not enough to make up for the thinner parts of the letters, so that makes it harder, too. My eyes are just fine, and I'm in my 20s. Compared to other books I have read, I find it harder to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It’s a bit dry.","review":"This book reads very much like a college sociology or anthropology book. I bought it to broaden my understanding of marshal arts customs, tradition and culture and so far have been disappointed and found nothing useful to that degree.

It’s a bit dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some wonderful content for a language learner","review":"I'm going to use a game metaphor; in certain MMORPG games (Such as World of Warcraft), once your character hits the level cap and you no longer have to run the level treadmill, you focus on what is called \\"end-game\\" content.

I can speak, read and write Japanese fluently. I am now focusing on Chinese, but I still like to learn new things about the Japanese culture I've come to know and love.

I always looked at larger companies as mysterious and complicated things. From the outside, corporations seemed so sophisticated and impenetrable.

Stan has a great way of not only imparting practical knowledge, he also brings a light-heartedness to otherwise serious subjects that contributes to a healthier perspective.

The story line seems to have been thrown together. None of the story lines of the characters seemed to come together. Tyler Perry's longgggggg talk after the funeral seemed more like a sermon than a part of the play. It was just to long and then his exit was abrupt and out of place in the play. I know that the stage play was cut short because Tyler was tired, and it was apparent that he was not at his best. The singing was awesome in this play, but the rest of the play was a disappointment. As in his other plays, there was not even a song at th end that bought everyone together. It was just awful and sad. If I had paid money to see this, I would have been highly upset. My family, who are ages, 49, 44, 20 & 18 all feel the same way about this play. I wish him better on the next play.

This is not worth the cash if you get it for free toss it, it's not worth your time. Its like a parody of every play he's ever done in the past. Tyler's plays are usually so uplifting and this just made me want to put a magnum to my head and pull the trigger. I couldn't even watch it all, I watched 75% of it. But that was all my patient ass could take. What's worse I spent 12.99 on the DVD which is now permanently in my collection as a constant reminder that I should have paid like what?

Normally after watching one of his plays (especially I Know I've Been Changed which isn't on dvd) I feel like laughing, crying, shouting, screaming, and everything else. During this play, I was emotionless. The woman who played Aunt Bam (Ella from House of Payne) gave me a few chuckles, but even her character bored me after a while.Its one of those things where you keep watching and watching waiting for the \\"good part\\", then next thing you know, its over and the good part never came.

I just love Madea and her many ways of getting her message across! I find it amazing that the cast in the play can keep from cracking up, even though I saw them smile like they were going to laugh. I also have seen several of his movies, but to me Madea holds the top spot! If you like music and roll on the floor laughter then you should get this play!

As she tried to straighten it, the plastic nearly broke in two, but enough stayed attached that I was able to superglue it together. The break is on the main branch of the wing, so if it breaks completely through the whole wing will fall off.She hasn't played with the doll since, as she can see the glue isn't holding great & just doesn't want to deal with \\"breaking\\" it again.It is a very pretty doll, but the wings need to be more substantial.

The commericial makes it seem as though there is some sort of button. Then when I attached her wings only one stayed in really good and the other kept falling out - very annoying!!! But to make matters worse that same wing snapped as we were trying to put it back in. My daughter is so sad - she worked so hard to get this fairy and now she has broken wings and no longer flys...

Lewis discusses the early explorers, the heroes and villains, and takes the reader right up to the times of the Wild Bunch, Tom Horn and Billy the Kid. Some of the poltical intrigue is discussed during this period, and in some chapters, you can see Hollywood got it wrong in the movies. Ever hear of Walter J. Crow, who killed more people than Wyatt, Billy, Jesse and Hickok combined? How about the travesty/injustice committed against the Indian tribes? There's also a lot of material about the western women and African-Americans - oftentimes they are forgotten in the sagas of 'moving west.\\" In conclusion, this is an interesting read for those doing research, and for armchair cowboys like me.

Sadly, it was poorly executed in this book. The book plodded at times, and there was a fifty-page tangent which served little narratorial purpose other than to show that Avisa is a skilled fighter and a good leader.I'm intrigued by the concept of the book, and am sticking with the series - for a while - in the hopes that the writing will improve.

What happened there, and has been happening to the people there since Katrina hit, is a travesty that the world has witnessed. This film brings to light only a few of the salient facts about the whole mess. Just get off your political soap box for a minute, and compare what has been done with and to the New Orleans Area with regard to Katrina - look to see where any real help has come from (private agencies, local volunteers, local businesses, and the like) - then compare what Japan has done since the devastating tsunami of March 11th.

Sadly, this book did not engage this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancer in the Dark","review":"Double spaced pseudo-biography of a woman the author claims (in the title, no less) to have been a 'priestess of depravity'. What exactly qualifies her for that title remains something of a mystery as the book is about as deep and detailed as a long Wikipedia article. Two chapters of its 199 pages eschew Ms. Berber entirely, 23 of the final pages a collection of poetry. There is no index. What's left is a portrait, poorly defined, of a semi-anonymous woman viewed in an equally obscure and ill-defined environment. Overall a vague, lazy, listless disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip to Decadent Weimar Berlin","review":"This book is less about Anita Berber than it is about the decadent social scene of Weimar Germany and Berlin in particular.

Sure, he's a bit old-fashioned and probably slightly chauvanistic in his own way, but Harry was a character I could relate to (considering I'm female), and I enjoyed reading a character who stuck to his morals and tried to do what he felt was right, even if it got people pissed off at him in the process. Sure, it wasn't the best book for a first, but Jim Butcher has a lot of promise in developing Harry's world, like our own, and yet, different, so I look forward to the next book.Safe to say, I definitely consider Storm Front a keeper to be re-read and enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wizard of Chicago","review":"Storm Front (2000) introduces Harry Dresden, the only wizard listed in the yellow pages in Chicago, Illinois. The police have Dresden on retainer to help with unusual crimes, and the two bodies whose hearts have exploded from their chests definitely qualify. Dresden has no doubt that this is serious (and illegal) black magic and begins to investigate the how in order to identify the who with the help of a sex-obsessed skull named Bob. Along the way, Dresden questions a greedy faery and a very hungry vampire before battling a demon and a few scorpions. Luckily, Dresden is very good at what he does, both as an investigator and as a wizard.

Unfortunately for me the SciFi Channel has already converted this particular book into one of its episodes of \\"The Dresden Files\\", so I all ready know 'who done it'.The story is still good. Harry Dresden is definitely the traditional \\"down on his luck\\" private eye character. His assistant \\"Bob\\" is just a talking skull in the book, whereas they've made him a ghost on SciFi.I'm contemplating whether or not I want to pick up the others simply because SciFi is covering the plots.

I've just started on Book 2 and am finding myself enjoying it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"storm front","review":"By far, the best thing about this book is the first person narration by Harry Dresden. He is an instanly likeable character. He admits he has problems with women, but he somehow seems endearing. His sense of humor is just right; even in the face of death, Harry comes through with some jokes. He is serious about being a wizard but also realizes the craziness of it all.Butcher weaves three storylines together quite nicely, and one can't help but root for Harry. I wasn't so crazy about his love interest, Susan. Maybe she wasn't developed enough. I very much enjoyed Harry's cat, Mister, who drinks coke and eats steak sandwiches. The plot stays focused on the mystery and doesn't meander off course. There always seems to be a point to Harry's actions. I waited far too long to start this series b/c I was worried about a male voice being the main character. Though I am a female, I was instanly drawn to Harry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best characters ever!","review":"Harry Dresden is just awesome.

One of Harry's only regular clients, a police detective named Murphy, calls him in to consult on a set of grisly murders. Harry also gets a cautious client who's willing to pay well to find her husband; while business certainly is beginning to pick up, Harry may not survive to enjoy it. Drawing heavily upon elements from classic detective noir, \\"Storm Front\\" is witty, intriguing, and will hook readers on the entire series. Highly recommended for community library fantasy collections seeking something outside the sword and sorcery field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad e-book translations","review":"Ok, I really like reading the Dresden files. But the author, publishers, and all who are involved in making a quality book are ill served by typos, misplaced commas, and these strange annotation markings in the e-book versions.

Main character always manages to set down or drop his weapons just as a fight starts. Magic is boring and inconsistent.The writing could be good, but the author would need to tweak his action and totally redo his plot. It comes off as an adolescent book. There is no complexity, no backstory (other than just monologue), no weight to the world. Characters are flat and can be mixed up. Data dumps.

Sometimes writers get so caught up in the \\"let me introduce you to my character\\" part of writing, that the underlying plot gets lost. I wanted to like this character. I needed to enjoy this book. I shouldn't do this, but after reading and listening to WOT, I hold authors, who claim to be able to write, up to Robert Jordan. Would I recommend this book? No, sorry I wouldn't. There are so many other fantasy type authors who put more life into the story, more zest and guts into their characters, that I can't really recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i had liked it better","review":"Alas, a predictable plot outcome, shaky history, and unengaging characters left me dissapointed. I had been led to this book by a friend who likened it to the older Anita Blake books. Well, if Anita was a man, a wizard, and was without the crazy sex drive, then she would be Dresden. Butcher even used some of her catch lines, and a lot of her \\"if i'm going down, i'm going down fighting\\", attitude. With Anita, it worked and went with her character, with Dresden, it's sort of baseless, and unoriginal. The story was bland, and seemed to be more of an introduction to the series than a self-contained novel. The author may improve in future books, but i found this one so uninspired, and i have to say boring, that i won't be reading them to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fantasy book","review":"This is the first book of a good fantasy series, set in current/this world US. The hero is a wizard/private investigator called Harry Dresden who seems to to stick his nose in things usually larger and more dangerous than what he can possibly handle but still usually comes out bruised-but-victorious in the end. Peppered with good humor the interestingly woven action-packed storyline and gradually built up characters make this book easy and enjoyable to read. As for me, I'm looking forward to check out the next book in the series.On a side note, a TV series (Dresden Files) was based mostly on this one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent combination of hard-boiled noir and horror","review":"Butcher has an original idea and his execution of same is well thought-out and planned. He has created an entire cosmos and then inserted his character, Harry Dresden, into it. The author hits all the necessary beats without being stale, and if Butcher occasionally lets a cliche slip into his prose, or if a phrase is not particularly well-turned, this is more than offset by his commitment to narrative pace and thrust.This is the first volume in a series. It sometimes suffers from the shortcomings common to such books, such as the need to introduce and define many characters, but its bones are sturdy and I am very anxious to read the next volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I'm not a big fan of fantasy, but Jim Butcher makes magic seem both believable and entertaining. The main character, Harry Dresdon, is a brash young wizard who likes to crack jokes in the face of adversity and always ends up in over his head. He works as sort of a magical private detective, never able to pay his bills and constantly in search of work.The first book in the series, Dresdon is called in by the police to investigate a gruesome murder in which two lovers have their hearts somehow pulled out from the inside. In his search for the killer, he crosses vampires, the mafia, demons and butts up against the magical White Council itself.Storm Front is fast paced and doesn't take itself too seriously. After reading the first novel, I promptly went out and bought the next in the series, and then the next....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I picked up this book at a yard sale because it sounded interesting, and lucky for me it turned out to be a very good book. In many ways it's like a classic mystery with your anti-hero private eye, Harry Dresden. The only difference is, Harry happens to be a wizard -- a very powerful one at that. Now, I know what you're thinking: another mystery/detective series where the \\"real world\\" co-exists with magical beings, a la Meredith Genty/Anita Blake and the Southern Vampure Mysteries. The only thing this novel has in common with those is the fantastical setting; otherwise, they are quite different. Without the fantasy elements this could be any other hard-boiled mystery. Being the first book in a series, Storm Front certainly had some faults, but overall it was quite good and I really enjoyed the main character of Harry Dresden, enough so that I plan to read that next few books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good read!","review":"I've been reading Jim Butcher for years, and always found him to provide a reliably good read. Despite the increased cost now that the series is more popular, its worth taking a chance on this series if you enjoy well-written urban fantasy. Now that I find myself reading mostly on the Kindle app, I'm re-collecting in ebook version some favorites I first collected in printed form.

And doing all that, he naturally (supernaturally?) gets into all kinds of trouble and danger. While entertaining and witty, it really left me feeling as if Mr Butcher had taken Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake and swapped 'she' with 'he' and 'her' with 'him'. The same wise-cracking jokes, the same attitudes, the same situations as in, say,Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter). I suppose 'Storm Front' is good for those who haven't read the Anita Blake series. But even then I would recommend they read the latter first! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Of Possibilities, But.......","review":"I really wanted to like this book.

I finished the book but will not read any others from the series. It was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storm Front audio book","review":"Just recently received this. Arrived within the time frame promised. Will reserve judgment until I have had the opportunity to listen to it. Past experience would indicate it should be excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fun! Detection and Magic","review":"Thought I'd help skew the numbers a bit. This book was such fun! It read like a detective story with a paranormal twist; basically very male-conceived with little to no interest in the male/female ratio of matters (though there is a lovely female police detective that helps out Harry time to time) but I'll take it for what it was meant to be -- sheer entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to an amazing series","review":"I am a huge fan of all of Jim Butchers work. The best part about Jim's books, whether it The Dresden Files or the Codex Alera, is that the each book is just as good or better than the one before it. That's an incredible accomplishment since Storm Front is so amazing. The Dresden Files are a lot of fun. And I think that is what reading should be all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series kept me wanting to read the next book","review":"A friend let me borrow this copy. I couldn't put it down. My wife bought me four of the next in line for the series. I love the plot and the stories. Butcher does a great job of keeping adventure and drama packed into this series. Hard for me to put these books down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storm Front","review":"Based on the audio version, I'd call it an entertaining listen. I've enjoyed the TV series based on the books, and the book version,which allowed more complexity, was different enough from the TV portrayal to still be interesting. I did not like the vocal portrayal of the main character by the reader of the audio book. I definitely liked the portrayal of the main character by the TV actor better, and probably would have liked the written word better than the audio version as well (if I could multitask while reading). Also, while I understand what sells, I'd have expected someone as old as Bob not to confuse a love potion with an aphrodisiac."},{"rating":"2","title":"New discovery!","review":"I stumbled on this series of books because of a road trip. I bought the recent book on audio and was hooked. I had never heard of these books I just picked it up on my way out of town needing something to listen to for my long car ride. I then decided to back track and start with book one. It's great reading and I love the main character. I plan to get my husband hooked as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read!","review":"Fun story with plenty of excitement. Really enjoyed the take on some of the supernatural folklore. Good mix of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to this series","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was easy to read, held my interest and kept me guessing. Within first two paragraphs it had piqued my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a detective with a magical fantasy spin.","review":"If you've been looking for a detective who taps into the realms of magic to do his sleuthing, then you've found him in Harry Dresden. Hopefully this is just the start of a long series. Not only does it have a sympathetic hero but an ensemble of helpers to rival Joss Whedon's Buffy/Angel TV series creations. From demons to faeries to cops you will truly enjoy this gang of enemies and helpers. The book also combines the hardboiled and the whimisical much as does Buffy which often switches from the comic to the horrible within seconds. The characters are wonderful and the plot well constructed with seemingly unrelated plot lines coming together at just the right moments. Like the other reviewers I also want to know when the next one is coming out. I'll be looking forward to them from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading quirky wizard scifi","review":"Good light getaway reading for an interesting world different from our own while still being in it. Insignificant amount of rude language and easy to settle into the plot. Enjoyable adventure/mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series Start","review":"Storm Front, Book One of the Dresden Files, is an engaging start to the series. I was hooked from the start. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Kindle book","review":"This is the first Kindle ebook I've bought. I wanted something not too challenging to make sure I liked reading on the Kindle.The book itself is entertaining, very much a traditional detective story but set in a world with magic, demons, etc. Belongs on your shelf next to the Anita Blake novels, the Newford novels, and your Buffy & Angel DVD's. Also, it's much better than the SciFi channel series, which is a very watered-down version.But why aren't books 2, 3, and 8 available on the Kindle?! I have no desire to read them out-of-order, and I'd prefer to read them all on the Kindle (it's great for \\"light-reading\\" paperbacks). Hopefully Amazon will add them soon. I'll be checking regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite kind of page-turner.","review":"This one had me checking under my bed for talking skulls, considering leaving a pizza in the woods for the faeries, and wondering whether I really wanted to look someone else in the eyes. Butcher has a way of making magic seem like it might really be just a step away from our humdrum lives... and not a pleasant step.Good plotting, setting, and drama kept me turning the pages and now I can't wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series which only get deepper and better with every new book","review":"The first two books from these series might feel a bit shallow, but they are definetly picking up depth, speed and emotions after book 3 and 4.If you like fantasy (Zelazny style) and especially urban fantasy you _must_ read this. In my experience nothing better have been written yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban fantasy with smart-aleck wit...

You can't go wrong here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book and the series is awesome - Penguin Publishing Sucks","review":"I love this book and the series.What I do not love is the price of this ebook. I'm pissed at this stupid ebook pricing structure in general but this book just caused me particular pricing pain.Here is a book that I enjoy. I owned a physical copy years ago. When I bought a Kindle and decided to re-read the series I re-purchased this book for $6.39. I was pleased and happy.Today a friend was looking for a new series to read so I redirected him here and he came back with \\"Woah $9 for a book from 10 years ago\\". He is right, the pricing is stupid. Especially the price increase from $6.39 to $9.99. Distributing the ebook did not become more expensive for Amazon (free of charge to the publisher) over the last year.Not Jim Butchers fault. Not even Amazon's fault. The blame for this stupidity and the 1 star review can be placed on Penguin Publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"Sometimes you get a book and you are overwhelmed at how good it is and some you are overwhelmed by how not so good a book is. This book was the later.I had an opportunity to listen to the audio tape of this book (well parts of it) about a year ago. I went out and bought the whole series based on a small listening of the book. James Marsters did a great job. I love his voice and really was the reason why I went out an bought the series.I wanted to like the series, wanted to praise it like many people who have recommended the books. I like the author he is very nice.However, I just could get into Harry. I didn't like the story line, the plot, the characters, and the over all feeling of the book.I can't identify with Harry nor with anyone in the series. The only interesting character is Bob."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty lame","review":"I can't believe this book got so many good reviews. This is what I usually go by when purchasing a book. Nothing really makes a lot of sense and Harry,the main character, is a very indecisive person. I think I might start writing a book also. It couldn't be much worse. If this a indication of what readers are thinking is good writing nowdays, we're in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Shows, but the books?...","review":"I loved the short-lived series entitled \\"The Dresden Files\\", and was looking forward to reading the books by Jim Butcher; but the Kindle price has definitely put me off. And then I am reading from other fans that the Penguin production of it is POORLY done, full of typos and grammatical errors that one has to wonder how any fan could buy this carp?Sadly, I will have to look elsewhere to get my neo-mystery thriller yen on.

It kept me interested until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Harry Dresden.","review":"The main char is great. I was really able to get into him and enjoy the crazy world that is his life. Magic, action, gore, romance interest. Book has it all.

And the book might have been had it not been for all the forced similes in the effort to make characters appear witty, or something. \\"Like a flying monkey from the Wizard of Oz\\", \\"closed like a bank on Sunday\\" - seriously? I can allow for a certain amount of suspension of disbelief at some of the plot holes, but I found myself way too often not being able to get past how lame some of the passages were. I suppose it was worth the diversion, but certainly didn't impress me enough to continue with the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable first in series","review":"Very enjoyable first in the series.. Harry is not larger than life and he does have bad hair days.Bob the skull is wonderful.. very sarcastic and a fun addition to this book.I also loved the cat Mister.Look forward to more in the series although i wish harry would not be so damned nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A character with character","review":"What makes the book and this series so engrossing is Harry Dresden. He's sometimes crotchety, always sarcastic, and always does the right thing even when his letcherous talking skull makes fun of him for it. I can't help but want to know what is going to happen to him next. Knowing that there's no such thing as wizards doesn't make it sound any less reasonable that there would be a listing for wizards in the Chicago yellow pages. It's thoroughly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storm Front","review":"Reading Storm Front felt like watching TV. I kept expecting Highlander cameos. I won't bother to read any more of Mr. Butcher's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very Disappointed!","review":"I am an extreme James Marsters fan and was excited to know his voice is on cd. Yet when I received this cd, I tried playing it on my cd player, nothing. So I tried it on a different cd player, nope! Nothing again. My last try was on my computer, success! BUT!!!... the tracks are all out of sync, the cd doesn't play in the correct order! So buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, and only gets better","review":"This book caught my eye as it was a fun new (to me) mix of genres. This is the first in a series and is quite good - however, the rest of the series just gets better as it goes! This first one is a simple introduction to the characters and the world, without a lot of complexity. The later books gain much in complexity, depth, and character (unlike so many series that get tired and lazy with each passing installment). I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Any book by Jim Butcher is going to be very good to excellent. I have many of his books including all the Codex ones. As far as I am concerned you can't go wrong with a Butcher book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun read","review":"really liked it ,I will buy more books in this series I really had a good time was alot of fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should love this Wizard!","review":"This series was highly recommended to me by other fantasy-book lovers. I enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor and appreciated the police hiring a Wizard as a consultant. It was entertaining and interesting. With all his power, our wizard could be very self-deprecating in a very entertaining manner. I look forward to continuing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have all of Jim's books and this one in paperback. I wanted to read it again and bought the Kindle version because I have gotten spoiled at having my books a click away. The Dresden Files series is one of the best I have read. I am a devout Jim Butcher/Harry Dresden fan. In my opinion these are some of the best books I have read and I really love the Harry Dresden character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent genre!","review":"Up until I read this book, I only new of Harry Dresden from the short lived unconventional TV series a few years back, which I enjoyed.After reading the book, I have to say I am impressed. The book is even more enjoyable than the TV series, and takes a number of steps away from the traditional detective novel. Besides the obvious magic context, there is the hero who makes mistakes - mistakes where people get killed or injured (including Harry). Personal relationships are not neat little packages and mirror real life in many ways.What I liked:The character and the storyWhat I didn't likeThe price of the kindle book - same as the paperback, for an older book? Ugh. But that's okay, because I actually enjoyed the tactile sensation of reading a real paperback..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, magic-filled detective story","review":"Storm Front is the first book of the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher and it is a great ride. It is filled with all the elements of a great noir-ish detective story and elements of fantasy to turn what might be a too typical tale on its ear. Harry Dresden is a fun and interesting character and the world that he inhabits just begs to be explored. I will certainly be taking on more cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Than Disappointed","review":"After reading the Amazon reviews of this book and hearing the author mentioned by other Urban Fantasy lovers, I bought the Kindle version. It took all my discipline to finish this book and at the end I was just scanning the last 60 pages or so to get it over with.First off, the plot had promise and I did enjoy some of the \\"battle\\" scenes. But that's about as much positive feedback as I can give to what I would consider an adolescent read. Harry was one-dimensional for me and I didn't find him particularly funny, even though I enjoy humor. I found I tired of him very quickly.The components of a good read should have been there for me, but the writing style wasn't to my liking the way other UF authors I enjoy is, such as Briggs or Harris.In the end I felt it was a waste of time and wouldn't recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Superficial and Rather Boring","review":"I love a good mystery and enjoy a paranormal slant in a book. What drew me to Butcher's book was a recommendation he made on a Laurel Hamilton (Anita Blake) novel and I had high hopes that it would be a good relaxing romp. Sadly, I was rather disappointed.The main character is Harry Dresden who for all intensive purposes plays Gumshoe specializing in the occult. Often a consultant to the local PD, he is drawn into a murder case which involves the use of Black Magic.The book reads well but regretably, there is nothing new here. The plot is predictable, the characters shallow, little interpersonal development and as for a mystery...you'll know who did it before you're a third through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face Palm","review":"It is not very good. The author has little knowledge of grammar. He also has little skill when writing a story that flows. He apparently has no feel for writing, nor skill for it.The system of magic is hobbled together from other authors' fiction. The characters, dialogue, and plot are very flat. I would stay away from this novel.I have not read any more things written by the author, thus I am not going to advise against any other of his novels. It does take practice to attain, at the very least, skill in writing. I am very surprised this was published at all. This novel needs a lot of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy, and not very good candy","review":"Everyone of the dresden files books are based on the \\"stupid person\\" premise. Harry Dresden is a stupid person. When confronted with a choice where one involves reason and other people or doing something stupid, Dresden chooses to be stupid. This choice is made without exception. Butcher uses pendantic predictable and utterly banal structure throughout his books.Where the writing trods along the language follows with little variation and interest. Butcher cannot seem to make up his mind about profanity using it in clumsy and odd ways. Quaint swear words are used judiciously.Butcher's only way to move the plot forward is to have his character do something dumb and then fight his way out of it. Butcher also announces major plot points with no subtlety or nuance.These books are a colossal waste of time.Yes, I read them. I read a lot of books.If you don't have a lot of time, stay away from this turgid series. It just isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO EXPENSIVE!","review":"I am NOT going to pay 9.99 for a paperback book that can sell easily for 6-7.99!!!! And the Kindle edition??? 9.99????

No--fricken--way!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to the series.","review":"It was a good start to the series with a nice development of the characters and establishment of the Dresden Mythos (the establishment of magic, the social circles of magical creatures and beings, etc.) It was a good read and I did not want to put it down. I thought that someone of Dresden's \\"skill level\\" would not get as beat up and make so many mistakes, but it is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I consider myself an avid reader. When faced with a book that has all the essentials to a good tale; I can't help sharing.

I am not a fan of urban fantasy but after reading this book...I may need to broaden my horizons"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Its a very good start. The books just keep getting better from here on out, too. I highly recommend you buy a copy and get started now, because they really are that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-crafted","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I think Jim Butcher has done a good job of creating a believable world full of magic and monsters. I think Harry is a great protagonist, a good balance between good and evil with a great sense of humour.My only criticism of the book is that there are a lot of things going on that are only alluded to (presumably to be expanded upon in later books), which can leave the reader a little overwhelmed at times.Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first book","review":"This is one of those series, I always look at, but just never seem to start. A friend of mine forced me to start. Man am I glad I listened. This is a heck of a good ride. I laughed a lot while reading Storm Front. Great characters inhabiting an interesting world. Urban fantasy is tricky. Jim finds the right balance of out there, but not to out there. One thing that really caught me off guard with this book is just how exciting it is. It moves at a break neck speed. Twist and turns in almost every chapter. Each one fitting right into the narrative. I am happy to report that the ending is great, and left me wanting more. I am told that the series really hits it stride at book four. This scares me because it is already a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoyed the show....","review":"Ah, the Dresden Files. One of the best short-lived TV series on Sci-Fi, back when it wasn't SyFy. Unlike the TV show, this Harry Dresden isn't as successful. He's thin because he's usually hungry. He's broke. He drives a VW Beetle, not a jeep. Even basic tech like his car is routinely fried by his mystic energy. Things aren't as smooth, as slick. In some ways, it makes for a better book. In others, it's not as entertaining for those who saw the TV show before picking up the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun, Fast Read, Incredible Ride ---- Spoiler Free Review","review":"The book has a million great reviews and mine is another one. The book just zips along, great characterization, great pacing, great plot, great voice....I can't believe it took me this long to read something from this author. He's now in my top ten of favorite authors.Get this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series!","review":"Harry Dresden is the sort of character that I really love to discover. Here's a guy with problems, money and the magik police being the biggest, who none the less charges into the fray just because he must. The mixing of the wizardly world, the \\"never-never\\" spooks, and the mundane works very well in Butcher's writing.In this, the first of the series, Dresden gets caught in a mess of Black Magic, Mafia, and Murder. Nothing like starting out the day with peoples' hearts being burst out of their chests with magic. The magic is consistant, the personalities are true without needing too much explaination. And the culmination of the chaos is very satisfying, while allowing for repercussions down the line in the series.OK, it's not the most challenging of reads (I tend to devour these books in about 2 or 3 days--and I care for two kids!), but I don't want to put them down. These fall into the catagory of books that I rip through with enthusiasm, but am sorry that I have finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arcane Noir","review":"Reminiscent of 'Cast a Deadly Spell', Butcher has combined the incisive, descriptive writing style of greats like Hammet and Chandler with the wildness and fantasy of the best speculative fiction writers of today. I highly approve, and chewed through this volume in a matter of hours. The magic system is firmly grounded, intricate, interesting, and still... magical. Dresden is charmingly blemished and there are enough unexplored angles (Like He Who Walks Behind) that I'm already looking forward to the next book in the Dresden Files. So get writing, Jim. (:"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Grows Up! Great Grown Up Fare!","review":"I am not a fan of magic/mysticism/fantasy fiction. Got nothing against it, it's just not my normal cup of tea. But I was very, very impressed with this first Dresden adventure. The magic was easily woven into the real world and seemed as real as the setting. The narrative voice was interesting as was the character through which it speaks. There's a lot of great action, interesting plotting and a quick, engaging pace. This book was a great read and I'll be back for more! Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"This book was amazing. I loved it. It has all the elements for a perfect book. Mystery, humor, sarcasm, a small amount of romance, and some fantasy mixed in. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Noir is Outstanding","review":"Harry Dresden is a standout character: a wizard with a job, limitations, and a lot on his mind. The development of such an interesting lifestyle coupled with an impressive array of supernatural groups vying for territory in power could be enough, but Butcher adds a plot filled with suspense. Worth one read? Yes. Worth two? Yes. Worth checking out the entire series based on this first book? Definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"I was looking for a good book, adult fiction, exciting, creative, fun.I don't read much so when I do I want it to be good!Well this book was great, so great in fact that I also read the second book \\"fool moon\\". These books are very entertaining, engaging.The whole premise of the books is very creative. I am hooked and will read the entire series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoy this series ...","review":"I bought this book way-back-when and then lent it out to a friend. Well it never came back. So I bought it AGAIN so my wife could get into this series as well. I love the characters, the pace is quick and the mystery/detective work keeps you guessing. Highly recommended if you like some sci-fi-magic-and-investigative-mix in your life. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron Weasley as an adult?","review":"No of course not!However I imagine that Harry Potters friend Rin, would be an adult wizard just like Harry Dresden. Harry (Dresden, not Potter) has a lot of knowledge about magic, but sometimes things don't fall out as expected, and that's how I expect Ron would be as an adult.The book is very exiting, and I can hardly wait reading the remaining books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban magic at it's best","review":"This was a great and fun to read book. The main character Harry Dresden while being a wizard is totally realistic and quite amusing as well. Butcher's views on music are quite kewl as well. A definite buy. I'm waiting impatiently for the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I guess I'm the only one who found this book a bit boring and unoriginal. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters, and I thought the mystery could have been a little more creative. All and all, I probably won't pick up the next book in the series unless I'm desperate for something to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for what it is","review":"I was a fan of the Dresden Files show, so, I wanted to read the books. Normally, print is better than video, but in this case it was not. Butcher has mastered the art of the cliche and the ability to tell me about things, rather than showing me. The writing is as good as anything else out there that is successful commercially, but I had hoped for better. I did not get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The equivalent of straight to video","review":"Narrated in a boringly plain language by the protagonist, Harry, who goes up against \\"some guy\\" that just happens to have gone bad. The villain doesn't even show up in person until late in the book. The primary thing we learn about characters other than Harry is how much shorter they are. Reading the book felt as if I was stuck sitting next to Harry on a bus ride that had me politely nodding feigned interest while wishing we'd run out of fuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"Even though Dresden has noble intentions and desires to help humanity, he practically sedates himself with nonchalance. I don't enjoy looking through the eyes of a fully functioning man (mentally) who can't face reality and has as little ambition as Dresden does. I did, however, find the community that goes to Mac's bar to be very interesting (though it was barely touched upon) and liked how the author tied magic into a drug feud. I also don't like the author's portrayal of white magic. Particularly how he ties it to the pentacle. The magic in this book borders on real \\"magyk\\" which I believe is entirely unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is better suited for a child between the ages of 10-13. Very short. Little detail.","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It could have been a 200 page book had the font and margins been typical. Short. Lame... Just really a kids book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a college education. Possibly even a high school education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring","review":"I couldn't get into this book. The characters did nothing for me and I just found it boring. Nothing interested me enough and I had to force myself to read farther.I am always seeing books being compared the Dresden Files so I finally decided to see what all the fuss is about. I still dont know! I don't know how such a mediocre book got such high ratings. I just found it plain boring and I really did not care at all what happened.If this is his best work I will not be reading the rest of this series or any more of Jim Butchers work. I am always looking out for a good series in this genre, but this definitely isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book supplier","review":"The book is good, but I bought a book used, almost new.

Will not buy from that supplier again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the reviews before buying this book","review":"Okay, I thought it was going to be noir-ish with an occult spin, but I was surprised by the excellent writing in the face of an extremely weak premise. A wizard? Really? Called in by the cops to the scene of an extremely gory double murder even before the forensic team had arrived? I had to delete this book from my Kindle, I'm afraid, even if doing so ranks me as some sort of snob. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thick slice of cheese","review":"So the story with this book goes like this: A young Butcher wrote \\"Storm Front\\" because he was taking a writing class and despised the formula that his teacher insisted was needed to write a publishable book. So he wrote a novel with as many of the ridiculous clichés that the teacher insisted on as he could fit in to prove to her that they would make a terrible book. She read through it and told him to start hitting up publishers.Joke's on us. The book is exactly what Butcher set out to make it be. If you're a reader who has made it past puberty, you will groan, wince, and roll your eyes and how thickly Butcher piled on the cheese with this book.

It seems that half of the questions toward parents have to deal with these movies. It would be nice if the questions were a little more educational, and not so much movie and video game related. I guess that it is supposed to be fun for kids in that they get to ask questions to their parents that they already know the answers to, but I think kids could also learn from having to ask the parents more educational questions.

It is a larger watch than many women's but the detail and the design make it look very feminine. I have small wrist, so I had to remove four links from it, but it looks great and is not overpowering. I don't think I have taken it off since it arrived!On the price - I had been looking at this watch for 3 months. Amazon was hundreds cheaper than everyone else. Many places are selling if for $369 to $499."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful watch","review":"This Bulova watch is very pretty, and I agree with other reviews that it can be worn with more casual attire as well as with a pretty black dress. I have very small wrists, and it is not big at all. Matter-of-fact, I would have liked it if it had been even a bit larger. I have only had it a month, but I anticipate that it will last for years. I wear it almost daily, and I love it. The price was great. I had checked out Kohl's and jewelry stores and their prices were all at least a hundred dollars more for the same watch. I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this watch","review":"I have owned this watch for over a year and everywhere I go, I get compliments on it.

I had to convince the customer support that since i've never recieved a watch in working condition i don't need this to be 'repaired' but a new working watch be sent to me. After a delay of another week i did get one in the mail which seems to be working fine so far.Also the watch looks better in the photographs than in fact. Its a little cheapy looking if the idea is that it looks a little diamond-y."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large Watch","review":"This is a beautiful watch, but just a word of warning - it is BIG! I actually returned it for a smaller one. The watch face is 30mm, which is quite a bit larger than most women's watches. The face was almost the size of my husband's watch. If you like big watches, then you will love this one, it is beautiful, but if you want a normal size watch, I would reccommend that you keep on shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"Purchased as a gift and have had nothing but complaints and issues with this watch.

The dial is not as big as it seems in the product image, however it fits perfect on my spouse wrist. So, if you are looking for a bigger dial, please go to local stores and check it out first.

I love it. It is very attractive...I have received many compliments on it already. The watch is a bit \\"chunkier\\" then the average woman's watch, however it does NOT look like a man's watch, and is still very feminine. The watch looks great with my casual and dressy clothes. It also has many wonderful features that are very easy to use. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!!","review":"My girlfriend absolutely loved this watch.

Five Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful watch","review":"I bought this watch at Macy's and was so happy. Then I happen to surf on Amazon and found out that it was $150 less. I agree with all the positive reviews said about this watch. I couldn't stop admiring it. I even thought it was great at $400. Well, I just returned the one from Macy's and am waiting for my watch from Amazon. I have no doubts about the watch but I hope I can say the same about service from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulova Diamond Chronograph Watch","review":"I saw this watch in a magazine and fell in love with it. Rather than paying full retail price for it, I went online to Amazon.com and found it for hundreds less.

My advise is to go to a retailer and try it on first before ordering online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch for the Price","review":"Just received this watch for my 40th birthday. Diamonds on watches are typically not my thing-but what the heck-you are only 40 once. The watch face is larger than the Tag Hauer, Seiko, Skagen, Movodo, and other high end watches I own & I will say this watch from a looks perspective stands up to each of them. I am very pleased.The only thing I noticed, the write-up on-line says it is Water Resistent to 30 ATMs. However, the paper documentation with the watch says Water Resistant. Not that I plan on diving in thie watch. That is what some of the others are for. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really pleased with this watch","review":"I love the watch. Great size-most womens watches are too small!Just right for everyday and evening wear. I like the band, clasp is invisible so it looks like a bracelet.

I use my hands to talk and emphasize what I'm saying all the time, and I find people are always glancing at my new watch! It's a great conversation starter - highly recommend it.

I wore it sparingly so it would stay nice, using an older watch for everyday use. In spite of that 10 months after I got it it no longer works and the metal that surrounds the date window has fallen off and is loose in the case.I think there are some quality issues at Bulova. Be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This watch is wonderful. I got it when I graduated college almost 4 years ago and have been receiving compliments on it ever since! It's durable and looks amazing! For me, the battery seems to die more frequently than with any other watch I've owned so I find it wise to purchase a lifetime battery replacement warranty from Kay Jewelers (even if the watch was not purchased there) for less than $20 and they will fix it at no cost in the future any time the watch battery needs replacing. Bulova is a great company as well and would recommend any of their products but this one ESPECIALLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!","review":"Great price! Cheapest I found anywhere.

It is the perfect combination. Sporty, Casual yet dressy and really looks like watches costing much more. The size is perfect! Although I am 5'7\\", I have small wrists but big hands. This watch is large enough to make a statement but is not huge like the ones that are on trend right now.I didn't want to buy something that will look out of style in a year.This is a timeless style yet trendy at the same time.

I think Eduardo Noriega is an amazing actor. The one star is not for the movie but for the review on it. I just have to respond to the other reviewer. What exactly is ETA's story? Blowing up cars and killing innocent people? The Basque are in no way being oppressed in today's Spain. ETA are a small bunch of terrorist radicals that want to impose their ideals on a larger group of people. Just ask the Basque."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the summit?","review":"Goran Kropp had a superb adventure but his narrative became exceedingly dull once he arrived in base camp. We had to hear the whole disaster story all over again (with lots of references to Into Thin Air - don't we all know these things already?). Kropp seemed to present his summit as an afterthought. I would have liked to hear much more of that feat and how the ride back home unfolded. Of course the tragedy needs attention too, but I was hoping the book's focus would be elsewhere. In the end, it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goran Kropp","review":"Text is simplistic. An easy style to read but a fascinating story. Well worth reading. The story touches on the 1996 tragedy on Everest and gives some different insights.

It is an excellent book, and I suggest that you read it!(Posted by: Brian Rosenschein, Lisa's son...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have one question.","review":"I want to know if he hooked up with the reporter chick that challenged him in the begining. It was an excellent book with regards to the bicycle portion of his journey. Not wanting to diminish the efforts and tragedy of those on Everest that year, I am nearly sick of hearing everyones angle on it. One or two veiws are fine, but more than that gets old. I agree with one other reviewer in that I would like to have heard more detail on his climb, and on the return trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Read","review":"What an incredible addition to an incredible series of stories. Just when you thought that each installment of the 1996 tragedy would begin to sound the same, along comes another fantastic version. Being a cyclist and an avid hiker I can appreciate the drama of Goran's adventure. I can only dream of coming anywhere close to his accomplishment, that's why this story I will read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Achievement but mediocre storytelling","review":"I expected a much more exciting story given this remarkable adventure. There's a lot of rehash on the Everest tragedy which has already been much better covered by \\"Into Thin Air\\" and numerous other books. Goran surely has much more to tell about his owh adventure through Europe and Asia and then finally the Everest climb. There is also some spotty editing - maybe the whole book was hastily done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I enjoyed reading Kropp's book. It was not a book that you had to consume in one sitting, but one you could put aside for a couple days and then return to. I enjoyed his chatty, straight-talking style, and his taking the time to explain the things he spoke about in a way non-mountaineering people could understand. I knew he had died, but waited to read about his passing until I finished his book. He was an unconventional person who made the most of his moments on this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I just have that this was the most insprational and amazing book I have ever read. It is well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Kropp's problem?","review":"David Lagercrantz should get more credit for writing this book. I am basing this on the information I read on page 220. The book is a bit heavy handed. Kropp seems like an arrogant person. He had no business talking about how bad another climber's English was especially when he had to enlist help to write this book. Kropp's lack of morals as depicted in the book proves anyone determined enough can climb a mountain. It was interesting only because the protagonist was going somewhere. Endangering one's life just to climb a mountain is stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"OHSHC","review":"Ouran High School Host Club: The Complete Series is an excellent buy. The series has an all-star cast of voice actors. The story line is both funny and touching and keeps you waiting to see just what kind of craziness the next episode. The out takes and comentary that are included are both entertaining and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice series, glad the price has has returned to reality","review":"Well, the hype has subsided and the price is back down to a reasonable level. It was in the stratosphere. It was definitely fun to watch. I still laugh at some of the cut scenes right at the original breaks.You already know the plot:The protagonist, Haruhi, is a high school girl who won a scholarship to Ouran Academy, a school for the uber rich. There she is promptly mistaken for a boy, and winds up a member of the host club, where she instantly becomes just about the most popular member. Several host club members fuss over her constantly and are actually rivals for her affection. Her father is a TV which only adds to the hilarity of the whole series.It really could have used a second season, maybe the producers will see the after print demand and will either a: re-release the set, or b: create a year 2, or c: do both.I'm keeping the same rating because i never lowered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouron=Fun","review":"I watched Ouron High School Host Club last year and I can say that it was very enjoyable.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show unreadable subtitles","review":"Whose idea was it to use white subtitles on a show that is mostly bright colors? Funimation that's who. My Eyesight is pretty bad but even if I Could see these white subtitles would be impossible to read.

WHY NOT?You're better off with fansubs.That said the Blu ray transfer is a good one and the show it self is good from what I can gather. But the subtitles make this show almost unwatchable and I refuse to watch dubbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"This anime is among the best I have seen. There are a wide variety of characters that many people can relate to. This romance is most definitely not for young children, because of the strong adult sub-context, but otherwise is a great and intriguing series. Definitely makes you think about current stereotypes and how people can say or act one way, and really feel and mean another. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouran HS host Club <3","review":"First, i wanna say that Ouran High School Host Club is the best anime ever. (just my opinion of course). but the ending was sort of a one-shot.. anyways, speaking of the quality of the discs, its best if you don't wipe or touch the play-able part of the disc or else it will pause unexpectedly during the play of the anime. what im really concerned is that the english subtitles don't exactly match what the character is saying. but overall, im sure you would fall in love with this hilarious anime, just like i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"i <3 this series!","review":"For some reason the blu ray was cheaper then the dvd version.

Funimation came out with this Ouran High bluray a while ago (2 yrs ago)and just recently (May-June 2012)re-released this anime set again, but they still have not fixed the issues with this re-release. What happened Funimation this is the worst bluray ever!!Cons:Bluray Picture quality looks worse than my non-bluray versionwidescreen is not available (cannot change picture size so this anime will never fill you screen)Pros:If you can get over the cons it is a great story with lots of laughs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid upscale Blu-Ray","review":"This Blu-Ray set is a very ugly upscale, most of the detail is lost, its not worth your money unless you \\"need\\" to own this show and you can find it for like $15. Hold out, Mad House might still re-scale the Project files at some point and give us a good release. People will tell you all over the place this show's Sakuga was illustrated in SD, totally untrue it was drawn with a vector based program called \\"RETAS!PRO\\" and can be re-scaled without lossy quality like you have on this set. hold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"Ouran High School Host Club is my favorite anime series so far, so much so that I have seen it multiple times and laugh just as hard each time. Each of the characters are well defined and are as lovable as they are beautiful.Hilarious and heartwarming, it is a near perfect series. There are a few episodes, mostly revolving around the Lobelia girls, that I do not love, but it is a small blemish in the otherwise wonderful series. I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in anime or in cute love stories.Note: This review is for the dubbed version, I have not seen the subbed version. The dub is done by Funimation and Vic Mignogna is fabulous as the off-the-wall Tamaki."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Purchased Anime","review":"I loved this. I have a bad habit of watching or reading things once, loving them and never wanting to look at it again. But this series is so enjoyably, laugh your butt off and scare the dog delicious.

I highly suggest this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink and Spontaneous Love in a Shiny Pink Box","review":"Ouran High School Host Club is the smartest purchase you will ever make (fantastic use of hyperbole, I know).

The show is fun and makes you happy just to watch as the characters go through their silly problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cutter!!!!","review":"I purchased this cutter back in February of 2008. I have been a scrapbooker for over 15 years and wanted a cutter that would cut stacks of cardstock along with chipboard, which you are unable to do with the basic plastic trimmers on the market. I did a great deal of research before purchasing the Rotatrim 15. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase as it was well worth the money. It cuts as sharply today and it did when I first received it. It cuts my cardstock perfectly straight, even with stacks, and crops the photos I print out exactly where I want. As long as you allow your photos to completely dry, it absolutely does not damage them at all. The cutter allows cuts from top to bottom and then bottom to top. I am completely satisfied with this product and will never use any other cutter than Rotatrim."},{"rating":"1","title":"order canceled by company so they could up the shipping charge!","review":"I order this item 2 days ago and was going to pay 5.95 for shipping and today (monday)i got an email that my order was canceled and when i went to find out why ,relized they jacked up the shipping to 12.95!!

The car would consistently overheat minutes within driving it. The mechanic replaced the timing belt, tensioner, radiator, waterpump, thermostat, heater core, all the hoses and the cap and the car would still overheat. When I got the car home I already knew it was tantamount to have no air in the cooling system as it would cause cavitation at the waterpump/thermostat. Just for kicks I bought this and hooked it up and test drove the car afterwards, no overheating. I then drove it on a 10 mile test drive, no overheating. My wife now drives this car consistently to work and back 50 miles a day and it has not used a drop of antifreeze or got no where near hot since 8 months ago when I bought it. The actual value of this car is around $3k.

However, as I continued reading the story turned from interesting social commentary to something right out of an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. The story started to feel like an incomplete, immature rough draft, and was full of inconsistencies and holes. Delany mentions in the preface that \\"They Fly at Ciron\\" is a re-worked version of one of his earliest stories. It rather seems to me he should have worked on it a little bit more. There's the skeleton of a good story, but it doesn't quite seem finished yet. I gave up half-way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all.

This version has a better set of that software, so I'm buying this one. I've had the old one for about a year and it does exactly what it was advertised to do. People who have tried to use the old ones as hard drives instead of just using them for backups are probably using them for something other than their intended purpose, and so you'll see all sorts of reported problems, mostly due to overheating.

Compared to the Braun, the Oster's containers are much larger, and it's supposed to have more power. However, this takes much longer time to puree or chop food, and the result is not as fine as the Braun, especially the chopper - with the braun I could chop vegetables into very fine textures in seconds, but with the Oster it takes minutes and there are always some big chunks that could never be caught by the blade! Besides, when using the \\"high\\" setting there's a burning plastic smell.I wish I had bought another Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they make these so that they break on purpose?","review":"I bought this immersion blender about a year ago. Used it 4-5 times since then and it worked great. Got it out tonight to puree some baby food and the plastic part that attatches the blending rod to the motor housing is cracked and the blending rod just falls out. So, the motor still works fine but the crappy design makes it impossible to use. Can't find a replacement part online, so now I'm looking for a new one--but across the board these are made with plastic. Even the ones that look like stainless are really chrome covered plastic. It really makes me wonder if all these companies are making these as throw-aways instead of making them durable enough for 10+ years of useage LIKE THEY SHOULD. I am not happy about sending this to the landfill and buying another one.

The controls are easy to use, and easy to control the speed, which is important when you are blending in the pot and trying not to make a huge mess. We wash the blade in the dishwasher, no problems.

If the flow charts, input-output relations, mathematical basis, more explaining graphs, figures and graphics were presented, the book would be more useful.

When it was still under warranty, the dealers warranty shop made some (factory authorized) repairs that did help temporarily, but now it is back doing it again. I have checked the alignment carefully, and can find no problem there. We mow about 5 acres of level land with it, and it will consume at least one belt every cutting, and at $36. a belt, it gets expensive. I have tried the Kevlar belts, at the suggestion of the dealer, at $55+ each, but they only last for a cutting and a half, so the extra cost does not justify their continued use. Factory was contacted but they have been less than helpful and could offer no relief. Great concept, but most certainly a design flaw somewhere. Would I recommend it, or buy another one???

Then, it was fine for two weeks until it was again unplugged. Since then, it usually comes right online, but other times can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes for the picture to come up.I would recommend this TV for people who are looking for a bargain on something decent, until HD prices come down more.Although the picture is great, its strength is in the audio.

I'm using it right now and it feels like the palms of my hands are trying to slip down the hand rest to the table. It's very uncomfortable. This keyboard doesn't supply any protection for carpal tunnel syndrome that hand rests are supposed to do. Any one using this keyboard over an extended period of time WILL GET carpal tunnel syndrome.

Good entry level wireless combo for HTPCA trick to increase the range: when I place the receiver in the position it's suppose to be (like this: /\\\\), I only get 6 feet range. But if I put the receiver upside down (like this: V ) I get more than 12 feet! not sure why. 4 stars given because of needing this weird trick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, inexpensive replacement","review":"This is a nice, inexpensive replacement keyboard and mouse set. After a few days to get used to it, I have few complaints. One is that the software supplied does not work with Windows Server 2003. I had to search for an older version (3.1) of Setpoint that is compatible. Another issue is that the keys on the left side of the keyboard click as if they are bottoming out, while the keys on the right are pretty quiet. This was a little annoying at first, but not enough to warrant returning it. Finally, while all the F keys are programmable in \\"enhanced\\" mode, they've silkscreened some icons onto the first 8, like Word, Excel, print and save. If you reprogram those to suit your needs you have to learn to ignore those graphics. It would be nice if they left off the graphics and included a labeling strip that you could customize for your own set of applications or functions. Otherwise, this is a decent purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for my HTPC","review":"I've had this for two or three years now and it's very nice for occasional (maybe one or two sessions a week) use. The wrist rest is a good size for laptop typing, and the key spacing is a tad larger than I'm use to, but it's still fine for touch typing. In my low-usage scenario, the batteries (rechargeable, not included) last quite long--maybe I've changed the keyboard once in all this time. The mouse is pretty standard and I can't say much about it.I find both devices work up to a little over 10 feet, which is just enough so I'm happy. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for PS3","review":"I bought this keyboard to use with my PS3, and I love it.

Both, mouse and keyboard are comfortable and well designed. The mouse has two buttons and a wheel which moves up/down as well as left/right. I've had this keyboard for a little over a year now, and I've had to change the batteries on both devices just once (I use it a lot!) . I have had no problems with this product, but there is one thing that might be an inconvenience to you - the range on this thing is limited. It works great on the desk, but if you want to move around the room and still be able to use it, you might want to pick something else. This is good product for the price you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've used","review":"I really like this keyboard/mouse combo. The keyboard has a nice, tactile feeling and the low-profile black and silver look goes great with my Samsung monitor. The mouse feels very precise and the size is great for me. About the only thing that bothers me is that the keys (particularly the space bar) are a bit noisier than on the one I tried in the store, but I suppose they're all a little different. Overall, though, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard at a great price.","review":"I've been using this keyboard and mouse combo for about 6 months. Set up was very simple and I have not replaced the batteries yet despite several hours per day of usage. Both items look nice with the mouse being the better of the two performance wise. The mouse provides ultra precise movement and took me a couple of days to get accustomed to(versus my old style mouse). Having said all that, if you do keyboard intensive work I would look for a better keyboard. The keys are very close to each other and not at all like traditional keyboard spacing in my opinion. This might be bothersome for someone who does a lot of typing. However, if you are looking for a great price on an entry level cordless mouse/keyboard combo, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"great keyboard for the price","review":"I am very happy with this keyboard and mouse. The keyboard has very useful extra keys that you can use to control a lot of the frequently used programs of your computer. You can configure some keys of the keyboard and the buttons of the mouse. The mouse has two extra buttons that you can configure with what you like. The only problem that I've had is the short distance in which I can use it. I don't know if it is the batteries or that I have the receiver close to electronic devices, but I can only be 6 feet away from the receiver or it stops working. Other than that I would definetly recommend buying this combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap but High Quality Combo","review":"This Logitech combo is a real value. Its super slim design and sleek look make your workstation look very professional. The wireless connection has worked perfectly and the audio/video controls on the sides work great and also give you a nice display on the screen.

It's very light weight, slim and the design is just awesome.One small complaint about the mouse, the scroll buton clicks rather loudly. Other that the mouse works great. I could say that the mouse is on the cheap side, but that may be too harsh a remark.I would have (should have) bought this keyboard first, but the photo confussed me. I was not sure about the silver edge that ramps down. I thought it was going to ramp down too much, and that it would be too large. It's not too large for me, but could be a problem for some.I am very fussy when comes to keyboards, and if you are like me, you will never hit 100%.

It is PS/2.The range is bad, if you aren't on a desk with the keyboard right next to the receiver with line of sight, expect to miss keystrokes.The slim form factor is attractive, but not worth the bad range.The key placement is non-standard, take a close look before you buy, especially if you use home/end/insert keys.I hate bad reviews, but this product is not up to par with Logitech's long legacy of quality wireless products. I have been using wireless logitech keyboards and mice for 5 years now and have never been dissapointed.EDIT:I looked through other products and it seems all of Logitech's current wireless offerings have the new non-standard keyboard buttons.It is marked by a super-long delete key, the home and end buttons going left/right instead of up/down, and the insert key off in Syberia somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reception","review":"I got this from Amazon for ~$50, and the keyboard and mouse works fine, that is if I were to sit within 4 ft from the receiver.

Although I haven't read the English translation I'm sure the story holds it's magical weave. In the original Swedish version he uses language in a poetic fashion that draws out your fantasy and encourages it to bend and twist.Vallgren's own imagination has brought us an amazingly resilient character whose monstrous body holds an innocence that is continually tortured by innocent looking bodies holding montrous souls. He uses his amazing gift to survive and to find the love of his life after they are ripped apart early in the story. And although terrible hatred does form a part of his life, it is no doubt his amazing heart and it's love that pulls the story through to the end and makes his life, indeed, wonderous to behold.Please read it!

This is just excellent. That's the only way to describe it. It's detailed and long, but it's held my interest through the first two books of the series (I'm reading the third right now, and it's just as good, or better than the first two). It's LBJ's biography, but this series is also the best primer I've ever seen on how the House of Representatives and Senate function.

Buy it and read it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Gateway Drug for American History","review":"This volume is probably not as good as the 1st or 3rd books in the series, but it is still one of my all time favorites. Caro is clearly an obsessive researcher, and sometimes he gets bogged down in providing context. But he completely delivers on his objective of showing how Johnson acquired and used political power.To the extent there are flaws they are crimes of passion. Caro has such intense love/hate feelings for Johnson and the detail and storytelling are incredible. Quite simply this series sets the standard for non-fiction writing in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work!","review":"As good as volume one. Just so compelling.

I perused this site to see if anyone knew when the third volume would be out. No one did, so I e-mailed Randon House. Their response: \\"Robert A. Caro is hard at work on the last part of Volume Three of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, in which he shows how Johnson mastered the United States Senate as no one else has before or since. You know the amount of research Caro does, how he leaves no stone or paper unturned in his insistence on getting every fact and detail absolutely correct in his life of LBJ and his history of America in the 20th century. And you know what a great writer he is. Such research and writing take time, and we have not as yet set a publication date.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping intensity of the best detective novel","review":"Robert Caro portrays Johnson as a compulsive liar with a need to prevaricate and steal that could make a politician cringe. I believe that the domestic program of Lyndon Johnson, civil rights legislation in particular, makes him one of the great US Presidents - even after reading this book. Given the disparity in these views of Johnson, it is remarkable that I found \\"Ascent to Power\\" compelling reading.Caro's book is extensively researched and written with a gripping intensity worthy of the best detective novel. His work gave me an insight that went beyond politics to that of human nature, the drive to power and impact that one individual could have on the course of the 20th century.My greatest regret - Volume 3 in this biography is years behind schedule. Robert, stop the foolin' around and finish that book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating and revealing","review":"The story of Lyndon Johnson's narrow victory in the 48 Texas Democratic primary proves that truth is stranger than fiction. Caro, who clearly is conflicted between his admiration of LBJ's political genius and leadership qualities and revulsion at his amorality, writes this drama as if it were a novel, and indeed it reads like one, with larger than life characters (my favorite being Frank Hamer, the old Texas Ranger) and remarkable twists and turns and a climax that is better than anything even the most skilled novelist could make up. If you thought the Florida election was interesting and had its ups and downs, it pales compared to the drama and legal battles that result in LBJ's winning (stealing, to be more precise) the Texas primary. Fascinating and compelling political reading, remarkably well researched and written (much of it based on first hand accounts of the events)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scary look at how one man's lust for power was realised.","review":"The book brought into the open the mechanics of LBJ's rise from the Texas political arena into national politics. I believe that if his supporter's had not been able to blatantly steal a few of his elections by ballot - stuffing, he may have never made it to Washington. As it was, he was unarguably one of the most effective behind-the-scenes mover and shaker this government had seen up until that time. I'm glad I was not in national politics at the time and in his way, or on his \\"enemies\\" list. A scary guy. His ascent to the Presidency has been under a shadow ever since in some debates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious","review":"I was so pleased with Caro's first book about LBJ, \\"Path To Power,\\" that I ordered the 2nd, \\"Mean of Assent.\\" I'm into the 4th chapter of Part I entitled, \\"Too Slow.\\" It is not too slow; it is too repetitious of material in Path to Power. If the rest of the book is like this, I will regret having purchased it. I suppose that the author wanted each book to stand alone. If that is the case, he is losing a lot of readers who find the repetition very unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caro Does It Again","review":"The second volume in Caro's \\"The Years of Lyndon Johnson\\" only covers a few short years and most of the book deals with his run for the senate against Coke Stevenson. Stevenson comes across as a very admirable figure who worked his way to the top. Some historians disagree with the picture that Caro paints, most notably Robert Dallek. However Johnson does not come off as a particularly bad guy. To understand him you really have to look deep through all the bluster.

We might not have lost so many of our finest in Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bad guys win big; the US takes a big hit.","review":"....Caro exposes Johnson for what he was in the 1940s. The story of Johnson's Silver Star will make Vietnam veterans sick to their stomachs as they realize he pioneered the flyover medals so many officers there got.Caro writes the story of how Johnson stole the election that set the stage for Vietnam and the credibility gap.Again in this volume Caro seems to avoid the worst and lowest personal failures of Johnson to spare the families of those whose stories mix with Johnson's to create a particularly desultory and even loathsome thread in American political history.I could not put this book down. Caro writes clearly and he writes with a natural flow that is rare in biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Game is played!","review":"Want to understand hard knuckle politics and what money really can buy?

Johnson. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I feel that this volume, and this part of Johnson's life were quite important...it defines Johnson in his future years. We must take a close look at a man who is down and out, a non-winner, in order to understand the complete man. My reservations with this work come in, in that I feel Caro possible had some sort of axe to grind here and perhaps went a bit over the top is his assessment of Johnson during those years. I grant you, Johnson was probably not the nicest of men, not someone I probably would have liked in person, but Caro almost becomes manic with his digs. On the other hand, the work, Caro's, is brilliant and continues to be the best of the LBJ Biographies. His research is wonderful, and I found, once started, the books was difficult to lay down. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged goods","review":"Item arrived without its handle--only a broken spot to show where it should be.

The album produces instant favorites in Bebel Gilberto's bossa nova \\"No Return\\" and Lambchop's strangely affecting dirty-old-man rendition of \\"Art Lover\\". However, listening to Tim O'Brien singing of \\"his\\" Cockney pride in \\"Muswell Hillbillies\\" strains all credibility. (I know, so what!)Because most of the performances are faithful to the spirit of the originals, the album is a treat just for the songs themselves.

The remaining 140 could be about ANY breed, the information in them is so generic.There are many wonderful pictures of Springers in this book and while that was enjoyable the lack of actual information about the breed was a grave disappointment.If you're really looking for excellent information about Springers one book I would recommend is \\"The New Complete English Springer Spaniel\\" by Julia Gasow & Edward K Roggenkamp. Their book is wonderful, and FULL of information. In fact, it's actully two books in one - the first half being about field-bred Springers, and the second half being about bench-bred. It's well written and well illustrated, with the only downside being that all the photos are in black and white.So that's where I'd go for something more educational. If, on the other hand, you're just looking for a pretty picture book, this one will do nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning tool","review":"Having been attuned to Reiki I and II many years ago and finally preparing to become a Reiki Master, I ordered this DVD to get Mr. Welch's perspective and perhaps have a more visual tool to help prepare for classes.

It is a great little suspense thriller. It is set in the north kingdom of Vermont, and uses charming touches of local color which somehow work to intensify the horror elements in the story. I suppose that, the charming New England country setting, juxtaposed with the events that take place there add up to a very unsettling story.The Gore is strongly suspenseful and so I don't want to give away any of the story because that might ruin the suspense for readers. I will say that I admire how Citro intertwines history, myth, and legend here to produce a novel that is more than a mere thriller, but something of a commentary on human relations.I've lived in CT most of my life and I never knew that New England was a world so full of mystery and bizarre fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Scripture-based counsel on Divorce & Remarriage","review":"Having read the New Testament (and Old!) references to divorce, listened to several ministers' interpretations, and read other books on the subject, I was confused!

Although I understand his arguments and agree with some points in the book, the style of his writing is very poor. My former English teacher would give D to a term paper written in this manner.

Everything about it is amazing. The cast, the FX, the message. It makes you question your existence and the world around you.

The book moves from topical quotes, to more focused collections of anecdotes from Lincoln's life, to a collection of his best known speeches. In comparison to his quotes, the famous speeches may seem somewhat dry. After all, many Americans have read some of the speeches several times since grade school.The book helps to put the Lincoln character in perspective. As a man, he started some place and the stories of his life did not always exist. These things actually happened. Few people realize what a witty man Abraham Lincoln was.

Hennessy has managed to present an unbelievably fair account of how each community viewed the major events in Northern Ireland's brief but contentious history. Most books I've read have a slight nationalist slant, which is usually understandable. However, as an Irish American who has outgrown the simplistic version of the story, I find that too many of these books leave me with more questions than answers. Not so with Hennessy - there is more information in this single volume than in the combined weight of all I've read.Be warned, however, that if you're looking for an easy read and a rough outline, this book will be way too much for you. It is absolutely nothing but the facts.

For example, according to other reviews, this book describes SAS as one of the most spectacular companies. However, that is just the company's excellent PR at work. Obviously there was nothing resembling investigative journalism. To include SAS in this book when there is a wealth of unethical behavior, payoffs, etc. going on there is just lazy work by the authors and questions the entire book's credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Management Consultant","review":"Kevin and Jackie Freiberg have done it again. First NUTS and now GUTS. If you are a business leader or consultant who is responsible for helping organizations to improve their culture, GUTS is a must read. What I love best about GUTS is the Freibergs five years of research proves that you can build an incredibly successful business by treating employees and customers right, having fun, and still make a ton of money. Managers are a dime a dozen. Great heroic leaders are few and far between. GUTS gives you the insight and perscription into what great unconventional leadership looks like.

He does it beautifully. Even though my husband & I are nature fanatics, some of these creatures had escaped our radar until highlighted by Attenborough; many filmed sequences had us watching with mouths agape in amazement, and were partnered with an exceptional score worth listening to by itself (and is included on the DVD in the special features section). I personally feel that the presence of Attenborough in the film served to impress the sense of scale against these creatures, or in the case of the giant earthworm, to give you the feeling of \\"being there.\\" If more of this programming wormed its way into our school systems, there would be a more \\"planet aware\\" generation. This series humbled this human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in the Undergrowth","review":"This is the most amazing and educational video. Everyone in the family loved it.

Quite frankly, I wasn't too excited about watching a show about bugs, but through this show gained a much better appreciation of the insect world. Unfortunately, the makers of this documentary couldn't just stick with facts. Instead of just presenting facts they littered the show with the THEORY of evolution, dismissed God's wonderful creation....It definitly had a pro-evolution, anti-God agenda. One has to be incredibly blind to look at creation (bugs, animals, plants, the human body, the cosmos, et.,) and not see God's handiwork in all of it....the fact that He alone created it all, and He alone sustains it. By the way, there is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever of evolution..never has been, and never will be....don't buy into the lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Evolution","review":"We were all very disappointed with these DVDs.They were FULL of evolution.

It has dozens of beautiful sequences with dragonflies and ants. Watching a spider weave its whole web with silk was almost magical. This easily ranks amongst the best of David Attenborough's documentaries, largely because it focuses on the insect world - which is too often ignored in nature documentaries. The clarity and quality of the footage might not be quite as good as inLife (narrated by David Attenborough) [Blu-ray], but it's still extremely good. And, unlike Life,Life in the Undergrowthis all bugs, all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set!","review":"Although I also own the complete Seas of Life Set, which is a fantastic work on its own right, I am more in awe of the efforts done to make this video. There are so many awesome episodes of amazing insects and their behaviors in this video. Can you imagine an insect able to release pheromones into the air that makes its enemies attack one another, instead of attacking him? It's unbelievable but it's true and it's right here in this video! I am not much of a nature follower, being only a mere spectator so I cant tell you indepth analysis of what all these insect behavior is all about.All I can tell you, is that these 2-DVD set is chuck full of quality footages of amazing insects living their grand little lives, fighting their enormous little wars beyond our normal observation. How the producers managed to get those shots of tiny creatures right on their level is a marvel by itself! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new appreciation for bugs and other tiny critters","review":"This will be brief, as the previous reviewer did such a wonderful job of describing the contents. Suffice to say, as a teacher struggling to teach life science in an engaging way to sixth graders for the first time, this series was a godsend. All of us, myself included, were immediately drawn into this brilliantly filmed, delightfully narrated, and fact-filled journey into the world of tiny invertebrates.

Too much profanity and too many politics for my taste. When he ventured away from both, I enjoyed myself again. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive \\"Filler\\" not Explicit Lyrics.","review":"The comedy central performances are a riot! In this CD Lewis uses vulgar \\"filler\\" words not to enhance the joke sequence but in an apparent attempt to impress an intoxicated audience. Timing and deliverance with the great style used on the censored T.V. acts are much better. After buying this CD I feel a need to shove a pencil in MY ear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This guy is brilliant. While this is far from being a family comedy CD; explicit lyrics, this guy is awesome if you love sarcasm. His timing is impeccable and it never gets old. Some people may not like sarcastic humor, but if you do, this guy is truly in a league of his own. This is not a CD to listen too with the kids in the car, but definitely one to listen to when they are in bed. Yes Lewis does tend to focus on being more liberal than conservative, but that aspect is really minimal compared to all of the material on the CD. Besides, as he says \\"I'm a topical comic\\" and that's part of being a comic; and his bit on Arkansas is priceless!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I, like pretty much anyone else, first saw Lewis Black on the Daily Show and always likes his 'Back in Black', mainly because he is really good to point out stupid things that kinda show western society is in its downfall.Of course September 11 is being discussed and even though he is not the first to discuss Airport Security it remains funny, though George Carlin has the best bit about it.My favorite part is about the end of the universe in Houston Texas, where there are two Starbucks right across from each other. It's hilarious, made me think of 'Best in Show'.If you like 'Back in Black' you will certainly be entertained by this, with the F-word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best stand-up album","review":"Lewis was in great form during this set. He must have been really pissed earlier in the day because his delivery and language were EXTRA coarse. I love when Lewis goes off the deep end but in this recording it seems like he went off the deep end, landed at the bottom and built a house there. VERY funny album, a MUST HAVE if you are a Lewis Black fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny!","review":"Lewis Black proves he is probably the best stand-up comic out today! His humor is funny and hits home on everything from airport security to Starbucks. His powerful energy is very apparent in his delivery!

I laughed throughout the entire thing and still keep laughing every time I listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed out loud....once.","review":"Some of these reviews call this his best stuff, and a top performance. I'd say of the 14 comedy albums I own it's my 14th favorite. What's wrong? It's just not that funny.Lewis is one of those comics that's really wound. He gets all riled up about things. Pissed at this, pissed at that, F this, F that. I like some good cussing, but I think he used the F word 230 times. Loses it's shock value after about 5. But like I have said, he's mad, but the jokes and real humor is just not there. There's almost no wit. It's all observational. He's like an older and angrier Dane Cook.Now I don't mean to say I hate this album, or I don't like Lewis Black. There's just so many others I'd rather hear first.

Vince does well describing Lombardi through his actions and the impact he had on those around him, especially his former players. Everything is written in a clear and easily understood manner, especially his paradoxical nature.However, it does not clear my threshold as a great book. A great book would have involved me not as a viewer from afar, but as a fly in the locker room. Since O'Brien did not play for Lombardi, I was hoping for more insight of how his players felt. I never got emotional reading this book, and emotion is a large part of what Lombardi was about.Basically, it reads like an exquisitely written research paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made.

Unfortunately, the control does not allow for a very precise adjustment of propane flow and thus causes yellow tipped flames (i.e. inefficient and good primarily just for making your pots black) in an open garage. In full outdoors, the flame is difficult to keep consistent and re-lighting is often necessary meaning you have to babysit the device.

Made my nails nice too, huge plus for a hand cream. It is a lotion, absorbs fast, but nurishes like a cream. Of course it depends how dry the skin is, but for mine works well, and I wash hands often, or I am guilty of not using gloves for some chores. Very pleased with this cream, also the fragrance. I bought it at Costco, normally I got it in Europe, it is German pharmacy staple, and a brand trusted fro decades, happy to see it in the US. I also like Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy, and Neutrogena Hand Cream after too much abuse for the skin, when is too dried out.

I was leaving a trail of plastic pieces whenever I opened it! I think that I've reached the intermediate stage after all of this time, but the book is still useful.One note: The second edition has a wire binding and lays flat, like the old first edition. There is a newer third edition, which I haven't seen, that has a normal binding and, I think, does not lay flat.

The entry gives less information on the Leontief than what can find anywhere online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit crying Seahawk fans","review":"Despite other opinions that were made about the game Steelers deserve to win. Anyone who knows the game or played the game, know that in order to score a touchdown the entire ball has to do is cross the goal line. When Big Ben was in the air the ball was on the goal line and even though he was pushed back. In football, they call that forward progress and that's why the play wasn't over turned. Even if the refs miss a call or two, one call doesn't determine the out come of a football game. The Seattle Seahawks had just as many opportunities to win the game as Pittsburgh. The difference was that the Steelers were able to execute and the Seahawks didn't. You can also add to the fact that Detroit is only 300 miles from Pittsburgh and Seattle is 3000 miles, which made this somewhat a home game for Pittsburgh. The bottom line is that the Refs didn't loose this game for Seattle, the Seahawks loss this game by themselves and they have no one to blame but themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Superbowl","review":"I rented this DVD so I could finally watch the game that I missed a year ago, which my parents were supposed to tape for me but they didn't.

A nice DVD putting together the entire Steelers Championship season, with the playoff games having more detail. Of course the playoff win over Indianapolis was exceptional. Steelers fans across the world can celebrate what a good organization can do.

According to Ballard Grant and his subordinates acted as a team while the Confederate side was hindered by constant infighting between Johnston and Pemberton. Moreover,Pemberton was unable to react to Grant's moves, but Grant was looking for new innovative moves to distract and outflank the Confederates. Naval power also played a key role in helping Grant transport troops and block reinforcements from entering Vicksburg. The only drawback to this book is that Ballard doesn't mention new research by Terrence Winschel,Timothy Smith, and others in his book.

After performing a number of backups, I decided to test the restore capability. The softwware tells me how many restore points I have, but when I try to select a restore point, they all disappear. So I can backup, but I can't restore.Which means that this drive is useless for what it is intended, BUT it functions great as just a plain ol' external storgae device.

Amazon Prime is superb.This cutter is simply amazing. I read all the reviews on here before buying it and I was still in awe when I first used it.

It is built like a tank, and it is so sharp it can cut aluminum. It is very simply made, will easily last a lifetime.If you cut papers or other materials often this is a non brainer. I had bought a guillotine cutter at Costco for $25, could not use it for any precise cuts. I was cutting prints using an exacto type tool before and a flat piece of metal. Thank God I did not hurt my fingers. The Rotatrim removes all the risk of accidentally cutting yourself. Cannot put a price on that.

The only issue I've noticed is that over time, the paper guide (that runs perpendicular to the cutting edge) drifted ever so slightly out-of-square. It's understandable that with continuous use, pushing paper against that edge simply shifted it outwards a bit. The shift was only perhaps 0.5mm, which is hardly noticeable, except to the perfectionist like myself. I was able to realign the guide with a bit of manually applied pressure in the opposite direction, and it's back to functioning as expected.

Too bad, it was good while it worked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Oven, Bad Controls","review":"This oven does a good job cooking food. It has a fan which allows it to be used as a convection oven and cook the food faster. There is a pan that is easy to clean.The controls are awful. The labels for the controls are beneath them, leading you to push the wrong buttons. The up and down buttons should be swapped. I'm not sure who designed this, but it's a pain to use. You need to scroll down to the oven selection you want (making sure to push the right buttons), then change the settings for that selection (again making sure to push the right buttons), then you can cook. What would have been nice (and they do this with their toaster) is to have a button for bake, a button for broil, a button for convection bake, a button for toast, etc. Then have buttons or a dial to change temp, time, etc. This has to be one of the worst interfaces I have ever seen while their toaster has one of the best. What's up Oster?"},{"rating":"2","title":"lbenn","review":"Ordered it and three days later it was delivered. Pleasantly surprised. It works very well. Couldn't really say about the convection option, although I have used it. I do not have anything to compare it to as this is the first time I have ever used a convection oven. It does what it is designed to do and the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This 6 slice toaster, convection oven and broiler is almost perfect. The one feature I dislike is the inability to permanently change a toast color. Since my family likes toast brown, I use # 5 instead of the set #4 for toasting. Every time I toast, I must make this change. It is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item","review":"First of all, this product doesn't come with a manual and take longer than our toaster oven we were trying to replace. Were returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange, very good","review":"One of the weirdest books I have ever encountered--but well worth the read. Even with the unbelievable plot I was hooked and haunted. It's both a great thriller and real food for the brain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the new Vonnegut!","review":"That's what Salon called this book and I for one agree with them. People expecting the easy-to-swallow humor of THE BASIC EIGHT might be scared off by this bok, but if you're up for a strange and imaginative trip, pick this up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incest is far from best","review":"I was totally entralled with the Basic Eight and was eager to find more of the same with Daniel Handlers other novels. Unfortunetly that was not the case with this novel. Unlike the Basic Eight it's neither entertaining or clever. This novel was just simply sick. Maybe Handler was trying for the shock effect but the outcome is just one boreing read. If you think you're going to find more of the Basic Eight in this novel, look again, you sure won't find it with Watch your Mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's very sick, but I loved it for its bravery to be sick","review":"When I discovered that Lemony Snicket was Daniel Handler I found thisbook here. I saw the first few reviews and hoped this book was as unusual as it truly was. I was tired of reading what my book group read (sad women finding themselves and living happily ever after) - I wanted to be shocked and challenged and this book fit the bill! I loved it for being different, taking chances to write in a style of being an opera, to incorporate tough subjects for the pop culture (old Jewish mysiticim and incest). I know I need to read this book a second time to understand all the humor but I loved it for being \\"OUT\\" there where most readers won't go. Some parts reminded me of Bee Season and Feast of Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Even after following the directions to fill the steamer below the max line, it still spit out boiling hot water dangerously."},{"rating":"1","title":"it has no on ans off switch","review":"I was very surprised that this unit had on power switch. It can only be turned on and off by unplugging it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Nothing!","review":"I tried this steamer several times with different fabrics and it was a big waste of money and time. It made me appreciate ironing which is a miracle compared to this piece of worthless junk. Mystified by the postive reviews on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely unimpressed","review":"I am returning this product. It just doesn't work like I expected it to. The steam gently floats out, no force to it at all. We tried steaming a shirt and i don't think it made a difference on the wrinkles. The cord is very short and steam lasts for a very short while."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth owning, let alone paying money for","review":"I wanted an alternative to using a spray water bottle for getting out minor wrinkles in clothes, and I figured this steamer might do the trick. It does create steam, and seems to be working properly, but it wasn't enough to actually get any wrinkles out... unless you want to stand there steaming until you've actually drenched the item.Squirt bottle that does the trick - $1Steamer that is only taking up space in my house - $25Your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"this thing stinks. It doesnt work at all, it spits water all over your clothes and the water gets all nasty and gritty....def need to just spend the money to get a good quality one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Magic!","review":"This is such a great product! I travel a lot and hate lugging out an ironing board, waiting for the iron to heat up and spending 20 minutes trying to get my clothes ironed. This takes just 2 minutes to heat up and is very easy to use. It's great for upholstery and delicate pieces that cannot be ironed too I wish it had a retractable cord and this would be perfect. Make sure not to tilt it too far over or you will have a mess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I purchased this because of the good reviews I saw on Amazon. I found that it was larger than I anticipated, thus not suitable for traveling and it did not remove any wrinkles. The water boiled quickly and steam was produced, but all wrinkles remained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"The design of this steamer is dumb. It doesn't even have an on/off button and the electric cord isn't very long. I had to plug it into a power strip so I could easily turn it on and off without having to plug and unplug it every time. It worked well for the first few months, but then started leaking water out of the plastic sides or bottom, so water would be leaked out on any surface it was placed. I know this steamer is inexpensive, but I expected it to last longer than a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright... for a short time","review":"I bought one of these a couple years ago and it worked fine for a little while. the water containers not th ebest design and it started sputtering right off the bat. It's definitely not something that you would be able to use at many angles.. again because the water container only holds the water in a certain position, you would only be abl eto hold it very upright in order to steam anything.Mine also started leaking out the base. I don't know when it happened, but at first I attributed it to all the sputtering that was coming out of the spout.After a year or so it just stopped working. the light would turn on, but nothing would heat up. It wasn't until then that I actually realized that water was leaking through the base (because there's no way it could be the sputter if theres no steam coming out right?)It's a cheap quick fix, but definitely not something I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I have two new curtains that I have packaging creases that I was trying to remove using this steamer. While It does work, I have spent over an hour just doing the 1st curtain. My only negative is that it is a slow going process using this steamer. But it does work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal> Some Issues","review":"This steamer is great! Yes, I agree with other users who say that sometimes it spurts out water but I have noticed that if you keep it a little below the max water line then it stops that issue. In addition, I average about one shirt or pant per fill up as it goes through the water very quickly. Then you have to wait for it to cool down and refill. So the whole process becomes even more tedious then it already is. However, with all that being said it does get the job done and nicely at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient, powerful, and affordable","review":"love this little thing! was replacing another compact steamer that bit the dust after 8 months of every day use. works well for the price. be sure not to fill it up over the max line or water will come out. doesn't hold much but i found that the steam goes a long way. i use it to get wrinkles out out of exercise clothing and dress shirts. heats up fast and the steam comes out strong. requires maybe 2 passes to smooth everything out. i live in a small apartment and hate ironing, so this is perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this item in early July, and loved it when I first used it. Unfortunately, after only about 3 times, I started to feel steam burning my hand as I held it, and all the water leaked out from the join under the handle. It seems to be leaking from the other side too. Since it's too late to return it, I'm now reduced to either trying to find a suitable glue to seal the openings, or throwing it out. It's too bad the reservoir wasn't better made. Maybe I just got a lemon........"},{"rating":"2","title":"You clicked on this, buy it","review":"For the price this is a fantastic product. Whether you travel with it or use it in your home, this product is well worth its price. We use it at our company for trade shows we attend to remove wrinkles from our fabric materials there (tablecloth and 10'x10' banner). This product works great at removing both creases and finer wrinkles typically in 1-2 passes. The slower you go on each pass, the more effective it is. Fill to the fill line, plug it in, wait about 2 minutes, and you are ready to go. Typically the water lasts for about 10-12 minutes of use, and it has a few attachments that help remove wrinkles even better. Just be sure to empty all water when done using (and keep the lid off to let any excess moisture evaporate before screwing on lid). Also, handle is very ergonomic and makes this product even easier to use. HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"The Steamfast does get really hot, but not hot enough to steam out wrinkles in dress slacks. I wanted it to steam out and refresh my husbands dress slacks in between visits to the cleaners. Unfortunately it just didn't work. I tried slow and right on the fabric. I even tried to with the pants inside out. Didn't work. I was happy I was able to return it. Still searching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would hesitate to buy this.","review":"I wanted to steam iron linen shirts to keep that sightly wrinkled appearance they have when first bought. A regular iron would not do the trick, so I opted for this handheld steamer. It makes no impression on linen wrinkles at all. I regret buying it and am relieved that it was cheap, though I paid through the nose for shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited usefulness","review":"I have only used this twice now, and both times I filled it with water below the maximum line. Unless you only put about half the water in that is indicated by the maximum line, it spews water badly. I was careful to hold it horizontally as the instructions suggest. Because you can only put in such a limited amount of water, you have very little functional time. For that short time, it works okay, but you better work quickly. I am disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"SteamFast","review":"The SteamFast met all my expections. I had to dress tables for awedding shower. My only suggestion, don't expect to do all thepressing once the tables are dressed. Do your \\"ironing\\" first,then press out the wrinkles from the travel. The SteamFast worked,but it takes much longer to do the complete job. I would certainlyrecommend the SteamFast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Depending on how wrinkled your shirts are, this can do several before needing to be refilled. My shirts were horribly wrinkled (to the point where I thought I might take the the cleaners just to get the wrinkles out), and this steamer got them all out! It's also small enough that I can pack it and take it on trips with me.My only complaint is that the cap threads are made of a softer than usual plastic, so you need to be careful you don't accidently cross thread it and damage it. Just be careful and don't try to force it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another positive review","review":"I'm a professional photographer. I set up at pageants and do portraits for the winners. I use a travel studio set up and my backdrops get terribly wrinkled. This steamer travels pretty well and makes my backdrops look great. Be warned, there is no start/stop switch and if you travel with it there is no cover for the spout so make sure it is empty and fairly dry before packing up.I've also used this on most of my dress shirts/pants and it does the job well. Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and I bet you will be to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"This was thin, light and cheap. But it was also big, too large to travel with. So I bought the Steamfast stand-up version and it works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size compact unit","review":"Works well, has 2 attachments. We use for at conventions/shows for the table cloths & banners. Put that and a bottle of water in together and ship it to location. We pull it out, plug it in and in a about a minute or two we are steaming with the best of them. There are bigger and better steamers, but for the price and 2-day prime this was and is perfect. Good solid top screw that is tight and clear fill level window to see how much water is in the tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric Steamer","review":"Not impressed with this steamer. I returned it thinking it was defective in some way. All it did every time I used it was spurt out hot water and soaked my clothes, instead of hot steam and steaming my clothes. Also, there wasn't a button to control how much steam came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as well as a steam iron.","review":"Did not like the fact that my steam iron does a better job and it was paid for. I bought this because someone at work told me it was great for polo shirts. The steam iron is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty crappy","review":"It does worka bit, but unless you havce a lot of free time to lose, or you find using this relaxing, this is not worth it at all. It takes too much time to do a shirt and you have to refill it for every shirt. I rather work an extra couple of hours and just send my shirts to the cleaners. Weak product.overall, I say it's better to just use an iron or cleaners, definitely dont get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as advertised","review":"We returned this excuse for a steamer - didn't do the job. Back to using the old iron and board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bulky cord too heavy and inflexable","review":"it makes steam; not a lont of it.bulky item and the cord is not good at all.too thick. needs to be flexible and is not.hard to use.i would not purchase again. should have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This steamer works VERY well and wasn't nearly the cost of others I have had that didn't work so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Steamer","review":"I read the reviews and head this was a good product. After receiving the steamer, I quickly put it to the test, as I had a few wrinkled items I needed to steam. The steamer did work quickly, however, it was not that great at getting the wrinkles out. So it a decent product, but it's better for a quick steam rather than a really wrinkled item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"This is perfect to use sometimes,This is not to use daily.The cordless is short.Is fast and compact"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spits water - a lot of water","review":"1st use was great, second and there after - it spits a lot of water... I want to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"It is very useful for busy people. I usually have to wake up early and run around to get ready for my day. This steamer helps get my clothes straight quickly and saves me so much time. I use it as a heater sometimes when my room gets too cold. Lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i have expected after all the reviews i have read.","review":"i read all the reviews to make sure this one was right...but unfortunately it sits there..can not use it...spills out water and the steam is very weak,and it stops steaming after every release of steam for some seconds and starts again afterwards.and i purchased two of them one for my sister-bad experience..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No shut off","review":"The steamer works well, but there is no on/off button nor is there an automatic shut off.I left the steamer on with a little water left, hoping to just steam a tie, and went to check on something. The water quickly evaporated and the steamer kept burning, so the steamer started burning the plastic and melting. The whole room smelled of burning plastic and the steamer can no longer hold water. Be careful and always keep an eye on the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on cotton knits, good enough on khakis","review":"I got this recently and steamed my wrinkled sweaters t-shirts, white cotton dress shirts and dress pants and khakis. The white cotton dress shirt and khakis took a bit longer to smooth out, I found it works better when I put the steam nozzle right up against the clothes, but the knits and t-shirts smoothed out very quickly. There was some wetter spots on the clothing by the time I got done, so if I had to go out the door right away, I would rather make sure I steamed my clothes at leasts 5 or 10 minutes earlier so it's not damp in spots. It heats up to a boil pretty quick, probably around a minute or so. I wish they would put an on-off switch on it, as you've got to point it somewhere safe when you put it down to switch to a new piece of clothing, but other than that, I really like this steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compact at all--Do not buy for travel","review":"I bought this steamer and it's not even vaguely compact. You cannot use it for travelling because it's much too large. The word \\"compact\\" should not even be in the title of this product. It's a large steamer with an industrial size cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WANT WE WANTED","review":"We were looking for a portable steamer that would help get out the wrinkles on the cotton fabric of our Pottery Barn Couch. Worked just great! We will pack it on our next vacation trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Doesn't hold very much water but it does the job and heats up fast when refilled. I would recommend this product. It does a good job and is easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy little steamer","review":"This steamer worked great on drapes I had recently hung that had creases in them. Brought it to my daughters new apartment so she could get wrinkles out of her new curtains and she liked it so much that she kept it to use for her clothing as well. It holds a decent amount of water and the cord is nice and long. We didn't have any trouble at all with water dripping or spitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks water","review":"Worked first time I used it. After that, it spit hot water all over the garment and dripped onto the floor. I followed directions exactly. Must be defect in some of the steamers since others reported same thing. If you buy, hope for a good one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"Works pretty well. However, after a few months it started leaking water out of the bottom. It's cheaply made, I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Oh Oh","review":"This steamer was bought based on others reviews. It does not take out the wrinkles from the clothes even though they were ironed before riding in the suitcase. The steam does not come out with much umph! I would not recommend this for the business traveler who needs to be presentable and will rely on this product to have their clothes looking okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I have no complaints about this steamer. It has worked very well removing wrinkles on all fabrics like knits, wools and silks. Furthermore, when used on jackets and coats it leaves them like they would just have been to the dry cleaner.To use it, I fill it with water to the MAX line and it starts steaming in a very short time. The steam is good enough for two garments, but that I do not consider a problem since it takes a short time from the refill until it starts steaming again.I like it so much, that since receiving it, I am looking all the time for something to use it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"make sure you empty it - mold","review":"I made the mistake of not emptying the water - and it molded over on the inside of the machine. the machine itself is great, i steam all my dresses now, but i couldnt find a way to get in with a sponge to clean it, so im hoping the boiling and letting it boil outside killed the mold and put it to the outside air... hopefully?"},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I had to return this little steamer. It didn't really worked on my clothes' wrinkles, just warned them a little. It sprayed hot water everywhere and didn't do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"Thanks it was shipped on time. Works good but use the water quilky. It takes out the wrinkles and leaves it fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"choose another steamer","review":"This steamer works ok, but after only a couple of uses, the bottom of the steamer is coated with rust & mold. Gross. There's no way to get in and clean that area of the appliance. I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have had 3 or 4 steamers before this one, but it is an easy call to say that the SteamFast was by far the worst so far. If you fill it with more than about an inch of water it will spit hot water on your clothes. Since you can't put much water in it, you have to refill often but it isn't that convenient to refill since the refill lid takes about 20 turns to open. After about 10-12 uses the SteamFast started tripping the circuit breaker which, I suppose, is a good thing since it gives me a good reason to pitch it and try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water spits out of this like a roman candle","review":"I was excited about getting this and it worked great the first couple of times, but the water runs out really fast and you have to wait 5 mins between refills which is a pain. Also I did exactly as the instructions said using the correct water, filling it to the fill line and at times water spit out of it like a roman candle. We even tried turning it off for an hour, filling it below the fill line etc.. and it still spilled water out. It comes with two attachements that are supposed to help with spitting but the water just dribbles out and that water is HOT! I burned myself twice. I would not suggest this to anyone. The sad thing is I did alot of research on these and I thought this one was the winner now I don't know what to beleive by reading all these reviews it seems like some work and some don't. I will be returning mine and trying another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I like small handheld steamers but they never seem to last. This one was no different. It started to leak water out the sides after a couple of months and then it kept tripping my outlet breaker which scared us so we tossed it. Definitely does not seem like it is built to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back","review":"It takes longer than ironing, removes fewer wrinkles than ironing, and in some cases even adds wrinkles - by spraying water droplets instead of steam in random places, then the fabric puckers around the water droplet and I have to iron it to remove the pucker.(And yes...I filled it below the max fill line and made sure I was holding it completely upright - it still sprayed water.)So I sent this back and went back to my iron... ironing wasn't that bad, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Price","review":"We've recently modified our morning routine to include getting out the door with a 4 month old baby (i.e. hauling out the loud, creaky ironing board and plunking it down in the middle of a major thoroughfare isn't always an option). For the price, this steamer was perfect.It heats up quickly and makes your clothes wrinkle free. One caution is that the product is either plugged in and on OR unplugged and off. And the water inside is boiling, so you need to make sure you have a place to sit it down where you're not at risk of steam burning anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"This steamer works great on every day clothes materials. It works for about 12 minutes and get wrinkles out very quickly. It take very little time to heat up. Using distilled water works much better. Only downside was I tried to use it on thick material curtains, didn't work so well. Overall I am very pleased, great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing for the ironing-challenged","review":"I don't know how well this steamer would please Martha Stewart or my mom the home-ec education major, but if you're like me and actually make clothes MORE wrinkly with ironing, this steamer is a life-changer! I mostly have knits and synthetic blends (due to the aforementioned ironing issues) but they can still come out of my commercial dryer pretty wrinkly sometimes. This steamer pulls those wrinkles out in seconds. Also works great on wrinkles that happen from clothes being packed in an overcrowded drawer. No more rewashing just to remove wrinkles! And hello again to the clothes in my closet that I never wear because I couldn't face up to the ironing. The cord is plenty long enough for me. I plug in at the kitchen counter, hang the item of clothing on the cabinet knob over the refrigerator, and steam away! Happy steaming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"changingspirit","review":"I no longer have an iron as long as I can steam press my clothes. They look fresh and just as if I took them from the dryer before wrinkles set in. I am very pleased at the performance of the SteamFast SF-435W, a compact fabric steamer that makes me look very professional wearing my styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little steamer","review":"Very pleased with this steamer. Wrinkles disappear like magic. Lightweight and easy to use. Takes up very little storage space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for delicate clothing!","review":"I received this for Christmas and I love it! I use it to steam my daughter's pageant clothes which are very delicate and sometimes the dry cleaner won't touch. It's small enough that I can fit it in my suitcase on vacation too. The only con is that I wish it would have come with a steamer glove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable piece of junk","review":"We used distilled water, we only partially filled the tank and the thing still just sputtered and spat water. Waste of $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look it's a fountain!!!","review":"Terribly disappointed with this product. I used it acceptably for about 5 minutes. After that this thing just kept spewing water like it's a fountain. And YES, the water line is below the MAX line! Yet another product here at amazon that makes me wonder who writes these really high reviews. I think it's a bunch of guys from the maker of this steamer flooding amazon with great reviews to increase visibility for their product. This is a massive fail product. Unless of course you are looking for something to spray your garden with or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little steamer!","review":"I need a steamer for sewing with fabrics that can't be flat-ironed, such as velvet. This little steamer does what I need it to do. It allows me to remove wrinkles without flattening the pile.It would be nice to have some control over the rate of steam. However, for an inexpensive steamer, one \\"speed\\" is fine. I learned to avoid holding the steamer too close to the fabric, or too long in one place. These errors tend to saturate the fabric with water. With some practice and patience, I was able to get good results on velvet and silk charmeuse.The steamer is also useful for pulling wrinkles out of my business clothes. It's helpful to have an alternative to ironing that doesn't cause shiny spots on the shoulders and seams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy.","review":"I bought two of these for use (a) prepping my daughter's wedding veil before the ceremony and (b) steaming out wrinkles for fabric used in the reception. It did nothing. Nothing. Given a choice between this product and a steamy bathroom... believe me when I say, you are truly far better off with the steamy bathroom. I've purchased many things on Amazon over the years that I absolutely love. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I even read the reviews prior to selecting these; some people love this item. I found it useless and I have used steamers with no problem before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I thought this little steamer would be perfect for removing wrinkles before I leave the house for work. It worked great the first time that I used it, but that was it. Since then it spurts water over the clothing, leaving large wet spots-what a mess! It is also dangerous, because the steaming water spurts onto exposed skin as well. I am careful not to fill the reservoir above the fill line. I have gone back to using a wet towel and hairdryer to freshen clothing before I leave the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous steamer","review":"I purchased this to steam some wrinkles in a wall of drapes in my living room and dining room. I have shoulder problems and didn't want to have to remove all the curtains, iron them, then rehang them so I thought a steamer might be an easier solution. I can't believe how easily and quickly the creases and wrinkles were removed with this steamer. It's like I have brand new drapes now. Wonderful product. Sorry if I'm gushing but the drapes have been on my mind for a while now and it's a huge relief to have them looking so spruced up and crisp-looking. Very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it while it lasted","review":"I thought this little steamer was good. It was small, but it got the job done... for a few months. It almost lasted a year before it just stopped working. I didn't expect much from a 20 something dollar steamer, but I thought it should last at least two years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great short term, terrible long term","review":"The steamer worked absolutely great the first few months but then started leaking and left water stains on my desk and floor. Now I need to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was excited to get a small steamer that would be easy to keep in my bedroom to steam on a dime. If I had the original box still, I would be sending this back ASAP. Even though it was not filled to the max line, it started spitting out hot water everywhere. It claims to only do so if it is filled up too much or is being held horizontally. Neither was the case. It was so volatile I couldn't even bring it CLOSE to what I needed to steam. COMPLETE WASTE OF MY HARD-EARNED MONEY. Very disappointed. Guess I'm going to have to go back to a big bulky steamer after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks terribly after a few months","review":"We've had this steamer now for about 6 or 8 months, and it was good enough at first, and we liked the design.Not having an on/off switch was a bit strange, and the cord has shown itself to be too short. But the worst by far, and the reason we are throwing it out and replacing it with a different model, is that the unit leaks water continuously whether unplugged or not. We have managed to ruin a few pieces of furniture, at first we thought perhaps we weren't being careful putting the unit down, or had forgotten to unplug it. Alas, not true. As others have reported, this steamer just starts leaking at some point, and never stops after that.Too bad, because the design seems ergonomic and practical, and it is nice to hold and use. But not if it's dripping water all over everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super simple, travel friendly, and QUICK!","review":"This little steamer heats up quickly, is light weight and easy to pack, and I'm never concerned about leaks. Its super simple to use (unscrew cap, add water to line, plug in - DONE) and is powerful. I even used it to relieve some congestion I had by locking myself into the teeny hotel bathroom and filling it with steam :D Very versatile!I wish the reservoir was larger though, because I can't use it for more than a single outfit before having to refill it (which requires a five minute cool down first - and then a reheat). However, I'm sure a larger reservoir would cause the device to be larger and really the compact travel aspect is the most important."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe for travel","review":"This got two stars because it does actually produce steam. Unless it is held perfectly straight up and down, won't operate properly. Spits water. It does have a nice design, but for everyday use in place of an iron, forget it. Better for travel when having to touch up folded clothes. Unfortunatley, I don't travel anymore. I almost returned it, but thought I would wait for an opportunity for clothing. I had gotten this for newly hung draperies which I had to take down and conventionally iron anyways. Good yard sale item. Maybe I can give it to one of my boys. I don't do that much ironing anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little high volume steamer","review":"This product is great for at-home steaming. Wrinkles released right out of my Dockers pants. The steamer heats up quickly, puts out a lot of steam, and holds more water than other steamers so you don't have to refill as often. I only used about 1/4 of the water on an entire pair of wrinkled pants. I plan on traveling with this to a wedding to steam my Bridesmaid dress after it's in my suitcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Lifespan","review":"I had my steamer for about a year, only using it a few times during the year and the most recent time I discovered that it was leaking. There are little plastic feet on the bottom and somehow water was able to get out of the steamer through one of these plastic feet. I don't feel safe using a steamer that is plugged into the wall while leading water all over my counter. Worked fine until it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied","review":"Tested and not approved! Product very weak, heats water but does not stretch any clothes. Tested in various tissues and none of them was good. You spend a lot of time and do not have any result. Unfortunately I will continue with the iron-to-pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really excited at the thought of easily and quickly being able to release wrinkles from my clothes with this steamer. It heats up quickly and makes a lot of steam, but struggles to release wrinkles in fabrics that are any heavier than a very light cotton. It worked semi well on a summer blouse I tried it on, but with the lightweight sweater that I used it on, I didn't really notice any improvement. When using it, you have to be very careful or you will end up steaming new wrinkles into your garment. It also seemed to piddle and drip water quite a bit. For as long as it took to use this to steam clothing into a somewhat acceptable and wearable-in-public condition, I could have done a much better job with a standard iron, probably in less time. This product did not meet my expectations and will be going back.Pros: Heats up quickly, seems to make a lot of steam.Cons: Steam isn't effective on fabrics heavier than light cotton, unit piddles and drips, end up steaming in new wrinkles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"I bought this for a special event so that we could steam clothes and not have to iron them. It works really well and the water heats up super fast. Just be careful operating as the steam will be VERY hot. The only downside was that I wish I could've used it horizontally too (without boiling water spilling out), but I knew that I couldn't before I bought it. Very pleased with the purchase though."},{"rating":"1","title":"spray or not to spray that is the question!!","review":"This steamer sprays water out used it the first time and by the time i used it for the next piece of clothing it was spitting water out of the spout.

Disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this!!","review":"I've never used a steamer before & am now in love! It's SO much better than ironing curtains. I bought new curtains (cotton/poly) hung them on the rods & steamed all the folded marks right now!

Instead, the authors put lots of unnecessary information there, which we can find more in detail from other sources. We do not get what we really want from this book. I am surprised this book even got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much BAPI specific information","review":"There are only 13 pages which detail how to create your own BAPI and the extra 50 pages on BAPIs mearly list the BAPIs that SAP delivers with less documentation than SAP already gives in their BAPI transaction...Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to look at the book before buying it because I bought it at a large conference in between classes. If I had spent 5 minutes looking at it before I bought it, I wouldn't have. But since the previous ABAP book from the same publishing company was of very good quality, I bought it thinking it would be the same quality. Since buying the book last year I've only looked at it for about 20 minutes. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"One of the junk books I;ve read lately. Poor content, structure and presentation. Lots of pages but no information. The authors/publishers tried very hard to increase the book size with all sorts of tricks. About thirty pages of the book are either blank or have chapter titles but no useful info. Not many useful code samples. The chapters on Java, OOP etc are really not necessary as there are lot of excellent tutorials/free books available on the internet. Very little information on the actual Java&BAPI as the title suggests. I;ve noticed a couple of errors in the Java related chapters. I will be very surprised if rest of the book is error free. Please do not waste your money by buying this POS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This lotion is completely non-greasy. It's absorbed into the skin thoroughly and leaves no residue. After it's absorbed, my skin feels naturally soft like it did when I was younger.

He refers to slaves but there are no \\"real life\\" information about that in his writing. This book begins with a fictionalized (but possibly historically accurate) portrayal of slavery in that time period and then the book introduces us to Paul and the new believers. Their lives cross paths and are forever changed. The slave also journeys to some of the other big cities at that time and tells us what is happening in Rome, Athens, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twice Freed","review":"Twice Freed by Patricia St. John deals with the subjects of consequences, and accepting responsibility for your actions.

It isn't that St. John doesn't grasp the horror of slavery, in fact she plays it down a bit but this is more for children and teenagers than adults. But the period, 1st century not long after the death of Jesus, is too early for so many Christians, especially among the middle and upper classes of Rome, to be running around everywhere. The character of Onesiumus though is well done and shows complexity and conflict where it should -- other characters too are fairly done. Its a good book to preach with, just not a good both to teach history from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size and color","review":"I have a small living area and needed an ottoman in front of my small sectional.

The color matched my leather chair perfectly and the accent stitching also matched that on the chair.

So you lose the original creation date whenever you copy a file to the drive.The second is an annoyance. Whenever you lose power and then power is restored the drive remains off.

I'm absolutely flabbergasted to find this is out of print and going for $80-$150. This CD should be in everybody's home. Yeah, it's got its Brian Wilson undertones (big deal), and its Big Star fixation, but it's really a lot more than that. The closest I can think of in today's terms is Fiery Furnaces meets New pornographers - but twice as goood as either of those (awesome) bands.Just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative History of Science","review":"A thoroughly readable and enjoyable book about the intellectual colleague and contemporary of Christopher Wren and Isaac Newton in 17th century London. The writing is witty and engaging and provides a vivid look at the social, scientific and physical structure of London after the Great Fire. I especially enjoyed the author's humorous descriptions of the machinations behind the scenes of the Royal Society and the often dangerous and bizarre experiments that Hooke and others would perform for the Society. A great peep into the development of many engineering, physics, astronomical chemistry and architectural discoveries."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Outdated It's Useless","review":"I got the Fourth Edition (2006) for CPE.

She has carrot red hair, brown eyes, a flat chest, tall, and a big nose and she has freckles from top to bottom literally. Even the hero thinks she's ugly until he see's her tiny nipples. I just couldn't believe she would do something like that. The book is hysterical and I love all the characters and the heroine has a graet personality.

The author seemed to believe that people can make poor life choices and should not have to deal with the consequences of their actions. I'm in my late 20s and yes times can be tight and student loans suck, but I made my choices and will deal with them. Based on the 1/3 of the book I read, potential readers are better off reading about how to manage their money, and not read about people whining about not having any. I can't remember who said it, but one of the best qoutes about money is \\"It's not how much you make, but what you do with how much you make.\\"I would suggest reading \\"The automatic Millionare\\" for a good how-to book on finance that anyone can understand.

The median home price today is approximately $210000. I suspect her rent in NYC several years ago was atleast that. Living in NYC on fresh-out of college wages is a foolish extravagance.

The most dramatic improvements will be in future health. Shifting 10 to 15 years into the future , we will see 40 and 50 year olds in 2015 or 2020 will never have to worry about obesity or a multidude of diseases including cancer.This is another in a long series of books which unconvincingly argues that \\"things have been getting better and better...until now.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I know it's tough, but.....","review":"I really enjoyed a lot of the statistics and examples that Draut used, but the whole book just drowns in the \\"woe is me\\" & \\"It's not my fault\\" feeling. She totally dismissed financially immature actions, such as the one gentleman who kept flying and adding to his credit card bill because he and his spouse thought keeping in touch with family was more important than being responsible, or the need to go to every Tom, Dick & Harry's wedding.Without a doubt, it is more expensive for young adults to get started on their own today, but I think Draut reached the wrong conclusions for the some of the facts she presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book regurgitates the obvious.","review":"If we go to college, we have to pay for it. Many people take loans to pay for their college education. When one graduates college, they must repay those loans. To pay back the loans, one must make money. To make money, one must get a job.College costs a lot. That sucks. Today's 20- and 30-somethings spend too much because they live in a society that is driven by the \\"I NEED this\\" and \\"I NEED that\\" just because the Jones' do.It's a vicious cycle.That's how I felt about the book -- it was very cyclical in that it seems to just keep repeating the same thing over and over again.I didn't get much out of the book.

As a graduate of New York City's public schools, including City University of New York for my undergrduatcy through my Ph.D., I find it hard to be very sympathetic. My dad was a civil servant. I was on an airplane once before I started flying for work. I have never owned a new car. I lived in a studio apartment until I got married, and worked a variety of introductory-wage jobs to pay my way through college.

All problems with the financial sucess of the youger generation are the fault of the government and young people just can't afford to live in New York or LA.She misses the fact that the tax load in the 70's was about 1/3 of today's load and people could save more. She misses the fact that a large expensive college degree is a waste of money for many people. She is also ignorant of the fact that many younger people are being very sucessful without an expensive degree and in smaller cities and towns.Basically the book is a waste of time and money and I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, won't the government save me!","review":"The author spends most of the book blaming outside influences. The only good part of the book is the statistics the author brings up that stimulate thought. Unfortunately she ignores anything that contradicts her stance rather than address the counter points to add validity to her argument.In the end this author wants the government to do the changing so she doesn't have to.

Beef is priceless, I wish Bruce had written more.I suppose it helps to be familiar with the three detectives he's poking fun at, and it also helps to have a sense of humor. Much of the genre at the time was clever but dull, humorless, and plot-driven. Bruce is great with a plot, but is also able to create memorable characters.If you enjoy Edmund Crispin's books, you'd probably like this.Anyway, I can't recommend this book highly enough. Would also recommend anything by Anthony Berkeley(but not at the insane prices people are charging here)- he and Bruce are my personal favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to assemble","review":"I echo a previous reviewer's experience. With the rubber gaskets we were provided, I do not believe that the laws of physics will allow assembly. I am fairly adept at assembling this sort of thing, but have given up on this product. When the directions warn you that assembly will be difficult, take this warning seriously. I also note that the \\"pulleys\\" provided with my unit are different from the illustration in the instructions.

My son wanted to have a way to consistently launch planes to compare their performance. This launcher will not launch a single plane in a way that meets the need. The motors are so weak that as soon as the plane begins to go through, the thing bogs down and stops. We have tried many designs, including the one suggested in the instructions. No success. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works for little planes","review":"The plane launcher only works for smaller planes and does not work for any planes containing quarters or for larger planes.

As Joanathan Barnes explained in the introduction in this book, this is probably because Aristotle's work is an unauthorized collection of lecture notes. Therefore, an introduction to the main themes in his work is an invaluable help to approaching the master's work. The Cambridge guide has chapters on metaphysics, logic, ethics, philosophy of science, science, psychology, politics, rhetoric. It also contains a massive bibliography. The essays concentrates on explaining the content of Aristotle's work, but it also introduce readers to modern controveries in interpretating Aristotle. The essay of Barnes on the very confusing work Metaphysics is pure gold.

In order to get to any teaching that has even a suggestive hint of substance, you have to bear an amateur writing style that made me wonder how it possibly got by even a novice editor.As a lifetime student of world religions and spiritual evolution, I felt badly for the meditative practices that were so grossly mangled by this author's exposition. If you are new to spiritual exploration (and like the simpleminded narrative formula of mass-produced paperbacks), you might find some value here. But I say experience this book at your own risk.

Anyone looking for a camcorder add-on lens that can provide great clarity with a wide framing should definitely consider this lens, but of course the price tag on this lens does feel a little steep, so if you are a hobbyist shooting home videos, I think you can get by without it.

I would recommend it if you don't have bad knees and have some flexibility to hold an awkward leg position for long periods of time.Also, it is very difficult at first for everyone to get on it without tipping everyone else over. You must get on one at a time so it's a little more time consuming than the ones that you just lay on your stomach and hold on.

The video shows us how Jordan reacts after being ejected from his first NBA game, how he deals with people attacking his gambling, his reaction to the JORDAN RULES book, Magic Johnson's retirement from the NBA and other moments that you won't find in any other video that was produced for Jordan.

For this album, however, she has chosen a wide range of music -- songs like \\"Think,\\" \\"How Sweet It Is,\\" \\"War,\\" and \\"The Weight\\". Having chosen these songs with very different emotional tones, she performs them all in the same sad bluesy tone. This tone strips the anger from \\"War\\" and the joy from \\"How Sweet It is.\\" Unless you are a big fan of Joan Osborne, wait for her next album of original material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why ?","review":"Come ON people, are we in a fog here ?

Joan Osborne has done a great job with her interpretation of the music and lyrics. She adds in her own unique flavor and it works.True, she doesn’t blow us away with her well-known soulful voice. What is in its place is a mellow funkiness that I absolutely enjoy. There are definite sounds of the blues as well as music that will help you get your groove on. I found myself snapping my fingers to the beat quite often.Although I enjoy listening to most of the tracks, there are a couple that I thought too slow. \\"War\\", for one, lacks a certain energy that I thought it needed to make it a track worth listening to. My favorites are \\"I'll Be Around\\", \\"How Sweet It Is\\" & \\"Love's In Need Of Love Today�?If you are a big fan of cover songs, then this a must buy. If you aren't, you should still get it because it's great music and will be an excellent addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joan, what were you thinking?!","review":"I can hardly believe this album is so poor. C'mon, this is Joan Osborne we're talking about, isn't it? Isn't this the same woman who put out probably the most brilliant album of 1995, \\"Relish\\"?Somehow, I don't think so.This album is a collection of cover tunes, all are sparsely done with Joan's drawling, souless singing. The choice of material is questionable too: Axis: Bold as Love, War?If you are looking for the quality of artist from \\"Relish\\" it is most definately not to be found in this CD. Age, it seems, has mellowed our Joan to the point that she is no longer entertaining.Sorry to be so harsh, Joan, but what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I loved Joan Osborne on Relish, but something is out of whack here. Part of the problem is the material she's chosen; you would have to be Aretha or Patti Labelle to even begin to come within orbit of matching these classics. And while Joan is good, she is not that good. And while you don't have to be black to sing r&b, Joan fails miserably especially when she tries to use black slang.

Boy was I wrong. The tracks on this CD uninspired, flat covers of some great soul songs. Somehow Joan removes the umph from \\"Think\\" and \\"War\\" and the solemness of \\"The Weight\\". None of the songs seem to take advantage of Joan's vocal distinctiveness and instead, she flattens her voice out to accomidate the music which is played by talented musicians on valium. If you liked Joan's other albums and are looking for more of the same, look somewhere else.

The production is horrible. The drummer can't follow through on drum rolls, and when he is blasting he usually stutters on the last few beats. The guitarist's riffs don't always follow what the drummer is attempting to do. The lyrics are infantile outbursts at an attempt to be death metal but come nowhere close to the bands that they emulate.

I've loved Toys in the Attic and Rocks since I was a kid but had never heard this one in it's entirety. It's interesting to hear them at this point in their career - great raunchy blues/rock songs, good grooves, and Tyler's voice sounds thicker and deeper than it does now. There are definitely elements of their future greatness evident here. Walkin' the Dog and of course Mama Kin are favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style","review":"This album is undeniably one of favourite Aerosmith albums, partly because of its uniqueness when compared to the rest of the band's collection. But mainly, it's short, raw, fast, bluesy and surprisingly full of musical range. And while Tyler later refined his vocals, Perry developed easier-to-listen-to guitar riffs and the group became more accessible to the masses, this remains a gem of unpolished style. A trait that's so hard to find, especially when it's as genuine as is evident here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith Raw","review":"One of my personal favorite albums of all time,rawnchy,bluesy,raw rock music ...simply produced.Very Real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Aerosmith!","review":"Ah, Aerosmith, how do you describe them? Hard, driving rock with plenty of mainstream accessibility (but not to the point of absurdity). This is where it all began, way back before they started doing pop rock. They were delivering some of the heaviest music of the time. Every song on here is great, but the standout track would have to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite Aerosmith songs of all time, \\"Dream On\\". This song came on the radio when I was driving in my car yesterday, and I just had to crank it (even though it's really not that heavy). However, although the whole album is good, there's really nothing else on here that's all that memorable. \\"Toys in the Attic\\" is a much more solid album. If you want to hear some great music, this is inarguably a wise choice. Not quite the best album of '73 (It can't compare to \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"), but it's still a heavy metal landmark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even decades can't take anything away from Aerosmith","review":"Still rockin.

Bought another updated one and it burnt the food. Thinking that it was just defective, I bought another Rival. It also burnt the food. I was never going to purchase a Rival again until I read the previous reviews about the SCV1600B0-SS and was willing to give Rival another try. Well, my first dinner, it burnt the stew I prepared. I put in on low for 8 hrs, put in extra water, and six hours later the meat and vegetables on the sides and bottom were burnt to a crisp and the liquid was actually boiling! I'm very, very disappointed. We live at a ski resort and would like to put dinner on in the morning and come home from skiing with a meal prepared -- not burnt. Also, I found the handles very effective for moving the crockpot. The rubber that covers the metal handles is very small and you WILL burn your fingers. I would definitely NOT recommend this crockpot and I personally will never purchase another Rival again."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO HOT!","review":"Like the vast majority of slow cookers, this cooks too hot. It boiled the food on low. A four pound roast (VERY thick) was beyond well-well-done after 5 hours. On the other hand, I see the reviewer below who said it didn't cook fast enough on high, and the other reviewer who said the high and low settings are switched. I find that hard to believe, but it is worth checking out. I'll let you know what I find... UPDATE: On mine, high and low are NOT switched. But they are about the same temperature. I just did a cold water test using low only, and in less than 3 hours it is over 200 degrees (low should be around 170). High setting did the same thing. I would pay double the price if they would make this exact crockpot that WORKS CORRECTLY.

In the mean time, I went out to by myself one since I was using my old one about 3 times a month and I hated cleaning all the pots. I LOVED it until I started noticing water in the bottom of the base (the heating unit). I was cleaning it one night and I let it soak before I start scrubbing it and I noticed water all over the counter top. There was a hole that formed in the bottom of the pot, I am assuming this happened from cooking on the gas stove.

We set the timer to switch from lo to warm after 8 hours. When we arrived home after work, the meal was cooked, but the crock pot was cold. It failed to switch to warm setting after the 8 hour low cook time. The final use was last night to cook pulled pork for a super bowl party. we put the pulled pork in the crock pot before bed.

It also cleans really easily but I haven't put it in the dishwasher. The timer function is great also. I'm busy with my 9mo. old so if I'm with her or running errands it waits on me, don't we all want that? The only cons are that the outside gets pretty hot even on the low setting and that I wish it could be used at a higher temp on the stove top. It suggest nothing higher than medium for fear of damaging it. So it makes getting things to the boiling point a bit slow but other than that this is a great product. I don't know why I would ever have to buy another crock pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snapped in half on the first use","review":"Bought this model as a gift for my sister-in-law.

I switched it on low and the temperature reached about 198 F. I switched it back to high and the temperature went back down to 178 F.

This was so bad (and pricey) that I had to warn others.The lid does not fit properly on this slow cooker. There are two high spots in the stoneware lid. The lid actually rocks back and forth on these two spots. Which means that it does not keep in any moisture at all!I tried to make pulled pork (which I've done at least 20 times in my last slow cooker with excellent results) and this time there was no moisture left in the meat at all because it had all evaporated out of the open top. This was an absolute waste of money! DO NOT PURCHASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hot!","review":"For all that is good about this crockpot, and there is much that is good, it has one insurmountable flaw. It has two temperatures: high and scorch. I have two words of advice for those who buy it. First, always test your recipe when you'll be spending the entire day at home. Its low setting is not low and many recipes will burn to a crisp, wilt to nothing, and/or boil to overflow within a few hours. Second, even the longest cooking recipe will, in this crockpot, be finished in 8 hours or less.

My sister bought a bunch of these, and has had about a 50% success rate on the fin staying on.Overall, although my daughter LOVES this doll, I have to say the manufacturer should be ashamed of making something that would pass no quality tests.

This bench is substantial, which means it's fairly heavy, but still compact in comparison to other brands, which tend to look like flimsy ironing boards. It's design is one of a kind and simple to adjust, the angle of the bench, with it's foot lever. The packaging it's shipped in is thorough and somewhat difficult to unwrap, which means it won't get damaged. Assembly is a snap: insert and tighten (two wrenches needed) four screws to install the feet. That's it. Worth the money if you workout frequently, like a variety of angles, and prefer a substantial feel to your workout equipment. Get the situp/crunch attachment if you plan on doing decline exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL ASSESMENT","review":"ok ill start here, im 5'6 so it is hard for me to find a good bench. but my toes can still touch the ground while benching.why didnt i notice this earlier but in order to do a decline you have to turn your body or the bench around it DOESNT ROTATE BOTH WAYS. not a big deal but for a 300$ BENCH I THOUGH IT WOULD ROTATE BOTH WAYS!!great packaging, great marketing, great quality bench"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bench","review":"I use this bench 3 times a week. This is an awesome bench, and I recommend it highly. It doesn't ever wobble or make me feel like it's going to topple over (p.s. - I'm over 6' tall).

For me, money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"First bench","review":"I got my bench the other day and I was really happy with it. I don't know why people say the bench doesn't decline, it does...you just have to buy the crunch/situp accessory separately if you want something for your legs. I bought the bench, chin up attachment and the situp accessory and I love it. It seems rock solid.

The other side wishes I had enough decadence in me to have lived in Happy Valley. There is no pretense that this is anything other than splendid housing for Europeans, not native Africans, and it is honest about malaria and the like, without mentioning politics. Nonetheless, I am happy to put this on my shelf with more technical works on indigenous African architecture. The work offers splendid structures built of simple materials on simple plans in which I could happily end my days relishing the elegant detail. The rich melange of styles effectively denies any dim notion of East African cultural isolation.

Amanda was a bit TOO naive, but you could see how she and the worldly Josh were so drawn to each other. It would have been nice to see a bit more of the villain.

His collaboration with Minnie Churchill, who oversees the painting reproduction rights by way of the Churchill Heritage, bring to light many paintings that didn't make the first book. The book took 6 years of in-depth research to track and re-photograph the many \\"daubs\\" that Mr. Churchill claimed privately to be his greatest love - next to Clemmie.

The only ones that really stand out are \\"Sunset Beach\\", \\"April\\" (nice acoustic guitar!), and \\"The Silence\\". But the last of those is many years old. 3 good tracks out of 22?It's about time that the Trancemaster series spent a bit more time selecting the best possible tracks for each compilation. Granted, there is less trance around these days, but it's still out there. I'd much rather see one or two Trancemaster CDs each year with 10-20 good tracks on each (they can't all be brilliant, but they can be better than this). There have been four instalments of Trancemaster this year, which is crazy when you consider how few tracks are actually worth a listen.A few hidden treasures, but nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Compelling Breed Info but 1/2 Book Was Too General","review":"I have been considering a Great Dane for a while now and want to read up before making that huge leap. Jill Swedlow's name was on 3 out of the 5 Great Dane books I found.The part written by her about the breed is wonderful. It is clear she loves the breed but also points out why Danes are not the breed for everyone. She knows her stuff and conveys it in a manner that is friendly and compelling.The main problem was that almost half the book is a generic dog guide. It relates to training and other issues, but it does *not* specifically address the problems with a dog that is as big as you are.I hope Swedlow writes a comprehensive Dane book.

ZERO! Here we get more of his awkward writing with good singers struggling mightily to salvage it.

I have Never had any problems with them. Unfortunately the mark-up on these things is crazy. The 3.0 Amp hour should be about $50. Li-ion cells are no longer expensive, 5 cells in quantity only costs $25. $80+ is a little high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and fast-charging!","review":"These batteries are the fastest charging cordless tool batteries I've ever used and they will put in a full day's work and then some before you have to recharge them. The 3.0 Amp Hour batteries take about 35-40 minutes to charge (there are 1.8Ah batteries for the drills that take less than 20 minutes!) if completely depleted and they're ready to take up again right where they left off! As some other reviews have mentioned, the only down side to them is there's very little warning when they do run out of juice, but seen from another point of view, they do keep running strong up to the last minute. So that's a tradeoff I can live with. I have four Makita tools that use this battery, and each has ONE battery, no extra spares, and I've never had to completely stop working to charge a battery. I just use one from another tool while I charge the one that ran down. Unlike other brands where I had to have 1-2 extra batteries for each tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"Ditto on the hate the Makita batteries!

It is even worse if you use them less. I have several that we're used just a few times and have failed. I have some used by my crew that were charged 100+ times. Makita knows this is a problem, and now that I have about $1500 of Makita cordless tools, I am stuck with spending hundreds a year replacing these poorly designed batteries.

The board draws a constant although small current from that single cell. If the battery is not used for a few weeks then that cell will deep discharge causing a weak link in the bank of cells, the pack then fails in the charger.Makita has programmed the circuitry so that if you try to charge the battery 3 times in this state, it will permanently disable it. Normal behavior is to think \\"why is it not charging, let me try again\\". If more than 1 year old, it is out of warranty.I would not buy any more Makita tools powered by this battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries don't live long.","review":"Upgraded from Rigid to Makita last year.

The home users of other batteries have no where near the problems. Read the Amazon reviews. I have never seen so many complaints about batteries.

I can see that the pack has about 16V yet it will not charge up. I know this is an older pack, however it has not been abused and since it seems designed to fail when it still appears to have a usable life is very unfair. Ironically my other battery purchased with the bad one is still going strong and it has been used much more - which is probably the key since they drain one cell for the circuitry.

If your exploring the band some of the best work is; Shannon Said, Holly Park and Leaving Ohio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"Cal and Maddie's story snagged my attention from page one and held it all the way through a one-sitting read. What an awesome story with great characters! Cal's sister Allison is esepcially fun with her mall addiction. Joanne Rock stories are now definitely on my auto-buy list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is my first Emily Giffin book. I planned on reading \\"Love the One Your With\\" until I saw in the reviews that Emily had such a large following, so I decided to begin with her first book. I read it in two sittings! It is fresh - not typical Chic Lit, Smart and well Written. I immediately ordered \`Something Blue' and can't wait for it to arrive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun fast read","review":"I truly enjoyed this book; I have been hooked on the Janet Evanovich books and have been looking for something that compared to them. I think I have found the ones. I bought this book in the Denver airport knowing that I would be there for awhile and started reading the book at the airport, I read the book all through my flight and as soon I got home finished it and wanted to read more. The characters reminded me a lot of my self during my single life. It is a story based on a woman that allows her friend to pretty much run her life; because of the fact that Rachel has no confidence in herself she allows it to happen. She soon finds out that she is actually in love with her best friends fiancé and goes through the turmoil of what to do with her new found love for Dexter and if he will call of his marriage to Darcy to be with her.This book keeps you wondering clear till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of cry babies","review":"Read this book if you want to hear somebody complian and cry for a few hundred pages (or if you are into swinging). There is nothing redeeming about any of the characters, except for a few of the less developed friends. I actually somewhat liked Darcy because at least she didn't complain about everthing, although you don't get her point of view...apparently that is the next book. Rachel needs to grow some and get over it, she lost to the pretty girl who was always mean to her...wah wah wah. The authors attempts at making Darcy out to be the bad guy are weak for two reasons 1.) Rachel is the one sleeping with her best friends fiance and 2.) why are you friends with Darcy if she is so terrible? On top of it, what is so great about Dex if he is willing to sleep with his fiances best friend? I'm surprised both Darcy and Rachel don't run as fast as they can out of NYC. Bottom line, these jerks deserve each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A friend and I both read this book and it was unimpressive. It was terribly slow, unentertaining, and I couldn't even finish it. It's too bad, since I had seen all the good reviews and really wanted to like it. Won't read books by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geh....","review":"Just because they were pretty, successful characters does not mean they are any less morally bankrupt. A worse waste of time than the 2 seconds I wasted of my life paying attention to a \\"Bad Girls Club\\" show commercial previewing \\"this\\" weeks episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"Full of cliches and self-absorbed characters. Thirty year olds who never got over high school. Puh-lease. Fortunately a quick read, so I only wasted 8 hours of my life on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they wanted vs. what they deserved","review":"The problem with Giffin's book is that the main characters only got what they wanted; they did not get what they deserved. I am usually a fan of chick-lit, but this book sorely disappointed me. While the writing was good, the plot lacked any subtleties. It was contrived and seemly written for those \\"other\\" women to make them feel better about their situations. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second one is Even Better!!!!!","review":"If you have not read this book, and love the edgy british \\"chic lit\\" movement, you will love this book. The next book, Something Blue is even better, and you will want to read this one first. A great new author!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book about bad friends","review":"I read this for my bookclub and I was baffled when I found out people actually liked it. There is nothing about this book that makes sense. If someone hates her best friend so much, why is she still her friend? It simply doesn't make any sense. The author tries to make the protagonist more likable by discussing her insecurities and dislikes but it has a hollow feel. I agree with other reviewers that this had the potential to make a really great book and to open up discussions about nice people doing bad things but in this case it was a huge failure. The fact that Darcy's character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever really throws off the balance of every other character in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No... just no.","review":"I picked up this book after hearing that I would like it because I am obsessed with all of Sophie Kinsella's work! Unlike Kinsella's wonderful, humor filled and MORAL work, this book is immensely disappointing. It's not the fact that Rachel and Dex cheat, THEY HAVE A FULL ON AFFAIR. Which is disgusting. I see this as Dex being completely immoral and insanely spineless. At least in the movie version of this book they gave a reason for this behavior (parents). Horrible. It had a making of a great book (if it was just a one time thing... etc), but the affair was rushed and the \\"i love you's\\" were forced and there was no situation that did not involve basic infatuation that tied them together.Read something by Kinsella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth your Time","review":"I read this book because the first chapter sounded interesting, but it was definitely not worth the time I spent on it. There are a couple interesting events and a ton of boring whining by the unrealistically pathetic main character (I mean, seriously? Is anyone really that weak?) in between. All in all, the characters are flat and unbelievable, there's no wit in the writing, and the storyline is predictable, so what's the point in reading it? Truly the only interesting part of the book is reading the incredibly selfish, bitchy (and very unlikely) antics of the main character's friend Darcy. Pick it up if you have absolutely nothing else to read. If you're looking for some simple, fun chick lit, I recommend Jennifer Crusie instead. Sure, she doesn't write high-brow lit, but the banter is at least fairly witty and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Read","review":"So, the plot of the book was good...Stealing your Best Friends Fiance(DRAMA!). Yet the characters are boring. For some reason I couldn't really create an image of the characters or a setting. The main character was a bit annoying because it took her forever to finally stand and give an ultimatum. Too much detail in the mist of getting to main points. Too many trips to the Hapmtoms...if anything the characters needed to be developed more. I am debating on reading \\"Something Blue,\\" hoping it will give the characters more depth. Currently reading \\"Love the one you're with\\" and sorry to say, thus far it is not sticking to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true heroine","review":"Here's a heroine you'll root for, cry with, laugh with, and feel her emotional pains and triumphs. Truly a book you can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked this book!","review":"I don't usually write reviews but I have to for this book.There are parts of the book that kind of drag, but other than that I really liked it. I got the kindle version and read through it in about a week. It has a predictable ending, but you just don't know HOW exactly it's going to get there. Definitely a good read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"I purchased this book on my Kindle, big mistake! It is the never ending book! The characters are very bland and it's almost like Ms. Griffin was on a quest to make the book longer so she added a bunch of needless babble. I found myself thinking \\"Get to the point!\\" Not too sure where it's getting all the stars from but I definitely don't agree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SNOOZE!!!","review":"i was excited to read this book.. i watched the movie first & i usually do not do that, i always read first. anyways this book is a total bore compaired to the movie, again usually the movie is not good & the book is great.. it was not a bad book i did like the story line & i like that she & dex did get together however is was very boring & i found it hard to get through & then a good part would come & i would continue only to have it be a bore again :( way to much info on parts that really needed no explaining & paged upon pages of nothing chatter .. i am not sure i would recommend this book ever but the movie YES!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unlikeable characters","review":"I read this book quickly because I wanted to get to the part where I could understand Rachel's decisions but it never happened. I found all three of the main characters to be unlikeable and it actually made me depressed. Awful friends and awful girlfriends/boyfriends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really engaged me","review":"Perhaps I am in the wrong age group to really identify with the characters in this novel, and was never - even when I was this age - as obsessed with sex and \\"hooking up\\" and working 7 days a week like these NYC characters all seem to do, but this book never really engaged me, beginning to end. The life these young \\"have everything\\" people lived felt alien, and so totally self-centered and even arrogant, that I grew tired after the first several chapters of the constant angst, but refusal to do anything about it. I finally just longed for it to be over. I stuck with it, and as I feared, even with a partial resolution at the end, the book just .... stopped, with two of the main characters \\"riding off into the sunset,\\" figuratively speaking. I also purchased Something Blue but I don't think I will take the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not Like","review":"After reading the book Something Blue, which depicted Darcy as a selfish snob, I could not warm up to her in this book. Found myself closing the book around the 20th chapter, in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a cheater","review":"I would be willing to bet money that the author of this book was, at some point, \\"the other woman\\" in a relationship and wanted to write a book validating that choice.I actually enjoyed the first half of the book. People are flawed, make mistakes, whatever. But the way this author tried to force a happy ending between some seriously f-ed up people made me want to throw the book in the garbage just in case someone I know picked it up and thought it would be a good read.This was a glorification of unhealthy relationships. And not in an ironic, or self-aware way. It was total trash and reminded me of 16 year old girls whining \\"but, but, we're sooooo in luv!.\\"Vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God For Something Blue!! Rachel Is Plastic!","review":"I've read this and something blue and cannot understand what made Rachel such a hero.All the while, Rachel thought of Darcy as a mean-hearted and selfish pig. QUESTION: WHY WOULD YOU STILL STICK WITH HER AND CALL HER YOUR BESFTRIEND? I don't get it!Darcy is mean yes, but she genuinely loves Rachel (read something blue) and the only reason why she's acting like a brat is because Rachel let's her have her way!!The heroine her is spineless and scheming. You would never steal your bestfriend's fiancee. If you did, then maybe she wasn't your BFF at all.I hated this book. Dexter is dry and boring. I loved Something Blue. It talks about them growing up and moving on. Thank God for Darcy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I really enjoyed Emily Giffin's \\"Love the One You're With\\" but \\"Something Borrowed\\" was simply annoying and contrived. I tried to finish it, but felt like I was wasting my time. It seemed like conversation was being repeated ad nauseam. I purchased \\"The Help\\" by Kathryn Stockett last week to return to good writing. It's a lot heavier topic but definitely worth my time. (\\"The Help\\" is Ms. Stockett's first novel; it is fantastic and I'm only half way through it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not stand RACHEL!!!","review":"I will give the book one star because the first chapter was great. The one about turning 30. After that I wanted to yell at Rachel and Dex, they were fustrating. Rachel was so weak and stupuid, to let that man have the best of both worlds. The book dragged on for way too long. I did finish the book because I was hoping she would end up in London. At least Darcy was fun, outgoing, and somewhat honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to like the \\"hero\\" don't read","review":"I had heard about how this was a great beach read, so light and fun to read. So I picked it up and I was appalled. The writting, well not bad...is what you would expect from chick lit. But why on earth would anyone want to read a book where the main character steals her \\"beast friend's\\" fiance. Altogether to trashy for me, even for a beach read. SO if you like you main character to have some sense of morals...don't read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God I HATE this book, don't waste your $","review":"I read all kinds of books and enjoy chick lit and I'm not even finished with this book yet (I'm not sure if I'll be able to make myself finish it) but I had to come here to encourage people not to spend any money on this book. It's not funny at all, and all of the characters in it are not likeable. In fact the main character in this book is the most irritating character I've read in awhile. What a horrible person, you sleep with your best friend's fiance and it's ok because she's shallow, oh but wait you've been best friends with her for 20 years and you are just now noticing it? Give me a break! I agree with all other negative reviews about this book. I'm so angry I wasted money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I finished this book","review":"I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time. It was just that bad. I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it. It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel. It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry. I almost feel dumber for having read this. Is this really what women RELATE to? If so, that is so sad? I found every character in this book just sad. Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love. C'mon! Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown. F-"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!","review":"Being that I don't read chick-lit books I was little skeptical about reading this book. After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a chance. I could not put this book down! I found myself laughing and being angry at Darcy and rooting for Rachel and Dex! This is a really good book. Something Borrowed is a must read!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something else, please!","review":"I would rather be punched in the stomach than to be friends with these two women. We live and breathe in a world where there is enough drama and I prefer an immerse myself in feel-good characters that I read about. Although the author had a unique twist to the story at the end, the characters were both a bunch of backstabbers no matter how you slice it. \\"With friends like these, who needs enemies?\\" Oh, by the way: can we be more original than use NYC as a backdrop for the location? It's so Sex in the City- in this case, the book doesn't come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you still be a teenager at age 30?","review":"Rachel and Darcy are best friends. Rachel and Dexter (Darcy's fiance) wind up in bed together. The remaining 20+ chapters are devoted to Rachel's angst: Does Dex love her or Darcy? Will Dex call off the wedding? Should Rachel tell Dex that Darcy has been cheating on him? It's all very junior high school. I was never able to figure out Dexter's appeal, other than good looks and the fact that Darcy was engaged to him. Hardly the stuff of which soul mates are made. I DID read through until the end, and Giffin's sense of humor does make me smile, but this is not a novel about anything remotely approaching adult relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"I loved, loved, loved this book. With 2 young children I still somehow managed to read it in 2 days. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Be prepared to neglect your family and any/all of your responsibilities when you choose to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Loved this book! It was a great detailed account of infidelity and friendship. I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy heroine","review":"This book was frustrating. Why would Rachel even be best friends with someone as self-centered as Darcy and why would a man supposedy as \\"great\\" as Dexter be involved with someone like Darcy? If I ever met a man who could propose to a jerk like Darcy, I would know he had a screw loose. Too bad Rachel didn't hook up with Hillary. Hah hah! Rachel and Dexter are both wimps, so maybe they do deserve each other. I think the novel would have been better and braver if the author had made Darcy a more sympathetic character. Instead, she conveniently makes her a bitch and has her sleep with someone else so the reader even feels less sorry for her. But that makes the rest of the story about Rachel and Dex tolerating and even liking Darcy even more unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgier Chick Lit","review":"This book is more than your standard chick lit fare. First of all, there really is no sympathetic female character. Although Darcy has been wronged by her best friend Rachel when Rachel sleeps with her fiance Dex, we do not really feel sympathy for her. Nor do we absolutely hate Rachel. The author is gifted enough in telling the story that we at least understand why Rachel does this and we do not condemn her completely.The novel also differs from the usual chick lit because there is not a happy (and implausible) ending. Without giving it away, everyone has regrets and no one escapes unscathed.This book kept my interest throughout and I could not really guess how it would end up. I've just ordered the sequel to this \\"Something Blue\\" and am looking forward to seeing more of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"I craved reading this book after viewing the movie which I absolutely loved Colin Egglesfield made the character of Dexter Thangler come to life. I undeniably was absorbed in the book and could not put it down. I should mention of course that the movie is absolutely nothing comparison. It's a fantastic book and I would recommend reading it after you've seen the movie or before.It's juicer than you could have thought.LOVED IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick lit readers won't be disappointed","review":"I read the book for my book club, then saw the movie. I enjoyed both versions equally! This was my first Emily Griffin book, but this will not be my last. I'm looking forward to reading \\"Something Blue\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book.","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Life is not black and white and I root for Rachel although I hated it when she gives in to Darcy. Rachel winning the love of her life is a good ending but now we need Dex's point of view. Emily, please write one from Dex's perspective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely enjoyable ! I really loved it!","review":"I have never read a novel so quickly before....I simply didn't want to put it down. I easily got into the characters; their ever-entwining lives, the simplicity of their feelings, as well as the complexity of their feelings. Most of all, I could relate to the main character and the handfull of different female friendships she juggled that effected her throughout. Emily Giffin has a great writing style, a wonderful sense of humor (I laughed aloud so many times while reading this!), an incredible memory of both childhood and teenage retrospects that I loved being reminded of (thank you!). It was a pleasure to read this story....and I certainly hope there will be a continuation to this simple but yet complex, fun, nail-biting, twisting, enjoyable journey of these characters that are now on my mind and that I hold dear. I really loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"A predictable but easy beach read. Unfortunately, it glorifies infidelity. It is a shame a fun romantic book cannot also hold up some moral values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I enjoyed this book as well as the rest of the series. There was good character development and a good storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book","review":"This book throws in many twists and turns but never gets boring. Keeps you on your toes. The thrill if the drama between Darcy and Rachel makes the book interesting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep but not too deep","review":"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't too fluffy like a lot of other 'girlfriend' books. Took you right along the ride with Rachael each step she goes into the dangerous territory of falling for a friend's guy. Couldn't help but think what you'd do in her position. I thought it to be realistic and heartfelt. A steady paced read that was hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Honestly, I was given this book and it's follow up \\"Something Blue\\" by a friend to take on vacation and I felt I had to read them. I did. Every single word. Both books were awful, but the first one \\"Something Borrowed\\" was the worst. I was appalled at the antics of the two main women \\"friends\\". I didn't like either one of them from the beginning and it only got worse as the plot wound up. If you are interested in self-centered, New York City centered, obnoxious, back-biting, snobby, \\"weekends-in-the-hamptons\\" type girls then this book and its follow up are for you. If you aren't interested in those girls, then avoid these books. I found nothing redeemable in either character or book. Avoid the movie, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't anyone get concerned when we applaud a woman who betrays her best friend by having an affair with her fiance??","review":"if you (1) hate your best friend, (2) believe that the end justifies the means (no matter how many rules you break), (3) think that being nice/good is more of a handicap than a virtue, (4) enjoy character-stereotypes that leave no room for the color gray (only black and white: good vs. evil), and (5) feel that believable dialogue and fun references to growing up in the 80's make for actual \\"literature\\", then this is the book for you! enjoy! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I read raves about this book and was totally disappointed. The novel is full of shallow, vapid, incredibly dull people who behave despicably. The female protagonist is a stereotypical 30 year old whose life is not complete without a man. It's a sad depiction of the female gender. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This book was waaaaay too long for the insignificant content. Much of the description was unnecessary and the longer the story dragged on the more boring it became.

Don't bother to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Boring","review":"I love to read, am an avid reader, I usually read about a book every 2 days.

I also dont enjoy books written in the 1st person. I just couldnt do it!Great for those who enjoyed it but I wasnt one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me? I HATED this character","review":"The main character of this book is by far the most unlikable protaganist I've ever come across. She sleeps with her best friend of 20 years fiance and doesn't feel guilty about it!! And she whines incessantly about how her friend is so lucky and how she's been outshone by her all these years. Well, maybe that's because you're an f'ing loser, sweetheart. The only reason I finished this book was because I was hoping she'd meet some terrible fate and end up even more miserable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping page turner","review":"When I picked up this book, I had not expected it to be much more than a semi-interesting read. However, with every page turn, I became more and more attached to the novel's heroine, Rachel, and actually found it very difficult to put the book down. I started reading it at 10PM and when I finished it at 3AM, I found myself disappointed that it was over and now I can't wait to read the sequel, Something Blue. Since reading this book, I have highly recommended it to all my girlfriends. It's a beautiful story about life, love and friendship filled with excitement, heartbreak and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"This was an easy read and thoroughly enjoyable. However, the writing was only mediocre and, as other reviewers have stated, the book was perhaps a bit lengthy. But I always judge a book based on whether or not I still think about the storyline after I've finished reading it. It's been days since I put this one back on the shelf and I'm still thinking about Dex, Darcy and Rachel. I'll definitely read Emily Giffin's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite book","review":"Didn't care for this book---the premise behind the story or the story itself. I don't want to read a story where the heroine lusts after her best friends' fiance, and wins him.

Good thing I was on the beach in Hawaii or I would have tossed it. Sorry,just a \\"dumb blonde\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED Rachel","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever not finished. I hated Rachel so much I couldn't finish this book. I liked Something Blue, because I loved the character of Darcy. But Rachel is such a whining, self absorbed, insecure little witch I couldn't finish Something Borrowed. She and Dex deserve each other. What a couple of nasty human beings. And I found it hysterical how the author kept trying to make Rachel out to be a heroine so she kept trying to make Darcy worse. I HATED Rachel and loved Darcy. Guess the manipulation didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"thats really all there is to say about this book. i'm not a huge fan of all the chick books, but this one is expectional. keeps your attention throughout the whole book. never a dull moment. you will always be wondering what is going to happen next and definitly won't be disappointed by the ending. an excellent excellent book that i hope many have the chance to read. right after finishing this book i went to the store and bought the sequel. hope you pick this book up. enjoy :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but drags a little in the middle","review":"This books begins with a bang - Rachel sleeps with her best friend's fiance. As Rachel struggles with her actions and what it means, and Dex wants to continue the affair even as the wedding approaches, I found myself wanting to get to the answer even as I started to like the characters less and less. I got tired of Dex's indecision and Rachel's lack of a spine. But I kept on reading. The book is well written and carries you along even if sometimes you wish the ride would speed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was pretty bad...","review":"I really didn't find any of the characters to be at all likeable. Rachel whined too much and felt too sorry for herself all of the time, Darcy is a vapid witch and I have no clue how or why anyone would be friends with her and Dexter was just an indecisive wimp. The only character who was mildly appealing was Ethan, and he was in exactly two chapters of the book. I bought it for a \\"mindless\\" summer read, but it was so stupid that I couldn't even be bothered to pick it up most of the time. I kept waiting for the story to pick up or for one of the characters to change, but that didn't happen. I really just wouldn't bother with this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have been reading a lot of books since I got my kindle a year ago. This was probably the worst book I've read since I got it. The writing was poor, she was so annoying with \\"It is.... this and It is... that (nobody talks like that in real life). I thought the plot stunk. How could she do that to her \\"best friend\\" and how could he do that to his fiancee. I won't be reading anymore in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Terrible","review":"I'm embarrassed to say I read it... read the whole thing. And I knew it was bad early on. I will say the author held my attention... much like a mind-numbing reality TV show that when it's over you ask yourself, \\"Did I really just waste all that time?\\" Even knowing how bad it was, I wanted to finish it. Talk about cramming an addictive and lousy TV show into a book. I'm not even sure who I would recommend this book to; someone who reads quickly but not for substance perhaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wanted to like it...","review":"Unfortunately, it was truly awful. I really wish I had stuck to the 50 page rule, but alas, I did not. The characters - all of them - are really REALLY unlikeable. Not funny or in any way uplifting - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in one night","review":"Great book. The story keeps your interest very well until the end. After finishing I couldn't help noticing the whole book was about just one thing. Will he or won't he, that was it. But still somehow a really great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the book down!","review":"This was such an entertaining book! I got some great laughs out of it and even found myself crying in parts! I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly blissful","review":"This is one of the first books I've read that I really couldn't put down. There were times I was annoyed and over with all of the characters, but then pages later they would redeem themselves...and I often had no idea what side I was on in the situation. It's an awesome easy summer read. I'm recommending it to friends and will read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"rachel is a loser","review":"Also can't believe all the raves about this book. Come on! The protagonist is so incredibly boring and insecure, blaming all her misfortunes on her friend? Have zero tolerance for this kind of people... The writing was very average as well.

Dexter is a sexy hero, Darcy got what she deserved, and if I were Rachel, I would have done the same thing????? Is this what we are supposed to be saying while reading this book? While Darcy wasn't a saint, I didnt read where she came close to deserving her best friend stealing her fiancee as this author wants us to believe.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising surprises","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Although my review seems rather low, I did find the writing engaging and the characters well developed. The plot offered some surprises along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Heroine you want to Support","review":"SPOILER~ The author tried to make you sympathize with Rachel's situation when in reality I didn't think Dex was a catch and I started to spite Rachel for acting like a victim when she had every opportunity to change her situation and take control of her life! Honestly I was hoping she would end up with Ethan who was CLEARLY the real catch! AND--I don't care what Darcy did to her! Women need to have respect for other women! NOT COOL RACHEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!","review":"The best part about this book is that somewhere- somehow we can all relate to the story, characters and the emotions that it provokes. It is a entertaining and fast paced novel which will be very hard to put down. I highly recommend it and will be reading \\"Something Blue\\" next. After reading about Rachel and Dex whom I absolutely loved, I can't wait to read about Darcy! Thanks Emily Giffin for such a well written and heart-warming chicklit which is far above the others in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chic Lit read for a summer day","review":"I loved this book. I am about to turn 20 and I was on the edge of my seat reading it all day. I didn't want to put it down to go into work- but I had to and finished it right when I got home. The characters are developed so well into their pasts and the present you feel like they are your best friends. The story line follows Rachel, like other chic lit, as she lives on her own and is in her job in the wonderful NYC. She has a best friend and loves she is dealing with while always wanting to remember the past.You should open it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is amazing","review":"honestly, this book has you sitting there like in AWE of what is going on. The whole time I was like \\"YEAH YOU GO GIRL\\" I loved it so muuuuch that I bought \\"Something Blue\\" which I'm so excited to read! THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Unrealistic","review":"A 'love story' that seemed just too unrealistic. It dragged on and while I had some sympathy for the characters, they did not do enough soul searching about what they were really doing and it was hard to have any respect for any of them. This was an ok book but not any where near the quality that I was hoping. If you like good fiction with engrossing characters and stories then move on. This was written like a made for tv movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"something borrowed","review":"i am really surprised this book has such good reviews. the characters have no depth and the story just kept getting sillier and less fulfilling. rachels pathetic nature grew tiresome. it was easy to read though felt a bit like watching a reality show...entertaining at times but very little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING","review":"Don't read this book it's so depressing!! Its all about cheating.. I would be ok with that as long as in the end they are crazy happy but that's not how it ends up. They are just kinda happy :( :( :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!! I am normally a mystery suspense reader and not a romance reader but I read it in one day I could not put it down until I finished it. Glad I read it before the movie comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"why the low stars? this book was awesome!","review":"SUCH A GOOD, LIGHT CHICK-LIT :) I can't understand why this got low stars- I thought character development was amazing and the plot was very well thought out. The book was very well written and kept me interested the whole way through! On to the next book now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I loved the book. I loved the easy access to purchase the item and had the ability to read it from both my ipad and iphone anywhere I was without having to carry a bulky book. Can't wait to purchase other books :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life writing","review":"I really did enjoy this story. I read the book in 2 days, literally, and it was two travelling days on the planes and waiting in the airports. The thing I most enjoyed about the book was that it was written in everyday words and the story is very real and you can relate to it, even though you do not live in NYC or hate your job, you can find yourself inside this story. Even though I did not sleep with my best friends fiance, I did do the infidelity act, but I was the one engaged. He was not my fiances best friend, but he did sweep my feet off the ground and made me feel like no one before. Anyway, a great chick-lit book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE RACHEL","review":"I read something blue first and then something borrowed. When I read Rachels character I could not believe how selfish and whiny she was. Of course Darcy outshone her. Dary is confident, a go getter, and someone who takes charge. I was so upset that this Rachel was being portrayed as some kind of heroine in this book. How can we condone something such as sleeping with your best friend's fiance? If you read something blue you will see that even despite the fact that Rachel resented Darcy, Darcy was a true friend to her. I think this was so sad that Rachel got her happy ending. I was hoping she'd get run over a bus or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend: I was in for a surprise. The main character is a whiny, spineless \\"girl\\" who cannot stand up against her \\"bully\\" best friend who stole her former crush? & then they \\"accidentally\\" had drunken sex and tried to hid it from her before her marraige? Really!? The entire book is one long, whiny disappointment. There are far better reads out there. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much substance","review":"It's not so much about the simple writing, the flat characters, the predictable plot. For me it's all about the author not even having enough respect for her readers to be more creative. Not much of a book, just like movies and tv aren't much either these days, either. The author gets credit for actually writing books, getting them published and reviewed. But you'd think she'd want to write something of some value. Surprises? Oh, please. We all slog through it, hoping for the best. The best never comes. Another shallow beach book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH gosh...","review":"This is the worst book I have EVER read and that includes this awful book I read in January that had an evil gnome as a main character. Don't ask.Okay, but back to \\"Something Borrowed\\" which is referring to a girl \\"borrowing/doing it with\\" her best friends fiance.Right then and there I should have just put the book down. This book did not keep me interested. I would have been more than content finding out the ending to it via google but since it was one of the first books I purchased on my Kindle I felt this responsibility to finish it.Anyway, long story short if you want to read a book where all the characters just whine and complain about their lives, this is the book for you.Also, if you are currently cheating or have cheated on a boyfriend, fiance, or your husband and you need someone to tell you that you didn't do anything wrong, again this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick-lit that actually doesn't give the genre a bad name!","review":"I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars on this one. It was an entertaining, fast read and pretty good as far as chick-lit goes. I hate to use that term because this is a deeper, multi-angle story than what that stereotype lends itself to. It is ultimately a book about how complex relationships that lack real/honest communication can become, and the tightrope that an unhealthy best friendship can be for two stark opposite females. The ending left me a bit unsatisfied, though there is a nice plot twist I didn't see coming. I will read the next novel to see where life takes Rachel and Darcy from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxed but fun read....","review":"I really liked this book! Liking a character that would steal her best friend's fiance seems like a crazy concept but you really can't help but like Rachel. I read this book in two days...such an easy read but you won't want to put it down because you will be dying to know what the outcome is. I will definitely be reading \\"Something Blue\\" next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like eating cheap chocolate","review":"That's exactly what reading this book was like. You can't put it down, devour it all in a sitting or two, then end up completely unsatisfied when it's all over. The writing was interesting and I particularly liked the many insights, but Rachel got off too easy - far too easy for a fictional character, anyway. Darcy, typecast as the 'evil' friend, tied up the ends altogeter too nicely. I was waiting to see how Rachel would have to pay the piper, but apparently she didn't have to get her hands dirty. In the end, the reader is the one left covered in dollar-store chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, sexy, fantasic!!!!","review":"Im not usually into books like this but now i will reconsider. I absolutely loved it. Rachel is funny,shy, and is unaware of who she is as a person and what she can do. I finished the book in a week and now I would love to the movie. This is a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book is so shallow. I tried to read it but had to give up somewhere around page 75. D'arcy is *such* a cliche - just way too one-dimensional and loathsome. Also, I found it boring to read on and on about relationships with no other plot developments. Clearly, I'm in the minority here but that's my story and I'm sticking to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyful & amusing!","review":"This book was amusing and enjoyable to read. The characters were well developed and relatable...I'm reading all of her books now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Jane living in the \\"fast\\" lane","review":"I read this book after reading some of Giffin's other novels, and this one is by far my favorite. Rachel and Dex genuinely fall in love and you find yourself applauding the breakup of an engagement and friendship between two best friends. Nonetheless, it is an easy and entertaining read. I wish I would have read this book before I had read some of Giffin's other work. I would recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"Worth the read if only to get you to \\"Something Blue\\" which I found to be the better of the two in the series.There was something about the dialogue (mainly from the male perspective, specifically Dex) that threw me throughout the book; it made me feel that it was forced. Not to mention that Rachel's inner monologue would abruptly answer questions that other characters would pose (for example, Darcy mentioning Dex and Rachel's thoughts suddenly spitting out for the reader, \\"Because I'm sleeping with him...\\") in a way that grew old quickly. It was hard for me to side with Dex and Rachel considering that, most of the time, I just wanted them both to simply put up or shut up about it all. I just wasn't a fan of the pair of them.I wasn't crazy about Darcy either until \\"Something Blue\\", which I almost didn't pick up; though I highly recommend to all. I even felt the dialogue and relationships were smoother and more natural in that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my new favorites","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I would have read this book in a sitting had my husband left me alone long enough. I think my book perturbed him, he kept asking \\"What's so funny?\\" because I smiled the whole way through. I loaned it to a friend and can barely wait for her to finish so we can talk about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's over?","review":"The good news is: this book is spectacular. Emily Giffin's vivid narration of Rachel and her dilemma had me hooked from the moment I turned to page two.The bad news is: Now that I've completed reading the book, I cannot find anything like it! I can't wait for Something Blue to come out. It would be highly interesting to continue to with the Darcy-Rachel-Dex saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Loved this book! Right time to read for me in my life. Very interesting twists and yet a good underlying principle in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!","review":"I haven't read a book this entrancing as Something Borrowed in a very long time. I absolutly loved it and couldn't put it down. I read it in two days! It stirred up emotions in me that I have only felt with my husband, I was rooting for the main character the whole time, and I felt her emotions, like they were my own. I even felt my heart drop during one bad moment in the book. If a book can make me feel this way, then it's really good and worth the money! I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, despite what Rachel did","review":"Ok, so maybe Dex and Rachel messed up when they hooked up. He was with Darcy for 7 years and Rachel was her best friend since they were children! But still i really enjoyed reading this book and really thought that Rachel and Dex deserved each other and despite the fact that Darcy was hard to like, I was anxious to read her story and her point of view. Overall, i really enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Loved it!*","review":"I have been reading Emily Giffin's books in order, so I started with SoBo. I loved this book enough that I have bought all of her books! I cannot wait to see the movie! I have been suggesting Emily Giffin to all of my reading friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"\\"Something Borrowed\\" is the tale of Rachel: dutiful daughter, loyal best friend, kick ass laywer who happens to realize she's in love with her best friend's fiance. Obviously anyone reading this has already read the synopsis, so I won't bore you with that AGAIN. The one thing that I want to impress upon anyone considering this book is JUST DO IT. It is well written, the characters are well developed and fun, and you will not be able to put it down! Great to take to the beach or on vacation. I'm currently reading the sequel (\\"Something Blue\\") and it is equally as fun so far! Looking forward to checking out Giffin's other books as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Borrowed","review":"I got this book through GoodReads' giveaways. Emily Giffin's covers have always attracted me because they look so simple but elegant.The book is about Rachel, who just turned 30, is not married and is a good friend to Darcy ... until her drunken birthday party where she sleeps with Darcy's soon-to-be husband. Rachel feels horrible and so does Dexter( the Fiance). They vow to never do it again, but soon realize they feel something toward one and other.Most of the book is Rachel either talking to herself or to others about Darcy. Her friends think has some comeuppance and deserves what Rachel did/ is doing. It was the kind of book I wanted to talk back to and say, \\"yeah she may have deserved it, but it's still wrong to do.\\" So sometimes the book was a little frustrating, but something kept me hooked to find out what was going to happen.There is a sequel to this book that is all about Darcy called Something Blue. It may fall in my to be read mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I read it in one day! I was on the edge of my seat...rooting for Rachel to win Dex's heart. This is ironic because I had an ex-friend/roomate do the exact thing to me. She stole the man who I thought, at the time, was the love of my life. I wanted Rachel to win Dex because she reminded me a lot of myself and I just didn't like Darcy's superficial, flamboyant nature. I appeared to me that Darcy thought she was perfect and she learned that she wasn't. I am one to root for the underdog and I am happy that the book ended the way it did. I felt all the emotions that both Rachel and Darcy were feeling...vividly. This was a very well written book that both males and females can relate to and empathize with. Most of us have been in at least one of the characters' position at least once in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"chick lit\\"","review":"This is an extremely fast read that approaches friendship and romantic relationships in a way \\"chick lit\\" has not seen before. I immediately purchased \\"Something Blue\\" afterward for the other side of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did reviewers give this 5 stars?","review":"Searching for a new author of romantic comedy? Keep looking. Although Griffin's a pretty good writer, this book is a dog. The plot is: girl really likes boy; girl introduces boy to best friend who snatches him up; 10 years later, on eve of boy's wedding to best friend, girl has a fling with him and ends up breaking up the wedding. This is funny?? These are characters you want to know?? The characters hardly talk to each other, so there's no clever conversation, and there's no action either. I'm not into betrayal and I don't understand the 10-year time lag (I understand that being 30 is a big deal in this plot, but if turning 30 doesn't freak you out, major motivations are not going to make sense to you). This book is dull, so if you're looking for good romantic comedy, try another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beach read!","review":"This was a perfect summer book.

The second book is even worse. Sorry i bought both without reading the first book. Shallow and immature characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for me","review":"Sorry but I hated this book. A total focus on drinking, cheating, and not really liking yourself or anyone else. I was looking for a good summer read, and this didn't fit the bill.

Can't wait for Something Blue next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute adult chick-lit with more substance than fluff.","review":"This is my first shot at an Emily Giffin novel after receiving several recommendations from friends and I must say that I was very happy with the selection!It's a quick read that I found hard to put down. I loved the characters, the forbidden love story... and as a 30 year old myself, the 80s pop culture references were a delightful opportunity to giggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal","review":"This was the first book I had read by Emily Giffin.

I was also doubtful because of the content; however, Rachel is believable and real. Ms Giffin really develops her characters and makes you feel sorry for all of them.

A must read!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cold Book","review":"I found this book really hard to relate to. The characters all seemed fake and unrealistic to me.

There are too many good books there to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2 books together are wonderful","review":"I love these 2 books (Borrowed & Blue).

I was recommended the author by a customer at work and ordered the book on a whim and was totally beyond satisfied with my purchase! The book kept my full attention and I absolutely did not want to put it down.The story revolves around Rachel, a goody-goody who has recently slept with her best friend's fiancee during a drunken birthday celebration. Rather than feeling guilty, Rachel begins to see how much she has been taken for granted in her life and it triggers a series of self-empowering events for her. It is so strange to feel for the \\"other woman\\" but in Rachel's case, it is completely warranted. I absolutely fell for Rachel's character and hoped she would get exactly what she deserved in the end. It's a great read and I recommend it to all my friends and all the people reading this - don't hesitate, just buy it! You'll LOVE it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thought it was a wonderful book! I admit, it did have a little too much fluff in the middle - that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I found myself skimming through some of it because I just wanted to get to the good stuff (but that may be more my impatience than the book). Definitely have Something Blue on standby. I think I liked that book even more. At the end of Borrowed I found myself thinking that Darcy deserved what she had gotten (let's remember, Dex was not the only one cheating); but in Something Blue we see how she totally evolves and how it all works out (thanks to someone finally making her see the real truth about herself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"Havent been able to put it down! Finished it in 3 days! (I usually take a couple of weeks). Definitely recommend.

Already ordered \\"Something Blue\\", cant wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Lit PLUS","review":"You get the NYC setting, the girl talk, the boyfriends, the soul searching, but this book takes it much further. Rachel sleeping with her best friend's groom-to-be goes beyond a drunken fling on her 30th birthday. As the relationship develops, the suspense mounts. Will Dex call the wedding off? Has Rachel cast herself as the other woman permanently? Will she always play second fiddle to Darcy (and is Darcy really her friend)? What about Marcus and Ethan?The emotions and soul searching ring true and the dialogue and action flows faultlessly. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utterly dislikable cast of characters","review":"The main character is a horrible friend and does the unthinkable by falling for her best friend's fiancee. I could not identify with any of the characters bc I felt disgust for all of them. The ending was a complete cop-out and this book genuinly disturbed me with its utter lack of regard for friendship and love and honesty. Emily Giffin is a great writer - it was the plotline I despised.A word of advice - if you have ever had your heart broken and been betrayed by a friend at the same time then this book is not for you. It made me furious and sad when I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Distasteful, Painful","review":"absolutely horrible! i have no idea where this book is getting all the stars from?!extremely awful plot.painful narration.spineless characters.im surprised i actually made it to the end, but then again i just kept clicking next page.reading every other paragraph actually works cause the whole story was written in one painfully long babble."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I really wanted to like this book as I've been in the mood for some chick-lit recently...and an overwhelming number of reviews here say it's great...but i just don't understand it. This book is such a major disappointment! UGH! I really hate the main female character Rachel, I hate the main male character and I really don't care about any of the other characters. By the end I was just skimming past the ridiculousness to get to the conclusion which was pretty lackluster at best.

What is there to like about this character (Dex) that she is willing to behave this way regardless of her feelings towards her \\"best\\" friend. It doesn't make ANY sense?!I think that she is a pathetic, whiny character. She should think better of herself, distance herself from Darcy, dump Dex and move to England to be with Ethan, the only character that I liked in this awful book.

It was a total waste of time, and I will not pursue other books written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Borrowed","review":"Let's just say I wiah I had only \\"borrowed\\" this book as it was a total waste of money. The main character could only be salvaged in this novel after a year or two of therapy and the other characters in the book are not fleshed out enough by the author for anyone to conclude what their motives might be.

A perfect rainy day book to keep in your bookshelf for when you feel like spending time with an old friend.I have already read Something Blue and grew to like Darcy even more than Rachel. I think that was Giffin's intention and she did it well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book started out ok but as you go through the entire length it becomes obvious the main character is wimpy and someone I did not admire. She became so dependent on her best friends' fiancee that she stopped being herself. It ended well but I will definitely not be reading any more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I am a big time beach reader and this book was AWESOME! At first, I thought it was a bit slow going but I quickly changed my mind 1/2 way through chapter one! I finished it in 2 days and swiftly purchased SOMETHING BLUE! I had to know what happened to the characters next! A new favorite author for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"saw the movie and then read the book","review":"I love the book so far, you know granted i started reading it as soon as i got but i say the movie first. The book is so much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that I just couldn't help but wrap my brain around the idea that it's okay that Rachel, the supposed heroine in the book, was cheating with her best friend's fiance. I didn't even like her that much-- she created her own situations (remaining friends with a person she really didn't even seem to like, being so jealous of that friend that she could barely see straight, staying in a job she loathed, etc) and continually blamed everyone else for her miserable choices. Her lack of any sense of self-esteem seemed to be a driving force in this book and her rivalry for her \\"friend\\" was annoying. Not that Darcy was blameless, but I couldn't help but wonder why on earth I should be rooting for Rachel either. Not my favorite chick-lit book (and I've read a ton of them that I adore-- like anything by Sophie Kinsella!) and I'm not sure I will read \\"Something Blue\\" even though I bought it with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prequel for Something Blue","review":"This book is suppose to be a prequel for Something Borrowed but I don't think it matters if you read it out of order. This is the same story as Something Blue but from the perspective of Rachel, the smart, hard working, good girl that was best friends with Darcy the pretty popular girl. Rachel is a devoted friend and also a little naive to Darcy. Rachel sets up Darcy with one of her male classmates at law school and watches them get engaged and on the verge of marriage. Then, on Rachel's 30th birthday party, she has a fling with Darcy's fiance. It is shocking to her but she doesn't want to stop. She struggles with her loyalty to Darcy or following her heart for a guy she liked but never had the confidence to go for herself, but rather set him up with her pretty friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was rooting for you, Rachel!!","review":"Rachel and Darcy have been friends for a very long time. Darcy is the one who always gets the guy to fall for her ~ never has a hair out of place ~ shall I say nearly perfect, so she thinks?! Well, now is the time for settling down and Darcy is engaged to Dex, who Rachel was friends with first in law school.On Rachel's 30th birthday, she sleeps with Dex, and feels like she betrayed her bestest friend. However, she and Dex seem to have more than a one night fling. Is the wedding still on for Darcy and Dex?You'll have to read this great summer book to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Giffin never disappoints.","review":"Another wonderful book by Emily Giffin. She sure can spin a story and keep you wanting to find out what will happen. The characters are real and down to earth. I can see them, have met some of them, shocked by others. She is a master story teller.This book was interesting on all levels, between the story itself, how she draws us into the characters and intertwine us in their lives and the ending. I find Giffin wonderful depicting reality and young life.Another one of her books, I could not put down until it was done within hours. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not offensive, just boring","review":"I knew what the book was about and wasn't offended with the main characters being \\"cheaters.\\" I simply just thought the book was dull- mainly because the characters were not likable. Darcy was utterly obnoxious - the author obviously did not want the reader to like her, which therefore made me wonder why ANYONE would like her, including Rachel (who stuck around as her best friend for 20 years) and Dex. Dex was average; I wouldn't have been surprised if he had turned around 3/4 of the way through and screwed over Rachel (he wasn't a bad guy, but he didn't seem that incredible). Rachel was okay, but I wasn't drawn to her. I do not normally read \\"chick lit\\" books, but I'm not opposed to them; I was looking forward to reading a silly romance series. However, after reading this first installment, I do not think I will be reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWZER!!","review":"You won't be able to put this one down. Each page keeps you flipping to the next. Loved it! Emily Giffin's writing is a delight. Can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have gone with my gut","review":"I thought about reading this book about 3 weeks ago, but thought against it when I read the reviews. However, I had second thoughts and bought it this weekend. I really immensely disliked this book - I disliked Rachel and her weakness, jealously and envy of Darcy. Rachel was a pathetic character and weak to allow herself to be a doormat to Darcy who was pretty,popular and obnoxious - which she was because she got away with it. Rachel invited the pity party and she should have taken the opportunity to stand up for herself countless times. I ended up skipping pages just to get to the end. I'm just perplexed, confused and surprised that his book has garnered so many positive reviews, not to mention the movie and the others that have been optioned by this author. To each his own, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie trailer is more interesting than the book.","review":"There are no redeming qualities about these characters. The characters are so black and white. There is the spineless plain jane Rachel and the beautiful but shallow Darcy. The book tried hard to convince me these characters are best friends but failed. Everytime Rachel would feel guilty about the affair, she would have a flashback about Darcy treated her so cruelly in the past. She just wanted to justify her betrayl. This trick got very old. The men are also weak and useless. I am wondering the same thing as other reviewers and ask how someone rates this book so high. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money!!!","review":"This author is long winded and has no direction to the story line - I really don't know how this book got published - I feel so cheated!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Borrowed","review":"I would have probably loved it had I not already watched the movie. I knew what was going to happen before it happened, but will continue to read this series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Ioved it just as much as the movie. I wish Eathan had a bigger role. I can't wait to read the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"This was my first Emily Giffin novel and I just have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of this book. I wasn't really sure if I was happy the way it ended or not. I ended up not really liking any of the characters at all. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Couldn't put this book down, and quickly read \\"something blue\\" afterwards too, which I found to be an even BETTER book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable read","review":"This book was so much better than the movie version. I made sure I read the book first & Im glad I did. The characters were more varied & interesting than portrayed in the movie. Its a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous beach read!","review":"I really enjoyed this page turner while I was on my beach vacation. The characters were well developed and you love the twists and turns that the author writes for each. This is set between Manhattan and the Hamptons and I am familiar with each and enjoyed all the references to restaurants and bars etc. Great book with a nice twist at the end. I am onto Something Blue now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I didn't have a problem with the morality of the cheating. Happens all the time. What I did object to was the two-dimentionality of the main characters. All were cliched, boring and predictable. And Darcy's revelation? How convenient to justify Rachel and Dex's behavior. I agree with the reviewers who wondered about all the praise. You want to step into the book, shake Rachel and tell her to get on with it! You're living in one of the most exciting cities in the world and you can't find one other decent man? Weak plot, weak characters, several hour of my life I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful manipulation","review":"Rachel was portrayed as whiny and lacking courage and honesty. It was very manipulative to have the Darcy character as also having an affair and worse as pregnant in order to justify Rachel's own infidelity. I hope the author chooses to be more bold and original by writing characters and situations that do portray grayness of life. I hope Emily Griffin chooses to challenge financial success in order to present untold stories of love. Please stop recycling (down cycling) love tales that only serve to excuse dishonesty and fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been a while since I read this book","review":"...but I hated it. It frustrated me to no end. The only reason why I finished it was because it was recommended to me by a friend who said it was really good. I kept reading and reading, hoping it would get better. But it just got worse and worse and worse.This is a do not buy. If anything, borrow it from a friend, borrow it from the library. Waste of space on my bookshelf.. it made me so angry that I had to put it in a box out in the shed because it was a constant reminder of all the time I wasted reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"This can be summed up as an adult summer romance. Interesting characters. intriguing story line. Sometimes I, Grandma, would react to the characters with thoughts like \\"don't be so stupid\\" etc. etc. I got involved in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Witty","review":"This book came at a perfect time just as my daughter is entering adolescence! I enjoyed the witty and edgy humor of this great book! Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The oldest work of literature in recorded history","review":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh: A Myth Revisited is the oldest work of literature in recorded history and an epic poem which is aptly translated into English by Danny P. Jackson, and into Hebrew by Saul Tchernichovsky. Color illustrations in an impressive mosaic style mark this hardbound, bilingual rendition, and three informative essays about Gilgamesh round out this most impressive volume. An evocative and powerful presentation, The Epic Of Gilgamesh is an enthusiastically recommended addition to any personal, academic or public library collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No how-to details","review":"This book provides an excellent overview of high-tech PR tools. But it says almost nothing about how actually to communicate well. For example, on page 53 she cites one woman as being an expert on gaining reporters' attention with effective subject lines. But she does not provide even one example of an effective subject line!At the end of the book, she does include a sample press release format. Beware -- it's a template for an extremely boring \\"us too\\" press release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Susan Kohl, Getting Attention","review":"This book is targeted for novices who know nothing about high-tech PR and marketing. If you are new to the world of technology, then the book might be worth leafing through. Otherwise, it is a complete waste of time because the author does not offer any new perspectives. The reference guide at the end of the book is very self-promotional. When you read the book, you can tell that the author knows what she is talking about. The problem is she wanted to target the book to everyone which made the content very basic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the whole Communications department","review":"I found this book to be a great book for getting the wheels turning within the corporate commmunications organization. Good examples for for profits, non-profits and how different segements of the industry can communicate effectively. Filled with relevant tips on on how to be more effective with presentations and pitches to the media.As a Marketing professional I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to improve their presence wether they are a startup, foundation, or Fortune 500 firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I ordered this watch as a gift and was pleased to get it for far less than the retail price. When I received the watch it was clearly not authentic. The crystal is convex and appears to be a polymer composite as it distorts the dials when looking at it from any angle other than straight on. I investigated further by going to the mall where they sell the same watch and it was clearly not of the same quality. Beware of buying watches online, most are fakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...but...","review":"I love my watch, it is so nice and it looks great with any outfit, from jeans to a cocktail dress, however, I wore it for less than 1 month and it stopped working. I had to send it for repair and now I have it back, I must say that Bulova has a great Repair Service, even though they never contacted me, they returned my watch properly working within the 30 days they state as the time fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and fantastic","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She doesn't own may watches, but she loves this one. It has just the right amount of bling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved well over $100 fro Amazon.","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend. She saw it at Macy's and it was well over $100 more, on sale. The only thing I noticed was that the pearl face was not as \\"pearlescent\\" as the ones I saw at Macy's. All and all she loves it, and all the diamonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protection for electronic items","review":"I bought my first one of these to protect a handheld GPS that was under the seat of my car most of the time. Texas temperature extremes can be tough on delicate electronic gear like MP3 players, cameras, cell phones, or GPS units, and this does a good job of protecting such a device from temperature extremes, dust, dirt and accidental spills.I now have several of them which I keep on items like cameras and audiophile headphones even in the house or workshop. If it's (a) valuable or (b) delicate or (c) gets exposed to temperature extremes, it gets one of these on it, now. They work great in your luggage around your camera, or in the trunk of your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handwash only!","review":"I had to buy a new one because they are NOT dishwasher safe!

History of first several decades of 20th century in UK, including political scene, economics of the time, effects of WWI and aftermath -- all woven together with Lord Peter Wimsey stories (and critiques of those stories) and Dorothy Sayers' life. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the history of the time, those who love Lord Peter Wimsey and Dorothy Sayers. Well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I recently started working in post production and had been looking for a good reference book for a while.

I haven't been able to find another book that so effectively takes you through the nuts and bolts of post production, from scheduling all the way through to delivery. If you are an entertainment executive, a film student, or anywhere in between this book will be an invaluable resource. I've been working in the film and television industry for twelve years and this book has helped me in jobs at two major television networks and in feature post production at several studios. The new edition provides accurate and up to date information and is the only book I've been able to find that adequately covers the film laboratory. The Guide is the one book I always have at my desk. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Editorial Disaster - Stay Away!","review":"I was suckered into buying this worthless book for a survey class I took on Post-Production for Film and Television. What I hoped would be an enabler to my education turned out to be a hurdle: the book is poorly organized, the concepts aren't clearly explained, and the entire text is fraught with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. When the authors aren't clogging the text with jargon, they're giving you advice on how to do business in this industry. If you work in the industry, as I do now, this book won't tell you anything you don't know already. If you want to learn about the process, this book won't enlighten you.

All have two major failings. The lessor failing is they wear out in a very short time - usually in less than a year you have metal showing through the nylon and out goes the non-scratch feature. But the worst problem with these is the designers all seem to think it important to have a heavy handle which makes in nearly impossible to keep from flipping out of the sauce pan and throwing a spray of sauce around the kitchen.After many tries I finally gave up and just let my stainless pans scratch.

There are the obvious influences such as KC, Sly, James Brown, Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers to name a few. I don't consider it a pure funk album, more pop/funk My favorites are \\"Sweet Little Lass\\" and \\"Candy\\".Bobby's voice, at times raspy, can hit the high notes. The arrangements are tight.

Arranged to please other people rather than himself, the music is blander than bland, failing to evoke the flavor of either rock and roll or symphonic music. A couple of tracks rise to the level of decent MOR, but not really worth the wade through the rest.The remastering for CD is a pure amateur job. Treble-heavy, with no bass, and a gee-I-can-do-hiss-removal approach to noise reduction that has left a heavy cloud of digital burbles and other artifacts over the music that is far worse than any tape hiss could possibly be. Note to whoever thinks they can remaster for CD: First, buy yourself a decent pair of headphones. Then look for something beyond the first freeware program you find that claims to do noise reduction, and learn how to set the parameters so that the result sounds like music."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great song - unlike most other christmas songs","review":"Rob is a Poet and a phantastic composer, singer and musician.I am thrilled ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats the fuss????","review":"After reading the reviews on amazon and being a huge fan of MB20, Tabitha's secret and the amazing \\"Smooth\\", I thought I would download this song and give it a wee listen.

I have both recordings and either one is a superb listening experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful what you order","review":"The description of this CD matches a different CD with the same title. \\"Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings\\" is synthesized orchestral music composed by Mickey Simmonds. The CD with the De Meij and Bilik symphonies for wind band showcase the Dutch Military Band, whose name appears on the cover. Somehow these two CDs have been linked on the website and have the same reviews. If you are expecting De Meij or Bilik, and get Simmonds instead, you will be very disappointed.The Dutch Military Band is a good group, but I didn't enjoy the recording as much as the one by the US Marine Band. For my taste, the recording mics seem a little far from the group and pick up too much of the hall. I'd give them 4 stars.The Simmonds CD is really a set of 3 discs and if you enjoy descriptive synth orchestra music, you want the CD with the picture of big rocks at the ocean shore.

The cover of the book is the only colorful, exciting thing about it.Not that I was expecting a cookbook, but it does not appeal to a wide range of people, and that is a flaw.

Since then, the Ratcheting/Clutch went out and I had to send it back. That put me out 3 weeks. Then, although I wasn't sure I was charging the batteries correctly ( I was ), I had to send in the batteries and charger in and they were replaced. Now, I have had the batteries and charger back for 4 months and the batteries are again draining too fast. Of course, Makita has no idea why any of this is happening, but I have had a Hitachi Impact Driver for 3-1/2 years and it runs circles around this %$#@&* Makita.

Makita ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine, despite unreliable transmission","review":"I had this drill and it's a great machine on all parts except the badly engineered transmission.I know have the BHP458z. It has a far better transmission which you can rely on.I think Makita stopped making this 3-speed machine due to it's unreliability and they have now gone back to using only 2 gears in their machines. I guess we have to wait a little while longer for a 3-speed gearbox that can be relied on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Drill!","review":"This is a nice drill. I use it hard and it has always worked well for me under all conditions. The light is a handy feature. The battery holds a charge for a long time and recharges fast. I gave it four stars because the chuck is difficult to tighten fully. Normally it's fine, but if the bit hits an obstacle and stops fast, the chuck loosens. You can't tighten it as much as a key chuck nor as much as a split collar hand tighten chuck like Milwaukee uses. Price is high too, but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transmission Problems","review":"I have used three of the Makita BDF451s in my home furniture and cabinet business for three years now, and they are great drills to use. Just need to be a little tougher. I used to own a commercial cabinet shop and must have heavy-duty tools, as I demand a lot from them. I concur with what others have said about power, balance, the very helpful light, quick charge time, etc. But now, two of the three drills have developed transmission problems. The problem starts with 3rd gear (gears slipping, popping out of gear). Eventually, all gears are affected. The motors run just as powerfully as the day I bought them, and battery endurance is likewise still great. But the drills make horrible gear grinding sounds now, and power no longer gets to the chuck. I would give 5 stars if Makita made a tougher transmission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Battery Life","review":"I am currently using this drill to build a deck. The battery life is impressive.

Although Boyd uses assassination and staged bombings in the U.S., Bushused 9/11 in a similar manner to induce fear in the population and provide arational for executive rule. Boyd's power play runs into more Congressionalopposition and is less brazen than the reality of actions by G.W.

However, in my opinion the plot was contrived and far fetched at best if not simply a conjured up non sense.

With Gillette's history in the preceding novels he should be justifiably paranoid, wary of every coincidence and interaction. He abandons his own mantra \\"trust no one\\" and manages to get people killed in the process. Maybe the author left out the chapter where Gillette is prescribed valium by his psychiatrist. That's about the only way this plot can be explained.Frey's demonstrated he's capable of much better; must have been bored and needed closure for the character.
