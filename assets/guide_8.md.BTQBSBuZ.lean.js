Before I started this review, I checked to see if other people had my problem, a few did, and some said you need to pull the tab in the back or change the batteries. I've done those things, it STILL will not play an entire song. Every song fades away after about 5 seconds. It's a shame cause my son (1 old) loves this thing. We've had it about 6 months, but he's just recently started carrying it all over the place. The major downside is he has to continuously press the button to get the songs to play since they fade away so quickly. I've checked the back thinking maybe there was a switch that said 'Demo-mode', or maybe a tab that I missed...nope. Maybe I just got a lemon, which is a bummer since he seems to like it, but I just can not give this toy a good rating based on my experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I get a dud?","review":"I just purchased this toy for my grandson.

He loves to stay in the kitchen and very interested in things on the fridge. However, this toy did NOT stay on the fridge so it killed the purpose. It seems that the magnets are not strong enough to carry its weight. In addition, my son likes to interact with toys. This one did not offer much because there is only one button that activates the music which makes it pretty boring for my son. The lights are fun to watch because they light up according to music, which I liked. But again, there is not much to engage little ones except for sitting in front of it and watching how lights changes to the music. My son is 11 month-old. For older boys it might be different.

Background vocal tracks were playing as if it were a pop dance show, and I have strong reason to believe they weren't even playing some of the instruments. The lead guitarist switched guitars in the middle of a song and there was no difference at all. Did they think we were that stupid? It was a miserable experience to hear them butcher their own best songs, even worse to hear songs I didn't know, even worse because the bass player made such socially awkward statements, yet even worse when the singer made fun of Dave Matthews.

I also have a Brita sink filter on my kitchen sink and this one beats it in ease of installation, ease of use, and looks. It also feels more solid.The water tastes great (we have very hard water and I hate the taste of tap water here), and it's attractive very easy/clear to use.

The product literature says that the filters should be good for 200 gallons, so with only the two of us in the household, the six pack of filters I added to the purchase, we should be set for a long time.Pros:Easy installation.Quick on and off if you need to remove it for any reason.Works.

I have owned 3 Pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use. Why? Because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time. Tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse. Removing and reinstalling the unit does not help. I have become so frustrated by Pur water products that I will never again purchase anything made by them. I just installed a Brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the Brita is more reasonably priced at up to 15 dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit.

The attachment was too short; the off-center weight of the heavy filter was hanging from the faucet by only about a couple of threads of the plastic attachment. Eventually, movement of the filter wore the threads just ever-so-slightly, and it wouldn't stay on for more than a minute. Back to the PUR refrigerator container.

They worked fine for 9 and 14 months respectively, then the cheap plastic materials failed on each of them.

This is the first horizontal mount unit (the first three were vertical mount) and it really is more \\"out of the way\\" mounted on the faucet, especially when filling a tall pitcher to make iced tea (the vertical ones had to be lifted over the top of the pitcher). I've rated the performance as 5-stars (which it is); it remains to be seen if the longevity of this one will also live up to that rating (the previous ones lasted anywhere from over 2 years to less than 1 year, which was replaced under the PUR warranty with no questions asked)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY better than Brita!","review":"I struggled with Brita onTap filtration systems for years. In that system, the white ring that tightens it to the faucet was, for me, almost impossible to tighten sufficiently to prevent leaks, and the units themselves lowered the clearance to the sink horribly.So, initially, the feature that most convinced me to try the PUR 3-Stage Horizontal Mount was the snap-on capability.I can happily report that this has worked out beautifully for me!The rubber adaptor screwed on to the faucet easily and then, SNAP, the unit was mounted.LEAK-FREE.I selected the Horizontal model which seems to take up so much less room, and the ability to snap it off and on makes it easy and non-damaging to the seal to remove it entirely if i need more clearance.More importantly, the water tastes FANTASTIC.

I use filtered water for the family as well as our Dog, cat and 2 birds. I am afraid to drink the water. I e-mailed Pur and waiting for a response. I had another filter system which is rather cumbersome so thought the Pur would be better. Definately smaller but if they cant tell me whats wrong I will send it back and try something else. I will try to follow up if and when I hear from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter Fraud?","review":"I bought a Model FM-9400. After three months or so the light turned red.

When we tried to change the filter for the first time, neither me or my beloved could get the thing to click back into position without it falling out.

I have gone through three of the horizontal mount version and two of the vertical ones. In about 6 months the horizontal ones leak arround where they fit to the faucet. The virticals spray water out of the window over the wear indicator. They will spray water all over you and your kitchen. If you keep the box the filter came in you can call PUR within a year of purchase and give them the code on the box. They will send you a cupon for a new filter. The consumer protection site here is filled with complaints about this peice of junk.[...]They redesigned it and now it pops off the faucet instead of just spraying water all over you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good filtering but junk","review":"I went through 4 or 5 different PUR faucet mount filters over several years - in various different configurations. Invariably, the filters clogged long before they had filtered their rated capacity of water, and the mounts cracked in less than a year - often less than 6 months. The filters are difficult to change because the caps on the mount get jammed. The water quality was very good, but the product is truly junk.I switched to Brita faucet mount and have been happy with the same one for almost 3 years now. Water quality is 1/2 notch below PUR, but much better made and easier to change.The best I ever used was the PUR sink mount filters which lasted the longest but they stopped making those years ago unfortunately.Haven't tried Culligan but from the reviews they also have big quality problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"New model is AWFUL","review":"I had the previous model for 3 years and loved it. When it finally broke it was an easy decision to buy a new one. The problem is PUR has changed the way the filter attaches to the faucet tip. It used to securely screw in, now with the new model, it supposed to \\"click\\" in utilizing two plastic snaps. If you don't mind having your filter system fly off the end of faucet and smash to the bottom of your sink every few times you turn it on, then you should have no problems! The new design for how it fits to the faucet is flawed. And I have a very common Home Depot purchased Moen faucet. So it's not my faucet that's the issue. It's the PUR. After returning it (which Amazon made so easy), I changed brands. Bought the Britta version. Not only does it stay on the faucet (go figure), but also has 3 settings (filtered water, regular non-filtered flow, and spray flow) and fills a cup a lot faster than the PUR ever did. I am now a Britta convert."},{"rating":"1","title":"water does not taste good, flimsy, leaking","review":"Water tastes weird. No chlorine taste which is good, but there is no other taste. It is as if you are drinking totally tasteless substance.I've got a \\"stainless steel version, hoping that it would be more sturdy... but it is made from the same crappy plasstic that other colors... So if you are going to get this - don't pay more for stainless steel version.It started leaking a little where it mounts to the faucet after a couple of month of ocassional useI don't like the taste and tend not to use the filter often. Will probably throw away once the filter runs out.I think I would have to stick with brita pitcher filter - water from it tastes much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd one in 6 months--all failed the same way","review":"We are on our third one in 6 months. (The second two were replacements from PUR, via coupons sent to us after we called PUR about the faulty units.)They have all failed in an identical way: leakage, not from the connection between the unit and the faucet, but from the other side (the filter side) of the black plastic \\"nut\\" that one uses to attach the unit to the faucet. (The one that we installed today was brand-new, yet had the same problem.)This is basically a design flaw, inherent in the unit, that is not fixable by the consumer.We are throwing in the towel at this point. Taking our losses and moving on. Dealing with this has been too much trouble and taken too much time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and cracks","review":"We have used Pur filters for years now, not by choice but because we are always able to get a new one by calling in to the company because the unit either cracks or falls of the faucet before the warranty is up. The company is VERY good about sending a coupon for replacement with any Pur faucet mounted unit. The filter is junk, the free filters in the future kind of make up for that. If you don't want the hassle, go with another filter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"I purchased this filter after reading more positive than negative reviews on several websites. The faucet mount chrome water filter looks fine, installs easily, but it is sooooooo poorly designed that the company should be embarrassed. What some other reviewers call a slower output from the filtered water side is more like a trickle. First three weeks was bearable, slow but steady. Now, it just trickles out and takes about 2 minutes to fill an 8 ounce glass. That is, if the water actually comes out in one dribbly stream. I've taken it apart, put it back together and it will work fine for a day or two, then it's back to it's trickle. I can just guess that a design flaw creates a vaccum in the filter and stops the water flow after some use. Whoever designed this POS should be embarrassed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!! DO NOT BUY!","review":"SAVE YOUR SELF TIME AND MONEY!When we first purchased this product we were thrilled.... although too bad it's made entirely of plastic... after about 6 months of movement on the faucet it stripped the (again plastic) adapter for your faucet and then repeatedly fell into the sink over and over again. cracking a little bit more every time. I called to get a replacement adapter for the faucet which was sent but only lasted for another 2 months. the adapter is soft plastic and the sink head (as is everyone's) is made from metal... hence when metal twists over and over around soft plastic is strips it and eventually cuts right through it and destroys it. like a knife cutting slowly over time.SAVE YOUR SELF THE HEADACHES DO NOT BUY THIS. DO NOT BUY...I suppose the best thing is when I throw it out I can recycle it... because it's plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made product","review":"The hardware that attaches this filter to the sink is made of plastic, not metal. It barely lasted two months before it broke. Now the plastic hardware won't even hold the weight of the filter, so there is no way to attach the filter to the sink. The filter looks nice and does a good job of filtering the water, but all of that is pretty useless if you can't attach it to the sink because the cheap plastic hardware broke. This was a waste of money. We have since bought a different faucet-mounted water filter made by GE. It was less expensive, looks every bit as good as the PUR filter, and it's hardware is all metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This hardware sucks","review":"Just tried to install this piece of crap. The adapter leaks like a sieve, and the filter adapter keeps falling off the faucett. I won't make this mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So frustrating","review":"Ugh. Even tho' I use the PUR filter it is so frustrating. My main issue now is that the adapter that they supply is made of plastic. OK..plastic vs. metal. Is it going to strip? Of course it will over time. Too bad the time interval was only a few weeks with normal use. As mentioned in other reviews, shoddy design and failure to use good materials is the theme. The adapters should have been made out of metal. Now, the unit shoots off when you turn the faucet on.Although the snap-on design is cool, there is a lot of play in the attachment. I think the prior design was better but, similar to others, the adjustable screw on bolt would crack. Good luck hunting for a better unit. I know I AM looking for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I had a vertical pur faucet mount similar to this one which last 2 years. This one detached from my faucet after only one month. I tried to re-attach to my faucet, but it leaked water constantly.

Thanks Amazon, good service always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - do not buy this brand!","review":"Our second PUR faucet mount filter just broke and fell off the faucet. No more!The problem is that the cheap plastic collar that screws onto the faucet has only 1/8 inch or less of threading and that's not enough to fasten it securely. It strips away in a short time, and the whole filter assembly falls into the sink; the weight of it will break any dishes it falls on.If PUR cared to make a more durable product, they would upgrade that simple collar part into metal, not plastic, and/or would increase the threading on it to 1/2 inch.In the meantime, buy a different brand!I've just ordered one made by Culligan, which is rated higher by Amazon reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap hardware.

It was easy to install and appeared pretty solid. Unfortunately, it started falling off the faucet after about a month because the cheap threads adapter couldn't handle the weight. If they could just improve that one component (maybe provide a metal one instead of plastic?) I would give a 5-star endorsement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slows down to a drip after 2 weeks - unusable in my apartment","review":"On initial use, the water certainly tasted far better than straight from the mains and the unit performed well... for about one week.The attachment to the faucet was better quality than Brita's version, being metal rather than plastic.Like the horizontal version, the main problem, however, is that the water flow slowed down considerably after about 2 weeks and was unusable, giving only a very slow trickle, so slow that it dripped back up the faucet!It says in the instructions that water with a high amount of particles can affect the flow rate, but this is crazy! I had to return this product back to the store. I live in Manhattan, NY if that's any use to any other potential buyers.I've now tried both Pur horizontal and vertical mounts, which both trickle, then Brita's version, which didn't trickle but just sprayed everywhere. My final test is a Clear2O water pitcher... fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts leaking after 1 month","review":"This thing started to leak like crazy after about 1 month of normal use.

However, after 2-3 weeks (using 1-2 gallons per day), the flow of water was down to a trickle. To fill an 8-oz water glass takes about 2 minutes. Filling the coffee maker reservoir takes forever... The claimed lifespan of a filter cartridge is 2-3 months (100 gal), but for me it is closer to 2-3 weeks (25 gal or so). This makes it a much more expensive proposition than advertised.

We can run about 4 filters (we have REAL hard water with lots of lime) and that is it then the leak. Someone should turn them in since this isnt very eco friendly since you are losing alot of water while trying to just get a small amount of filtered water. I would say once they start leaking more unfiltered water leaks out then what filter water you get to use. And another thing I noticed they are saying they filter 99% but we still get tons of lime deposits on things like the drinking glasses with the purified water. Also it still limes up my coffee maker it doesnt do it as fast but there is still lime getting through which makes me wonder what else gets through since micro organisms are smaller then the lime.

However, the design of this faucet makes filling pans and pitchers with water, very difficult. My guess is that the shape of the filter does not work well with the shape of our sink; this is something people should think about before purchasing a certain model. We purchased this faucet as a replacement for the exact faucet given to us as a gift via Amazon, less than a year ago. The previous faucet began leaking in various places after about 9 months. We thought getting a new faucet would correct the problem. The new faucet, however, began leaking after one month. It is probably something we are doing wrong, but I am not an expert.

Amusing for a couple times but with very diminishing returns.The FM-9400B lasted only 4 months.They're great filters for a few months but they simlply don't last and now I'm stuck with two filters from my latest pack of 6 (and they aren't inexpensive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine, until it cracked","review":"After 1 year of very mild use hairline cracks appeared.

The filter can not handle the hot water (NOTE: even the hot water is NOT going though the filter itself, but the temperature above 110 degrees heats up the WHOLE unit). The gaskets fail and the water starts leaking..The mystery is solved. I hope PUR will start making these filters using more heat-resistant plastic...Thank you... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended Pur Water Filter","review":"I found the Horizontal Faucet easy to mount. The chrome is stylish and compliments the kitchen. Unlike others which take time to fill your pitchers the filtered water comes out rather quickly and you will have your pitcher filled in no time. It has a green light indicator which is very handy to let you know when it is time to replace the filter. The Pur water filters are more convenient than bottled water and is the way to go for me. I'm sold and highly recommend the product.The only con (which is not a con but why I gave it 4 stars) I prefer the vertical mounts as opposed to the horizontal mounts. This is only because it doesn't leave much space to place pitchers under the faucet to refill and you either have to hold it or tilt it. If you like convenience this product is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty sketchy","review":"Should have believed the reviews I read about this filter here on Amazon. Only had it a month or so and it has slowed to a trickle. If I want a glass of water it takes 30 seconds to get it and sometimes, if I have used it a lot recently, the flow slows to the point the water runs back along the filter and won't even drop straight down into the glass. Very disappointed. The water is great, if you're willing to wait for it. The product is not great. Save your money and buy a Brita pitcher. Note: I have not had the leakage problems other reviewers have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"Bought this filter and was so excited. Easy install, only took a few minutes. Stayed on faucet about 10 minutes, then clunk, into the sink the whole thing including the plastic adapter. Tried again, fits great without the washer, but of course it leaks. With the washer does not allow good enough connection. Thinking maybe I just got a defective one, I took it back and exchanged it. Nope, second one exactly the same (husband installed that one). Don't waste your money on this one. I am trying Culligan next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"I had been using this product for a little bit more than 2 years, but I don't like it and I will switch if I have other options. I live in a rental apartment in New York city and this seems to be the best choice to purify water. But as everyone else says, the faucet mount will break sooner than you think.

Six attempts to intall the filter failed due to the poor design. The filter is too heavy for the shallow depth/ height of the threads. No matter what I tried, it kept falling off the faucet. I tried taking the washer out in the hopes that a few extra turns would help it fasten. Naturally, this led to leaking. I tried various methods of tightening and nothing worked. On the last attempt and after running water through it for 5 minutes, I stuck my glass under it, and it fell off again. I bought it at Target and will be returning it tomorrow. Interestingly, I installed two similar Pur filters 18 years ago in my college apartment. I had the same problems then as I had today (would not remain fastened). I am shocked that after almost two decades, Pur persists with the same poor design. Time to switch to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have used Pur for years","review":"but these newer horizontal mount filters leak. I switched to this model so that it would provide a little more clearance than the old style filter but they leak from the faucet fitting and along the edges of the part below the faucet.

Now this one is leaking badly, as well. I am very disappointed.One of the reasons I switched from bottled water to filtering my own was to reduce waste but having to buy a new filter assembly every year or so defeats the purpose. It also is very expensive to keep having to start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine until it starts to spray","review":"After four or five months of good reliability, the unit started to spray water from the manufactured seal around the mouth of the faucet.

I recently got a One Click and I hate it. While doing dishes one day I accidentally bumped the white click on button with a dish and down came the whole unit. Also, while rinsing dishes it is way too easy to bump into the lever with a dish. The problem this poses is that hot water is not to be run through the filter. I've caught it within a couple of seconds but I become concerned if the filter is ruined anyway. I'm going back to the old design. This one stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"The Pur Faucet filter is a piece of junk. I've owned it for two months and it only worked decently for about four days. It comes with two filters. I used the first filter for two days before the water began coming out so slowly it was unbelievable, I'm talking a good minute or more to fill a normal glass. When I changed the filter it worked well again for two days before doing the same thing. Not only does it take forever to fill a glass, the water comes out so slowly that it trickles down the outer filter casing and drips and drabs all over the place, rather than running into the glass. I don't know what the deal is, other than the possibility the filter is getting clogged. I've never been so disappointed in a purchase. $40 thrown down the drain (pardon the pun).

But guess what, after 3 months of use, the joined edges of the parts went loose and now water are spitting out all over the places when we try to use the filter. That was another $50 into the trash. Honestly, what kind of QC inspection are they running in production? Their faucet product qualities are just terrible. PUR is going on our blacklist now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks incessantly, stops working after 2 days, junk","review":"This product is a piece of junk. It started leaking on day 1 and never stopped. You cannot tighten the screw enough to stop the leakage, even with additional stuffing. The filter stops working after literally 2 days, when the water out of the filter trickles down to nothing. At that point, if you switch to a new filter core, it starts working marginally again for 2 days, and then you have to replace the core again. This is the worst consumer product in the kitchen I have ever used. It never functioned.

Once again the latest unit has started leaking profusely. I might be able to tolerate a few drips here and there, but half the water that is supposed to either come out of the faucet or come out of the filter never makes it where it's supposed to.

It randomly falls off into the sink, and eventually I have to hold it tight to the faucet to use the filter.

The leak will progressively grow until water is no longer directed to the filter, but rather sprays out from the faucet mount point in all possible directions. Given the short lifetime of the product (maybe a year), consumers are advised to investigate more durably constructed alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately I can't give this thing 0 stars","review":"I bought this a year ago and recently purchased a TDS water meter. Basically the water meter measures how much dissolved solids are in the water. To my surprise, the meter read about 220 ppm for both tap and filtered water. I then cracked open a bottle of water from the fridge to see if the meter was working and found it read a mere 10 ppm. My surprise quickly became anger as it now dawned on me that I have been drinking from this thing for the past YEAR all the while it was basically tap. Now 220 ppm in tap isn't that bad as I have heard other people get 300+ or even 400+ readings on their tap...those poor souls. But still, I expected this thing to do something. Maybe I was wrong to expect a water filter to actually filter stuff out rather than just look cool. I guess that deserves 1 star. It looks pretty cool, but as far as functionality goes I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction","review":"I don't mind spending a little extra on a filter since I don't expect to replace it that often. And I owned one of Pur's original attachments for over a decade! But the screw-on faucet attachment is made of a very soft plastic that got stripped almost immediately. Like many other reviewers, I found that this piece of garbage has the tendency to pop off after only a month or two of use. The overall construction of the unit is suspect as well - the on/off toggle is very frail and was broken in the in-store display, which should have been my first clue.The most disappointing thing of all is that I purchased this as part of a bundle, which means I have 2 unused filters. But I have no desire to give this company any more money for a new attachment, so I feel doubly-wronged.Will it work properly or will it shatter dishes in your sink? Will it spray you and your loved ones in the face?

Both of our models have leakage issues. Despite tightening the mount multiple times, a lot of water is still wasted near the indicator light where the faucet and filter are screwed together.This is not a long term investment, and it's hard to justify the cost when leakage becomes an issue after just 1 month. The water tastes great, but I'll stick with my Brita filter for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I give it 1 star because the water tastes good, however after 3 1/2 months use, the plastic adapter securing the filter to the faucet stripped out and will no longer support the weight of the filter.

The first two were the vertical, plastic-cased products. They both sprang leaks in the plastic casing. For a third try, I went to the new horizontal model. It worked fine for several months but then the little indicator light, which is supposed to tell me when it's time to replace the filter, stopped working. There doesn't seem to be any way of fixing it. A call to the 1-800 number was considerably less than helpful. \\"We're saorry you're having this problem. Call us back if it continues.\\" Now I have to mark the calendar when I replace the filter and cross my fingers that I'm timing it right. The actual filtration is good; the water tastes great.

I've had my own for about 6 months; there are few things I own that I think highly enough of to give as a gift, but the PUR is one of those items -- this was purchased as a Christmas gift. Easy to use, and think of all those plastic bottles I'm keeping out of the landfills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - stay away!!!!","review":"Had 2 of these fail completely in 5 months. They end up coming off the faucet when you turn the water on - the filter and the cheap plastic mount that screws onto the faucet, which then strips the plastic threads making it useless.

I decided that instead of buying another filter replacement for my Culligan I would try this PUR model instead. Big mistake! The attachment is for lack of a better word, junk. It is plastic and flimsy. I can't see it lasting more than a couple of months. The filter itself stopped working after only two weeks of minimal use. The next filter did the same thing. Mind you, my Culligan was cheaper, the attachment while sometimes difficult to screw on is secure, and the filters would last me close to two months. I only tried the PUR model because I thought that it might serve me better. Nope!!!!Don't waist your money. It might look nicer than the white Culligan model but the Culligan is a much better design. P&G; should take this PUR model off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed","review":"I have to concur with so many other reviewers. The nylon faucet adaptors are inadequate for supporting the weight of the unit. Like clockwork, after two months, the threads became compromised and the unit popped off the faucet, rendering it useless. Typical of the disposable products American companies are foisting on the public. Sadly, I (and I am sure many others) would be willing to pay more money for a higher quality product. Clearly Procter & Gamble prefers to manufacture this junk, priced low enough to dupe consumers into thinking they're getting a bargain - more to add to the overflowing landfills. Don't even think about purchasing any replacement filters - this thing will NOT last long enough to require a replacement filter. Awful, awful, awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"the \\"systems\\" should be forever FREE with filter puchases, and replacements sent out no questions askedI thought my Brita was bad cuz filters were smaller, but the PUR hardware is \\"pure junk\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart within 3 months.

Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filters Average Only a Couple Weeks","review":"I bought this as a replacement for an aging Brita filter of similar design. After two months, I am considering switching back. The biggest problem we've had so far is that the filters (PUR RF-9999-3 3 Stage Faucet Mount Filter, 3-Pack) only last a couple of weeks before water flow begins to slow to a trickle. On previous models I've owned, the filters would never reach their specified 3-month lifespan, but they would at least get close. These filters are rated up to about 100 gallons. Though we drink a lot of water, we certainly have not consumed 400 gallons in the past two months!Not only do the filters have a short life, but the frequent replacing of them has taken a toll on the assembly itself. After only one month, pieces (cosmetic not functional) started falling off of body.The filter looks good, and is easy to install and use, but the frequent replacing of the filters becomes very expensive, very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"Finally, the design works in at least my faucet sink configuration.Easy assembly...the washers that come with it will fit just about anything.

Pur filtered water has always tasted better to me than Brita so I'm glad I gave Pur a second chance.

You can easily remove the filter although."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great for Me","review":"The PUR chrome 3-Stage Vertical Faucet Mount filter does the job. I had used a \\"Water Pic\\" filter for several years and was satisfied with it, but I like the look of the PUR chrome unit better and it goes well with the other fixtures. Installation was literally a snap, and the water bypass works well.The filtered water from the tap tastes great and the unit also aerates the stream well. The cost of replacement filters is reasonable and the process of changing them is quick and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy installation, convenient to use","review":"My friend in US recommended this filter to me. After searching around, I found amazon sells this product in a reasonable price.Before I start to use this filter, I'm afraid whether I can install it by myself as I am not good in it. When I opened the box, the instruction for installation is clear, the installation procedure is so easy for a dumber like me.It's convenient to use as well, the LED indicator can tell me when to change the filter clearly. Unlike other filters my friend is using, they need to either remember the time or check the color of the filter. I'll continuously use this product and recommend to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"water taste good again.","review":"After having drank bottled water for years due to the nasty county water here in Maury County TN.

Coffee and tea taste much better made with the filtered water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water tastes great.","review":"For the price it's hard to complain too much about the quality of this. It was disapointing to find out the mount is actually plastic, but after 2 months of use it still works and looks good. It can be annoying while washing dishes, since it sits down lower in our sink and we are constantly having turning it out of the way. Yet, we werent ready to try our luck and money on a reverse osmosis system yet and a pitcher filter just wasnt practical with having to fill constantly. We have well water, which is very hard (live in a desert) and to me had tasted dirty. I am not completely certain how well it's filtering, but our water does tastes so much better! I plan on getting a water test to check, but I do feel hopeful. Now we use this for all our drinking water and in our coffee pot, which now doesnt get nearly as much calcium buildup as before.

In the past week I've also purchased a replacement for that water filter, but just returned it because of another leak. The one I installed today is my 4th unit.I love how easy these things are to install. You just unwrap it, connect it, twist it on and.........it is leaking again. Second time in literally two weeks. It is leaking from underneath the plastic ring and as a result it makes it completely unusable. Seriously, I cannot believe that two brand new units are broken out of the box.

The water does taste great until the unit stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs slight redesign","review":"The filter process seems to work well but the unit drips onto the countertop behind.

The last PUR filter I had, I bought in 2003. It lasted a long time. It was also all-metal, no plastic parts in attaching the filter to the faucet. It finally gave out and I got this one, although I was wary of the plastic connector part. I have only myself to blame--I saw all the negative reviews but I bought the unit anyway.

Neither one is still working. It works fine for about 2-3 months then the adapter that connects the faucet to the filter apparently strips it's threads and the filter detaches from the faucet . This wouldn't be so bad if you could replace the adapter. There is no place to buy a replacement adapter. Apparently there is no web site for Pur filters. At least I can't find it. Amazon doesn't sell it and hardware stores don't either. This means that for lack of a little plastic adapter an otherwise fine filter system can't be used. I'll never buy another Pur product.

But this particular mount is very heavy for an average kitchen faucet that it pulls the mechanism down too much. The slightest adjustment to the filter itself (even when you change the cartridge) can cause the threads of the filter to become stripped.

The cracks occurred in the part that is directly underneath the faucet, not where the water comes out of the filter.

Ms. Brice is extremely thorough in her explanations, though they are brief. I agree with the other reviews that wanted more examples of arm placement in dance, and a section on hands would have been great. But, the DVD is about ARMS. This instruction set is for those who want to bring their arm work up to an elite level. (With regular practice, you will get, at the very least, an amazing increase in range of motion in the shoulders.) and who doesn't want arms like Rachel Brice? That said, the lessons and exercises are not complicated. But, they are hard and require consistent practice. I give this DVD five stars because of the excellent instruction and for the fact that RB reveals her secrets including how to do the side winder, a fundamental serpentine move."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable part to incorporate into your practice","review":"This is NOT a complete workout and is NOT even meant to be one.

I can see how some people might have found it lacking in moves or choreography, but that gives you room to be creative and find your own style.

The Black Dial with white numerals and minute and hour hands is awesome w/the white stitched black leather band-not too flashy just right for a conservative like me. The Indiglo feature is cool.With the black dial sometimes it may not show up real well depends on the lighting but to me its GREAT. Overall I like this oversized watch a lot.

This kits allows you to rotate atoms about the bonds (great for exploring the different conformations of compounds (anti, gauche, ellisped stuff) and converting between chair conformations of cyclohexane.

I do have a hard earned A in Organic Chemistry but it is definitely not because these models helped me to understand anything. We cannot use models during the tests so I don't think that relying solely on the models is a good idea anyway. If you are not generally a visual learner, DO NOT BUY MODELS!!!I also do not think that these things are worth the price. They are made of cheap plastic and are often a poor interpretation of the actual models they are supposed to represent. I plan to make a rather large molecule to put on my desk.

After about 7 or 8 months, the spring within the chopper gave out, and we were on the hunt for a new one. Beyond reliability limitations, this model is also more difficult to clean after use as the chopping blade is not removable for easy dishwasher cleaning.My wife and I have since moved onto the Chef'n VeggiChop and have really enjoyed it for the past 5 months.

Unfortunately, the blades are too flimsy and too dull to cut anything else. When I attempted to chop an onion, the blades merely bruised the onion, or left pieces of onion lodged between the blades. This even occurred after cutting the onion into smaller pieces, as recommended by other users. The compartment space is small, and the cap on the bottom of the compartment prevents the blades from working properly. In order to use this product effectively, you must remove the cap, and use a cutting board (thereby releasing the scent of whatever you are chopping, and rendering the cap feature useless).

It's a great product.My only gripe is Creative's customer support. They don't have an 800 number so you'll have to call long distance to get in touch with them by phone and the only other way to get customer service is through email, but it seems that they aren't prompt with the email part.

It also holds its edge poorly (and was even dull when we first got it). Both my wife and I also find the grip very awkward. The size also limits its usefulness - for example, it's too small to chop onions.This usually just sits in our drawer as we use a higher-quality chef's knife. It's cheaper than other knives, but still not worth it.

You cant type the street you want, so you have to go by the list supplied by the software. The voice says lost satellite at least 5 or 6 times a minute. I typed in a big city nearby and got about 10 points of interest. We tried restaurants and it couldn't find any that we asked for. Again, some of the names showed up but it always sent us somewhere else. Inputing streets also takes forever on a laptop and the layout is not intuitive at all.

The software is definately NOT for the task of figuring out the best route to connect all stops. A piece of cake for Honda GPS and even for Microsoft Trips.The search is too dummy also, e.g. It tells me the nearest \\"Walmart\\" is 72 miles away. Later I figured that the actual \\"Wal-Mart\\", searched by \\"Wal\\" instead, is only 4 miles away."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS","review":"I love this unit. It is easy to use and accurate.

I love it after a 2-weeks road trip around the USA. I can't without it anymore. Literally you don't need a map in your car. Input your location and you be there! Even finding hotel and steakhouse is so easy along the road. It's not without minor error but it's only due to outdated data in the software and I believe you can keep update your sofeware whenever new version comes up. I believe GPS will be as popular as cell phone in a few years. Garmin's products are definitely leading the market.

My unit did not work and after one hour and half hours with Garmin, we were instructed to return the product under the warranty. Upon return, we tried again to install the unit, this occured after spending a half an hour with tech support. It seems we are not able to connect to the approbrite driver.

In fact, if you enjoyed Hand's similar album, titled \\"Jazzantiqua\\", you will no doubt like this album also. Hand's music ia also in somewhat the same vein as some of the Paul Winter consort albums. But this album is more of a unique work and has only vague similarities. There are some very fine musicians performing on this CD like Eugene Friesen on cello and Eddie Daniels on woodwinds (among many). Primarily acoustic instrumentals, with some backing from electronics, and with a combination of the harmonies of English folk music but with the freeplay of jazz improvisation. The music offers both a feeling of relaxation as well as food for the imagation.Very recommended, if you can find a copy (sadly it seems to be out-of-print). By the way, this CD was also released (as was Jazzantiqua) by the Musical Heritage Society."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was shipped a defective product.","review":"- None of the computers I connected the USB were able to recognize the hard drive.- There is no manufacturer phone number available with the item.- I called beyond micro no one picks up the phone not even voice mail.- Had to pay the shipping charges for both delivery and return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite the good cause, do not buy this for small children .","review":"This book is a retelling of the classic story by a few dozen celebrities writing and performing (on the CD that comes with it)the parts of the various characters in the book. I was not at all happy to find that a book that is certainly meant for small children contains much that I found inappropriate for my 4 year old and even my 8 year old. This collaboration turns out to be an opportunity for some well meaning, but clueless, celebrities to entertain and impress each other. Many of the characters are needlessly mean spirited and vulgar. Between the 'potty' humor of Robin Williams to the use of the term 'schmuck' by Fran Drescher there is plenty to make me put this book/CD in the trash. There were several classy and thoughtful contibutions including those from Angela Lansbury and Nathan Lane, but this was not enough to make up for the other shortcomings.If you like the cause send in the $30 and tell them to keep the book and the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing remake of a wonderful, old classic story.","review":"While reading this book to my six year old grandaughter I struggled to finish the story because of the inappropriate, wise-guy, smart-alecky language.

It is appropriate for the 8-12 year old set as well as for adults. My only problem was that the moral of the story was misconstrued. The moral of this story is that we should have the courage to challenge the status quo. While the moral of the original is to point out the outrageously foolish lengths that people will go in support of leaders (Royalty or Presidents). Irreverence and attacks on the status quo were interesting when they were unusual. The generation of Hollywood stars who so amusingly narrate this story appear cut of the same 1960's cloth and use this format to promote their ideas of the proper role of the individual in society.

In this book Pauley takes the reader through the evolution of the totalitarian dictators. He starts of by defining the terms under which each ideology fell: Nazism, Marxism-Leninism, and Fascism. From here he shows the reader how each personality gained, maintained and relinquished power. The outline of the chapters adds to readability as well as allowing for comparison and contrast of the three previously mentioned persons. This is an important topic not only to learn about the absolute control that these three wielded, but how they managed to manipulate the masses into not only following them but in some cases actually loving them; as scary as that may seem. There are important lessons to be learned in this study and Pauley has some good insight to get one thinking about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not fantastic","review":"When I took this product I felt nothing at all, no increased energy, no mood improvement, nothing at all.

He liked the music the best at first and then found it was easy to pull himself up on the handles. He did not like sitting and bouncing as he doesn't have enough control yet. He kept coming back to this toy because he could pull himself up and the tilt of the base is just enough to give him confidence in standing up. By the time he returned to his home he was going to this toy several times a day and starting the music and dancing to it as only a baby can do so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this for my one year old son and he absolutely loves it. It is the one toy he got for his birthday that he plays with on a daily basis. It is just the right height for him to swing his leg over and get on. He loves bouncing and turning on it. As far as music goes, it's not even that annoying. This is a constant in our living room. Even when he is playing something else, my son will get on the zebra for a bounce or two and then continue on with what he is doing. Excellent buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"I bought this for my daughter's 2nd christmas, she was about 14 months at the time. At first, she didn't like it so much and her little feet didn't touch the ground. As she grew, she started using it more and more. Now, at two years old, she uses it every day. She mostly spins around, but will intersperse a bouncing session in. It's very durable and has stood up to hard daily use with no problems. The litghts and sounds are fun too, and I've only replaced the batteries once in almost a year.I would recommend this highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for kids a little older","review":"This toy was purchased by my husband and I for our sons first birthday. We put it together and put him on it, and he got off immediately. He wasn't the least bit interested. We kept it in the living room, and after a few days he started standing next to it and spinning the attachment on the front and really liked the music and sounds it made. Now, at 13.5 months, he likes it a lot more and gets on it at least once or twice a day. He can spin around on it and bounce. He still doesn't REALLY get into it, but I think he'll like it more as more time passes. Overall this is a cute and sturdy toy. It has volume control and lots of different sounds and a couple of different songs. The base is rather large, though, and takes up quite a bit of space in our living room. Overall, this was a pretty good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it","review":"We got this toy for my daughter's first birthday. After putting it together, I thought it was lame because I didn't realize it locked when the child wasn't sitting on it. But we gave it to her anyway, and the baby ended up showing me how cool it was. When she sits on it, it unlocks and then it spins around and bounces up and down. It plays music and has lights too. She can get on and off by herself, so I don't have to keep going over there to help her off and on. We have a few pictures of her riding it with one arm up in the air like a bull rider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for tots","review":"My twenty-month-old granddaughter happily bounces on this toy daily.

If itS not turned on she will stop and gives us look. She then hops off and goes to the front and turns it on all by herself now!! So CUTE! She jumps back on and starts bouncing all over again.

She points it out all of the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than an oldfashioned bouncing horse","review":"I got this for my daugher for Christmas after a terrifying experience with an old-fashioned rocking / bouncing horse. Has the same idea but for her size. She's only had it for a day mind you but I'm sure we'll get use out of it. The only con is it does take up space since the base has to be large for stability. I would definately recommend for any active toddler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute & fun zebra!","review":"Cute toy, but since I originally posted the star ratings for this toy, my opinion has changed. My son has never played on this thing by himself, even as he's gotten a year older. It's really a waste of money. He doesn't like the fact that it won't move around after he sits on it (he didn't weigh enough at 1 1/2 yrs old to push it far enough down). It loses his attention faster than any of his toys! If I'm not sitting there pulling him to it, he doesn't pay attention at all. He's nearly 2 years old now, and has a one of the old fashioned horsey's with the springs and rides it ALL THE TIME. He even gets up on it without help. This zebra is now WORTHLESS to him!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Toy.","review":"WE got this last year for my 1 yr old twin boys and they still use this now and they just turned 2.

It was about 50 dollars when I bought it. I was so excited at the time.I really thought my daughter would love it. I could not have been more wrong. I got it home, put it together, placed her on top of it, showed her what it did. She looked at me and just got off. Over the course of a year she would walk over to it, sit on it, turn it, and then get off. She was so bored with it. After a year and a half, and her reaching the age limit, I just gave it to a neighbor that had a little boy that was about a year and half. I was happy for it to be out of my house, and no longer taking up the space. I am not sure if their little boy enjoyed it either. I hope he did, so that 50 dollars was not a complete waste. I would never buy this product again. And I have definitely NON RECOMMENDED this to several friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Disappointment for Kids","review":"This looks like it would be a blast for kids but it isn't. First of all, the age requirement is a joke. It says 12-36 months but there is no way a 3-year-old could ride this thing. It is really small.Another problem is that it doesn't bounce much at all and is very difficult to spin. Bouncing on this thing would give me a headache. I don't know about little kids, but mine didn't like it at all. This was such a waste of money and space in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for the little ones!","review":"My 18 mo old nephew loves this toy. He could ride it for hours, he loves it.

It seems to be well built, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 14-month-old Loves It!","review":"We just got this in the mail two days ago and my son loves it. My son was so excited and wanted to get on it before I even had it put together. It's a very cool and innovative idea. It's very easy to assemble as long as you have a screwdriver.

He has fallen a couple times when he's not paying attention or holding something instead of holding on but hasn't hurt himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby loves it","review":"We bought this for our baby's first birthday. It has been three months now and she has used it every single day!! Once she learned to get on it (she figured it out the first day) - she was riding away. It is also very amusing to watch, so everyone is entertained with this toy. When I looked at the box - I was worried about it tipping, but that has not happened and I do not see how it could. The base is heavy and wide, yet it does not take up alot of room.

We bought this for him for Christmas when he was 18 months old and it seemed like he was to big for it. He's a tall tot and he plays rough for such a little guy, and when he got on this thing it took a beating. When he bounced on it the thing bottomed out everytime, I thought for sure he was gonna brake it. It did however hold up to the abuse. He lost interest in it very fast, I think party because he's to big and it didn't bounce the way it should. We decided to give it to his cousin, she's the same age but much more petite and gentle so it worked out better for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great toy!","review":"My 18 month son loves this toy! He has no problems getting on and off or staying on the zebra. The zebra is also very easy to spin. I only gave it four stars because it took him several weeks to learn how to make it bounce, but even before he could make it bounce, he still loved being on it. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this toy. I think it is a very original toy that does exactly what it claims. Maybe some parents are buying it for children that are too young, and a child that is not within the recommended age group may not be able to enjoy the toy because of their height."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricing is Severely High","review":"This item does not deserve a one-star rating.

He started bouncing and seemed to enjoy it very much. There is no safety belt. He fell off a a few times and we were able to catch him. But one time he fell off very fast and we had to take him to the emergency room. I think that this toy should have a minimum height requirement instead of an age guideline and can be very dangerous. I would help if it had a seat belt.I don't recommend this toy for young infants unless you try it first and both of their feet can touch the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"17 month old LOVES this!","review":"My 17 month old daughter has been loving this toy since she was about a year old.

I bought this toy for him to enjoy as he grows. His legs aren't quite long enough for him to bounce himself, but he had a grin from ear to ear when we bounced him on it. I babysat a toddler who had this toy, and she would get out all her energy bouncing wildly like a crazy kid.

It starts out more entertaining to you watching your toddler interact with it for the first time, then get used to it and use it's features. Then it becomes more entertaining for them :)At 13 months old my daughter was afraid of the zebra when she first saw him. So we pointed out the other features (toys/lights/music on the handle), and soon enough she was climbing on it and bouncing on her own. She has not started the swivel feature, but I'm sure that will come with age. All in all, it's a good toy. I did give this toy 3 stars for educational, but what it teaches is fitness and coordination climbing on and off :) Also as important as other aspects of development. I bought this toy used from Amazon, so my daughter is the second child to have it. It was and still is in excellent condition. I would say this toy or one similar is a thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bouncy fun!","review":"I have a very high-energy daughter and this is a good way for her to get the wiggles out. :) But I think it is universally liked by toddlers - we had EIGHT toddlers at our house for a holiday party this weekend and they all had to have a turn (or two or three) on the zebra."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS TOY IS THE BEST!!!","review":"MY HUSBAND AND I JUST BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR OUR BABY'S FIRST BIRTHDAY.

He's had it put together for 3 days now and he finds interest in it for about 5 minute intervals then he's off to do something else. I bought this hoping it would be good exercise to strengthen his legs, but I don't see that happening. Maybe he's too old.Overall, it's an adorable toy though, and it seriously only took 4 minutes to put together, so I would recommend it for a first birthday possibly.Another thing, the price on Amazon is outstanding, just go to your local toy store, wal mart or target and save yourself at least a hundred bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a cute toy!","review":"My one year old loves this toy. He is constantly bouncing on it and it is so easy to put together! I would recommend this for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exercise for little legs","review":"We bought this before my daughter's legs were even long enough to use it on her own, but she would still love to sit on it and we would sit next to her and bounce it for her and she had a blast and always wanted to keep going long after our arms were tired.Now that her legs are long enough she still loves to climb on and bounce like there's no tomorrow, although she'll go through little 'spurts' of wanting to ride it. It's great exercise for their little legs, especially if they are cooped up indoors for a while.The only down-side is it does take up a good amount of space and you really need to place it in the center of a room away from other pieces of furniture in case they fall off or get carried away climbing on and off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bouncin' Fun!","review":"I purchased this Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Bounce & Spin Zebra for my daughter's 1st birthday. At first she didn't know what to think of it, but eventually started playing with the roller at the top, activating the music. She started dancing! Now a couple of weeks later, she laughs and giggles when I place her on it and bounce her up and down. She's not quite old enough to climb on it herself, but once she learns....Go Baby Go! Wonderful product and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Hit","review":"My son got this toy before his first birthday. For several months he would only play with the spinner in the front and listen to the music. Now that he knows how to ride it, he loves it! He does not ride it for long periods of time, but it makes him giggle and laugh every time. I like that the music is not very loud. Many kids toys make sounds that are too loud by my standards. My few quips are that the toy is a little hard to keep clean. The base has little tiny crevices that collect grime from sticky little fingers and shoes. Also, I wish there were an option to raise or lower the toy, as my son is getting almost too tall to ride anymore. These are only minor, to me however.OVERALL: A great way to release energy, and encourage your toddler to move around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"We bought this for our granddaughter's first birthday. She loves it! Her mom says it was easy to assemble. She is tall for her age and has no problems making it bounce. However, she needs help getting on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, loved it!","review":"1 Y/O loved it, I think he like the fact that he can get on and off by hisself. He had the biggest smile laugh I ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This is a fun toy for a little while, my daughter got over it as she got a little older. Was better when she was closer to 12 months old. The major problem is that one of the green panels on the base always pops out. The last piece down does not snap in completely and lifts out constantly. I must put it back in place 10 times a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very durable","review":"We purchased this 2 years ago for our 3rd daughter. Our 4th child and first son now loves this. He could climb on it by himself before he even turned one or started walking. It's just the right height to encourage and practice climbing. It is durable and has withstood our 6 year old sneaking a ride one it when she thinks we are not looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and entertaining!","review":"We got this for my son last Christmas. At the time he was 17 months old and I was afraid he might outgrow it soon but now at 25 months he still loves it and plays on it almost daily. His sister is 5 and only about 36 lbs and she enjoys playing on it too. I don't let her very much because I'm afraid she might tear it up but so far it has held up great! The batteries soon ran out but that was fine. The music can get a little annoying after hearing it all day long LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"-Get the wiggles out","review":"This toy is wonderful. At 20 months getting on and off is a little bit of a challenge but one that will be conquered soon. It helps little ones develop their muscles, their coordination, their sense of rhythm, and uses up a lot of that go go energy that a toddler has. Big brother at 4 1/2 who is within the weight limit enjoys it also. If need be it can be taken back apart completely if you do not put the triangle connector pieces on the base. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite from Christmas!","review":"This toy has so many reviews, it doesn't really need another one. But, I felt compelled because this is my son's absolute favorite toy from all of the ones he received for Christmas. He loves bouncing and rocking on this thing. Now that he's had it for a few days, he can easily get on and off by himself. My only minor complaint - at 14 months, his toes just barely touch the green platform (he's 90th percentile for height)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy for my two and four year old","review":"My two year old received this for her first birthday, and both she and her four year old sister loved it. It was easy for both of them to climb on, and they both operated it easily. We used it for a year, then passed it on to my one year old nephew, who played with it whenever he visited.I've dealt with Fisher-Price with returns, recalls, and general inquiries in the past. Their customer service has always been excellent, timely, and fair. They seem to be a reputable company that stands behind their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for boys and girls","review":"I bought this for my 1 y/o godson and his twin sister.

It's a great way for him to burn energy on a rainy day! It's a bit loud and could use some cushioning. My son uses it so much he sometimes gets blisters on his bum, but we've added a towel on the seat and monitor his usage. It's held up to quite a beating over the years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift for my granddaughters Birthday","review":"My one granddaughter LiLi had this , got it for her birthday... so when I came home from visiting her, I ordered it for my other granddaughter Isabelle.. both girls enjoyed their bouncing zebra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"We gave this to our 18-month old boy for Christmas.

This has been received just ok. He gets on it and jumps for 1-3 minutes but that's it. It just not that exciting I guess. It bounces up and down fairly slightly (not a huge amount of bounce), and swivels when it's being sat on. When it is moving in some direction or another, it makes sounds and lights up. But isn't that engaging it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel's having fun","review":"My grandon loves this toy he just turned 1 and loves to get on it. He bounces up and down and spins around.

Would definitely buy this again for another grandchild."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun... But needs a spotter for little ones","review":"Length:: 0:15 MinsGrandma bought this toy for our 11 month old for Christmas. This has been an awesome toy HOWEVER, if your childs feet do not touch the floor you must spot them. Shortly after posting this youtube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAxIHwcEdS0 my daughter fell off the zebra and got a pretty decent cut inside her mouth. Granted she is probably too young for this toy but its a fine line between buying a toy they can grow into and buying a toy they will grow out of. This zebra takes up a good portion of floor space but our daughter seems to really enjoy crawling up to the toy and playing with it standing up. It does not fasten to the floor. The green stand is free standing. All told I would reccomend this toy just know you will be stooping over hurting your back to help your child until their feet can touch the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 month old loves it","review":"My grandaughter just loves this toy.

Great stories about the Red Sox in the 50s, the White Sox in the 70's, and lots more.

Ordered two more in Feb. 2008 (1 for home & 1 for office). They arrived the next day. The one we kept at home is still going strong. The one that we took into the office stopped working two weeks ago. E-mailed Amazon who forwarded my message to the marketplace vendor. Did hear from them within two days, but have had the flu and haven't gotten back to them to see what sort of exchange can be worked out. These heaters work wonderfully, when they are working. They don't eat up the electric like most of the other plug-ins on the market, and the heat is much more comfortable. If they can get the longevity issue under control, then it's 5 stars from me.

It is a good foundation, but not the Rosetta Stone I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Definitely not worth $65.Material almost completely UNRELATED to material tested on Praxis II math content for high school.

After reading this text, you will have an understanding of how to start programs, make your windows and menu bars multi-colored, and how to save documents...but little else.

Instead, the plate is solid and Shop-Vac provides sandpaper sheets with the tool (and no screens), so the vacuum action is apparently supposed to work around the edges.

The routines are short and require room, lots of room -- more than most living rooms offer, even with removing furniture.The exercises are more acrobatic than required and not typical of her other workouts.

I do an hour of intermediate to advanced abdominal exercises each week, so I wanted some fresh ideas, but that is NOT what I got.I skimmed through the video & did the Level 2 workout. Much of the abdominal exercises in Killer Abs were more cardio moves (such as doing lunges & squats & kicking the legs in various directions) that did not directly focus on the core muscles & if they did, it was on the obliques. I kept my abs tight throughout the workout to get the maximum benefits, but never felt any soreness in the days that followed. The cuing was also poor.My biggest concern for others who do this workout, is the negative effect some of the exercises can have on knee joints. The exercises involve a lot of quickly rotating the knees in various directions as they are very fast-paced, complicated, & hard to keep up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel scammed","review":"I am not in figure competition shape, nor fitness model shape, but I found most of these moves to be too easy.

I have to literally pause the DVD and keep going for another minute and a half or so. Maybe I have a strong core, maybe I'm used to longer more intense exercise DVDs like Insanity or P90X, idk.

Another opinion he puts forward is that women should not study business or science in College, but should study \\"useful\\" subjects such as home ec or child development.

The knife has great balance, can be sharpened to razor sharpness, and holds an edge well. The metal has a glassy polish finish that prevents food from sticking to the knife. The only problem with this knife is that it is thicker than your normal santoku knife.

Not as bad as 13th Child, Ghost Rig, Dark Universe, or Jack-O but the difference between this film and those, it that this one is cheezy so you can laugh at it. It's basically about this cryogenic lab that has many frozen customers already inside little capsules. One night during a power-outage and while it's raining two security guards decide to bring the capsules out in the open. As expected, they get struck by lightening and then become the undead, which end up looking more like green space aliens than anything else, and believe me they'll have you on the floor laughing.

The non-stick really works, heating is even, price is right. BUT it came delivered packaged alone, at an angle in the box, padded only by some crumpled brown paper, and it warped. I was furious! I mean, a warped cookie sheet? I bent it myself back into shape, almost, and after using it for months it is now fairly even, but not exactly. Next time I will buy this product from a local store. As it is an ungainly sized item to ship, I don't really hold the shipper to blame, but it could have been laid flat and padded with popcorn. Seemed very sloppy handling, to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Specialty Cookies","review":"It is true that your cookies won't burn, but what I don't like is that all the cookies I make on this sheet flatten out into thin little cookies. On my old cookie sheets they hold their form and any fillings in the middle do not leak out like they do when I use this cookie sheet. Also when I go to remove the cookies from the sheet they just smush up like they aren't cooked enough. Overall I will only use this for baking pizzas and cookies that should be flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cookie sheets on the market","review":"AirBake cookie sheets are horrible. Yes, your cookies will be a perfect golden color, but they will stick to the cookie sheet. After making the standard chocolate chip cookies (made with lots of butter), I was distraught to find that they would not come off the AirBake cookie sheet. It was like they were glued to the surface! I could turn the cookie sheet upside down, shake it, and the cookies were still stuck. Now, I am left with dark circles that won't wash off, even after soaking the cookie sheet overnight. I will never again buy this brand, and the AirBake cookie sheet I currently own is going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long and food sticks","review":"The past few batches of cookies I've made on these pans just didn't turn out well at all. There's definitely no problem with burning, but they just don't cook the cookies right - they'll be nice and brown all over, but when I take them out, they just flatten into a very ugly cookie, like the insides aren't cooked well or something. And my cookies stick, even when the recipe says to use an ungreased pan. I'm going to look into a different kind of pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst brand out there","review":"These cookie sheets suck, to put it mildly. I went to bake biscuits on my new AirBake cookie sheet and they overbrownedwith minuted left on the cook time and stuck so badly I ended up throwing away the entire thing- pan and all. I'd like to note that they stuck even though I buttered the cookie sheet with a large gob of butter. The worst part is I had recently recieved a bunch of AirBake as a housewarming gift and I can't return any of it. I'm afraid to use the AirBake cake or pizza pan I have because I know whatever I cook will overbrown quickly and then stick no matter how much I grease the pans. I'm going back to using my old cheap non-stick bakeware- thank goodness I didn't throw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"air surprise","review":"After taking a batch of cookies out of our oven (which was set at 350 degrees), the airbake sheet exploded, sending black smoke into the air! Needless to say, my two-year-old son was terrified. Sam was eating an apple and choked on the piece that was in his mouth. After giving my son the heimlich maneuver, I took him to our family doctor. Our doctor sent us straight to emergency where it was determined that our son would need an immediate surgery to remove a chunk of apple deep in his right lung. Surgery, and several hours in a croup tent left my son unable to respond verbally due to an exceptionally sore throat. After spending a night in the hospital due to possible breathing complications my son was able to come home. I hope and pray that nobody else will have to go through a similar experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baking Sheet","review":"Really love this item. Only complaint was the packing.

The pans are useless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty blah","review":"I read this for a book group. It gets two stars because it wasn't a tough book to finish.

Bottom-line: Competently written but so many better reads are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't shake that \\"made for sci-fi\\" channel feeling.","review":"The story line itself is not entirely bad. A bit worn, but workable for a sci-fi flick. Tired old \\"set 'em up, pick 'em off\\" plot. And some awful acting. Awful to the point of funny. One girl, on the plane at the beginning, gripped by the machine's claw, frees herself, and then, with the machine not even touching her, she runs, jumps and throws herself on the floor in a heap. I keep thinking this must have been the setup act for a CGI scene that they forgot to do. It's hilarious.But the movie spends what seems about half it's entire length reiterating the same scene. Guys standing in front of the machine shooting at it with AR-15's. I mean, it doesn't work, and they continue to spend their entire time trying to shoot it with guns they know won't do the job.After the twentieth gun battle with two guys standing on front of the machine shooting at it, and the machine standing there unfazed, I'm yawning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"If you want to have some fun watch a movie called Curse of the Komodo which is Komodo 2 .It's about 3 casino robbers who crash their helicopter on an island full of giant komodo dragons.This movie was obviously made by the same company as they have 2 of the same actors in it and lifted the entire sub-plot and dialogue,sometimes word for word, from Curse of the Komodo.They just replaced Komodos with robots.I've never seen a non-remake scavenge a film like this.Komodo was much better with better acting.Anyways it's worth watching for the fun of it.Very low budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a laugh","review":"One of the truely bad movies that you can have a few drinks and laugh at.

So bad it borders on hilarious. All this while a silver slinky robot with long legs searches out to destroy. This is one that could evolve to be a cult favourite, it's just that bad. Thought Robert Picardo was a good actor? Wait until you see this one!The best realised scenes are those of the secret military robots. If I was voting for hilarity I would give this a 5. There is a part of this where a plane crashes, and something breaks out on the plane, and insanity enuses. Keep in mind this is before Snakes on a Plane came out. Don't take this film seriously, but have fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is one of the best advanced math textbooks I have ever seen.

The problem is that it is not extensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent introduction into the subject","review":"This book is intended primarily for graduate students with math background who wish to expand their applied math skills. Originally a Russian textbook, it offers an excellent overview of the theoretical background for the field without real heavy mathematics. All that is required is knowledge of calculus and a little ODE/PDE. Many classical examples, has an introduction to applications such as analytical mechanics, optimal control theory and approximate solution methods. The last edition I am aware of is pretty old, so this book should be tough to come by. A new edition would be welcome, with more examples and other applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content is great - printing and binding is not","review":"First off, the content of this book is top-notch. Calculus of Variations comes across as slightly magical when you first encounter it, but this book lucidly explains in thorough detail how and why you can extend calculus to functions of functions.That said, the binding of this book is really terrible. The cover--which is glued on--fell off after I opened the book 4 times! That is unacceptable, even for a book as inexpensive as this. The printing quality also isn't great, and some glyphs are difficult to discern, but it's not a huge deal compared to the cover falling off. Usually Dover books are better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon S Heart Collection II","review":"My fav. episode in this one was Retire from the Sailor Soldier!?Minako's Concerns.

It's really mysterious, and later you find out she's the most violent witch. I really do love this movie, and if I had a choice, I would give this 10 stars. This is probably my favorite movie!!

Towards the end it gets interesting when their rivaling ideas get put to the test as the villainess Kaorinite captures Serena (Sailor Moon) and presents them with a difficult choice. Sacrifice Sailor Moon--for the chance to save the world, or, save Sailor Moon--putting the entire world at risk.How does it turn out?

This DVD, containing about 7 episodes uncut dubbed (speaking English) and uncut subbed(speaking Japanese) is an excelent addition to anyone's collection.

There is also pronounced hiss and audience noise. These other reviewers raving about this CD don't know what they are talking about.

All I can say is someone did not edit the book very well and adding more and more elements into a story until it is smothered,to me, is a sign of a lack of ability or creativity.Needless to say, I thought the book stunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book was Great!","review":"Martha Grimes remains one of the leading mystery writers today!

The built in wi-fi works like a charm. Screen, keyboard, and size is great. Processor and memory was sufficient for my purpose including a little use of paint and drawing programs. Only thing I didn't like is their touchpad. They have something called Draglock feature turned on which makes it hard for me to do what I normally do with my touchpad. I only found out after fiddling around with adjusting all sorts of touchpad settings that it was the Draglock being turned on that was bothering me. If you having trouble with making your touchpad act smoothly, I suggest you turn this feature off. However it is not easy to get to. It is under 5 layers of menu screens. The final menu you will find it is under \\"tapping settings\\".

She is a colorful and important figure for anyone studying Civil War medicine and the history of nursing. She was not trained as a nurse but was a \\"Botanick Doctor\\" in a southern Illinois town when the war began. She volunteered to go south to help care for the wounded and became the guardian and caretaker of the sick and injured in Sherman's army until the war ended. After the war, she played a major role in obtaining benefits for the wounded for whom the Congress had made no provision. She is little known outside Civil War scholars and should be better known. This book does a good job in describing her and her contributions.

My guess is the fuse 'safety' or heat sensor technology on these is garbage and just blows for no good reason. There does not seem to be any way to replace the fuse so they are pretty much door stops now.Any product can have the odd lemon, but two out of three for a single customer that use them for about an hour or two at a time is pretty awful.I would avoid these like the plague and I am not inclined to ever buy a Honeywell product in the future.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"This charger works great - my only complaint is the little piece that attaches to plug into an outlet is easily lost so I gave only 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Came timely as advertized.

The problem is that a resistor burns out (R3 for anyone that cares). Mine happened to burn out while I was out of the house. Yes I should have unplugged it, but I didn't. With this resistor out it will not allow for any of the toast settings to work nor will it automatically pop up. So, if you put some bread in and walk away expecting a nicely toasted piece of bread you might want to keep a fire extinguisher handy.

It's a gamble every time we try to toast (room temp or frozen) bread, bagels, waffles, or our coveted Poptarts. Sadly, we've burned enough food to feed a small nation. You pretty much have to monitor the entire toasting process. We strive for a medium golden \\"toast\\" result; not too light or dark. The middle setting barely produces a very light toast so we toast it a second time on the lowest setting and if we don't watch it and pop it up every 10 seconds to check, the toast is burned!

Mostly, I want to be able to put bread in it, and then have this bread emerge at some point in the not too distant future as toast.This machine doesn't do that. At any setting below the maximum, what it produces is more akin to stale bread than to what I'd call toast.Turn it up to the highest setting, and one side of the bread comes out reasonably, if unevenly, toasted, in a way that reminds me of the tan on my wife's feet after a summer of wearing sandals with straps in unexpected places.The other side is quite charred.Not really what I was going for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"I though I had just gotten a lemon until I read all the reviews.

All of this is extremely well played.But what makes The Dealer so good is--do I even have to tell you, Larry Coryell. Coryell is an interesting choice here; this is pretty straight forward music. Hamilton could have as easily drafted Wes Montgomery, Joe Pas, Kenny Burrel, any number of guitar players.But hearing Coryell's wiz kid, almost abstract guitar playing--complication beneath the simplicity of the blues layers, is quite a treat.

With their slapstick dialouges, special effects and great fashion statement, its no wonder it survived for 8 years. Its a feat.Well, Season 8 is the closing season ever for the series and the story was all well-written and great twist to the story line. Who could have expect that they will be battling one of their own during the climax episode. Overall, Charmed deserved a spot in my own \\"WALK-OF-FAME\\"Goodbye, great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but now we're sad!","review":"My daughter and I love Charmed and couldn't wait for the final season to come out. But now it's officially over...no more Charmed! We're still hopeful for at least some type of spin-off or movie. A spin-off probably wouldn't do the series justice though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really liked the Charmed ones, but I could have done without Billie and Christy","review":"I came late to watching Charmed. Don't know how I missed it, except that I don't watch much tv. However I enjoyed every episode of the first 7 seasons--I did think that Cole got a raw deal-but I truly stopped watching it some during the 8th season because Billie and Christy, especially Christy were very tiresome. As so many other reviews expressed, how could two blond bimbos out-magic the charmed ones? I have ordered the 8th season tho, so, just as one reviewer aptly put it, I will have a complete set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not received","review":"I purchased Charmed 8th season and have not received the dvds. Please advice as to when item is going to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"charmed ended with season 7","review":"I can't believe any die-hard charmed fan would want to see the 8th season again. first of all, for seven years the charmed ones are the most powerful witches. also, the finale of the seventh season was fully conclusive. then suddenly its a couple of blond college girls (sisters, even, which i think really undermines the power of three plot) who totally kick their butts for most of the season, regardless of final outcome. also, the finale, was, in comparison to other charmed finales, lame. i found the characters of billie and christie so very irritating the entire season. although i did like coop, and henry, i will happily go without those story lines to avoid the rest of the season. the show ended well with the seventh season. the eighth was obviously tagged on, and is just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Now","review":"I really enjoyed the final series but it seems to me (how about you?) that the last two parter left it open for, do I dare say it, a movie? It really would be interesting to see all the interactions of the kids in the future. A lot of loose ends there. However, I don't want to see movie after movie. Just one good one would do. It is sad that Pru's picture was not on the wall in the end. That was the only part I found sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful season.","review":"Really. The complete lack of Leo, the loss of Darryl, and the intro of Billie, this season just sucked.The only good thing was seeing Piper and Leo happy...until they couldn't afford to pay for Leo to be in the show anymore. I would have gotten rid of Billie and kept Leo!I watched until episode 10, then skipped to the end. The middle is just crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"charmed fial season","review":"this was a great buy i followed the show as long as it ran i was upset to know that charmed was over but i do still catch the reruns on tnt and even thats not enough charmed for me i need the two epidsodes in the morning and then the 2 in the afternoon and then i put on the charmed box set that i brought i love love love this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"charmed","review":"THIS ITEM ARRIVED JUST AS PROMISED AND SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST ! \\\\THERE WAS AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF CHOICES AND THE ITEM WAS REVIEWED PREVIOUSLY WHICH MADE THE TRANSACTION CHOICE MUCH EASIER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed Extras","review":"There will be three featurettes: \\"To The Manor Born\\", \\"The Making of Charmed\\", and the 2-part documentary \\"The Story of Charmed\\" and \\"Forever Charmed\\".

I love this show. Where else can you get drama, comedy, and action all rolled into one? Charmed will be fondly remembered for it's exceptional cast, often exciting story lines, and 'magic' it possessed, at it's peak. Setting the record as the longest-running female lead dramatic series, it's place in television history is secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Charmed","review":"So sad that it had to end.

A whole new dinamic for them to explore.Instead they threw together and it really looked it a series full of recycled stories, plot holes and a few celebraties. It ignores so many of the rules and cations writen carefully into other seasons until it made an absolute hash of what was a great seris instead dragging it slowly through alot of stupid Sh-t until it was too painful to watch.My cat could've done better. The sisters still being by their oringals is the only reason for the one star. It's more like minus 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed, The Final Season","review":"The price is great.

Purchased as a gift and loved by the recipient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Season...not too bad","review":"I love Charmed, but the addition of Kaley Cuoco and the chick who played her sister irritated me to no end. Like many die-hard fans I pretty much hated their two characters.(if you saw the show's message board not too many cared for Kaley C at all) Not to knock the actress herself though...she was great on 8 Simple Rules. I also really missed Darrel and the regulars we all got used to seeing. Getting rid of Leo for a time was irritating too. However, the season ending was really cool. I liked getting to see a bit into the future. So buy it, the show isn't complete without the final season. Get it while it's hot! PS.

All I wanted to do was upgrade my harddrive now I am forced to re-install everything and start from scratch just to get a good configuration. I have used Ghost in the past and it was simple.Not only did it kill my machine but even with my machine booted with the last known good configuration the software does not work at all. I am a Systems Analyst and I have repaired, configured, tested, installed many machines and software and in all my days I have never seen such an outright piece of trash....well except for maybe the early days of Microsoft patches where you always made sure to back up your system first or face the consequences.Buyer beware!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of DriveImage 7 : it's a trap!","review":"PowerQuest sells you their DriveImage 7 upgrade promising you that you will be able to create a backup image of your drives on dvd.Not true in my case. I have win2k and upgraded from DI 2000 in order to have a backup of my C drive on one or two dvds instead of a dozen Cds, but ...If I backup the drive (10 GB,standard compression) on a hard disk, it takes about 7 minutes. On dvd : after seven hours (!!!) it had done about 22%. Which should mean about 30+ hours to complete the backup...I called PowerQuest and told them the sad news in July.In August they asked me to wait for a patch. In October, a few days ago, they told me that I could download an upgrade: Drive Image 7.01 which should solve the problem. Not true: nothing has changed.I shall ask for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, easy to use","review":"Have been using it for several months after I lost my c drive. The install cd doubles as a boot disk which has the utilities to allow you to restore from the drives. You can also click on the somewhat compressed backups and extract a single file. No problem seeing my USB backup that has 173 gigs. Automated scheduler works with no problem. You can set the times and how many copies you want to keep. Works while you sleep. Pretty easy.If you are like I was, and think it will be no big deal to go back and rebuild your c drive from scratch - think again. It's a major pain and 2-3 weeks later you will still be finding stuff you haven't reinstalled yet. For a few bucks you can avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Framework","review":"This program must us Microsoft's Framework Program it will ask to load it if you don't have it.

When In boot mode He found that Frame work was the problem. once it was removed the comp. worked. When I got home I found that any time I used Help I would get an error Message about framework and the same thing would happen if I tried to down load a Program. I had to goto the Microsoft Windows Update Page to load v1.1.4322 framework just to stop the message from coming up I can remove the old frame work but if I then try to remove the new framework same error messages.

The main issue is that the Drive Image program doesn't report any errors, it just sees one partition.

Symantec is giving us almost no support. The web site won't even give you instructions for activating the Drive Image 7 or Partition Magic 8 by phone correctly. What they gave you won't work for DI7 or PM8. Telephone number they ask you to call for activation is always busy and tell you to call back later. We paid for the long distance charge too. After 15 or 30 days,(depends on which document you read) you are locked out of the software you paid for if you cannot get through to Symantec.. Other very serious problems are revealed by other customers. Read their comments before you want to pay for the software.

It has been more frustrating than V6. They make many claims but the features they promise don't always work. Backing up across a network is impossible, and accessing images after creation is not guaranteed.I made a backup of an XP machine prior to upgrading from Home to Professional, and when I encountered problems with the upgrade I couldn't open the backup image file. Their Knowledgebase is pathetic and doesn't even list the 2002 version as a choice. If you want reliability and good support, don't buy from Powerquest - you will be disappointed. They claim to safeguard your data but the program is unreliable so how safe is that?I wish I could give it a zero, but the lowest rating here is 1 star - but to me it is a real zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better have a backup!","review":"Drive Image 7 has a defect in one of its modules that caused my computer to crash on installation during the reboot.

Well deserving of it's Booker nomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The novel doesn't really deliver the sort of emotional impact you want and expect.The story is premised on some key characteristics of the main character (his size, unusual ability to tell when people are lying) which not only don't resonate emotionally with the reader, but also don't seem terribly believable. The writing is muted and almost flat, so what could and should be vital plot developments end up being more or less statements of fact. The result is that the struggles experienced by a boy growing up in unfortunate circumstances don't really come across as genuine or important. They just seem contrived and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story?","review":"The only reason why i was not able to put it down, is the fact that i was trying to find the story?

Never mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for something to happen...","review":"I didn't care for this book at all. The best thing I can say about it is that it held my interest just enough for me to keep reading it. And that was for the simple fact of nothing much happened in the entire book and I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen. I expected some earth shattering climax but there was nothing even close. The book just ends, period. I was very disappointed. I probably won't bother with another of M.J. Hyland's books. I read another that was only marginally better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, uncomfortable, heart-breaking","review":"The book is a cross between Angela's Ashes and The Curious Case of the Dog in the Night-Time. The narrator is an adolescent boy who has developmental problems and has a family ill-equipped to deal with them. There is a false note of hope at the end of the book, but we know enough about the characters at this point to know that no happy ending will ever occur. There are brief dark moments of sexual tension between the mother and son that are quite uncomfortable and just add to the sense that the reader is a voyeur watching damaged human beings. The writing is quite good, but the subject matter is heart-breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough information","review":"I saw this book in the bookstore and I was shocked at how little was said about each book. Each book description was less than a page- of course that was just what I saw from looking at the book in the bookstore- there may have been longer reviews that I didn't see.

The drums are out front, not tucked into the background. Ginger Baker, Bill Frisell, and Charlie Haden play so well together that it seems they have always been together. Frisell is a master guitarist, and he brings this music alive. Haden has always been a master at getting more emotion from the bass than other players, and he clearly anchors these sessions.The music can be challenging, and it demands that you pay attention.

I feel that this cookbook is very misleading and if you do not test your blood sugars after trying a recipe, you may end up with a higher than expected BSL. I feel that this is false ifnormation and am very disturbed by it. Please test a recipe for the carb counts for yourself! No wonder the recipes are tasty!

When I looked into ultralights while the new centrio based looked good. Few would have a built in DVD/CD Drive. The Sharp MP30 is an ultralight that weighs so little I can work evey day on the commute to work and never felt burdened.Pros: Light , small, full featured, expandable (cheaply $120) to 1 gig ram. The 802.11 (super) G has excelent reception. Battery life is as reported. Vidio play is flawless.Cons: Transmeta is not a \\"gaming\\" cpu, while I have not tested my favorite game on this system, games tend to fail or be jumpy on tranmeta. Keyboard is a tad smaller than the lifebook I had, not an issue for me, just noting.For me this system spell freedom, I just wish there were more Transmeta 8800 choices out there. I gave it 4 stars because it does not have a extended life battery option, the standard battery is 2400ma."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's came brocked.","review":"Did not get any refound.

I bought this one because Maelstrom represents a Globidens, and is the only representation of the species in toy form I'm aware of. The figure was produced in 2005, so the goo in which the figure is covered had hardened so I had to dig it out and wash it. Although the same size as Cretaceous (2 inches) and nicely sculpted too, Maelstrom is bulkier, sturdier and less bendy, and it doesn't peel, so it makes a better toy imo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atragon- One of Toho's Best","review":"Atragon is a very good movie. Great even. Even though the infamous daikaiju, Manda, is only in it for a short amount of time. The special effects are great and the acting is splendid.The storyline is original and different from most other Toho creations. But that is a good thing. The cast consists of many familiar actors from the Godzilla series, as well as other Toho monster movies.Manda is well designed, too bad he was never used as much as he should have been (particularly in the Godzilla series). His movements remind me of when I first saw this film.Overall, Atragon is a excellently done film. It is worth buying and the price is great. It's not too expensive and you get plenty of entertainment. So buy it and enjoy. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Toho's best!!","review":"This movie outright sucks. There is no plot in the movie and if there was a plot, I missed it. The acting was terrible and the special effects was done by a third-string team that Toho somehow continued to employ. Not Toho's best produced movie. The monster Manda looks like it was put together by 3 year old kids with no imagination. Overall not a great movie and would not recommend for anyone to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I wish I had never bought this DVD,I enjoy classic Japanese sci fi,but this one I never saw,thats why I bought it,and I am disappointed with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Fitness Book!","review":"I have been a workout fanatic for many years now.

Many of the typos are fairly minor, but others are absurd.For instance, on page 24: \\"After just a few weeks, this form of exercise will not exhaust you, but conversely, will get all the endomorphs flowing and actually boost your energy level.\\" Get all the ENDOMORPHS flowing? All the little fat people in my body will be flowing?

In January I noticed and joined a gym on the same street where I work. Its main attraction for me was that I practically had to trip over it to get to my car. Like a good student, I bought the owner's new book. I wasn't expecting anything dramatic.Surprise! The Hot Point Fitness program has given me my own set of keys to the gym. The overall approach to exercise is so clear and sensible and, above all, empowering for someone like myself. I feel like I am in charge instead of being at the mercy of a daunting list of exercises. I like the detailed descriptions and photos for each exercise. I can see and feel the changes in my body. This book has changed my attitude toward exercise from \\"endure and escape\\" to \\"seek and enjoy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Same Old Same Old","review":"I've been in and out of gyms for years. In the past, I have gotten good results, but burned out on the boredom of my routines. And so, the good results would disappear as my workouts tailed off. This book was written for 'gym burnouts\\" like myself. Zim gives a different routine for each day. I find myself looking forward to going for my workouts now, because I know that I'll be working different combinations of exercises. I also find his descriptions of the exercises very helpful. He is very specific about what I should look like during each phase of the exercise. Finally, each exercise is accompanied by a stretch. The stretches are very specific. Stretching was something that I did if I had a couple of minutes left over, Zim is the first one to get me to understand that the stretching is as important as the exercise. I love what Zim's book is doing for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews. Unfortuneately, it wasn't what I was expecting. As an avid fitness buff of many years, I have read a lot of fitness books but I don't see what is \\"revolutionary\\" about this one. The big hype is that it's based on MRI technology but MRI has been shown to be of little value in showing muscular function. The routines are similar to what I've read in many of the muscle magazines. The pictures and the descriptions of exercises are also poorly done. If you're looking for a well-done, motivational book on exercise, get \\"Body for Life\\". Take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Definitely loved this book and the approach Zim took towards fitness.

Yet, all I saw were two exercises he came up with in the book. I could have written this book, anyone who has ever lifted for 2 years could have written this book. All it is is a beginners book telling you the need to be physically fit, and then literally going through different CLASSIC exercises for each muscle group. If you are a beginner who has not read anything yourself or ever really lifted then this book is for you (although I must add there are probably a lot better beginner books out there). But, you if you want to lift weights and get in better shape, there are no secrets, literally, it takes dedication, patience, and hard work and correct eating. This book was good on getting you diet ready however, so, there's a plus there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!!","review":"I was given this book by one of my clients to review (I am a personal trainer and exercise physiologist). After reading it, I was appalled. It is exactly what is wrong with the fitness industry. The author, apparently a personal trainer, perpetrates numerous myths about fitness that have no scientific basis. His knowledge about exercise is very limited and his knowledge of nutrition is even worse. Anyone can call themselves a \\"fitness expert.\\" Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's true. Don't be lured in by fitness hucksters.

Come to find out, the version of \\"Evangeline\\" that stars Miriam Cooper is considered \\"lost\\".When I put aside my misgivings. and viewed the film, I was struck by the beauty of Dolores Del Rio, and the depth of her emotions. Her performance was quite extraordinary, and you could see that she'd thrown all of herself into playing Evangeline. Also, this dvd was constructed from the original 35mm prints, and boasts the original tints and musical score.This is a wonderful rendition of \\"Evangeline\\" that bears witness to the dedication and artistry of little known directors and \\"foreign\\" actors.

It gave decent overviews of grammar, but it doesn't give any practice questions... AT ALL. Only exercises that make you write and are extremely boring.

Additionally, I found that the questions were somewhat more difficult that the actual exam's qeustions are. I feel that I benefited more from the 1 Writing Test in \\"Real SAT 2: Subject Tests\\" by the College Board than from all of the tests in this book. In conclusion, I would probably not have purchased this book if another had been available. This book's section on writing sample essays is better than the multiple choice sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unlike other Barron's test preparation books, this book turns out to be a big disappointment.

It turns out that \\"the more you practice, the more you err\\". This book does not give you enough examples. Practice test are flawed with numerous errors.

The only thing you can do is to get accustomed with English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improved editing","review":"Barron's SAT II Writing covers the basic topics on the SAT II. Its essay writing sugesstions are beneficial and useful; however, the five practice tests in the back of the book are flawed. The practice tests contain typos that greatly confuse the reader. In a few cases the book stated the answer as one thing and then had a different answer for the same question in anonther location. After taking the writing test four times (twice on the PSAT and twice on the real SAT II), I feel that many of the practice questions that Barron's offers are not similar to ones found on the test. However, if one really needs help with the SAT II Writing then Barron's will provide limited help; just don't always believe the book is correct.

One note for installation is that the cartridge is not reversible, so make sure the hot and cold lines are hooked up correctly the first time. This of course is a minor thing. I would much rather have its silky smooth operation than the connivence of a reversible cartridge which really is a one time event anyhow that is easily remedied.

Everyone knows that Ed Wood wrote the screenplay for \\"The Violent Years,\\" even though his name was omitted from the opening credits. Nevertheless, this 1956 saga of Girls Gone Bad has enough non-acting and Woodian dialogue to satisfy his most ardent fans.

And how could the cops mistake bandanna masked women for male juvenile delinquents? I don't recall men wearing that much make-up in the 1950's but this movie does come to us from the creator of \\"Glen or Glennda\\". Better is the \\"ravaging\\" scene set on lover's lane.

You'll get to know the major TV producers and network presidents, and you will swear you were actually in New York when these decisions were made in the late 1980's. _Three Blind Mice_ is well researched, and Auletta is careful to note what is speculation and what is fact.

Bottom line: if you liked the last CD, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch","review":"Timezone123 is who I prefer to buy watches from from now on. Usher really made sure I was happy to have this watch in my collection and when I was not satisfied made sure I got a new watch that worked as specified.Onto the watch - it is big and beautiful. That carbon fiber face is a great detail and couples well with the stainless steel. My only complaint and it is not that big of a deal is that the movement of the chronograph does not line up perfectly with the second markers. It is off by a mm or 2. This is something I tried to get fixed but cannot because it is gear specific. Cannot really notice it but it kills me because of my attention to detail.Also the watch band is falling apart and doing very poorly with minimal use. I will replace the band and suck up the slightly off movement to wear this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book was quite a disappointment. What little bits of new information you might glean were buried in disorganized details. Example of two sentences from page 192 on the role of the queen's family: \\"Richard II was more fortunate, and perhaps more careful, with his half-brothers than Henry III had been. John Holland and his nephew Thomas Holland were members of Richard's inner circle in the 1390s, but were spared by Henry IV, probably at least in part because John had married Henry's sister Elizabeth, but possibly also because their influence over the king was not considered as malign as that of the chamber knights of the 1380s, nor had Richard aroused resentment against them by so heaping them with honours as he had his cousin the earl of Ruland or William le Scrope.\\" Huh? This is a book about Margarent of Angou, Elizabeth Woodville, Anne Neville and Elizabeth or York?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, but not for males","review":"Well I did enjoy reading this book. But there's one thing I didn't really care for in this book, it kept referring to the person that reads the book as a she instead of (he/she), because there are guys who actually read these books (I being one of them). The naming thing is kinda cute, but the book is very short and half of the book is made up of the names on what to name your cat.

Johnson's guitar tone is not as refined at this early stage of his career--opting for a more \\"fuzzed-out\\" tone reminiscent of Hendrix. The songs are fairly lengthy and feature extending (if relatively uninteresting ) improvisations.This was recorded as a demo as an attempt to generate major record-label interest.If you are an Eric Johnson-ophile, this album is necessary to round out your collection although, do I dare say it, this is not his finest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisiest pad ever","review":"These are by far the worst pads Ive owned for noise They squeal so loud at times you can hear it with the windows up Im a GM technician by trade and have worked on cars for over 20 years and have to say these are garbage.

Where is the excitement and the good feelings of the first book? I have been trying for about a year to get through this book, but I don't think I ever will. It just doesn't have the spark of the first book. I probably would have given this book higher marks before reading the first book, but now it pales in comparison.

The quality of the vector graphics is quite low, but a bigger problem is the search engine. They include a tool called Portfolio Browser, but it does not offer any keywords or text search. Instead, you must load one \\"portfolio\\" at a time by navigating to a folder on the CD. This is a very inefficient way to sort through 30,000 images, since each folder may contain only 100 or so pictures.You can copy the CDs to a hard drive (manually), but when you open the portfolio folders it demands that you insert the CD to load the image. With such a large number of CDs, this too is unwieldy.So to summarize, this is a collection of 30,000 low-quality images without a usable search or browsing capability. I do not envision myself ever using this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Clip Art Ever??","review":"I bought this after reading some of the glowing reviews. After actually looking at the clip art and photos at home, I don't understand why people rave about this collection.

Alright, there are some nice ones in there, but you really have to hunt for them.I was lucky enough to buy this when there was a rebate, so it was pretty cheap, otherwise I'd return it.

The search engine only works on the particular disc that you are using at the time, which may only have six or seven categories. The way the pictures are organized is very confusing, and only useful for those who are very patient and those with lots of time on their hands. I use this with my high school journalism class, and my students are much too impatient to go through every single disc to find the pictures they want. The whole thing is practically useless. Don't buy this.

So when I saw this book in the local supermarket, I happily grabbed it.What a disappointment! I should have read the reviews first and saved the money... what a horrible piece of drivel. As other readers said, it's repetitive, boring, and long winded. The Royal Highness is altogether too perfect, if I ever met such a person in real life I'd scream! After the umtieth description of her boredom and what was requiered of her, I wanted to yell \\"Yes I KNOW, get on with it!\\"And when she finally did get on with it, things didn't get better....... my advice is don't waste your money on this book, borrow it from the library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, predictable and boring","review":"I have read every Danielle Steel book. The last few have been only ok, but this one is terrible. The characters are totally one dimensional and do not represent people as much as fairy tale characters - the good princess, the good doctor, the tyrannical royal father, the dead mother, the playboy, the party girl...blah blah blah. This story is not worth reading. I should stop reading these books, but I keep hoping for a good one. I loved Family Album, The Wedding, Once in a Lifetime, Heartbreaker, Missed Blessings....but the quality took a sharp turn for the worse in the last few years. I understand from the author's dedications that she has a lot of children, but how much money do they need? Obviously with the volume of books she is putting out, quality is going to suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG - soooooo bad","review":"Don't waste your money! Seriously, it's so bad. So boring. It got worse and worse. The two dramatic turns could be seen a mile away. At least when I started I had the hope it would get better...once it ended I was left feeling like a shmuck for buying it, let alone reading it. NOT what I expect from Ms Steel. I'm shocked they allowed her to publish it. Did anyone else notice the grammar errors? The repeating of things, word for word? I can't remember the last time I've read a book I hated so much. Maybe never. I normally don't keep reading, but I was so mad to have splurged on it....I ignored the inner screams of despair. DON'T SUFFER THE SAME FATE!

There were several paragraphs that were maddeningly redundant. Repetitious. And to add insult to injury, the author (or drunk editor?) decided it would be cool to redescribe the same things pages later, just as redundantly as before. There were several sentences that were so poorly written that any high school english teacher would have cringed. Me? I just tripped over them. The characters were BORING. The scenery? Nondescript. The plot had far more potential than it was given. Was this one of Danielle's very first books recovered and remarketed? Cut out the redundant fluff and you have a Harlequin dime store book.

I listened to the unabridged audiobook. I am not a really big Danielle Steel fan but pick up her books now and then. I was shocked at how short and dull this was in comparison to others of hers. Very predictable. The main character was too good to be true as you are told over and over and over and over again. I listened to part of the book with my husband in the car. \\"It's kind of repetative\\" I say, \\"Gee I didn't notice\\" he replies as we listen to the tenth time in 3 minutes how the main characters father is so old fashioned. Its like the author had a short story and a deadline. So she or someone else just filled it out by repeating the same things over and over in different ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the worst","review":"I've lost count of how many Steel books I've read, but this one was the worst. It was like I've heard and read all this on the news. Poor bored Christiana ... just has to do her part for mankind. The author just goes on and on ... okay we get the picture.

Some of the songs are very similar to each other, and you may not want to sit down and listen to the entire collection in one sitting, but they are a good resource for this style of harmony, and I'm using it to teach my 18 yr old daughter some of the \\"homestyle\\" chords on guitar and rythm patterns.By the way, for the reviewer who wasn't sure if the 'Gales were Christian because he or she could not understand one of the words in \\"It's Going to Rain,\\" it's \\"It won't be water, but fire the next time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Looks even better in person.So happy to have purchased the statue.

Not so much. The plot, such as it is, revolves around the daughter of the first governor of New South Wales (Australia). She falls in love with a French explorer (actual historic person), has his child out of wedlock and the rest of the story follows her life along with the development of Australia as a country.Amazingly, there is very little dialogue in this novel....far more telling going on than showing. As a result, if you're suffering from insomnia this book might help bring sleep back into your vocabulary. Despite the high potential for the subject matter and some great historical characters making an appearance, the author managed to dull them all down.I can't in good conscious recommend this one.....if you're interested in the history of Australia, even Aaron Fletcher's Outback Series is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift for teachers everywhere!","review":"Kids America has served as a great resource in my classroom for almost twenty years.

I have an original set from the mid 1980's. The new pieces were much lighter in weight, the spoons had different bowl shapes (both soup and teaspoon) and stamps on the back of each piece (including the 'made in China') were obnoxiously large and made the silverware ugly.

Some of it is just quality: the spoons are shallower and have sharp edges. That's just cheaper forging. To add insult to inury, they also have a new shape which I don't like as well. The knife is similar to the original, but not as elegant.If I'd known Dansk was going to do this I don't think I would have bought from them 10 years ago.

I purchased this beautiful, and not cheap, flatware in the late 1980's. I loved it. After years of \\"kids\\", many pieces had \\"walked away\\" so I ordered some replacements. The difference in quality was truly stunning. This was the first time I really began to understand that the flight to Chinese manufacturing (read: cheaper manufacturing costs), was also a flight to inferior products. The spoons were not rounded on the edges; they were flat and sharp. The luster was not there, the weight was lighter, and overall the flatware had a \\"cheap\\" look to it when compared to the original. Honestly, you should get what you pay for. I replaced it all with Ricci and have not been disappointed. Caveat Emptor - buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pay retail!","review":"Great phone, but don't buy it here.

The Symbian system used by several phone manufacturers is EXTREMELY LIMITED in terms of program availability.Regardless of Nokia's marketing of E61 as the state of the art in telephones, they should be more concerned about the FULL CAPABILITIES they may offer. For a device that claims to be supportive to executives, it lacks programs for productivity and even games (yes, executives like good games too), so common and assorted for Palm OS products.I am sorry I won't be able to exchange my device at this moment, since I just bought it!What a poor deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the Astroturfer!","review":"If the \\"reviewer\\" Scott Lingren really works for Nokia as a Director of Product Marketing, then I have these comments for him:1.

The only message I saw was of the be-completely-submissive-and-unquestioning-or-you-will-end-up-like-these-guys type.I also noticed that it never mentioned that only a third of the world is Christian, and that only a fraction of those are especially committed to their faith, so the Rapture would technically only apply to about a quarter-billion people.So. What did I learn? Some Christians aren't afraid to manipulate children to bring them around to their way of thinking. Sometimes the world is very depressing.This would be okay if it weren't based on just the fundamentalist Christian viewpoint that if you aren't Christian you are doomed. (Because if those guys are right, Ghandi went to Hell.) They could have said that only the pure of heart made it or something like that. But no, it's set up so if you're a Zen Bhuddist, you are evil.It rather pissed me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadness","review":"That was a good book but no I want the other book you ended that book on a cliff hanger I hate you just kidding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This first book of the Left Behind: The Kids series is very interesting. \\"The Vanishings\\" uses lots of scriptural references to try and explain about the end of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left behind","review":"This book was awesome and very entertaining.

Unfortunately, that is about all I loved about the series. The writing is completely lacking in artistry and features characters that are so flat that it is very hard to care what happens to them. I have read the first six books, and amazingly little has happened thus far. It was only the bits of biblical prophesy sprinkled throughout that have held my interest. The authors have managed to make the apocalypse boring!!!!!I guess my biggest complaint is that there is no subtlety about these books at all. The message could have been much more powerful if only it had not been so blatant. It was just too preachy for my liking, coming across more like propaganda than young adult literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Read","review":"I've had this book for years and I'm just now reading it.

Throughout the first chapters you are introduced to Vicky,Ryan,Judd, and Lionel and you learn about them and what they are like. In the second half you get their reaction to the Rapture and see how it affects them. The last chapter all four of the kids meet up and watch a video that was left by The Pastor of a local church.If you are a kid or teen and want a good book on what will happen when the Rapture takes place this is it.Penny Lane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"It was a really awesome book I loved it is a good chapter book I would recommend it it might not be a little kid book it is meant for kid 8 and up I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an eye opening book to what may be!","review":"Very well written.

It is also a great book because it has to do with 4 friends, their isn't many books that just relate to 4 friends.This book also has to do with the world and faith and evil which is something most kids need to read about.

The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book.

The rest of the movie is about Costner's search for his own revenge.Unnecessary characters are introduced and dropped. For example, Costner's Navy buddy, a dying cowboy, a rock singer. Plot errors and gaps litter the film. For example, Costner's character can speak Spanish in the beginning, but not in the end.*SPOILER* Eventually Costner learns Stowe had been sent by Quinn to a whorehouse. But somehow he finds her in a convent in a coma. She wakes up, sees Kevin and dies. At least she got out of the movie.

Even campgrounds he rates high for spaciousness and privacy are essentially parking lots with a few trees in between. In a campground with a five star rating for both we were about 40 feet from the nearest surrounding RVs and parties with load music. The campgrounds are always full even in the \\"off\\" season, in the rain, in an area fairly remote (example: northern coast by Crescent City).The way to truly tent camp out of a vehicle in California is to off-road it in the Trinity, Six Rivers, or other National Forests using a map of the logging and forest roads. Otherwise, no matter what campground you go to, it is essentially a parking lot. The only other alternative to get into nature and actually camp is to backpack. These campgrounds are good for last minute \\"we just have to stop for the night\\" trips, but not to get away from noise and other people (tough to do in California in general)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why two books for the Sierra Nevada?","review":"Pros:(1) Clean presentation and well organized information for each campground(2) Reliable recommendationsCons:(1) This is pointed out by other reviewers too: the cross reference of map, index page and the actually location of the campground information is cumbersome. Simply reverse the order of index page vs map, and prefix the campground index to each campground name in the description pages will help a lot with navigation.(2) My main complaint: dividing the Sierra Nevada by CA 108 seems quite arbitrary. I hope it is not done to making buying the Southern California Tent Camping book necessary. Note to author and publisher: why not combining the two books? The combined book can still be very handy field guide if the fonts andlayouts are made more compact.

What makes this translation so much better is the attention Neugroschel gives to giving us prose that is as good as Mann's original German - this writing is simply beautiful; evocative of the period in which it was originally written without sounding like a joke or a bad imitation of turn of the century fiction. (It's no Henry James satire). Neugroschel has won the PEN/Faulkner award three times for his translations and it's easy to see why.

In my opinion the only thing they will damage is their reputation to the true underground metal fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GENERIOS 4 stars","review":"ive listened to almost all of this album a number of times before it starts to get old.. dimes guitar tone sucks compared to his pantera tone but is still ok ..bu not very uniqe. they album is a little same ol same ol but i may be alil unfair i ay compare to much to pantera. but the biggest suck of this album THE SOLOS Dimebag, R.I.p, gave us great long solos in CFH and other albums but i guess we cant expect them to keep comin here we have short ones that dont seem to try and achieve something. but great album to crank out youre earfones if you just wanna hear some metal and not hav to think about the lyrics and such"},{"rating":"1","title":"follows in metallicas footsteps..","review":"when i see people start to defend a cd. THATS when you know something is definately wrong. heard 2 songs too many from this cd. singer flat out stinks. music is so so. disappointing for the talent. if you're looking for pantera here. go to their back catalogue. only redeeming virtue of this cd...the name of the band. thank god they decided not to keep the pantera name. this is nowhere near worthy of being called pantera...r.i.p. pantera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with it overall","review":"As much as I loved Dime's guitar work, Vinnie's kickass drumming and Patrick's work with Halford on his solo releases this cd was a big disappointment.It has about 5 really good songs on it. Pride, Save Me and Cold Blooded really stand out and the rest are pretty much filler. Lot's of growling and little groove to the song structure. Pantera always had a nasty groove to it's music and this is lacking that big time. The music just seems to be missing something and has no direction at all really?It's to bad as Dime was a great player and his brother was equally as awesome behind the drum kit. That moron who shot dime took away not just Dime's playing, but his brothers as well as Vinnie has yet to fully recover from such a tragedy.If you need a Dime fix, check out Rebel Meets Rebel!! It's got that Pantera grind and it's funny as hell. It's a great way to remember a great guy and a great guitar player and was a great parting gift to us his fans!R.I.P Dime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No. No. No.","review":"I am a Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual fan, an I'm tellin you all now, this cd sucks. There is no power in the riffs like pantera. There is no vocal power like in Down. And since the separation of pantera, Phil has gone and proven himself to heavy music and the fans. Everyone is so stuck on the idea of members of pantera in a new band that it must be good, just like if the radio plays a song over and over, people flock to it. For all the true troops to heavy music, don't waste the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im sorry.","review":"We all know how great Pantera is, and how Mr. Darrell Abbott is a god, but when you review this album this should all be left behind. This album should be graded by itself, and not as an ode to Dime. And when graded by itself, most of us know what we REALLY think. RIP Dime, but the riffs on here are so downtuned and forgetable, and the whole album is so monotonous.When I picked this up I was so upset because of how awful this is, and the lack of solos on everysong bugs me to death. This Lachman dude is no Phil Anselmo. Not even close. Well, I'ma go listen to Cowboys and try to forget about this, and you all should do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Metal Radio Friendly Garbage","review":"Terrible recycled riffs, uninspired nu metal vocals. NOT HEAVY!!I once regarded Vinnie and Dime as gods but what the hell happened to them, this sounds so watered down and lame. Please skip this one. This even has the Slipknot vocalist on a track called F%#K You (so original isn't it?) This is so commercial to appeal to the mall goth kids. What is metal turning to, No wonder Phil left these guys. Smart man that Phil Anselmo. Listen to Superjoint Ritual those guys know how to shred. They know how to keep metal alive. This album makes me laugh. Check out \\"explode\\" without a doubt the biggest [...] song ever recorded. Sound like ALice In Chains mixed with Korn. Do yourself a favor please avoid!! [...]. Listen to Superjoint Ritual!! Phil will never sell Out. All hail the epitome of metal... Phil Anselmo!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not suppose to be pantera,so get over it","review":"I think its great that Dime and Vinny started something fresh,they were pantera anyways(not just phil).If it were pantera they would have reveled in the name for 20 years like Iommi with sabbath,but whats the point in that,time to move on.This music does have elements of pantera,some of the vocal's,solo's,etc.Although its more stripped down without all the doublebass and double riffing,which is fine.Compared to superjoint this rock's,instead of sounding like a drug induced idiot,which is all phil has turned into,Damageplan isnt afraid to venture out and try some new things.And he doesnt have to scream every other word to be a powerful vocalist.So let pantera go,they had there success and went they're seperate ways thats life.And yesterday don't mean S@#t."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the Plan","review":"Anyone expecting this to be another Pantera album will be seriously disapointed. Anyone that is a Pantera fan and realizes that there was more to the band than Phil Anselmo will enjoy this album. While there are Pantera-esque songs on the record (Breathing New Life, New Found Power) there is also alot more diversity to be found. There are slower tracks (Soul Bleed) and even some nu-metal sounding tracks (F**k You, Blink Of An Eye). There is something here for everyone, if you don't like a song skip it. My only complaints are that the band seemed to lack direction in the sound that they were trying to achieve. I liked the slower more melodic stuff and the heavier stuff equally but please, cut out all the nu-metal elements for the next album, it sounds cheesy. My only other complaint is that some of Pat Lachman's vocals don't sound up to their potential. But overall this is a pretty damn good debut. Dimebag and Vinnie Paul fans, you owe it to yourselves to pick up this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Pantera...but better than most!","review":"As most reviewers have said...this is NOT Pantera. Though you can hear a lot of riffs from Dimebag and beats from Vince that sound like trademark Pantera...the aggressiveness and sheer brutality of Pantera are missing. The songs as a whole are pretty well arranged and much more commercial than Pantera ever was but the lyrics sometimes lack the bite you would expect from a good Pantera album. It's one thing to tell someone you're going to punch him in the face (Damageplan)...but it's completely another when you can describe to him exactly what his body will go through to absorb the blow (Pantera). That's the best was I can analogize the album.

Holy sh**! This disc R-O-C-K-S! I know this will sound lame but Damage Plan was supposed to play my town like a week after guitarist Dimebag Darrell's untimely death. Due to the emotional shock that a lot (if not most) of us old school / long time metal fans were in following that tragic day - what many have NOW tagged as the Heavy Metal's 911, I simply could not get myself to take the time to listen to this CD. But after awhile, I found it to be an inspiration to myself as well as a couple of fellow patrons. I mean, Damage Plan is IN fact a branch of Pantera, so THUS it (in my humble opinion) is a darn good 'extreme metal' album. Cuts I thought made this title a keeper are \\"Breathing New Life\\", the in-your-face \\"Pride\\", the aggressive \\"Reborn\\", \\"Blunt Force Trauma\\" and the disc's acoustic closer \\"Soul Breed\\". If this title doesn't do something for fans of Machine Head, Soulfly, Rob Zombie and Slayer - then I really don't know my music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"As an old fan of Pantera, I desperately wanted to like this album but never could even find one song to really be a favorite.

I'm sure that if these guys work together alittle longer it will all mesh also. Dimbag is a god when it comes to showing these other bands how to play and write music. This album is \\"TRU-METAL\\" not \\"NU-METAL\\". If you want a back to basic \\"punch in the mouth, no nonsence\\" metal buy this album. You won't go away disappointed. Give it more than one listen.

I'm not a thriller reader but I thought I would try it and, to my amazement, I loved it. It was fast-paced with interesting characters and the story line was just a bit scary.

The plot was SOOO stupid and contrived, and the characters were SOOO ridiculous and utterly unbelievable. I won't repeat the inane plot lines, as other reviewers have already pointed out the worst parts. Suffice to say, after the first couple of chapters, I thought, \\"this just has to get better\\". About half way in, I thought, \\"I'll give it one more chapter\\".

The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book exceeded my expectations","review":"This is not a book to be read like a novel,however, it is rich in information about the early history of the people Arawaks and Caribs in the Caribbean. i was able to discover the introduction of the bread fruit tree to the Caribbean.

This is a highly euro-centric history, with questionable statements about slavery, very little on Caribbean identity, and a war-to-war chronicle.

Very disappointing altogether because the history is such an important and complex one to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry Z is right","review":"I have to agree with Larry Z, this book is horrible. Due to the scarcity of books on Caribbean history I thought this book would be a great addition to my library, I was wrong. Rogozinski's perspective on the history of the caribbean is definitely from a conservative american view, and at times seems racially biased and eurocentric.I would love to read a history of the Caribbean that includes some Caribbean influenced nations like Guyana, Belize, and Panama, that are definitely extensions of West Indian culture and share the same history. If you are a West Indian or interested in the history of the West Indies this book is not for you. If you are a eurocentric thinker and looking for another skewed history of a people then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but Rogonzinki's conservatism is obvious","review":"This is an excellent book for the lay student of the Caribbean. The author provides a wonderful array and facts and stories giving the book just the right feel between textbook and a readable work. All of the necessary details pour out to give the reader an amazing look into the heritage of the Caribbean. A special admiration goes to the author for his work in explaining the role of pirates (or privateers, depending on the day) in the power politics of the imperial rivalries in the Caribbean. A slight criticism comes in Rogonzinki's descriptions of the Native Americans, which seems to agree with the paternalistic descriptions of them put forth by the colonizers. But aside from that and similar conservative slants, this is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Organized, History Review of the Region","review":"I bought the first edition of this book over 8 years ago, and couldn't let it down. \\"A Brief History of the Caribbean,\\" by Jan Rogozinski simply is one of the most well researched and organized books on Caribbean history ever published. As a Latin American Studies major in college, this book was very reliable and informative in many of studies, and it allowed me, by utilizing the many maps and charts found in the book, to understand the very nature of Caribbean politics, culture, and most importantly, history. Everything from Pre-Colombian civilization to Post-Independence woes are covered here, and the author has released an updated edition with information as recent as of January 1999.

Its bias is so prevalent that only older young people and adults who are capable of discernment should be reading this.Also, I cannot see how Barack Obama can be included in this book as it was published before he took office.I much prefer that my children be exposed to the neutrality of politics such as the importance of our government structure or the importance of the balance of power, rather than the extreme prejudices that exist today as evidenced in this book.Give children time to form a foundation before exposing them to the intolerance of politics today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for AP class","review":"This book is only for one thing:Presidential Outlines in Advanced Placement United States History.It gives you mostly everything that you need.

I have a large collection and thought I would add \\"Gorgo\\". The problem I have with this film is the man in the rubber suit. Now Godzilla was done in the same way but was very effective. It moved well and was quite believable. Not so for Gorgo. The man in the suit didn't know how to move at all. He often stood upright opening and closing his mouth like an idiot. Sorry to say but this is the worst man in the suit creature I have ever seen and this is coming from a man that loves these sort of films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgo is great..but at London's expense!!","review":"This is a great version of a huge monster gone upset because its offspring has been messed with by unsuspecting humans. At the expense of some big time London landmarks big mama lizard comes into the city looking for it's abducted youth who's being held captive in a watery pit as a circus attraction. The film transfer of this oldie but goodie has stood the test of conversion for dvd. The movie looks great and so do the red eyed beasts. This is a must for any monster film buff's collection!

There's plenty of monster. But there's plenty of military stock footage too. That hurts.Whether you choose to watch this entire snoozefest or fast-forward to the Picadilly Circus destruction scene, you won't find much to satisfy you. There's not even any dubbing to laugh at between the various monster scenes.Mystery Science Theater 3000 pointed out that there are NO women in Gorgo. An entire movie without women = Booooooooooring. Watch Godzilla or Gamera instead, and leave this disappointment behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best print so far","review":"The best edition so far,however...The color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater. A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any serious collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"London gets its come uppance","review":"I love this little movie. It's a great end of the day fall asleep on the couch movie. I've also seen it while wide awake. Like many others here, I grew up with this film and remember watching it on TV many times as a kid. My favorite scenes are when Mama G tramples all over London and the people are running around in full panic mode. It looks realistic enough that I've often thought that's probably how it would look when the real world comes to an end. And of course, the movie's ending is satisfying when Mom and baby are reunited. I also like the principal actors Bill Travers and William Sylvester together. They make a nice couple! (just kidding) This DVD print isn't that bad for a 40+ year old film since I've seen previous prints look real bad. All in all, if you want a little Sci-Fi escape and want something to watch while eating your TV dinner, you can't go wrong with this one.

It actually corresponds to my memory of seeing it on screen years ago as a child. And in fact it is one of the few \\"big beast\\" monster movies that is geared to the imagination of children, with some precocious environmental consciousness woven in. The message finally is that Mommy will always protect and take care of you in the end, even it means crunching half of London into rubble. Also, it's hard to watch the William Sylvester performance and not think of his role in Kubrick's 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful little classic","review":"I remmember this lovely classic from 4o years ago and am happy to see it on dvd ,beautiful music and wonderful meaning behind it, yes the effects dont compare to today but were still great for the time,besides its the story of a mothers love- and thats what really matters! also i loved gorgos red eyes. a nice little classic . christopher landry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Public Domain?","review":"During the 80s and early 90s Gorgo was available from many \\"cheepy\\" VHS producers and was known tobe in the public domain.

If you know a little bit about Excel, this book will take you very far. If you know a lot about Excel, you will be astounded by some of the things you can do using the proper formulas. This book is chock-full of great tips that will radically improve your spreadsheets. The section on financial formulas is particularly well-written with plenty of real-life examples.

Niles is an amateur, and marks himself as such clearly in this series. Predictability, boring descriptions, and poor sentence structure are everywhere in the novels, jarring the reader from their \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" The characters might have been good, but Niles treats them one-dimensionally. Foreshadowing ineptly reveals the entire plot early, making the only suspense in the book the curiosity of who will be knocked off. The books follow the \\"small problem / adventure / big problem / dramatic battle of epic proportions with lots of carnage\\" formula that leaves little room for originality (kind of like the cheesy \\"Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers\\" series). All in all, the books are only worth it if bought for $2 or less used."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it none, but I cant.","review":"The trilogy STINKS!!!

The difference is mainly in the extras: more discussion, the free checklists, the electronic forms, and a larger more readable format. Personally I find staging a desk reference situation and I think the manual is better suited: I really cant imagine using a valuable pocket for the manual. (For the electronically interested various versions exist for PDA).So whats in the book? Each anatomical site is introduced with a description of the changes from the 5th edition, the anatomy and regional lymphatics (where relevant) are described, and then the rules for staging are outlined. Summary tables, prognostic factors and a liberal reference section complete each site.There are predone checklists, diagrams and ICD codes to help those setting up registries all of which come in electronic form as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good anime in my opinion.","review":"This is good in artisitc style and story.

However, once you have heard her versions, you will wonder why she chose to call her album 'I Remember Buddy Holly'. The fact is, she proves that she doesn't. I bought the disc and have great respect for Buddy Holly's talent. Unfortunately, Ms Francis was more interested in making some quick money trying to sing, and in some cases, rework some of Buddy's material. Perhaps, the most unusual item is her version of Peggy Sue. Ms Francis did well enough with her own songs, but was less than successful with Buddy's. Buy it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra price; not the same as restaurant fame","review":"I was disappointed.

I bought a Targus one from Target last week to get the feel for a monopod. It was cheap, and felt very cheap. I wanted to purchase a more durable monopod for my rig. I figured, \\"Why would I mount $3,000 worth of equipment on a $16 monopod and risk damage?\\"I went with Manfrotto because I already own a 3021B Pro tripod and two heads with RC2 clamps. The monopod came in tonight, and was not too heavy, but felt very durable.

This replaces a cheap monopod from BestBuy that had limited height adjustments. Manfrotto quality is first rate, I also own the 322RC2 head and 055XPROB tripod and they all perform flawlessly.

The irony! And worth a few stars in vindication of at least part of his thesis.However though the loony left does exist, to suggest a national conspiracy on the part of the left is laughable in a historically conservative America and following two republican presidential terms. This smacks of invisible monster syndrome, lets face it we have enough problems post 9/11 without inventing extra ones! Trying to put ideology above economics, consumer demand and the physical sciences did not work for the Russians and it wont work for the Americans either.

Secondly, he is an arrogant, adolescent, homophobic blowhard who's solutions to the county's problems revolve around dismantling the ACLU, which is interesting coming from someone who is so committed to free speech.Its downright scary that anyone who can write their name in the ground with a stick would believe anything in this book.But then again, we live in a nation so engulfed in idiocy, that the very fact that this book even exists should surprise no one.The stucture is 8th grade theme writing throughout, albeit without the graceful naivete of a thirteen year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Savage is a racist, sexist pig.","review":"Not to mention a homophobe and a self-hating Jew.The ideas he puts forth in this book (and on his show) are so generic and insulting that virtually everything he says about liberals could be spun around and said of conservatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limpid","review":"I wish this guy could live up to his own delusions. Ooh, liberalism is a mental disorder! Boy that sure teaches those libs! Alas the book merely gives a weary beer gut to back up that and other attempted \\"outrageous\\" statements.

And true to those who have been trod upon too long instead of taking up the cause of the downtrodden Mr. \\"Savage\\" attempts to become one of the oppressors. All very psych 101 and explored with more interest in Orwell than here.

Mute them and then shout over them. Time tested and big mic advantage. Savage is a better author then some of these rightwing talk show books, I will give him that. He ignores though that liberals brought up women's right to vote, end of segreation (liberals and not necessary democrats as this is a difference), child labor laws etc. Things that conservatives eventually support over time.

When someone's motive for maintaining a viewpoint is public coercion, they cease to be a free individual and are operating under cultic conditioning. It is out of fear of offending the status quo that they lash out at opposition to the status quo. They know that the liberal magisterium is unforgiving and vindictive. However, when someone manipulates good rhetoric to support his Zionist cause by defining anti-liberalism as pro-Israel, that too is cultic conditioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascism","review":"Savage has rightly been banned from entering Britain because of his hate-filled diatribes against everybody not exactly like him.In reply, he has now called on all Americans to boycott all British goods - so he has proved that he is no friend of Britain.With Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, he hates democracy: they are in truth modern fascists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Immature Rantings","review":"Mr Savage, aka Wiener, a former health food guru, now has all the answers on how to make society \\"right\\".

Everything that is wrong with this country is the liberals. He demonstrates Intolerance and shows no respect for opposing views. This is a book of anger, revenge, moral rightousness and blind patriotism. And he thinks liberals have a mental disorder..

It seems he just wants to destroy all this nation has worked for. Throw away all acceptance, knowledge, rights, cultures, and just go back to the 1950's - if not earlier. Go back when people like him were in charge. He's a bigot, and racist, and anti-feminist. People like him need to be uncovered for the silly ideas they uphold, there are too many people out there who are blinded by people like him and need to be exposed to more factual based political commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weiner is worrisome!","review":"An original thought would be nice from this guy - instead, he steals from everyone else! He's a failed scientist who couldn't make it in his chosen field so he became a topical hatemonger. His troubled relationship with his father resulted in an unnatural mother/son connection. He complains about the inroads made by the homosexual lobby but has a tell-tale fixation with powerful men! He wants to clean up Hollywood but his son makes a living telling people they too can party like a rockstar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Today's conservative thought is sociopathy conning ignorance","review":"Cynical sociopaths are manipulating the ignorant, racist and homophobic toward following their highly destructive vision. This is what amounts to \\"conservative thought\\" these days - a type of conservative thought which would be unrecognizable to true conservatives of the past.Savage, as with his generation of putative conservatives, falls in line. He uses the mental illness offense against liberals just as the fascists in the USSR used it against their enemies...just as Hitler gassed the liberals. All fascists first attack the liberals and academics. And now as we have a very cynical sociopathic horde attempting to force fascism on our Republic, they bring this nonsense to our own nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael is on point - his distractors prove it","review":"Just got done reading Michael's book, \\"Liberalism is a Mental Disorder\\". He is an expert at delivering a serious message in a tongue-in-cheek type fashion. At times he goes somewhat over board, but his points are well researched.I have to chuckle when I read some of the one-star reviews since they are exactly the type response Michael says liberals take (personal attack and insult) when confronted with the four-letter word liberals hate most \\"FACT\\". Either they don't get it, or they are written by Micheal himself to make his point.If you want the straight story, with some humor, buy the book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nut","review":"He really needs professional help. I found his writing lacked facts and it was nothing more than opinion with nothing backing it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkable","review":"This moving biography of O.J. Simpson is essential reading for any American who considers himself a patriot. Mr. Savage spends the first half of the book focusing, oddly enough, on Joe Theisman and Carl Yastremski. But then he hits his stride, tackling Simpson's life with a thoroughness, and level of empathy, unseen in less comprehensive studies of the killer's narcissistic personality. Savage then surprises, at the end, with a stupendous reconsideration of Baldwin's Go Tell It On The Mountain, before concluding with some shocking, even lewd, takes on the blind, defenseless Helen Keller. All in all, this is a disarmingly ambitious performance, to be read in more than one sitting (but no more than two)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to know what evil really is, let me break it down for you....","review":"What is evil?Evil is a man of high intelligence, verbally gifted, with good critical thinking skills, who willfully and knowingly makes a career out of inciting the latent fear and hatred lurking within us all. Evil is loving fame and money so much that this man finds a niche spreading the most hateful, paranoid, and violence-inducing propaganda imaginable, which he himself does not believe.

He'll go to his grave insisting that he was qualified beyond everyone else; if he'd submitted this book or one of his previous diatribes, his interviewers probably would have called campus security right away. Written for other angry white men who can't come to terms with the fact that they are simply losers--so affirmative action, women, gays, lawyers, muslims and just about the rest of the world is at fault.A pathetic waste of paper and ink, but it's even more pathetic that there are people who lap this trash up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservatism?

Just shows how right Savage is about all of you!Michael Savage is brilliant as always by pointing out the flaws of BOTH the Democrats and Republicans, but ultimately explains why liberalism is in fact a mental disorder. His Savage Solutions should be enacted immediately to save America from islamic jihad, illegal immigration, and the liberals who are killing us off slowly with their propaganda in our schools and courts.Simply put if your conservative and love America this book is for you.

But Savage pretends that all liberals have the exact same views so that he can make his arguments in this book, and that is intellectually dishonest.I'm a liberal, and I agree with Savage about the need to protect the American borders and crack down on immigration law violations. I also believe in the death penalty and think it should be kept and used for violent criminals. But according to Savage I am some kind of mythical beast like a Unicorn or a Cyclops because he gives no indication that any liberal could ever think either of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"narrow minded trash preaching to the converted","review":"A product like this is bound to provoke a strong either/or reaction. Either you lean toward right wing conservatism, and thus agree with Michael Savage to begin with (and give him 5 stars), in which case there's really not much of a point to reading this book, or you disagree with far right wing thinking, and find yourself insulted by him. Unfortunately for the closed minded followers of this crass, bullying ideologue, they are ignorant of the fact that the world is not always an either/or, black/white scenario. There are also many who fall outside of the \\"liberal/conservative\\" dichotomy. There are often nuances and shades of gray.

His book even lobs insults at the reader, yet look at how many 5 star reviews his followers have submitted! I suppose this all goes to show that people with narrow, inflexible political views will swallow any kind of lie, as long as it confirms their opinion.

Micheal Savage is a partisan hack and an entertainer just like Limbaugh and Hannity, but on a level so vile and bigoted that he only attracts the most extreme misogynists and clueless psychophants in the conservativ-o-sphere. Do yourself a favor, Savage fans. Forget about trying to bring thinking, rational conservatives, liberals, and moderates over to your side.

Fitzgeralds book, on the surface, seems simple. Readers are often thrown by the misplaced ethics and selfish behavior of the charictors. In fact the charictors themselves are only a small part of the important messige Fitzgerald was trying to convay. The rich symbolism suggests a deeper meaning burried in the pleasent partys, the vally of ashes, and the eyes of Dr T.J. Eckleburg. In fact, this book is really about the conflicts between east and west, the death of the American dream, and the dissapointments of the new world. Ghatsbys obsession and eventual failure with Daisy mirrored the discovery and eventual failure of the new world.

The styles are inconsistent between discs, and the content is less than that of an average level history book. The first disc must have been aimed at grade school as the narrator seemed to be lecturing either young or feeble minds. Do not waste your money. Look at a Visual History of the World by Brinkley. It is what this series should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Long","review":"I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but I was unable to finish this one, even after I started skimming about 150 pages into it. Very few writers can sustain a work of this length --- taken together, the three volumes run about 1,800 pages --- and the pacing wasn't lively enough to keep me interested.The series has some compelling concepts, and even the battle scenes in the first two were vivid enough to keep me interested, in spite of the mostly two-dimensional characters, but after a while it got very tedious for me. Stephen Vincent Benet, a great American story writer, once said that \\"writing is the art of abbrevation.\\" Unfortunately, Stirling doesn't get to the point too often, and the plot is weighed down with long, windy descriptive passages that don't advance the story.Looks like most readers who liked the first two will enjoy this one as well, but it was too much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mini series since the lost regement","review":"Enjoyed this book very much and its two companions. Wish that the author wouldn't leave you in suspence at the end with the knowlege that one of the wolf lords children has escaped to reak revenge on the republic. The author needs to write another book to kill the suspence. Make it take place 10-20 years after the end of the Great War with some old and new characters. I know i would buy in an instant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticlimactic ending to an otherwise noteworthy series","review":"I loved the 1st book and was satisfied with its sequel, but I was sorely disappointed with this book. I guess I am so bitter, because I found the set up in the prior books to be really thought out and plausible. I became so invested in the characters and their fates, that I was really looking forward to this last book. The book was on par with the first two, I felt the set up led you to believe that the ending was going to be really good, but then it shifted and it just ended.. It feels as though the author was rushed to meet a deadline, thus ending the series abruptly. Spoiler***it was especially anticlimactic because the 2 leaders never faced offed, the evil leader was poisoned by some random person, that is never given credit for it. Even having him end that way could have been better written to give the reader satisfaction. I was so dissatisfied with the ending, I felt I wasted my time reading the 1st two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad it is over.","review":"This novel was not nearly as good as the previous two. A fascinating premise and somewhat interesting characters, if sterotypical, made for some decent reading previously. I really bogged down in this book when the plot line became obvious. The conflict was resolved too easily and too simply. It was almost as though the writer didn't know what else to do with this convoluted plot. I made it through the book but struggled with my conflict between sheer boredom and keen interest. I would recommend that you read the series in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"series end","review":"I like alterative histories; the what ifs and the what coulda shoulda happened ...They all make you think ...This one made me run back to the history books to find out what really happened and finding that out was just as facinating as the well written fast read that this is.

Otherwise, it's OK but no Hugo winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but immensely entertaining.","review":"First of all, this one probably won't make a lot of sense to people who missed the first two books. Second, almost all of the story threads are tied up neatly, with the balance of power in the Bronze Age seriously out of whack. I love that the Event is never explained.However, this is a flawed book. The transition from scene to scene--leaping halfway across the world, at times--could have used at least a row of asterisks between settings. Some characters vanish for too long (IMO) and villains from the first two books are removed almost as an afterthought.The parts that are good are *so* good that it's worth reading even with the flaws, and so are the first two in the Nantucket Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is my first delve into alternative history and I must say it has left me wanting more. Maybe I was lucky in that it reverts to a preriod of history that I am interested in (the Bronze Age, more specifically around the time of the Trojan War) but I simply could not put the trilogy down. The characters are superbly out of their depth in this new world, adapting and shifting to realities. The characterisations of known historical figures is entirely plausible and the series comes across much bigger in depth and perception than it really is.Perhaps people will say this is the finest example of its genre, I don't know. Suffice it to say, if Stirling doesn't continue this series it will be an immense shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind the story","review":"Ever since I started reading SF (and alternate history) I have wondered why the genre is so often disregarded by \\"mainstream\\" literature. The IitSoT trilogy is a good example: a thrilling, well woven story, with (apparently) a lot of research into its writing. As I finished OtOoE, the last installment, I guess I finally found the answer. SF writers in general, and Stirling in particular, are great with the premises and plot, but are usually unable to provide depth to the characters. \\"On the Oceans of Eternity\\" ends nicely (although in a somewhat corny fashion) the adventures of the RON, but enthralling as he plot was - I kept wondering what would I've done were I in the characters shoes - the characters are doomed to early oblivion...That doesn't mean there weren't great characters in the book (like Rapuasha, Kash and the Hollards), only that they were somewhat underdeveloped.Overall, it is a great book, so forget the character depiction minor flaws and enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed reviews","review":"As someone who is interested in military history and wargaming, I find the continuous fighting added a lot of excitement to the book. Especially since we have two roughly \\"balanced\\" groups fighting it out. I actually like the frequent manuevers on both side, as it resembles some war history with the red and blue arrows representing armies clashing across the map. However, I like many other reviewers do find the ending too neat. Sure, it rings true with the \\"victory through enlightenment\\" philosophy of the Islanders, but it is not truely exciting. After developing so many polar characters, I am surprised there is we don't have the various \\"legends\\" fight it out, while Leaton and Cuddy pumps out increasingly innovative war machines on both sides. However, there is a teaser at the end, and the story has not yet exhausted possiblities in Central/South Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, so the hope is there will be more this than the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Trouble, Unfortunately","review":"This series starts out with a bang, with a terrific idea. Although there are interesting scenes, and I have no doubt that the author knows what he's talking about when it comes to every military tactic and the design of every sword, ultimately, it is a complete let down. I was so disappointed by the last book, that I wanted to send it back to the publisher for a refund. Maybe the author will write a proper ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stirling is a good author, but...","review":"This and the other two books in the Nantucket trilogy are excellent, but there is a good deal of totally unnecessary objectionable material in all three books. He gives graphic descriptions of...sexual acts...None of the graphic sexual relationship or any of the off-color language that he litters his books with are even remotely related to the plot...There is a lot of killing in these books and he just loves to write about how they \\"void\\" before they die...He also loves to tell of the stench of defecation that is present at the scene of a killing or battle....If all of what I just mentioned isn't offensive to you, then you should read all three books."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of Same","review":"This series starts out with an interesting premise, but this third entry in the series really doesn't offer anything new.

I would add a much better read is Eric Flints 1600 series. The 20th centuary people go down to the 18-19th century level and the 16th centuary folk basicly stay at that level. The HS library gives knowledge of the lives of the 16th Cen. people and enables them to change it. It is NOT like the Nantucket library that somehow gives info on how to make advnced 18th Cen. weapons.Inc. sailing ships with cannon of all things and Gattleing guns. Give Flint's books a look at,they are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarized scenes","review":"I'm very disappointed by the fact that Mr. Stirling plagiarized scenes from the movie Zulu for portions of this book. I was loving the series and reading it as fast as I could when I came across scenes virtually copies from the movie. I've enjoyed everything Mr. Stirling has written so far, but this was just very, very disappointing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Oceans of Eternity","review":"Being a military historian I enjoyed the book, and the series. It shows well the Bronze Age. There were no \\"nice people\\" at that time. Civilizations were chewing each other up for land and resources. It is for that reason I did NOT find the ending rushed or contrived. Poisoning one's enemies was common during that time. I would have liked to have seen the \\"villains\\" to be defeated honorably (especially Hong), but sometimes reality doesn't end that way (ex Hitler, Mao, Ho). Nor did I mind women as infantry. When you have a small population, you use everybody available. Not PC, just simple survival in a harsh world. Looking for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope this isn't the end","review":"I enjoyed Islands in the sea of Time, and Against the Tide of years better, but this was a good one, too. Stirling set up a continuation of the story, but it could end with this one, too. I hope he writes more in the series as it is one that I look forward to future installments of. I'm particularly curious about what happens to Vicki Cofflin and Company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Ending for OK Series","review":"At the risk of repeating what others have said here, the ending of this series was a monumental let-down.

The conclusion is so lame that I would recommend you not even get started with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, pointless and completely aimless ending","review":"The only reason I read this was to see how it ends - it is just a stupid ending and long descriptions to test your patience - of irrelevant things.

Leaves lots of room for future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine","review":"After all the fanfare leading up to the appearance of \\"A Question of Blood\\" in the US, I found this novel vastly overrated. There is nothing new here. Inspector Rebus is a loner cop who Doesn't Play by the Rules. His sidekick, Siobhan Clarke, is slightly more interesting, and of course she Doesn't Play by the Rules either. The crime is not hard to solve and the book is easy to put down. The plot lacks urgency. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Question of Rebus: The Ox or a Fish Supper?","review":"Walk into a book shop, and chances are you'll find the Rankin books under the category of \\"Mystery\\". The latest Rebus book is once again a tale of two crimes, which Rebus and Siobhan Clarke slowing solve thoughout the book. But unlike other mystery novels, the fun isn't in deducing whodunnit, but in enjoying the characters on their journey through the story. The interaction between Rebus and Clarke as they work their way through the pubs of Edinburgh is a joy, even when the conversation drifts far away from the cases they are supposed to solve. Many of the other characters firmly hold your attention too, and it's all so enjoyable that the weak conclusions to the mysteries are almost of no consequence. When it comes to an Ian Rankin mystery the fun is in the journey, not in the getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cliff hanger","review":"A question of blood is one of the better Rankin novels. Two students and an adult are found dead in a classroom with the adult a former military character and appearing to be the murderer of all of them.

Don't forget to get also \\"The Captain And Me\\", another excellent Doobies album!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus is Just Alright","review":"I bought this cd for this song. There are a couple of others that are good too. The Doobies are a favorite group of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"DISCIPLE\\" ....the actual reason to listen to this cd","review":"Overall, a very strong showing for this band, even 35 years later after its initial release. Ton Johnston and Patrick Simmons, guitarists for this band, are standouts throughout, however the one actually overlooked track on this cd is \\"DISCIPLE.\\" With a twin guitar attack, biting vocals, and wild twin drummer syncopatic displays, this one song should convert any true guitar rock fan into the \\"Doobie Brothers\\" camp. After this 6 plus minute display of guitar/drum histrionics; the next song \\" Snake Man\\", is a eye opening acoustic foray into early - sounding Chicago blues with a Doobies' West Coast feel. A 4 star was given to this cd ony because of the strange sounding song \\"cotton mouth\\", which just seems out of place on this record. Still, a \\"must buy\\" for any rock guitar fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOFI SACD Superior !!!","review":"To think I nearly missed out on this kills me. Last year, before it was released, I had a preorder up. At the time I had just gotten my home theater system hooked up,and I was obsessed with surround sound. Bought EVERYTHING I could lay my hands on. When I learned that THIS was \\"just\\" remastered stereo,I canceled my preorder. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago,after 36 years I FINALLY decide to get Bad Company's debut album. Of course I want THE very best version available, so...I rekindle my romance with both MOFI, and AUDIO FIDELITY. Eventually, I'm led back to this album I have loved since the day it was released in 1972. When it arrived the day after I ordered it ( thank you Prime !),my socks and my mind were BLOWN !?!?!? This album has NEVER sounded THIS good before !!! I HIGHLY recommend this MOFI Masterpiece if you have an SACD player. I can't speak to the standard CD layer (it's a hybrid), since I can only listen on an SACD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"House music personified -- with two great groove tracks","review":"Ever since I was introduced to House Music in Chicago, back when there was WBMX and the Hot Mix 5 -- I knew that the way music was marketed and played would change. We are now in the year 2000 and the way electroica, as it relates to House Music vibe, has changed. Theres Techno, Trance, Speed, Garage, and so on. But my all time favorite is genuine House Music.To Mr. Gene Farris, I say keep the house vibe alive. All of the tracks that you programmed, coupled with the sultry voices that appear on occassion, is spot on!!!If Gene could, I would like him to explore making a complete downtempo CD. Tracks 1 and 6 are key to an excellent downtempo CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage !","review":"Half these CD's didn't work. Buy another brand.

Mr. Schein's clinical psychology approach lead us to a very deep explanation about what kind of personal, groups and organizational dynamics are involved in the process of stability and change in an organization. A very interested framework including inconscious references. The clinical diagnostic approach Mr. Schein offers here is a very interesting methodology every organizational research or practitionaire must know and think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for camping","review":"Have used this pot for camping trips several times now and it is very handy. I especially like the handle as it allows the pot to be suspended from a tripod with a hook and chain and it holds enough soup/chili to feed three hungry men. It is lightweight and the non-stick coating works good but you need to be careful otherwise you can scratch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Unit","review":"This fryer does its job very well. The one problem is heat--the outer shell gets very hot so it is not good around children. It is easy to clean and has a good filtration system. I would recommend it for anyone who really likes fries."},{"rating":"1","title":"does nothing my old fryer can not...","review":"I got this expecting crisper fries etc..but they seem soggier..follow all the directions but not impressed. Several things wrong with this. I do not have children so not happy with these \\"magnetic\\" plugs..They pop off very easily..There should be a provision to have a normal plug for more stability. The other thing I do not like is the gimicky filtration system. Most of the crumbs stick along the sides of the container and fall between the little space of the strainer and container..therefore they go to the bottom and never get filtered out...plus..cleaning is a chore..to many parts to take out and clean..The filter does nothing..same greasy smell in the house..My old unit had 2 pieces...basket and unit. Also goes up to 400 degrees...this goes to 375..maybe that is why things come out somewhat soggy and greasy. Taking it back and digging out the old cheapo fryer...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just out of warranty, FIRE!","review":"Great fryer for 12.5 months.

It is not model FR4008002, but instead is model FR400750, but judging from the picture and reading the description and reviews, I believe it is the same model. It seemed to work just fine, although some recipes ask for temperatures above 375F; which this unit cannot handle. My gripe is that I used it about 10 times total, over the course of about 2 years, and then it died. At first, it just stopped heating, and the reset button needed to be reset in order for it to heat up again. This happend about 3 or 4 times. But now, it completely died. No light, no heat. I'm currently looking for a replacement. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"MJB ROCKS!","review":"Mary J. Blige rocks!

The quality of the music and the entire production was A+. She is definitely an artist whom lives what she sings and you were able to get a full picture of it in this DVD.A must have!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"My wife bought this CD as she's a Mary J Blige fan, and even she made a comment about it not being as good as her other CDs. To be honest I think she is incredibly overrated as a singer, and this CD shows that all too clearly. I assume it's been overdubbed in parts, as she's not as off key as I have heard her in other gigs (Superbowl, Grammys, etc.).If you like this sort of thing I guess it's OK, but it's not really my thing. I think what I dislike more than anything else is how she is touted as such a great singer, but you can hear that she sings flat throughout this (she often sings flat on her studio CDs too though), and she oversings some songs to the point where her voice cracks.I would say if you're going to buy her CDs, stick to the studio albums, as they don't expose her vocal shortcomings as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARY KILLED IT!!!!!","review":"I am so proud that I purchased this DVD. I saw Mary when she performed at Radio City Music Hall in NY and her performance along with her testimonials had people clapping and crying, including myself. She let us go down the road with her and allowed us to feel what she was feeling and thinking, when she may not have been loving and respecting herself and being in less than perfect relationships with men (including her daddy) to a new day where she has found true love and have a total different outlook on life. After watching this, I felt like doing a commercial. Seriously any true Mary fan would love this dvd and would want to add this to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimonial!!!!","review":"This is truly a testimonial. Mary really did her thing on this DVD! Her singing was so heart wrenching & true to heart that I cried especially \\"Children of the Ghetto\\" & \\"No More Drama. Mary is a true performer with no holds barred. Her performance and stage presence has excelled over the the years, she is like fine wine...She gets better with time. I have been an avid fan since the 411 because Mary has never stopped puttin' out the hits. I hope she continues to soar to greater heights. This is a must buy, must see DVD to add to your collection! Where would Hip Hop be without Mary's contribution?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I have been using this product for a couple months now. I am very happy with my choice.

This book was a great disappointment - it is too disjointed and is full of exaggerations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beauty of Harsh Country","review":"I first learned of this book from a wizened sheep rancher and shearer discussed in one of Ehrlich's vignettes, and expected a trite outsider's view of this area. (I live not too many miles from where she lived during most of the book). As I feasted on the author's prose, though, I was thrilled to find that I was wrong.This is a spirited, moving, and perceptive portrait of a land that can be both hostile and nurturing, and those people who have become a part of the country. The author relates her responses to the land, tying these reactions to emotional transformations she experienced as she learned the territory and its ways.Yes, the book is good as a travelogue. However, it really excels in its analysis of a land and its people. Ehrlich's book both confirmed and sharpened the impressions I had developed as I learned about my new home. Wherever you live, this is an excellent book for you to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional writer's close-up observations of ranch life","review":"I discovered this book while working as a tour guide in Wyoming, and found that it captured the spirit of the place beautifully. Ehrlich is an outsider-turned-insider, which I learned from her writing and from accounts of Wyoming natives who knew her and indeed respect her. Her accounts take you to shepherding and into a Native American sun dance ritual; fascinating stuff and there's much more. Her prose is highly poetic. My wife and I have recommended this book to many people over the years, and each person has thanked us profusely for the advice. That includes a New York native who moved to Montana, and he, too feels that this book captures the heart of the region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent lore of west, one woman's wyoming","review":"This memoir was assigned reading in a creative writing class I took entitled: The Art of Regionalism at University of California, Irvine. Ehrlich's poetic writing brings the reader the hardknocks life of ranchhands, sheep herders and fenced lands. The flavor of the West is resonant throughout, the feel of winter, the parch for water, the wide sky with its eye on everything below. The rodeo of characters, those ranchhands, who mostly have trouble with women and drink come to life as truly as they did to the author. This slim volume roots one into the West and I have a great urge to bring my children to Wyoming to breathe that fresh air and rejoice in that solitary life. This book, at my recommendation, has been selected by our book club for April, 1998. This review was written by Jacquelyn Beauregard Dillman, Newport Beach Public Library Foundation, Newport Beach, CA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open spaces have always attracted me.","review":"Wide landscapes and open land as far as the eye can see have always been a draw for me. The middle of a very large city can be so confining if you don't have the time/money to get out frequently and that is what this book does for me.I read it 25 years ago and had since lost my copy and I'm glad Amazon had one ready to shoot to me. I'm in a different mindset (along with being 25 years older) but same feelings are here.

Plus, now adays you can't get into the sites like you used to anyway so 1/2 of this stuff is totally out dated! I feel totally ripped off.

The overriding theme is essentially, \\"And then I read Dr. Gray's book\\" (or, preferably, \\"attended my first seminar\\") \\"and my live was changed forever.\\" There are a few allusions to the specifics of his theories, but basically the jargon is used and the reader is assumed to be familiar with the subject already. The book has been marketed as a collection of real-life experiences of ordinary couples, with many of whom the reader should be able to identify, but this is not the case at all. It is a glowing \\"puff piece\\" which reads as if it had been drawn from the evaluation forms submitted by couples at the end of his seminars. I am not disputing the significance of Dr. Gray's insights and presentation in the slightest, just the thrust of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...not at all what I wanted","review":"I completely agree with the previous review that this book is nothing but a John Gray advertisement.

I found that Princeton Review kind of just packed their guide with random student quotes.

The CPU is slow, the RAM is limited, and your hard drive isn't exactly fast or large.The best of the first-gen tablets was the Fujitsu Stylistic, but it cost twice as much. Of course, it also had twice as much ability. For tablet shoppers, the second-gen offers WindowsXP for Tablets, Office 2003 with OneNote (really leverages the tablet's strong points), better CPU selections and more mature engineering (convertibles!).

Also, occasionally I will close the program and instead of minimizing into my icon tray it will show up on my taskbar. I have to restart the program and minimize it again to make it go away.

Was a total waste of money and time. The security center was totally annoying and kept popping up until I manually disabled it using msconfig. And configuring the tool for any other mail program other than outlook express is a pain. Besides, if you have already opened the mail program *before* the spamkiller, there's not much spam killing you can do. Finally uninstalled and just wrote some outlook rules to filter out everything but known e-mail addresses. Recently installed norton internet security, and it seems to have a much more sensible spam blocking option."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spam Killer That Doesn't Kill Spam","review":"Do not under any circumstances buy this awful product; I cannot believe McAfee, which has decent Firewall and AntiVirus software could bring out such a bad product; it's almost as annoying as the Spam that it doesn't filter.If you put this rubbish on your PC, it will take ages to filter all the messages each time you open Outlook Express and then it will put about 1% of any spam into your junk folder and a few that are not spam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful.","review":"Absolutely no support of a piece of junk software. All other reviews except one are right on the money.

For the past seven days since installing, it has trapped all of my important email (without warning, I might add) and left all the viagra, insurance and mortgage spam in my inbox.After finding out that the program was trapping my email without telling me, in trying to disable it, I removed the email account from the program. NOT ONE SINGLE WARNING appeared that doing this would remove all rescued email!!A week's worth of client email and information is not gone, thanks to a program that was supposed to help. How hard would it have been for the programmers to put a secondary warning in the 'delete account' dialog that warns you your blocked email will be deleted? I mean, wtf? It's buried deep down in a help file somewhere, but why would I go search that out if I didn't have this problem in the first place?McAfee? Your programmers should be fired. This program is a colossal disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLACE YOUR VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"If I could this organization would get no star. Program worked fine for a while, then I was unable to retrieve messages. Mcafee offers online Tech Chat that has not worked for 2 weeks and my e-mail has gone unanswered for an equal amount of time but sales on-line chat works everytime, immediately and 24/7. With service like this vote your dollars somewhere else until their revenues and and stock price subsequently suffer. This organization apparently has yet to learn that business success is largely a function of customer satisfaction, not accomplished by consistently ignoring you. If you have a problem good luck the support can easily cost more than the software and the live tech chat or e-mail assistance is available not 24/7 but 0/7 (my experience). I finally decided I wasted enough time and effort have uninstalled and am currently researching other alternatives and an organization that is available in the event support is required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems and then some","review":"I wasn't happy with Spamkiller. It's painfully slow and doesn't seem to catch much of anything, even after doing some trouble shooting with Tech Support. I agree with others that I don't like the Security Center thing.

Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Support--Sort of Works--I would avoid.","review":"Support is just awful. After installation, my Outlook, on a network, Win XP, fractional share of T-1 line, would state that it had lost connection and I would have to exit Outlook, then re-start Outlook and it would be fine for a while. I could get virtually no help on support either within or after the 30 day return period. System works fine now that I took SK off.Product sort of works with a lot of fooling around. Screened (i.e., \\"killed\\") some mail even after I marked that sender \\"friend.\\" Let stuff through that it should not have, but that is a lesser problem.Documentation is [bad]. If it works perfectly for you right off the bat, maybe it is great for you. If you want to try it and it does not, I would strip it off immediately and get a refund.McAfee \\"security center\\" is an annoyance, too. I bought the product to avoid spam.

The 2nd time it came bundled with Internet Security Suite 2006, which is OK - apart from SpamKiller. After installing the suite, uninstall SpamKiller before you run any programs.

So I thought lets give chance to other and try other spam filters.So I tried McAfee SpamKiller and Wooho! it was a big NightMare for me.... Its -100% Smart ... Yeah I mean it ... It not mark any mail as spam but even If i tell it to block this mail, It says rudely like This Mail Cannot be Blocked like the spammer given him much $$$ to not blocking his mail. So McAfee itself is not a smart but After guiding it, still it not work as we wish so its -100% smart.So now I am back with my Norton ... and Hope It wont push me in situation to reinstall it again and again.So much disappointed with McAfee SpamKiller.

These are very good coveralls. They are made very well and I have been looking for some to replace mine for awhile now. My old employer used to supply them and since mine were finally wearing out, I started looking for new ones. The tags in my old ones used to bother my neck (Tickling and the like) so I tore them out a long time ago and that is why I could not figure out who made them. I bought several different brands and none seemed to be the quality of my old ones. These are heavy material, but not too heavy either. After a few washes, they are just perfect.

But seriously, this book helped me at a time when my relationship was on the rocks. It gave me the courage I needed to see that God didn't intend for me to be walked on like a doormat,and that relationships need to be equal. Paula gave me so much great advice and most importantly, applied the bible to things that I had no idea they applied to. This was especially important to me as I am a very new Christian. Thank you Paula for being here for all of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Original","review":"Women who want to take charge of their lives (or anyone else) will get little out of this book. The author projects her own emotions and conflicts onto women of the Bible, extracts illogical conclusions, and wraps up the whole thing with empty, chirpy imperatives like \\"deal with it!\\" The author comes off as brittle rather than inspiring. Further, the book needs the help of a good editor to reduce the rambling, unfocused narrative into more cohesive text.A better way to deal with life is to read the Bible yourself for its richness and wisdom rather than heed the author's superficial conclusions, which are only \\"sound bites\\" posing as actual exegesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal With It! You Cannot Conquer What You Will Not Confront","review":"Really do love this book by Paula White. It helped to answer many questions and open my eyes to what I was going through and why.

Those who follow her ministry will find it a more in depth explanation of the spiritual teachings and messages available through her television ministry. I recommend this as a must read for anyone who is living life after trauma especially incidents that were done against their will. Look to the words of this anointed woman of God and know that you can deal with it but you gotta confront it first. This book deserve a Silver rating because it is a great effective read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula White is the antithesis of true Christianity.............................","review":"Were you able to sum up Paula White's understanding of God it would actually form a black hole sucking up knowledge from those nearby. Jesus spoke of her in scripture noting that she takes away the keys to knowledge and is willing to cross land and sea to make disciples, then makes them twice the daughter of hell that she is. For those of you who are willingly sucked into her lust for material wealth know this: You are culpable before God for following this woman.

However, once we got it home I was very dissappointed. It is poorly made and constantly falls apart. My son is very frustrated with it.

(The Vehicles are better quality)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice","review":"Sorry, this toy is a hunk o' junk.

He loves the toy, bricks and Rolly alike. Honestly he spends more time playing with it than any other toy he has had so far.It decided to write this review after reading all the negative ones. I can see younger children getting frustrated with the toy, but it is OK for a slightly older child. For me the important thing was that he LOVES it, and honestly he has no idea that it is cheap looking or could be sturdier.I am planning on getting him more of the series for holidays (he has been asking for it since he got the first one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better suited for older kids!","review":"My 2 year old is obsessed with Bob. I'm sure other moms know how difficult it is to find Bob toys. Even still, steer clear of this unless your child is older. I don't know a single small child who wouldn't immediately take this toy apart. I agree with the other reviewers with regards to its' durability. It just doesn't stay put together. Probably a great toy for OLDER kids! Little ones just don't have fun with it. My son loves the Roley included! (You have to install the batteries in it for it to talk.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very fun toy","review":"I purchased this toy so that my son could park all the Bob the builder mini vehicles I bought for him in it. He does play with it some but it doesn't do any more than a shoebox turned on it's side would. It doesn't stay put together. The ramp is placed into a space underneath the shelter but doesn't snap together, so if the shelter is moved at all it comes apart. The mountain scene that snaps on top doesn't snap in well. The Roly vehicle that came with it doesn't work. When you press the top of it down it does nothing. NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY. If it closed together to form a carrying case then it would have been worthwhile"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original Cram Book is much better","review":"I bought this book based on the previous reviews and read the book from cover to cover. Then I worked on SelfTest Practice Test. Many things that are on the SelfTest are not mentioned at all on this book. I had to search online for things like ARC Path.

I don't much mind this one because the historical elements of ancient Rome have always fastened me. The main character is especially interesting because of his rather sarcastic comments involving everything from marriage practices to Alexander the Great.Overall-fun little mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy stuff","review":"This series is pretty lightweight. You don't feel that you've visited ancient Rome -- the city doesn't come alive, the people do not behave as we expect, e.g. Milo, Cicero, Cato, to behave. The scenary feels like cardboard, and it is hard to care about any of the people, including the 'hero' Decius.Historical detective fiction has been done a whole lot better than this. Lindsay Davies' 'Falco' novels are far better written, and much more fun to read.The funny thing is that Roberts can write a good tale when he wants to. But he seems to know nothing about ancient Rome, and it shows. I was disappointed, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff!","review":"I've recently become interested in Roman history and have read histories by Suetonius and Plutarch as well as Robert Graves' works. John Maddox Roberts allowed me to take my thin knowledge of the period and culture for a fun romp. I found the writing to be brisk, entertaining, and very creative. I agree that the characters could be fleshed out a little more, but it's not a big deal.In this classic, hard-boiled detective novel, our principled hero gets beat up, seduced, and winds up in trouble way over his head. The fact that it all happens in Rome instead of 1920's Chicago makes it all the more fun for the ancient Roman aficionado."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's No Steven Saylor","review":"I was hoping that, after having devoured all of Steven Saylor's fantastic Sub Rosa series, that Mr. Roberts' novels would be good enough to give me my fix for Ancient Roman mysteries. Alas, his first novel in the SPQR series has turned me away. The writing is good, but the author spends too much time with \\"info. dumping,\\" the characters are sometimes poorly developed, especially the protagonist, and the reader can see the bad guys coming a mile away. Even the book's title offers a clue to the situation. Oh well, at least I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical inaccuracies distracting","review":"While I don't pretend to be an expert on Roman history, I do have some knowledge of the time period. I found this book to have so many glaring inaccuracies that it was difficult to read. The one that sticks out in my mind is the description of Cato as consorting with his slaves and producing children. The author has confused Cato the Censor with the Cato who was a contemporary of Caesar's. Cato the Censor was the great (I believe) grandfather of this Cato and he was the one who consorted with his slaves. Indeed, that side of the lineage is what produced Caesar's nemesis Cato.In fact, this is really the only thing from the book which sticks out in my mind, in addition to other historical problems which needn't be addressed here.

You already have what it offers-motivation. If you care enough about the SAT to read reviews of the best practice books, you will do well; trust me. This book is for students who need a push to prepare. While not a bad book for its purpose, it spends too much time motivating, and not enough time teaching. There are relatively few practice exercises, and the answers are too basic for motivated students. Instead, I recommend buying Cracking the New SAT 2005 from the Princeton Review. It has three complete tests, and the main text provides excellent strategies for attacking questions in math, verbal and writing. With time and practice, you will definitely do very well on the SAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting..., and a Good Value.","review":"I found this book laying around in the library and decided to pick it up, even though it's outdated, I still thought it would give tips for the reading and math sections. It did that and in addition, it made some good jokes worthy of a real laugh. A quick and enjoyable read, it may not be for people who really wanna get serious and straight into studying the SAT. If you want to use your time to the best of your advantage, you should just go ahead and do SAT problems on your own, but this book is basically the talk part of it (it instructs you to practice on your own using a book written by the collegeboard). Nonetheless, i still had a good time reading this book and i liked it, so read it at on your own time and at your own risk. It does include a good 600 word vocab section that suggests how to remember each individual word, and I found that pretty valuable since a side vocabulary book would cost around the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"I used an earlier edition of this book a few years ago and my score went up from 1280 to 1490.

I enjoyed this movie very much even though I didn't care too much for the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real \\"Noir\\" Love Story...","review":"This is my idea of what a movie should be. It has more than a touch of \\"noir\\" quality to it; it is tinged with real human evil - and love - which, of course, are so closely related. This is the story of Alan and Ella - a tale of lovely, twisted, obsessive-compulsive love (and how else can real love be if one is truly alive?). I saw it three times on TV; finally, I just had to have it - to give to a very special lady-love. I only watched it a couple more times and I had to give it to my lovely lady. \\"Forever Mine\\" can now be called, \\"Our Movie.\\" This story captures the very essence - the cutting edge - of love/hate. It was captured long ago in a movie called, \\"A Man and A Woman\\" - the sound track of which I have treasured for years and years, having the haunting, Latin-feel of music by Antonio Carlos Jobim. For anyone that loves the \\"noir\\" genre - this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Mine","review":"One of the better movies I've watched in years. Never heard of Gretchen Mol before and must say she is a pretty fine actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really boring - yuk!","review":"Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks right up there among the very worst. Some reviewers enjoyed the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. This film didn't work for me on either level - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one. I wanted to smack Alan and Ella by the end of the movie for being such sappy idiots. They deserve each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Mine is now yours in review","review":"The VHS that I purchased was in great shape.

When it came out, it may have been a Spielberg project, a technological piece, but it definity lacks the wonder of ET or the appeal of Star Wars. The teen kids will find it rather tame, the horror scenes, not even as weird as Harry Potter.Sherlock Holmes is best handled by the BBC. Holmes is sort of an early James Bond, almost a Union Jack superman without the need for female companionship. Hmmm?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far fetched story line","review":"I have realized that every spin off of Sherlock Holmes disappoints me greatly (I am an ardent fan of the BBC series with Jeremy Brett as Holmes).I do not intend to spoil the plot and hence I shall write no more about the mystery.On the bright side, they have tried hard to do justice to Sherlock Holmes whimpsies, e.g, fencing, the hat, existence of Mycroft et al.This one simply adds to my big fat collection of Sherlock Holmes DVDs. I wont dispose of it, but I wont be watching it for the second time either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great production values, but weak casting!","review":"Why anybody would want to make a movie about Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson as teenagers is beyond me, but I don't think this one was very successful.

It's Harry Potter without magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holmes fans will love this.","review":"This movie is an account of a young Sherlock Holmes who meets a young Watson at a boarding school in Victorian England. There are clues, suspense, special effects and a touch of romance. Egyptian assassins, drugged-laced darts, stained glass knights coming to life to attack a hapless priest, and of course, the kidnapped girl being wrapped in mummy bandages and being encased in wax while alive keep the film moving.I show this movie to high school sophomores right before a homecoming or a vacation or some other highly anticipated event with good success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Very well filmed. Big Steve did a good job on this one. Has mystery and fun. A bit much for kids and not a historically correct (as the books go) but a fun way to look at how he might have grown up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So THIS is Holmes as a teenager...","review":"I saw this film the first week of freshmen year at college, with a young lady that would ultimately become my wife. So it may be that I'm a bit biased when it comes to this movie -- but I loved it. Absolutely loved it. For 1985, the special effects are wonderful. For example, the stained glass window that springs to life was really impressive. I love how Spielberg and crew introduce us to Holmes' future nemesis Moriarity, and how his strong relationship with Watson begins in the seemingly safe environs of boarding school. We all have favorite films, but even the best of those get tiresome after awhile. This one, however, I could watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"chris columbus becomes Sir Doyle","review":"about 15 years ago, I've watched this movie in the theater. It was amazing! I even thought there was possiblitites that Doyle wrote this story. Most of Holmes stories which by non-Doyle are awful, actually - look LeBlanc, even good writer like him spolied Holmes just for his gentle thief Rupin. But Chris Columbus made perfect Holmes and Watson. That's really I love this movie even now. Doyle's characters have humors - specially Watson. He is lovely, he has loyalty. The only one shortage is, the director didn't recognize the humors - Barry Levinson actually serious director, so he couldn't understand a whole of script, I think. That makes sometimes 'a little bit of awkwardness' - look Watson's illusion. It's fnny, but not funny as we expected. only one my wish is - I want to get this movie's original music score CD. Some score is come from classical score, but music is also good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure Movie!","review":"I freakin' love this movie! I have loved since I was probably six years old. The special effects were outstanding for their time, the visuals are awesome, and the kid playing Sherlock Holmes doesn't look too bad either. It is a great adventure movie--a must see for any Spielberg fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"very little to do with and entirely unlike anything genuinely holmesian. just a bad, rambling often incoherent production with ghoulish effects in place of genuine invention. pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"young holmes- - very cute!","review":"I think that this was a really good movie, I think that it kinda explains why homes really never fell in love in the future. and I think that Holmes is really cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overlooked movie of all time.","review":"This has to be one of the greatest movies ever made, and on of the most ignored.

It does keep you guessing and can't believe it is as old as it is. If you have seen it, have you watched it all the way through the credits-there is quite a twist which sets it up for a sequel. Bummer that they never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good not to be on DVD","review":"Young Sherlock Holmes is the perfect film for young teenage audiences and old Holmes fans. With its clever plotting, tragic climax, and double ending (one before and one after the credits), this film deserves to be on DVD. Can we start a campaign to get a special edition release?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem worth watching again and again...!","review":"I saw this film when it was released in theaters while I was a teenager living in London, England. My whole family and I were instantly smitten by it. With an engaging storyline, strong acting and memorable characters, this has become one of the favorite films of my youth.Now in my 30's, I still enjoy watching this film whenever I can. Nicholas Rowe plays the young, intelligent Holmes and Alan Cox plays his sidekick, Watson. Beautiful Sophie Ward plays Holmes' love interest, Elizabeth. The story takes place in Holmes' and Watson's school days in London. Old friends of Elizabeth's uncle mysteriously die one by one, all caused by strange hallucinations caused by poisoned darts. Soon enough, Holmes and Watson embark on a wonderful tale of revenge, mystery and deception.I do wish this film would be released on DVD soon. It would certainly be a great addition to any mystery fans DVD/video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for diehard Sherlock Holmes fans!","review":"For Sherlock Holmes fans, this rendition of bringing a younger Holmes and Watson to life on the screen is enchanting and fun. It allows the viewer to \\"imagine\\" how Holmes developed his gifts for solving mysteries and how he came to know Watson, drug use, and his life as a batchelor detective. The plot of this film, along with the fantastic special effects, does seem a bit far-fetched, but that hardly matters. The Victorian setting, the early \\" competitions \\" of solving school mysteries, and falling hopelessly in love, all contribute to the feeling that you get a chance to glimpse Holmes as he might have been as a teenager in private school in the earliest days of his keen observation skills. I love this film. It is one that can entertain me again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This is a wonderful movie, and I think I've waited some 20 years for it to arrive on DVD :)Well... at least 2 years, since I taped over my copy of it on the VHS.If you havent seen it, buy it on DVD!IF YOU HAVE seen it, buy it on DVD!Too bad theres no extras on it. Anyone know if it will be an \\"special\\" edition?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best and original Holmes films","review":"As soon as I watched this movie, it became a favorite of mine. I liked the unique approach that it took--that Holmes and Watson first met when they were still teenagers. The movie is full of intrigue, suspense, and comedy. The graphic, nightmare-like hallucinations are brilliant feats of computer-aided imagery, and may be a tad frightening to younger viewers. Overall, a fantastic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Spielberg!","review":"Even the greats have bad days, maybe bad seasons, during which the filming of a movie takes place. This particular movie veers away from the canon and everything it presents to such an extent that if the darker stuff like ritual killings and death of teenagers are taken away, this movie almost becomes a spoof of Sherlock Holmes. Probably Spielberg had simply offloaded some Indiana Jones material in this movie by giving us a mushy Holmes, an irritating Watson, and some of the most OTT villains which can be produced only in Hollywood.If you are not in the mood for the original stuff, as portrayed inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Boxed Set Collection)or the latest \\"reboot\\" (Sherlock Holmes) or even its more intelligent \\"updating\\" (Sherlock: Season One), and simply wish to have fun, better pursueThe Great Mouse Detective (Mystery in the Mist Edition), which, let me assure you, is vastly superior to this particular movie that is under review."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!","review":"I only watched this movie a couple of days ago, but I'm already in love with it! The acting was great, only Potter... er, I mean Watson, was extremely annoying. I kept being reminded of Harry Potter all the time!! The chemistry teacher was like a Proffesor Binns, and Dudley (!) was like a mini Malfoy. It's extremely hard to believe that the two movies (or the movie and book) are completely unrelated! Anyways, I thought that the movie is very \\"misunderestimated\\" nowadays, and I'm extremely disappointed that there's no fansites of the actors or anything... I mean, they're all so good, Nicholas Rowe especially! The music was fantastic. If only I could get my hands on the soundtrack... and it's out on DVD!! Go watch it, you'll never regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spielberg Does Holmes & I Proclaim It Good","review":"This nifty movie is sooooo Spielberg. In fact, it is more Temple of Doom than Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, but that's okay because the results are terrific. Barry Levinson cranks up the juice as Nicholas Rowe (as great a Holmes as Jeremy Brett) and Watson (Alan Cox doing a Nigel Bruce, foot in bucket and all) team up in a wonderfully atmospheric boarding school and fight computer generated bad things. Holmes falls in love with an English beauty, and not to give too much away, he loses her (gotcha), thus beginning his famous lonely path. There is so much to like ... especially for any Anglophiles. The gothic and the Victorian, the Spielbergian excitement, and a slick production with a lot of heart. And that's what really marked the best Spielberg-produced movies ... a lot of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Tested...Cris Columbus' Prep for Harry Potter","review":"I liked this movie when it came out in 1985...and its a stealat a nice price here on DVD.

As a Sherlock Holmes fan of book and movies, it's fun to see what might have been. The actors are great, and resemble younger versions of Basil and Nigel in my opinion.

I enjoy it for a rainy afternoon as well as popcorn-worthy. An all around good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Sherlock Holmes","review":"I believe that Arthur Conan Doyle created the character, Sherlock Holmes, to exemplify integrity. The DVD, Young Sherlock Holmes, portrays young Sherlock as Doyle did in his stories about him. Our children and young adults need to see integrity as an asset.

However, several pages into my reading my \\"excitement\\" turned to disappointment. Not only are there no pictures (I always find before and after pictures so motivating!), but the stories were much shorter than I expected. The 145 \\"secrets\\" (which the author will comment on after each one page story!) were many that we've all heard before.

I agree with the other reviewers that the one page stories (and it's a small page) do not do anything for you. There are also no before and after pictures. The \\"Winning Action\\" section which follows each story is pretty much a compilation of diet hints that we have heard before from all the womens magazines out there. It's only 1-3 sentences. You are not inspired since you are not given enough details of the person's struggle and how he or she overcame it. You are given so few details that it may as well be an excel spreadsheet with name, diet center used, and pounds lost...period. Find your inspiration/motivation elsewhere since you won't find it in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational title!","review":"I was somewhat skeptical about this book. I figured it would be filled with pithy little sayings but I was delighted to find some true inspiration. From people who have struggled to lose 10 pounds to one woman who has lost 400 pounds, these people have been there and know what it takes to be successful. I think perhaps the most helpful thing I gleaned from this book was that each person found a different thing that helped them to find their weight-loss success. For some it was discovering an anchor, for others it was facing the emotional reasons behind their eating. It showed me that there isn't one right answer for all of us - we each need to find what works for us. I highly recommend this title to those who are looking for motivation.

It covers auditory perception of linguistic processing, including lexical, syntactic and schematic effects, learner inference, collaborative and non-collaborative listening skills and strategies, developing and assessing listening skills, and the placing of listening in a language curriculum. This book may not be the ideal choice for a teacher new to EFL, as there is rather a lot of specialist terminology - so much to the extent that at times I felt that I was reading a linguist's learner dictionary. What I liked best about this book is that it allowed me to focus more clearly and scientifically on creating and evaluating listening tasks for my high school teaching situation, and for that reason alone, the book was worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son that plays on his high school golf team.

First, I have to say he was a huge hit because he was instantly recognizable as Harry, and without the signature glasses the character could be \\"any random Gryffindor.\\" So the glasses definitely accomplished that goal. They were comfortable and durable. His only real complaints were that they have a \\"Harry Potter\\" logo on the bows, which of course--if you're \\"really\\" Harry Potter, you're not going to have your own name on your glasses, so that was a little annoying. Also, the lenses were quite enormous, even on his adult face they seemed a bit too big. But they definitely stood out as a defining accessory for his costume, so maybe that was the point. All in all we were pretty happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap alternative sent by Cashco1000","review":"If you think you are ordering officially licensed Harry Potter glasses with the Harry Potter name on the side (that fit most, have UV protection and that most reviewers really like), I would not place your order if it is to be filled by Cashco1000.

Cashco1000 says that this happens all the time. If your Amazon picture shows the officially licensed glasses, according to Cashco1000, Amazon posted this without their knowledge. Their picture should be of the cheap alternative (that should not, in my humble opinion, possibly get a positive review by anybody unrelated to that seller's company).

Her main sources are personal interviews conducted with numerous persons once connected with Fidel Castro. An overwhelming bias against Castro surfaces in these interviews, as most of the persons interviewed are expatriated Cubans who possess a considerable, although justified contempt for Castro. As a text to be used in academic research, Guerilla Prince is, therefore, inadequate. Geyer's book, however, does offer some intriguing pyschological analysis of Castro and his policies. Her summary of Cuban history, and Castro's early life are particularly insightful. Yet Geyer's pitifalls are superficial analysis and outlandish conspiratorial claims which inflate the status of Castro, making him appear as global figure more powerful than he ever was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop psychology masquerading as journalism.","review":"Although \\"Guerrilla Prince: The Untold Story of Fidel Castro,\\" is touted by the publisher as \\"historically, politically and psychologically definitive, the consummate account of the meticulously secretive Cuban leader,\\" Geyer's account of Castro rings hollow. It is filled with cliches and weak writing. Geyer arrives at overreaching conclusions supported largely by testimony from (what else would you expect?) anti-Castro exiles. While she shows that Castro was a master at political and personal manipulation -- nothing new there -- Geyer shallowly explores Castro's psyche, leaving many still unanswered questions. That Castro is an unbending dictator is not a new revelation. But in trying to answer the all-important questions -- who is Fidel and what makes him tick -- Geyer resorts to pop psychology and tenuous connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, worst book ever!","review":"If you want a book to read about Fidel Castro, to tell you the truth about the revolution and himself then steer well clear of this book. This book is nothing more than an aggressive, and completely unfounded attack on Fidel Castro. You can learn nothing from this book other than Fidel liked his ladies...WOW! The author, despite her claim to the contary in the forward, hates Fidel Castro. She shoots herself in the foot by pages eight when she, while listing Castro's \\"faults\\" (all of which can be justified when you take into account outside influences), gives a bitter rendition of \\"America's humiliating defeat at the Bay of Pigs.\\" Like he was just going to sit around and LET America steal his people's country. The Bay of Pigs was a glorious victory, America should never have stuck their noses in in the first place. Viva Fidel Castro!

This was one of those times -- and lucky me, I got a great read out of it. Like many of the reviewers here, I read this straight through, cover-to-cover in 2 days. The characters were immediately real and they've stayed with me, since I closed the book. The story is more than fluff or Gen X bubble gum writing; and I'm sorry for those readers who see it as only that. There's a great story being told here if you listen carefully.

I'm only halfway through it, but based on the rave recommendation and reviews I have to say I'm disappointed. I find that the characters are incredibly pretentious. The tortured writer theme is tired. The situations presented throughout this book are very stereotypical. Rich lawyer dad who cheats on wife, wife who spends his money, rebellious trust fund hippie daughter, tortured writer and his tortured writer father. Gag me. I agree with another reviewer about way too many pop culture references...it is tiresome. And the sex scenes are just plain old gratuitous and uninteresting.

And a dedication in the end-credits makes it clear this is based on DeBartolo's real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I don't read many novels anymore...","review":"It was a quick read and kept me interested BUT it read like a 12 year old girls angsty fantasy. There is nothing surprising about it, and the conflicts are ridiculously overblown. They have fights over nothing, and somehow it becomes an insanely dramatic affair and that is supposed to equal the tumultous romance described on the back of the book. I left this book not liking anyone, not finding depth in anyone, and not really seeing any of them as someone I could ever actually meet in the real world. I can't even quite figure out why they are THAT connected, it seems to me like they share about what a serious but non-lasting couple would have not the kind of thing you'd expect SOUL MATES to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hole in Our Souls","review":"I can't begin to express how deeply this book effected me. I yelled at the text; I let my tears slide down my face to the pages below. Tiffanie DeBartolo has written an amzing work. The reader knows head on that the protagonist is headed for heartbreak and misery. Still, it's impossible to put the book down. The two main characters are plausible, and most people could relate them to others in their lives. These are characters that have a deepseated need for eachother, but for reasons unknown, must be seperated. We all search for someone or something to fill the Hole within us. This book takes a look at how another person can fill that space and leave a chasm when taken away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gut level tour through finding and losing a soul mate...","review":"Tiffanie deBartolo's ability to create intoxicating characters makes it impossible to put this book down. I picked up the novel one evening and ended up reading late into the night, annoying my husband who couldn't sleep with my fits of laughter constantly waking him. The next morning, I immediately grabbed the book again and continued reading in between bites of cereal and blow-drying my hair.

Trixie, the lead character, is witty and loveable, and her story is feeling and deep in the spots it should be and light and frothy in the places it supposed to be. It's ordered and chaotic and wonderful.It's also flawed. It takes a very romanticized view of death and the entire novel reads as a tradegy even if it is being pleasent and fun. It's slightly uneven.

Regardless, everything about this book just worked my nerves, from the main character Trixie (who, though incredibly self-obsessed, gives no real evidence of having an inner life or an interest in cultivating one), to her ill-fated boyfriend (the stock brilliant, brooding Kurt Cobain/James Deansian rebel) to the equally generic Shallow Parent Characters. The simplistic way the author writes her characters and dialogue would be acceptable in a teen novel, but in one ostensibly for an adult audience is either laughable or cringeworthy. Actually, both. Save your money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"Solid writing by Tiffanie DeBartolo.

It will format and start to use the disks, only to show a disk error sometime during the recording. I have be unable to recover ANY data from the disks after an error occurs.I live in Houston, TX and the closest repair facility is about an 1.5 hour round trip. And because only parts are covered by the cheep-o warranty, it would cost me $75 in labor just to have an estimate done (applied to the cost of fixing it if I go forward). So now I have to decide: Is it worth driving 3 hours (drop off and pick up) and spending at least $75 to fix a camara that broke after just 4 months? Am I willing to trust it to film my daughters 2nd birthday? Guess I've got me a $400 paper weight, because I'll be buying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought i might like","review":"I have only used a couple of times.

That being said, overall this camera has performed pretty well. My only complaint is that it doesn't do well in low light (maybe none of them do).

To get rid of disc error you need to take out disc, you can not finalize to save data because of the error and your precious moments taped are now gone.

While these qualities would be desirable for most books, they are what make \\"C: The Complete Reference\\" such a danger. Much of the information that Herb so eloquently gives is by and large tripe; many examples in this book demonstrate a lack of understanding of some of the most basic points of C.

I am saying so because the book is huge close to a thousand pages but it sounds like a cut and paste of the Exchange programmer user manual. When I purchase a book like this one, I expect it to be a complement to the product documentation, to give a better insight of how and why a given software works like it does.

Too bad - it created rather high expectations from this author!. Unfortunately, \\"The Bridal Season\\" was silly, shallow, weakly plotted and poplulated by one dimensional characters. I think that the author can really crank up the angst when she goes for the more serious side of romance and she is not cut out to be a writer of what is essentially light comedy. I agree wholeheartedly with reviewers Darlene and Jane Harrison; the author is clearly capable of much, much more. I struggled to read this and found my mind wandering almost from the first page.

With 3-4 uses a day the collar lasts about 6 hours - with no use it lasts 2 days. What the hell good is this? Also, replacing the batteries is not a snap - two screws have to be manipulated and the battery holder removed. If this only needs to be done every couple of weeks or so, no big deal but if you are training your dog you are constantly taking the collar off and putting it back on so the dog starts connecting the collar with punishment - not good. Customer service gives run-around if you start talking refund or exchange. This outfit knows it is selling a faulty product because of the battery problem but continues to hustle it. My advice is to find a reputable company with a reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries","review":"I have had 3 training collars. The first two stopped working after a week or two.

The second one did the same thing and I ended up returning that too. I don't know if the problem is in the remote or the receiver but about half the time when you press the buttons (either shock or beep) it doesn't do ANYTHING.Sometimes I had to press the button 2 or 3 times until it would beep or shock so this device will often times fail you when you really need it. Because of the delay in delivering the shock/beep it makes it very difficult to train your dog. The dog doesn't know why you shocked him AFTER he has misbehaved, you need to be able to correct the dog right away. When it works, it works great but 50% reliability is just not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"I have been having a a lot of problems with this animal collar. The range is very bad; sometimes at close range it doesn't even work- very bad for attempting to train a dog because timing is everything. The remote control stopped working.

You're outside in the yard with the dog, someone comes down the street walking their dog. Of course your dog takes off after the walking dog, by the time you grab the remote and try to correct your dog it's already out of range the signal and you have to chase after your dog anyway. The battery life is ridicuously short. It takes 2 watch type batteries which cost at least $5 and they go dead quickly even when you havent been correcting the dog. I turn off the collar whenever the dog is inside (which is most of the time) but they still die in a matter of a few days.NOT Recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaky Response","review":"Having followed the instructions to the letter, this would refuse to respond, by shock or tone, and even immediately after re-pairing it to the receiver would be variable like that.

THE FIRST TIME I used this on my dog, the shock button got stuck! It was on the second setting, so it didn't deliver a very harsh shock but it sent my poor little dog into a frenzie running around the yard! I thought it was just a one time thing and maybe I had pressed the button too hard but while I was bringing him back inside the house, my hand hardly bumped the button and it got stuck and shocked him continuously (again) for 8 seconds!

Once we purchased this collar, it wasn't long before he realized his howling days were over...not to mention the counter surfing as well. The only downfall is that the batteries ran out rather quickly, so I'd suggest ordering extras.

The antenna comes out of the collar box, and is woven into the fabric collar. There is not a good enough strain relief or something because it becomes detached from the circuit board and then the thing wont work outside of 10 ft range (can you say useless) because there's no antenna connection. I would have opened it up and soldered it back onto the circuit baord, but the plastic shell is not servicable since its 2 brittle pieces of plastic glued together.Cheaply made.

I purchased this productPetSafe Deluxe Little-Dog Remote Trainer for Pets Under 40 Pounds, PDLDT-305to help train our shiba inu from running (especially because we live on a busy road), upon getting this, we read the directions (more than once) and followed them EXACTLY. It did NOT work the way it says it would, from day one. Even turned to the highest setting (our dog only weighs 20 pounds) combined with the verbal command, it didn't startle him or stop him. I do NOT recommend this product. You would be better off just flushing your money down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an aggressive dog!","review":"We never tried the collar because we decided after reading the instruction manual that we needed to return the collar. The manual says very plainly that it's not to be used on an aggressive dog. Our Chuckie Lee can be aggressive so we decided the collar wasn't for him. I'm only writing to save someone the hassle of ordering this product if their dog is aggressive. We are returning the collar, but are stuck with the extra batteries that we bought. They can't be returned so I suggest trying the collar before buying extra batteries. I'm sure that it's a good product, but it's not for us. We're going to find an animal trainer to help us.

Responded to verbal commands using the Petsafe collar within the first 8 to 10 minutes.Our 6 month old Pitbull mix puppy was uncontrollable especially around our 14 year old Border Collie. He wouldn't stop jumping up on her and nipping at her ears and rear legs. We only had to buzz him twice along with the command \\"STOP' and the behavior ceased. After that, we simply used the tone button with the verbal command when he would 'forget' and he's reminded. We simply leave the collar on him ( turned off ) and now he's calmer and more obedient. Next, we have to work on not chasing the cats.This was our puppies last chance before we found him another home, which we did not want to do.

I live in the country and my dog had the bad habit of chasing things he did not needs to be chasing and had gotten really handy about taking a run down the road. The collar works great and his \\"hearing\\" has gotten much better. I really like the tone feature because you can warn them with the tone first. The collar seems to be durable, my collar has been wet before and has stood up to his scuffling with the other outside dogs. The only drawback I would have to say about the collar is the size. My dog has a thick neck and the collar was still big for him. I have it taken up as far as it will go. If you had a smaller or a skinny dog I don't know how you would get the collar taken up enough because of the transmitter wire built into the back of the collar. Other than that I give it a thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome products, worked on a stubborn mule of a dog!","review":"This product is excellent!

The reason we like it is because the unit gives you the option of using the electrical shock and noise setting or just the noise setting without the shock. Once you train your dog with the combination of the zap and noise (it took about a dozen times or less) you can mainly use the noise function and the dog will respond the same as if he were zapped. We used the very lowest setting during training and it was very effective.We are animal lovers and have rescue dogs and we are strong supports of a little tough love with more difficult or stubborn dogs. The electrical shock setting is very effective tool if used properly. We got our training with a professional dog trainer and we HIGHLY recommend that you learn how to use the collar with a dog trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product was a piece of junk","review":"I bought this when my dog was a puppy and hardly even used it. I tried to use it because it was a pretty descent price, but found it really wasn't worth the money nor effective. The range is not far at all like it states. The batteries needed to be replaced all the time and were so hard to get in and out of the remote and collar and were hard to find. The nylon collar is terrible to try and keep on the dog. No matter how tight you try to put it, it never keeps and that remote is too big and you can't even wear it around your neck like the Innotek ones. I do not recommend this item at all!! Save your money. For a little bit more, buy the Innotek collar. That is a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works and then breaks","review":"Doesn't seem that many of these sorts of devices work for very long. The Petsafe Little Dog Remote trainer is no different. The transmitter works via a 9V battery while the collar unit works on a couple of button batteries. The unit works ok but the battery life goes down the drain in only a few days. If you forget to turn the collar off, you'll be faced with dead batteries in a short time.This is unacceptable because the collar unit, while not even being used to administer the slight electrical shock, runs down the battery quite quickly by just being on.The unit failed to function in less than a year. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let anything happen to it","review":"Works well, but you better hope nothing happens to it. However, chances are, as it is a dog collar used outside, something will happen to it. The company customer service reps are trained to say \\"I can't help you,\\" and they will not let you replace either the collar or remote, even if you offer to pay for it. So, if something happens to the remote, you have to buy the whole system again. That's a very expensive remote! Overall, in this day and age, to have a company so opposed to customer service is unbelievable. I will not buy any of their products ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Dog Helper!!!","review":"We have the wildest dog ever but this product worked. NO JOKE. He hears the beep now and he'll stop where he is running to and come back. We've shocked him a few times but now he knows not to run off. I never write reviews so you know this must mean something. Great product. Batteries last a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"The training collar WORKS!I have used the electric shock with my Cavalier King Charles twice, then there is no more need to use it. I just use the audio button, and he gets it right away. As a matter of fact, he understands that he needs to stop his behavior as soon as we put the collar on.I mainly got this collar because my Cavalier tended to bark too much. I tried using just the audio tone first, and he reacted to it, but didn't stop barking. Then I used the chock button on the lowest setting, and he reacted right away. He stopped barking and started playing with his toy or layed down instead of being overly excited and barking. I used the collar on him once when we were on a walk, but I forgot the remote control. He didn't bark at the other dogs and just minded my commands. When we dog-sat another dog, that dog stopped barking too as soon as I hit the audio button.I LIKE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How big is a small dog?","review":"After a few weeks of use I am happy with the product. My only negative comment is the the out of the box collar length is too large for a small dog (13 inch neck) and required significant cutting and adjusting to get it to fit. Beyond that its fine for close in, good weather use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews very helpful and on target","review":"I read the reviews when looking to purchase this type of product - to help with training and this product was exactly what we needed. Always having larger dogs and not needing this type of product, I was cautious in purchasing it. But my terrier responded very well - she didn't like the sound so we had her attention right away. I tended to leave the collar on and 'on' except when in her kennel, just in case of running off [the reason for the collar in the first place]. It has been a quick learning curve training the 'come' command, which she thought meant 'go ahead around the corner down the block and stay at least 20 feet away from me'. Now she understands English and comes when called. Worth the investment for my dog who is approximately 25 pounds and fast to run down the street to play. Now I am confident she will stay close and more importantly - safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product so far.","review":"Works most of the time, but have to make sure collar is tight so the poles contact the skin or it won't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Last -stop working less than a year.","review":"I had returned the first PDL training collar because it was using batteries like crazy. I had to replace batteries every other day. I finally figured that it might be defective, and contact Amazon. They replaced it with another one. The collar works as suppose to, but within another 5 months-it stop working. Though, I got a use of it because my dog is now trained not to go too far into my neighbor yard. I was hoping I can use the same one for my new dog, but it stop working less than one year. I will be looking for another dog training collor, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"batteries are COSTLY","review":"I have had two of these collars for probably 1 1/2 - 2 years now. I had just one - for one of my 4.5 lb. Yorkies. They bark at the wind! Then I got a second one and labeled them and the remotes - so I could correct the one that 'barked' when I needed to. The batteries died over and over and over again. It was pretty expensive - but what is the alternative?? A citation from the city. Now the collars are not really working at all - have sent them in for a lifetime warranty repair - will probably be $40 per collar - but don't have any alternative. They have to be controlled with the barking and barking and barking.Find a better brand and let me know where I can get it!!!! Please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for small dogs","review":"Although this collar does what its designed to do, the collar design is very poor- esp for little dogs. The antenna is attached to the inside of the collar and thus, on small (less than 15 inch neck dogs) you CANNOT get the collar clasp flatly closed and cut the collar to fit properly.Also, the on/off switch is on the front of the collar where it could be easily hit/bumped off by a stumble or wrestling with another dog.The remote doesn't always work well and often you have to hit the tone only or stimuli button more than once to get it to work. There is also no way to tell if the batteries are getting low.Not worth the retail price of over a hundred dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big for a little dog","review":"We bought this collar thinking it was for a little dog and we have a 14 lb Italian greyhound who is actually quite big for the breed. The smallest setting is so big it could go around his neck twice. This product is more for medium to large dogs as it is long enough to fit a great dane with room to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stubborn Dog","review":"Well I know I have a stubborn dog, but man; I can't believe this didn't work for me. I have a Brussels Griffon and she is so finicky. She only obeys her commands if she feels like it. I like to take her and my other dog to the park and let them off the leashes but she never listens when I use the \\"come\\" command. She always either looks at me like I'm stupid or goes the other way. I worry because people drive too fast and aren't very observant of the animals around. The training collar worked for my other dog but I think I'm doomed with my Brussels. The collar has, however, worked as a barking deterrent. Yes!!In conclusion, the collar works but if you have a very stubborn dog you will need to be patient and do several training sessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This product claimed it had a \\"training manual.\\" It does not, at least, not in the sense of giving you any idea how to use the product in a humane way to teach the dog something. It just has a manual telling how the device works (ie, push the button to shock him). It also includes a little light bulb you can use to make sure the shock works-- come on, if this is so humane, it shouldn't hurt too badly to test it on you own arm.Also, Amazon said \\"better together\\" with a replacement battery, so I ordered it.

Poor battery life.","review":"This unit's range is no more than 30 feet, definitely not the advertised 100 yards. The batteries are the expensive lithium CR2032s which do not last very long. On top of that they are a pain to replace. You need a small (I mean really small, not your standard #1 cabinet, smaller) screwdriver to get the batteries out, and the the screws are not captive. Luckily I haven't lost them yet. The stimulation mode is adjustable and it has a beeping mode which is good. But again, with the limited range, it's only good in the yard, nowhere else. The remote uses a 9 volt battery which lasts long and is easy to replace, but it also falls apart if you accidentally drop it on the ground. Cheap. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continued problem with Receiver","review":"My PetSafe Deluxe Little Dog order of February 21, 20ll was received; however from almost the start, the receiver never functioned correctly.

It has worked quite well for my situation. I only use this collar in close environments for when i have people over. It works well within range, but the range is only about 20 feet. Sometimes when you use the warning noise it takes a few seconds to signal. After a couple of months the buttons have worn down and you have to push harder for it to work. I have not had to change the batteries yet, but this is due to only using the product for a few hours a day and turning it off. I have been pretty satisfied with it for my use.I would not purchase this product if you intend to keep it on your dog indoors and outdoors, the range will not work and it's not waterproof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for us","review":"This was one of the best things we got for our dog. We have a Jack/Rat Mix and he was out of control. Jumping on us, chewing on everything, stealing our daughters toys. We use the beeping 90% of the time and don't need to shock him. I tested it out on my arm before we used it on him. level 3 was perfect. Sometimes we just have to pick up the remote and he knows. I did buy this as a last resort. it's great. The batteries seem to run out quick but I don't mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons don't work","review":"I received the item as promised.When I put it all together, and then put the collar on myself first, the buttons (sound) did not work even thou the light flashed to indicate that it was on. It finally made the sound after pressing the button several times. I then put the 'dial' on 1 to see what the shock would feel like. It was only a little zap (after presseing the button a few times again)...hardly felt it. Number 2 did the trick, I even jumped a little, didn't expect it, since it actually worked on the first push of the button.I then went ahead and put it on my 21 lb' mix (JRT & Pug). I gave the command to 'leave it' and then pressed the 'sound button'. After pressing it again a couple of times the sound finally worked. My puppy just looked around, since now she was already on to sniff at something else. After a few try's I finally took it off my dog. The delay of the sound button was enough to drive me crazy. I'm returning the item today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after first week","review":"Worked great for the first ten days or so.

There is an excellent overview on why this common test is a necessary event for every newborn (beginning on page 21).

Just be sure you know how to use it, so you don't waste tape with typing the wrong letters and/or the wrong size font."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive Tool for Making High-Quality Labels","review":"The Brother PT-65 is an excellent tool for creating labels without breaking the bank. I was inspired to purchase a labeler after reading David Allen's book, \\"Getting Things Done.\\" I use this labeler about 3-4 times per week to label filing folders at work. The label output is long-lasting and easy to read. The labeler is a bit loud when printing, but that's secondary. I also wish it accomodated an external power supply, but the batteries have lasted for over 3 months without any signs of wear. The unit is selling for $20 at the time of this review, so how can you go wrong? I highly recommend this labeler to anyone looking for a home- or small-office labeler on a tight budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I've had my P-Touch for a couple of years. I use it mainly to label keys. I used to stick on a tiny label and ink on the apartment number. Inevitably either the label would fall off or the ink would smudge until the identification was no longer legible. The P-Touch produces a label that stays on and remains legible. Bravo!My complaints: As has been noted elsewhere, the backing is not easy to get off the label. You need nails of a certain length to pry it off. My second complaint is that if you print a short label \\"6FW\\" for instance, and need to fit it on a key, you end up cutting off half the label as the letters themselves take up only 40% of the label. This is a minor complaint and admittedly somewhat specifc to my usage of the labels for keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to read the directions","review":"I love it when I can pick up a product and start using it without reading the instructions! I have yet to read the instructions and it is really easy to use. Great for the office for lables, etc and at home if you're as organized as Bree Van De Kamp on Desperate Housewives, you can lable to your heart's desire.A few notes: They have various lable tape colors. It's not as cool as you'd think. I really like the white. Easier to read. I've tried a few others and I'm not all that pleased. Also, it would be helpful if they'd make a \\"super-sticky\\" version of the tape. If the surface you're applying it to is rough or at all porus, you'll have trouble. No hesitation however, about recommending this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labeller died - twice!!","review":"Bought the first one in 2006. Usage is very low as we use it for labelling kids' text books at the beginning of the year. Don't know why the unit stopped working in 2008. The Brother service centre said that the lifespan is considered good (give me a break!).As we have 4 rolls of tape, we decided to stick with the same brand and bought a 2nd unit shortly thereafter (not worth repairing the first unit). The 2nd unit just died last month - the LCD showed gibberish running about and then it stopped functioning altogther. Changing batteries didn't work.In addition, the metallic blue and pink M-tapes became spotted with small black dots in about 2 years, rendering any printout unreadable. I give up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied!","review":"First of all, I also had the initial frustration of trying to seperate the label from the sticker, however, I quickly learned that instead of trying to hold the label/sticker in your hand and try and seperate them with your finger nails, just hold the label against a flat surface (i.e., your desk) and with your finger nail just press down and pull apart - very easy (hope that helps).Great product, very easy to handle and type with your thumbs - you quickly get used to the keyboard. The labels are about $.../pack so keep that in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good economical labeler","review":"This labeler is cheaper and easier to use than the previous labeler I had. The tapes [don't] cost [much]and they come in single packs. .... The labeler is small and easy to store and carry. The only real problem I have is the labeler tends to bind up for no reason. But unlike, the other labeler I had it is easy to fix but it causes a lot of waste. There is only black ink tapes on various color backgrounds available. I have not found any Black on clear. I use the labeler mainly for my video collection and I prefer to use black on clear. If you do a lot of labeling it does create a mess. I also use the label for my files as well as labeling my audio CDs that I have created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to replace it twice","review":"The first machine I had would print in only one size.

Once you get the hang of how to change the different styles you'll find yourself labeling all you stuff. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because it needed 6 AA's to work, I wish they hade an adapter for it. If you do end up buying it make sure that you get some extra labels if you're going to do a lot of labeling. I also found it easy to get more labels at my local Staples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool.","review":"This little baby works great for labeling just about anything. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, the print options are pretty good for an inexpensive machine, and print quality is superb. The only thing keeping this from garnering 5 stars is the printed label backing. Although it sticks great to just about anything, it can sometimes be a challenge to remove the backing from the tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"So far this is the best book in the series.

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is #7 in their \\"Left Behind: The Kids\\" series of novels. Grounded in evangelical/fundamentalist Christian theology, the book continues the story of a group of young people living in an apocalyptic near future. The book's heroes continue their resistance mission while world leader Nicolae Carpathia continues to consolidate his new world order.\\"Busted!\\" shows some of the flaws of the other books in the series. The dialogue is stiff and corny; many characters and scenes seem a bit forced. A significant theme of this story is the conversion of Jews to fundamentalist Christianity. I found the tone of the Jewish-related material in the book to be patronizing and paternalistic. Still, the story held my interest and did contain some intriguing elements. In some ways, it's like a good old fashioned dystopian sci-fi tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"I wouldn't even give this CD one star!

Additionally, they don't work well on computer monitors (at least, not mine).I prefer lens cleaners to be a little damp - enough to wipe away the oils and grit that get on eyeglasses - and smooth enough to avoid scratching the non-reflective or anti-scratch coating on most modern lenses. This product just didn't fit the bill. I've used others that were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bausch & Lamb Pre Moistened Lens Cleaning Tissues","review":"I really like them.

They aresanitary (individually wrapped). They are the perfect right size. They have the perfect amount of moisture to clean the glasses, but then it self-dries. They are perfectly made for glasses, lenses, etc., and will not scratch. (Never use tissue on glasses, as that will scratch them.) They do a perfect job on cleaning the glasses. They are small and convenient. I leave some at home, and take some to work.They are not only good for eye glasses, but also good for CDs, computer screens, camera lenses, etc.Perfect for everybody. Even if you don't wear glasses, everybody either has a computer screen, some CDs, and/or a camera lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for cleaning glasses","review":"These are too wet to clean glasses.

I also enjoyed the illustrations, so colorful and bright. I would certainly recommend this book to children as well as some women. This book shows perservence and creativty.

Have you ever seen a movie and enjoyed an actor or director and wondered what other movies the director or actor has made?

This book relives that Inner Passage voyage with the Spirit of 98 brilliantly. Each town is described excellently. Mystery was inventive. I recognized so many real people in this book. The author must have enjoyed writing this immensely and it shows. A wonderful series. Got out all my pictures from that voyage to enjoy once again.

This did not disappoint. It has all the good things I love about Jack - - his sense of right and wrong, his code of ethics, his sense of humor, etc. as well as a touch of the \\"supernatural\\". I liked the story as well. What was really interesting, not that his \\"Repairman Jack\\" thing is not interesting, but situations happen that cause Jack to really think about how he wants to live his future and what the future holds for \\"Repairman Jack\\". Despite the introspection, the book is filled with excitement, suspense and new as well as old characters.

Lots of the pages seem to be filler material to allow for a similar ending.Might be worth your while to save your money or check it out at the library. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yip, Yip Hurrah","review":"Harburg was arguably the 20th century American musical theatre's preeminent lyrical elf. Yet he was a sprite with purpose, motivated as much by anger as joy and possessed of a social vision that matched his peerless gifts for whimsy. Not even Ira Gershwin can quite compete with Harburg at his most felicitous. (Could anyone but Yip have written, \\"But I could show my prowess/Be a lion, not a mow-ess\\" for Bert Lahr?) This little gem of a book is one of two Harburg compiled before his death. The other, \\"At This Point in Rhyme,\\" is the more overtly political of the two, published as it was in the Watergate era, and is just as wonderful. Until that great come-and-get-it day when Robert Kimball gives us \\"The Complete Lyrics of Yip Harburg,\\" this will do nicely as an appetizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing yet absolutely worth reading","review":"i have only read the 2nd volume of <<La Preuve>>, but it was enough to see that Agota Kristof is a truly one of a kind writer. i loved the character Lucas because of the refreshing way he seemed to be almost emotionless, acted completely on his mood, spoke with factual, to-the-point sentences, and how he was extraordinarily intelligent yet never thought so of himself. many parts of the book disturbed me quite a bit, especially the relationships between some of the characters. however, the cruel, sickly despressing reality of the world during war and bare human nature shown through the book is inspiring, and thought provoking. the plot was complex, and full of unpredictable twists. overall a great, unusual book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good chrismas movie","review":"I collect Christmas movies, but I am very selective in what I collect.

The personal stories are generally pretty entertaining, from the Mexican gigolo to the homosexual couples. Sometimes they go a bit too over the top. Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting style comes across as trying too hard. It's never really clear what her characters motives are, except for being as obnoxious and sleazy as possible. Overall,3.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Win or Lose","review":"I usually write a review of a movie if it is exceptional, or so bad I feel the need to vent. This movie falls into the latter category.I have watched alot of 'artsie' movies as of late and have liked quite a few, Broken Flowers, Closer, 21 Grams to name a few. This movie tried to reach that artistic note but came off as pretentious and vulgar.The story line is weak. It tried to be clever and filled with witwhich made it embarassing. Kind of like someone telling a bad joke, they laugh but know one else does.My previous reveiw of this movie was not posted here. Due to the subjects I wrote about. Well those subjects are what this movie is about so I won't mention them again. If you are into mindless vulgarity, and plotless stories that think they are clever you might enjoy this.

I also have to recommend from PBS \\"The American Experience/The Donner Party.\\" Angelo composed for that video also and the music is again stunning!

Unusual movie (dark, mysterious, sad) with the most beautiful soundtrack EVER, ANYWHERE! Actually, taping this for myself (tape = old-fashioned and PROUD OF IT)) I left out several tracks... okay, okay, the final tape is 13 1/2 minutes out of 36 1/2 minutes, but WHAT A COMPILATION. It's worth buying, just to whittle it down to tracks 1,4,6 and 10. You won't be sorry when you play this overwhelmingly erotic 'reduced' version. So haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This cd is worth getting just for the signature theme piece. It's a striking, sumptuous, foreboding piece of music.

One of the most bautiful scores ever, and listeneres are lucky it's avaialble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Knight Rayearth...the magic of classic manga","review":"The 6th and final book in the Magic Knight Rayearth series is truly the most touching, and beautiful!

Volume 3 reflects a transitional period for Popeye in which he is relegated to nothing more than a hen-pecked fall guy. Even the animation appears to have suffered from the studio cut backs. From my personal view point...don't waste your money on this set unless you are interested only in the historical aspect of this pooped out period of Popeye's pathetic performance. Stick with Volume 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAR!","review":"I received this set as a Christmas gift and just finished watching it.While many of you may be offended by the \\"politically incorrect\\" replications of the Japanese and German characters in some of these cartoons, you can only imagine how people felt back then after Pearl Harbor was bombed, not to mention the impact of WWII on everyone (if you haven't seen it I strongly recommend viewing the Ken Burns documentary called THE WAR, which you can find elsewhere on Amazon's site).How did YOU feel after 9/11? I'm guessing that's how everyone felt back in the early 1940's also. But instead of Osama it was Hitler and the Japanese! You can't imagine how people in theatres just loved seeing Popeye \\"take care of\\" the enemies as only Popeye could do!If you want to see the seldom (if ever) seen war classics, buy this DVD set.If, however, you're looking for the more common Popeye episodes you may be more familiar with (with Wimpy and more of Bluto), check out Volumes 1 & 2 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for lifting","review":"Great stuff for lifting if your gym does not allow traditional chalk.

I have no idea who thought this was a good idea to market to little kids. The characters all hurt each other, launch each other into buildings, or hit each other with mallets while a voice over says \\"Oh no, My Melody has an owwie now.\\" It is incredibly disturbing.

It does contain some useful information here and there, but minimum at best. It is a helpful tool for realizing some of the underlying reasons behind the compulsive desire to eat, so it is not all a loss. However, it would have been nice to read more about how to overcome the problem. That section is rather small, which I find most important. The book is also filled with typing errors, which can be pretty annoying after the first 5, and you're still counting.

The book is definately good, and the DVD that includes video instruction and extra tutorials is great. Having read a great many other Photoshop books, I'd say this book did a decent job of covering the standard tools, but not a great job. That would be my only negative comment, and don't get me wrong, the book is very worthwhile. It's great to have a book focussed on preparing material for video.

I also got to see birds, squirrels, and cats wandering across the field of view.The main drawback of this camera is that it has a narrow field of view.

I obviously needed a bag for boots and gear and a seperate bag to check for my skis.The Dakine 60/40 was huge and could hold 2 pairs of boots (alpine and tele boots) and plenty of gear. At the last minute I decided not to take my free-heel gear and removed one pair of boots. This bag is advertised as being able to split into two at the airport and have two checked bags. However, three bags has a greater charge than two over-weight bags. I was stuck and had to pay the extra money when I was at the airport.I came home to check the specs on this bag 14 pounds. The total allowable weight for most airlines is 50 bounds. That leaves only 36 pounds for clothes and gear.If you plan on using this bag for airline travel, be cautious, the bag itself is too heavy and most often is not convenient (or even an option) to split it in two."},{"rating":"2","title":"great surrealistic prose poems","review":"These short prose poems are completely startling and odd, unlike most faked suburban surrealism from writer's workshops, these have a rough great edge.

Somehow he's able to put just the right amount in each chapter this time.Furthermore, North has been able to include in this book chapters in spectroscopy and radio astronomy that I've not seen in other books of this type.The only issue I have with the book is that some of his information now seems a bit dated. There is not much that can be done about that in such a fast moving field as Astronomy.

You have to read Dr Phibbs' book to learn that the command, with few exceptions, did not live up to the courage and common sense of the troops who took the fight to the enemy. You also learn that many of the problems we see today were related to a long history of prejudice and irrational behavior that existed despite what we want to believe about ourselves and forefathers.

I prefer Carreras and Baltsa and Ramey and the Metropolitian Opera who give a great performance. The movie with Raimondi and Mignes Johnson and Domingo and is terrific. Both also have great Michaelas. Both of these DVD's also provide French as well as English subtitles,and wouldn't it be nice if original language subtitles were available for all opera DVD releases.

She is just so brazen and sensuous and sullen...and she does great little theatrical \\"business\\" gestures, like picking lint off her dress. She's Carmen as a woman in charge.

The syrupy sound track and obviously non-outdoor sets were annoying, but no different from what was standard fare at the time. The cast is excellent.The omission of the older brother Howard was rather startling, but understandable. In the story, Howard was present in almost all the scenes where the whole family was together, but never was brought forward as a major character; the sibling rivalry was more implied than shown, other than in a few scenes. Howard would have had very little to do in most scenes unless they added dialogue, and the little girl who was substituted could be included in scenes or not.Gave it four stars, and recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"Iremember these shows when my kids were little.

The mysteries pulled me to the next page and the next. The Cavern of Forming and Learning and what occurs ithin it caused me to want to go in search of such a place for myself! In the end, I didn't know whether to think of it as a metaphysical treatise or a trueadventure of what really did happen to our dragons.

You can add your own source code to that project (or a copy of it). What makes the book so interesting, are the given 101 well-explained examples. Together with a large number of instructives figures, they build up a geometry book about kinematics, projective geometry, differential geometry etc. This seems to be a missing link between theory and programming practice. I recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money - a very bad book","review":"Don't waste your money. This is some of the most unorganized, poorly commented code I've ever seen.

It has six original, \\"frightful\\" fairytales that are very much in line with the rest of Dame Darcy's work. If you are not familiar with Dame Darcy's work, but love traditional Grimm-like fairytales (a little disturbing, violent, and full of Gothic/Victorian charm) you will also enjoy this book. Aside from the wonderful stories, there is a generous amount of Dame Darcy's artwork. Almost every page has a black-and-white side-sketch or full illustration. Be warned though, these tales are not for the faint-of-heart - some greusome things do happen. The book is best read when you are alone in the house on a rainy day or up late-night by the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"The illustrations in this are nice ( if a bit uneven in their quality throughout the book) but the prose is what suffers most. The words seem strained and for the most part are a little flat, a little basic. The stories seem like they wold have been better condensed as simple comics or picture books. The artwork is the main draw (all black and white illustrations inside) but some drawings seem more polished than others. There seems to be a span of 4 years between some of the dates on the drawings so the quality isn't consistent with some of the illustrations appearing rushed and dashed out. I guess this book will appeal mostly to those who already like the author's previous comics, but for those who aren't friends or fans, this was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like it...","review":"My father-in-law gave me a copy of this CD this Christmas.

Its little mouth is red and open, as though ready to take little nips out of me while I sleep. The fur is kinda ratty and I did not care for the texture and feel. I replaced it with an Aurora calico kitty, much more to my liking. Also, keep in mind that it is a puppet, so it is not really fully stuffed.

If you're ordering a macro lens, you already know what it's for - this one will do the job brilliantly. At 70mm it's a little long for some applications, especially on an APS-C camera, (which brings your field of view down to the equivalent of a 105mm lens.) But in most all situations that's just fine and gives you a little breathing room with small, live subjects. If you're using it to double as a portrait lens, this one might be too big - they also make a 50mm in the same high quality EX series that might be better suited. (There's also a true 105.) The specs are outstanding - this is a very bright, high quality, low-distortion lens. Only complaint: the auto-focus can get confused in lower light situations, more so than happens with my shorter kit lens. (18-55) But some of these shots are best handled with manual focus anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculously good.","review":"The lens is solid, easy to use and ridiculously sharp at all f-stops. It makes my Sony cameras better than they were. I recommend it for people who need this focal length for their portrait and still life work.

The build quality really turned me off. I tried the Tamron 90 macro, better build quality, better optices for both macro and general use. Decided on the Nikon 105 micro with vibration reduction. About 300 bucks more but a world apart in build quality and optics. A truly professional lens. In fairness though, I have to say that for the money, the Tamron was OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel!","review":"This book is about healing and moving on past what happened on 9-11.

I thought that Kingsbury did a wonderful job, capturing the depth of people's pain after what happened to our Twin Towers.

Including pictures of many of the missing employees posted at St Paul's, where Kingsbury did research for BTM. So, if she wanted to locate a firm in the South Tower, why didn't she choose a firm that was actually located there? Or, make one up. She made one up for Eric Michaels.

After two weeks of a whirlwind romance, they are deeply in love and contemplating commitment. Jamie's initial feelings of guilt for being attracted to another man (besides her deceased husband) are true to life. But Clay is almost too good to be true. Not only does he fall for Jamie right away, he also treats her daughter like a princess.

It's quite well written, as faked stories go. All the same, it is hard to understand how anyone could ever have believed this story --- much less the Holocaust victims who wrote blurbs for the book jacket before it came out. And how the book was published in 18 languages is beyond me.The entire story --- of a 7 year old Jewish girl leaving her safe house in Brussels, wandering across Europe in search of her parents, and surviving in part with the aid of wild wolves --- is just incredible. That is, unbelievable.My copy cost only a few cents on a remainder pile. But it's worth even less."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUTHOR CONFESSES HER STORY IS FAKE","review":"This is a fascinating story. But it's not a true story. The author finally admitted that she made it all up. The truth is after the author's parents, non-Jewish resistance fighters in Belgium, were arrested in World War II, she moved in with some relatives who treated her as a traitor. This made her \\"feel Jewish\\" and she made up her story to feel better about herself. A shame, an insult and an affront to all those Jewish people who truly suffered. (But nonetheless quite a moneymaker for the author who, before her confession, got a judge to award her tens of millions of dollars from the publisher for unpaid profits from the book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be serious for a moment here","review":"Uplifting and entertaining though this story may be, it is impossible to tell how much of it is true. Let's face it, no-one has ever been brought up by wolves, beautiful idea though it is. I would love to believe that wolves would take care of children, bring them up and feed them, but they don't.There aren't any properly documented examples of wolf-children. It is an urban myth. Most of the \\"examples\\" can be traced back to some carnival barker trying to sell tickets to see somebody like \\"Pogo, the dog-faced boy\\". Just because a 19th century carny hustler says that a kid was brought up by wolves doesn't make it true.I'm afraid that Misha either has a faulty memory or is telling an untruth here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A touching story, but is it all true?","review":"The recent allegations against the truthfulness of Binjamin Wilkomirski's \\"Fragments\\" should make us hesitate to accept this story as completely nonfictional. It is hardly surprising that a tragedy of the magnitude of the Holocaust will inspire some accounts which are either fabricated or embroidered in ways that will appeal to a wide public. It is not impossible that Misha Defonseca survived alone in the woods, but improbable that she was adopted by wolves as she claims.

The truth has been revealed. Misha's real name is Monique De Wael and her family wasn't Jewish. She made up this \\"inspiring\\" story and presented it as authobiographical.

She's not even Jewish.Defonseca, a Belgium writer now living in Massachusetts, admitted through her lawyers this week that her best-selling book, \\"Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years,\\" was an elaborate fantasy she kept repeating, even as the book was translated into 18 languages and made into a feature film in France.\\"This story is mine.

This cd is a great piece of work, basically the only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because, although the songs are great, the whole disc does seem to blur together slightly, even after a month of listening. The production is superb, every band member is a master of their instrument, and the songs are filled with a complexity not usually found in punk. The songwriting is more polished and focused than earlier cds. Rather than just putting the same chords in a different beat, they keep expanding sonically, often abandoning traditional song structure and standard chords for something totally unique, yet still punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let The Yellow Cover Fool You","review":"Inside the hideous yellow cover you will find a treasure trove of insightful wit on painful reality. Best of all, there's no poetic garbage about protagonist Ned \\"becoming a man\\" as there is in every other movie, tele-movie, and Wonder Years episode about High School. Instead Ned Vizzini chooses to focus on real life as a New York Teen, and all the comedy, stress, and, yes, maturation (no matter how slight)that comes with it. With the yellow cover, you won't exactly achieve the brooding intellectual look in the halls, but you could always gift-wrap it with dark wrapping paper, or better yet, wrap it in a Subway map to show the book's true NYC colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"After reading this memoir of Ned's teenage years, Ned Vizzini has quickly become my favorite author.

As I read it, I could literally feel the inherent filth seeping into my very body and desecrating my soul like some sort of relentless, burrowing bug with 3-inch long poison mandibles. 188 pages of Mr. Vizzini's own personal rants, gripes, and disenchantments with the agonizingly meaningless life of a typical self-absorbed teenager gives me cause to think about what I'm having for lunch, lest I lose it. It's a lot like a rectal exam, but without the benefits. Vizzini's brainchild would have been better off miscarried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, Genuinely Funny","review":"\\"TEEN ANGST?

Yeaaah...","review":"First of all let me start off by saying that this was a fantastic read! I was not 100% sure how the book would be set up and when I started off reading it and there was like a collection of stories about Ned's life as things would happen to him, I was a little bit apprehensive. I have read memoirs and similar books before, but none that have been set up this way, now I ask myself why other books aren't like this? I loved it.You are invited to sort of \\"grow up\\" with Ned by living out his experiences as he really did. Being a teenage guy myself, I felt at times like he was writing about my life, haha. Nice to know other people go through similar things. It was a very personal book for him to allow to be published, so it was really like reading something special and invitation only! Such a good read, I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review courtesy of [...]","review":"It's pretty cool because there are little mini-stories in the book. Each of them are interesting. I loved every one, but I have to say that my favorite story was Cable Access Says No. It's pretty funny because I was like, did he REALLY do that? It made me laugh so hard. But what's really cool about the book isn't just how funny it is, but that it is from when he was in high school--like me. I guess it's just pretty neat to see that even your favorite authors had to suffer through high school.Anyways, reviewing an autobiography is kind of tough for me because I hardly ever read them. If I were you, though, I would invest in this one. It's so good I want two copies. It's so good I want to punch a sheep, for no apparant reason except for how good this book is.

The 57 (instead of Meyers' 50) topics are very well chosen, and the level of detail is excellent. Code examples, showing both the correct way and the wrong way to do things, are just the right length - complete enough to make their point, yet still nice and short. The items on equals(), clone(), and the typesafe enum pattern are worth the price of the book themselves.

The contents is well-thought out, Java specific, and thus very good. No fluff here, and it does live up to the expectations set by C. Meyers! It won't turn you into a Java guru (for that, you need to know the core libraries very well - collections, networking, threads), but will move you in that direction quite a bit.I loved the sections on Methods Common to All Objects (an equivalent of the 'canonical form ' in C++), immutable objects (author presents coherent reasoning behind them, it got me thinking and I saw the light!) exceptions (this is a very pedestrian topic, the advice is excellent and time-saving).

It seems to me that there are some who had benefited quite a lot from reading this book and then there are those who don't.I would just say this: This is a good book. It's built upon sound principles. If you allow yourself to be taught by it, you would gain from it. But if you take on the attitude of \\"I have read tons of leadership books, you better impress me in less than two paragraphs or else...\\" Well, we all know what the outcome would be. The principle of humility and the willingness to be taught is mentioned also in the book.The most important thing is, now that you know the principles, go practice immediately or else you never really gain anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Superficial","review":"\\"The Servant\\" is certainly a best-seller in every country where it is marketed. However, the book is too superficial and its teachings are somewhat obvious, provided that serving is the very basic principle on leading others. Besides, all but everything in the book is not new, so that I had a deja vu feeling on reading it. Incidentally, many books like \\"The Servant\\" sell quite well and are not good (for instance, \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" is one of them). Actually, I purchased \\"The Servant\\" because of its reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor allocation of regurgitated ideas","review":"The only reason this book earns a second star is because the book chose good quotes and philosophies to review. This book could of been better had the Author left out all the characters in the daily classes and created a more personal relationship between the main character and Simeon where they explored Simeon's priciples deeper and with more theoretical applications and systems. But, it didn't and this book was painfully slow at times while on the tangents of the attendees of the leadership class. I really don't know how this book got such a high rating and waited for it to pick up the entire time I read it and it didn't. My opinion: Don't waste your time and money, stick with the classics - and this book it certainly no classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read = Big Impact","review":"This book is full of wonderful life relationship lessons.

I cleaned the book up a bit and began to read it at home. What an incredible book! I could not put this book down. I finished it in about 2 days. Now here is a benedictine Monk armed only with the rule of benedict teaching CEO's from various fields. The author came back with a profound sense of insight in human behaviour. He learned that a monk from 1500 yrs ago developed a system of living that bolds well for modern times.

The Cree chief (in the movie) speaks in English. The Canadian officer does not understand English. So his white interpreter (in the movie) translates the English into Cree. The officer replies in Cree which then has to be translated back into English so that the Cree chief (in the movie) can understand it.Apparently the whole movie is like this.

Their music became more mellow as the years progressed. Nothing wrong with that, especially given Karen's great voice. But I really enjoy this early album because it has more rock influences. I mean, the Carpenters rock in HELP. Even the ballads have a rock edge, like BABY IT'S YOU and REASON TO BELIEVE. Great CD. If I had to chose 3 CDs of the Carpenters, it would be: CLOSE TO YOU, PASSAGE, and LOVE SONGS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Richard has played around with the Carpenters catalog so much almost nothing today sounds like it originally sounded. Listen to the original LP of this album and you'll be surprised at the many differences in several tracks. Karen was forever redoing vocals, too (\\"Ticket to Ride,\\" \\"Merry Christmas Darling,\\" \\"Top of the World\\") so as the years passed the Carpenters were forever reinventing their recordings. That aside, this remains one extremely enchanting album with some memorable songs, vocals, and arrangements and a venturesome attitude. I've never understood Karen and Richard being saddled with sugary-sweet, square judgments. Every album they did took a step into new territory. Imagine where they'd be today.

Each of the 12 principal actors is very good (six as the young soldiers and six as their older counterparts). This is the kind of engrossing story that you'll never see on American TV. The violence of their captors is quite graphic, but the humor they use to survive offsets it nicely. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changi","review":"I have seen this first in the Hallmark Channel but never got to see all of it. It is an interesting depiction of the situation in the Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore during Woeld War 2. It is quite good, but can get dull at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tantalizing mystery suspence.","review":"Blood Marks was an amazing book. It is very suspenceful book without being gory. You never knew when the serial killer was around, or when he was going to speak. I felt as though I wanted to tell everyone that he is sitting right next to you. I read this book at two sittings. It's a book any mystery fan would love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"Just discovered this band 3+ years after the passing of Gene Eugene. What a loss!!! This is a great disc, the only complaint I have is that they left a track off of each album to make both of them fit onto one CD. I found a used copy of Dig and I just ordered it today. Homeboys is not so readily available. The songs are just wonderful, there is an honesty that is not often found in most Christian music. There are no rose colored windows here!! But it is an honest portayal of someone who struggled in faith to serve Christ, and I think that is a great testimony.PS. I picked up Homeboys finally (a few years back), and the song that was left off was No Regrets. That song is well worth whatever you pay for the original CD. I printed off the tabs and play that pretty regularly. I love that song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty and Power : Transgendering and Cultural Transformatio","review":"I felt this book gave a good understanding of the traditional versus modern life i the Phillipines.

However, it is a brief intro. If you need a scholarly text, go read Erhman's full NT intro. You must also read Donald Guthrie's NT Intro to obtain a balanced view of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"The book came on time and in perfect condition.

All my OneNote 2003 notes were imported into OneNote 2007 correctly. While I have not tried all the new features in OneNote 2007, the ones I have tried worked as expected. OneNote is a great tool for keeping notes. I use it keep notes on Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Photography, etc. techniques I find in books, magazines, etc. This have made finding a technique to use for a particular application much easier. I believe OneNote 2007 has earned a 5 star rating from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I discover this sooner?","review":"I just entered a graduate program and noticed some of my classmates using OneNote to take notes during class. I figured, what the hey, I'll give it a go... and I absolutely love this program. I am the type of note-taker whose notes tend to be all over the place. I also tend to take notes on loose leaf paper that I just can't keep together. Because of these attributes, OneNote is perfect for me. I don't have to go rooting around for paper, I don't lose my notes. It is also very easy to export and share notes - just download the PDF/XPS publishing plug in (free from Microsoft) and you can create your own PDF of the notes to print, email, whatever. Going on a trip? Put all of the confirmation numbers together, do a screen capture of the route from google maps, then publish everything as a PDF, which you can then print them out. Awesome program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well for my needs","review":"I use this to transfer my math and science notes into electronic format that I can save as PDF file, then download onto my tablet so I do not have to carry around three ring binders full of notes. It works great for that. There are many other features that I do not use that other users may or may not find helpful, but if you are looking for a program to organize your class notes, this will get the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Note-Taker Software By Far","review":"I have used & been utterly fascinated with this genre of software (\\"note-taker,\\" \\"outliner,\\" \\"free-form database,\\" \\"personal information manager\\") for decades. I well remember using the earliest versions of \\"Tornado Notes\\" & askSam--both of which were wonderful in their time; I've upgraded both of those apps over the years & have tested NUMEROUS other competing programs . . .And OneNote Easily beats them all. There is simply no contest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Product was received rapidly, exactly as described.

Stumbled upon this software a few months ago and now wonder how I ever managed without it! I work in multiple domains and information overload is a universal issue. So I bless the good Lord and the buddy who introduced me to this application every time I am trying to organize material.Very simply an electronic organizer with workbooks, section groups, sections, tabs and sub tabs, pages. Use them to organize your notes, emails, calendars, etc. into domains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Notebook","review":"Works like a champ.

It is double speed so if it seems like I am speaking outta control. LOL, I am. The main focus is Microsoft Office OneNote an amazing software that grounds the tablet writing experience. I hope you enjoy and give a good rating so I will do more. For the next review I will show actual drawing and painting via a couple of programs such as Corel Painter X and Sketchbook PRO as well as some games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Software BUT...","review":"I had issues installing this on Vista. More clearly, it didn't install on Vista. It installs fine on XP. The interface compared to the 2003 version feels smoother. For what I use it for, 2003 would have been fine for me. Greatest feature to me is the ability to print it into a document, so you could print it out at another computer without Onenote installed. Like on some campuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feist's Brass Age (He's got a lot of brass putting his name on it)","review":"Feist has written some excellent books, creative, complex, and interesting. \\"Faerie\\" and the \\"Magician\\" duology come to mind. This isn't one of them. This is a shallow, cartoonish coming-of-age/revenge plot that exhibits the worst excesses of fantasy today. Feist got comfortable here in Midkemia and hasn't done much that's worthwhile since then. If you want to learn about fantasy, find something that is original rather than a pastiche of every easy cliche the author has run into. BTW, 1 star for this was high. There should be a rating that says \\"Give me my money back.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Talon of the Silver Hawk (Conclave of Shadows, Book 1)","review":"Although not as good (or even close) to the classic Magicain, Feist yet again secures his position as one of the best fantasy writers around with this first book in his new series.Our young hero, Talon of the Silver Hwak, returns to his village to find his family being murdered and his home being burned. He survives the massacre and his the last of his people. From here on Talon knows that his life is in the hands of the man who saved him as is custom with his people, he owes him the life-debt. Talon has now a new life and in this life he is trained to be a dangerous man, for his carers feels he has something special. A young boy from the mountains soon becomes a man with abilties beyond his thought in his old life.Talon of the Silver Hawk is very well written with fantastic clarity from Feist, he a once again justified himself as one of the best. This book is a excellent read and the series has all the making of a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the place to start the series, but a good continuation!","review":"This new series had a strong opening and focuses on a new and quite likable character. The geographic focus has shifted as well - and since I am reading this on the Kindle, I do wish that the maps from previous books showed this area in a bit more detail. And though series staple characters like Pug, Nakor and Miranda made cameo appearances (and Rupert Avery even has a book written about him... though the exact timing of this seems a little skewed...).Still, this was an interesting continuation of the series, but as a starting point, I think that the shadowy, evil enemy would not be enough to keep me reading, since a lot of this is buildup from previous novels. Faithful readers know more than the main character, which would be off-putting to start the series here.Though entertaining, the plot was less complex than some of the other books, and I remain curious to see where this trilogy goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"I must admit that I never got into Feist's fictions because they seemed the same old thing but maybe it's because I never pressured myself into picking it up and giving it a chance. This book, I did and I'm glad I did too. This book intriqued me and had me laughing during every page. I also admit that I didn't enjoy his many \\"conquests\\" with women. For once, I would like to read about a man who doesn't just think of women as game. Nevertheless, this book took the reader and carried them away into a land that was full of shady people and changed an ignorant boy into a deadly weapon against evil humanity.I do recommend this book to anyone who likes to get their feet wet in battles and twisted in a plot of a vengeful spirit. Talon is one of those people that you love to hate and you hate because you love him. He's a great character!!I can't wait to get back to the U.S. to get the second book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read one of his other books","review":"Feist has written some good books, this isn't one of them. In the intro he writes \\"thanks to my editors who watched me burn the candle at both ends to get this finished and kept me upright and moving forward.\\" It reads like it was written just to get it get it done, there is little art or magic, just prose and a plod to the finish. If the series interests you, read the synopsis in some of the reviews and skip to book two. I promise you won't miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I was a big, big fan of the original RiftWar series and the Empire series co-authored with Janny Wurts, so I thought I'd check out what Feist had written recently. I now wish I hadn't. To be blunt, I was disgusted by this book and couldn't finish it. The writing is good enough, but the whole atmosphere is nasty.The whole book reads like a long S&M; fantasy. Talon is a hopeless character who is constantly used and bullied by the people around him, the supposed \\"good people\\" in the world. He doesn't stand up to them, rather he seems to think it is his place to be put down and humiliated.I was particularly revolted to see Pug, a character I had grown quite fond of in previous books, acting so cruel and callous.I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A repeat in different clothes","review":"Is there anyone else who is tired of Raymond Feist's repeating of old plots and styles in new incarnations? The young-man- coming-of-age saga is getting to be grating, especially when one looks back to his earlier efforts and see that he is getting to repeat himself ad nauseum. It is my cross to bear that I discovered Feist when no one I knew had heard of him, and now that he is commercial, his work no longer appeals to me. But at least it is not as embarrassing as Krondor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great heroes journey.","review":"Talwin Hawkins is a great new character to carry the ongoing saga of Midkemia's struggle between good an evil forward. One of the strengths of this, the first book in a new series by master storyteller Raymond E Feist, is that you can jump strtaight into this book without having read the multitude of previous novels set in the world of Midkemia. Of course, if you have read all the books there are connections and references to past events which are satisfying, however this story does stand on it's own and can be read as such. If this is the case for you I am more than certain you will enjoy this book so much that you will want to search out the first book Magician and gobble up every delightful morsel of Raymond's genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 2 way radio at this price","review":"I just received my radios a couple of days ago and was impressed with the features at this price.

It's all very exciting (and rhyme-y), but they get through it safely in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaaaad Book","review":"I guess I just don't get the whole \\"Sheep\\" phenomenon.

Also, if you decided to rearrange furniture and move TV to a different wall it can be done in 5 minutes with this stand. Unlike if TV is mounted on the wall...The only disadvantage is that my Samsung TV has few jacks located in such a place that the mounting bar of the stand covers it. So, if you ever need to get to those particular jacks behind that bar it is not easy. So, I'd advise to connect your wires to those particular jacks before finishing assembly.Love this pruduct and will buy another one in black for my other room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall mounting is OVER RATED and PLAYED","review":"High quality finish .... my plasma seems to float in mid-air.

The book is a hodgepodge: the first chapter talks about general crypto algorithms, the second discusses finite fields, and only the third chapter is really about elliptic-curve implementation. (The 4th chapter is about crypto protocols in general, not really specific to ECC; the last chapter is about general implementation issues but, again, not about ECC specifically.)

It's a remarkable achievement in blandness, the producer seemingly doing all he can to muffle the effect of melody and rhythm, and for whatever reason the singer's now singing like it's his job rather than something he takes any enjoyment in. This is as definitive an example of music as a product rather than art as any teen pop star's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"on the bandwagon","review":"a couple of good singles and alot of filler. you will try to sell this cd in two years !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!!","review":"This book is awsome~ It has many tips from shopping to one ingridient masks.I tried some and they really work!Need a lift? read it!

We each took a different radio (some of them were even other brands) and we just tuned ourselves into the same channel and we kept in touch nicely, inside and out!

Well the first time we used it it flexed under my 2 year old's weight (30lb) when he used his hands to stabilize himself the seat ended up pinching him enough to leave a red mark and breaking the skin. This seat is now useless since when ever we are out in public and I go to use it he yells NO SEAT HURT ME... I did read the other reviews and it seemed there were many more positive ones so I took the gamble for us it didn't pan out.

It is too small for the large typical public toilet. It is flimsy and bends frighteningly underneath small children even if you push the traveler seat all the way back so it is supported underneath the back (as per the included instructions). It slips slips slips. I can't think of a single use for it. Even at grandma's house we would be better off just keeping a proper toilet seat there like the Baby BjornBABYBJÖRN Toilet Trainer- White/ Black.We have had much better luck in public toilets using theKalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Blue. The Kalencom is very sturdy and has good (but not perfect) non-slip grips.

It does not stay in place very well at all on elongated seats. You pretty much have to stand there and make sure it doesn't slip forward so the rear of the seat is not supported while your little one goes. A good idea for more sanitary bums and kids who won't sit on public toilets yet, but overall a flimsy, not-worth-it product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product for moms!","review":"This is an amazing product for anyone who is seriously potty training or who has recently potty trained!

I love the regular Cushie Tushie and thought the travel one would be perfect. However, the travel version has issues that I haven't seen others mention yet.

She refused to use the seat after the seams scratched her bottom and thigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all!!!!","review":"I thought this would be great for when we are on the go, WRONG!!

It would be easier to take a regular potty insert with us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This comes in its own carry case, is light and fits in a diaper bag. I used it for my daughter and then gave it to my sister to use which her boys. They haven't used it yet but it's fantastic for taking out and about, because after all you should be able to potty train on the go.

It's okay once she sits down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toilet seat","review":"Our son was right in the middle of potty training when we went on a 3 day vacation to disneyland. We bought this seat to take with us, and to have on hand when we leave the house. So far (we've had it for 2 months), this travel seat was worth every penny!

He still freaks out a little in public restrooms because they are so big and loud, and he's somewhat of a clean freak. This took the edge off. It was especially great in the hotel room.

I loved the idea of having a cushy toilet seat that folds. We only used it few times then the seat broke while my 3 year old was seating on it! This obviously wasn't made to hold more than 34 pounds (that's what my 3 year old weighs)! Couple of screws came out then the seat fell into the toilet along with my son. I don't recommend it for any kid over 34 pounds....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't But It.","review":"This seat worked a total of two times before collapsing & dumping my son in the toilet. Worst travel toilet seat, ever. I followed the directions, making sure it sat well back on the toilet when in use, but it still sagged every time he used it, and then it just folded inward while he was sitting on it one day.

Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought this seat for my potty-training two year old. I thought the plush seat would be comforting to him while learning to use the toilet in strange places. This seat is flimsy and unreliable. It has to sit back on the toilet and my son would have to remove at least one leg from his pants in order to accommodate sitting that far back on the toilet. It also folds in a way that makes it seem like it will collapse into the toilet at any moment (and one time it did!) I am throwing it out and buying a different one. It was a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"Here's the thing. It may work on some toilets but others it doesn't.

Love the concept but honestly not worth the fear of this happening again! NO WAY!!

The toilets in most of these restrooms are shaped just like this seat, only larger. No matter how much I try to put the cushie seat all the way to the back of the seat, it still slides forwards and almost falls in with my toddler's weight. The paper seat covers are a much better option and I do end up using them if they're there.

It is most definitely NOT secure on the usual public restroom seats. If you put it all the way to the back, the front two sections squeeze in towards each other and if you put it all the way to the front or in the middle, it shifts around just as much. One wiggle too much and the edge will plop into the toilet, along with your kid. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I hoped","review":"This seat was a lifesaver for awhile, but then it snapped into pieces. It is just not that sturdy. Also, I agree that depending on the size of the toliet, it is not always that secure.

The hole opening is very small, almost looks like it would work for an infant, not a potty training toddler. The seat with the step made by this company is totally different, has a wider hole and a cushier seat and fits very well on the toilet. But when you push this to the back it leaves a large gap in front and nothing supporting the front end of the seat.

I thought to myself, \\"how could anyone put a reverse picture on a book they're supposed to know about\\"? Unfortunately, the cover was only the beginning. There were reversed pictures through out the book. And as stated by a previous reviewer, the terminology that is used for several parts is so obscure, that I had to re-read several times to try to understand just what part he was referring to.

This color does fade more quickly than other darker Special Effects colors. Unfortunately, this is just the nature of the beast with many lighter dyes. It can be counter acted though. Apply to bleached hair. Also, refrain from washing your hair, particularly with hot water and/or harsh shampoos. When using this color, I rely on dry, aerosol based shampoos (such as Batiste) and a shower cap when I shower to keep my hair from getting wet.If this sounds like too much trouble for you, choose a different blue-based color (blues, darker greens, most purples).

His music fits the movie quite well. I bought the cd because I liked the songs from the movie. This is a great album. The songs are so pure and simple. They are great feel-good songs. It sounds like Peter Gabriel sings in the background on 'Lady D'Arbanville', although it doesn't say on the album. It does say however that he plays the flute in 'Katmandu'. This album was made back when music wasn't so complicated. It kind of reminds me of the way Nick Drake makes his music, simple yet perfect. Too bad I am barely discovering Cat Stevens now after all this time. Because of this album, though, I am planning on buying more from this amazing artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Low Point In Magambo's Career!","review":"I Don't usually trash artists or their CD's because, as a musician, I know how hard it is to put a CD together but in Magambo's case, I will make an exception. Especially if it will help some unsuspecting listener to save their money. Magambo's release is a little, INXS meets Steve Miller meets John Denver meets Donny Osmund. Magambo is all over the place with his music and none of it is very good. At best, he shows brief flashes of potential on the guitar only to drift back to mediocrity. He has some decent vocal ability, but fails to channel it on this disc. Whatever genre you prefer, you will be better off looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pretty!","review":"As always Kenzie is a 100% acurate purchase...excellent quality, true to fit, even nicer than the picture.

The solder included was worthless, the tips included were too big for practical use and didn't last more than one use. The plastic thing was worthless and melted immediately. The stand barely held the soldering iron in place. The cord was too small and I had to use and extension cord even tho I was right next to an outlet.

I've used it for maybe two or three hours, then I had to replace the standard tip with another, because the tip of it would no longer get hot enough to melt the solder. I made sure to wipe it off with a wet sponge while I was using it, but it didn't seem to help. I switched out to another tip, but the same happened within two or three hours as well. Even tinning the tip doesn't seem to help.Now I have to buy another one, but will make sure to buy a more expensive version with iron tips instead of nickel-plated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated","review":"UPDATED 4/17/2012. The tip is no longer usable after just three or four uses. The metal that it is made out of must be very soft, because it didn't like my brass sponge.

But, within 1-2 hours, the tip would no longer solder. I followed the instructions on how to tin the tip, and cleaned with wet sponge after each use.. But the tip turned black anyway and would not melt the solder anymore. I tried sanding the tip to remove the black, and that did not really work either. And, there is no way to find replacement tips.

The case also comes inside a little plastic box with Clifford's face on it, which was a nice touch. The stories themselves are cute, inoffensive, and contain gentle messages about sharing, playing nicely, and so on.While there are more Clifford episodes out there, this collection contains all of the Clifford I'll ever need, and it represents a good value for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Content bad quality","review":"My kids love Clifford and were very excited to get this video collection. The problem is that the quality of the DVDs is bad and it is shaky at best when playing them. I seems to go through cycles of dark and light with the dark periods getting very shaky.

It was reccomended to me by someone who works in a fitness store, when I was telling him about how i have chronically tight hips from running.With the exception of a couple of poses, which you can sit out or just attempt your best, the exercises are easy and relaxing -- this is not a workout, but an adjunct to one.

Having said that, it's amazing to watch, and I do use the section on hip openers, which just about anyone could use with some modifications. There is a whole separate disk on breathing, which I have tried twice but cannot get into at all. The subject spends the whole time with her head bent down to her chest, which just instinctively feels wrong to me. Guess I haven't \\"evolved\\" there yet, but don't plan to watch that any longer.

His musical range is what makes this album so interesting-he goes from the hair metal sounds of Scarlet Heart to the Satriani/Vai sounds of Winter Park to the classical Preludio in G Minor to the heavy hitting Creeping from the East.

You will waste hours punting around the Ribbon, trying to to figure out how to execute tasks you're used to doing in seconds.Worst of all, there is no way to configure Office 2007 to have the look/feel of Office 2003; you're stuck.Bottom line, Office 2007 is a disastrous product that has severely impacted my productivity.

They tried to make the options more \\"user-friendly\\", but for someone who is wanting to do more advanced documents, creation time is at least doubled.

What are the limitations of a non-commercial version? It really does little more than the word processor and spreadsheet that come free with Windows. This version is not compatible with Office 2003 unless you download an update from the Windows site. I can not do this download at work, so I can not work on documents at home and then continue them at work. There are virtually no significant improvements to this suite compared to the 2003 Version.

The product came promptly -- and we could not load it on to the computer because there was no product code. To get any help from Microsoft we would have to pay $49.95. We contacted Amazon.com who very quickly replaced the software, however it still has no 26 digit product code required to download -- So it appears that in order to load the product on to our computer we're going to have to pay Microsoft for service -- so we've wasted over a month and not saved any money.

One example, when I browse web sites, the computer frequently freezes; it is so bad that control/alt/delete freezes and I have to shut the computer down via the power button. Screen menus cover up existing screen messages so nothing is readable. I have downloaded updates; there are still irritating problems. I am astonished that microsoft has regressed.

Don't purchase this!Office 2010 is about to come out!Why waste your money on an outdated program? It doesn't work the same as the last version either and is a bit frustrating because of that. You used to be able to hit \\"Save\\" and it simply saved it on your desktop. You can still get it to do that but it takes a bit more work to do. If you are already running it in a desktop icon and you hit \\"save\\" it will save it again but it has to go to another icon location rather than that which you have been using. It may be that it doesn't work as smoothly with Windows 7 as it did with XP but in any case, just wait for 2010 to come out and deal with the inevitable frustrations of all new programs then rather than now and again later when you decide to update to 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to adapt to this after years of Windows XP","review":"Have been thrown by the new requirements of this software.

I still have trouble remembering how to transfer my information to my flash drive, and once I have done it, I have trouble finding it again. I do not find this newer version to be user friendly at all. In my opinion, they should have left it like it was. Newer does not always equal better. The worse part is that you can not get the older version at all anymore. They should offer both for those of us who just want to do the same work on their laptop, without a bunch of hassle.

I even tried to uninstall the pre-installed trial version of Office, then install from the included CD to no avail. Finally, a call to the noticeably off-shore-based Microsoft help center eventually led me to get another product key over the phone. After that beginning all went better.So far, luckily, the old function key sequences for short cuts still work. Otherwise, I would be lost in the new menu interfaces in each of these products.

As for the program itself, I prefer the earlier version. It seems as though, these days, the most important thing is image: it doesn't matter whether you can understand it--as long as it LOOKS chic. In short, the older version of Microsoft Office wasn't \\"broke\\"; I think they simply need to keep \\"fixing\\" it simply so they'll make yet more money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"limited access","review":"My biggest beef with this program is it only allows three installations.

But once I understood the logistics it turns out to be easier to use than older versions, particularly Excel. The ribbon concept makes sense...why look through drop down menus when the new version puts everything up front?Word doesn't seem all that different from the older versions, but perhaps that's because my needs don't put a lot of demands on the program. Similarly, the new PowerPoint is more flexible than older versions, and lots of gimmicks to play with (if that's what you want)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is all you need for home","review":"I had the professional edition, usually what i get, and when I saw this saying student I thought that it would be missing some extra tools etc. This is good not just for kids as others has been saying you can do just the same amount of work load and the profession and ultimate the same MSWORD, EXCEL, PP, it does not have outlook but if you dont use outlook not an issue, The others have publisher, accounting so those who use tht would be more geared for them. The graphics screen is all blue, all the icons are section all in little segments [ex. edit would have copy, paste,etc.. all in that section visible so that you can see and you hardly even have to use the pull down menu] BUt I will say at first a little confusing trying to find the icons you are looking forward so many added functions, once you sort the screen the way you want it, than everything is a go.

When the program finally lets me access it, I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find what I am looking for. I have better things to do than sit here and wait for a program to open up for me to use it. It is a pretty looking program but the older versions of Office are much better.

This may make it easier to the most basic of users to get started using some things, but for anybody that is comfortable with previous versions of office or needs more than \\"the basics\\" this thing is a disaster. The addition of OneNote is of dubious value unless you have a tablet PC, and the removal of Outlook leaves users searching for another solution or moving to online solutions since Outlook Express (or even the replacement Windows Live Mail) does not cover more than the basics.It is functional, and can do most of what you want it to do, but Microsoft Office Home and Student Edition is a serious misstep.

If you're strapped for cash or just don't want to spend $70-$150 just to do some spreadsheets, word documents, powerpoint presentations, etc. there's always openoffice. This is a decent product, but I'm always surprised at how few people know of the free, open source alternatives.

I am not sure.Because commands are so difficult to find, the software seems to have \\"much less\\" functionality than previous versions.

The few upgrades in the actual performance of the product does not offset the lost productivity of having to wind through the so called \\"ribbon\\" style of menus as compared to using the drop down menus. It is not just a matter of learning the new menus, but the lost time of using this new slow method everyday. While it is quite annoying when using all of the programs in the package, the frustration is amplified greatly when I use Excel because I have to use a wide verity of its functions and options. The more you need function rich use of MS Office the more it will slow you down. For this reason alone it is a step down from their previous versions and I hope any new versions of Office will at least give an option of using the drop down menus, if not I will investigate the possibility of replacing Office with one of the competitors' products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007","review":"This product, is not as easy to work with, Eg. the new tool bars? as far as locating the command I am looking for, Where is the on line help?, to me, version 2003 was less complicated, remember, more is not always better.

I often sign by hand (on my tablet) and fax documents I create. Previously, I had to print to windows journal, sign, and then print to pdf. With the inking features built into Word, I can sign to my document \\"directly\\", save it as a pdf and then fax it with fewer steps, all without using any paper.

The \\"ribbon\\" that appears when a tab is selected displays common and important functions, making it quite easy to find and select appropriate operations.

As a teacher, I have very little time and I need my software to work NOW.That said, the on-line help function is very good. You will need it. The programs are every bit as good as the older versions of Office and documents can be saved to older versions which is also good.

I have one computer on its last legs and barely working, one new laptop, and a new one I have yet to buy.MS Office 07 at $69 was a good buy (usually costs at least $79 and sometimes even more) and I'll not need a new computer (at a higher price) that has that program already installed so I'll be saving there.

You have about eight different menus to choose from and it is easier to find the list of previous documents you have used or created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Upgrade!","review":"Microsoft seems to be the company a lot of folks love to hate. However, I think they did an exceptional job with the Office 2007 upgrade and its a fine improvement over the 2003 version. The big benefits are the expanded toolbar (ribbon) and the real time previews. Both features save a lot of time and make for a nice work environment...especially if you have a good size monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wont find this for a better price","review":"I was working on Windows 2003. I guess I was used to that version and this one looks a bit different. Knowing commands certainly helped since I never found the print button. But you cant beat the price either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Office Home and Student 2007","review":"2007 version is different than the earlier versions with which I was familiar and comfortable but as I use the 2007 I find it fairly easy and well layed out.

And you can NOT return it to Amazon, whether it is opened or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken seal twice!","review":"Although I usually get great results with Amazon, this time was a real disappointment. I received the first order with the seal on the product box removed. I returned it and the second one also had a broken seal on the product box. I went somewhere else to buy and doubt that I will get software again through Amazon.This item, by the way, was bought NEW and direct form the Amazon warehouse, so I really expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Brother knows what's best for you","review":"For anyone who has been using Excel for many years (i.e. people like me who remember when it was called MultiPlan) - avoid \\"upgrading\\" to 2007 if at all possible. I'm sure there are some minor efficiencies that can be gained from the new ribbon interface - once you learn it - however, if you were just hoping to do things the way you were used to, you are out of luck. There is no way to opt for the \\"classic\\" interface. Microsoft apparently thinks that they know the best way for us to do our jobs and is forcing us to learn to do it their way. So instead of doing useful work you will waste time re-learning how to use spreadsheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"A screaming piece of garbage","review":"Consistent with the disaster that is Vista, Microsoft changed Office to a point where dedicated PC users are looking at Macs. Incompatible file formats from prior versions is just the beginning- the completely altered layout and moronic 'ribbon' make the program a nightmare to use. Only Outlook remained unchanged much. To add to the chaos, look at all the web postings about inability to even install this bloatware. It took forever to get this dog to work, and even removal is a nightmare. Stay away, this is Microsoft Malware at it's WORST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than prev. version; doesn't contain Outlook","review":"Why oh why did Microsoft do this? All the menus are hidden and keystrokes don't work. There is no \\"File\\" menu - you have to click a little round dot to figure out how to open a file. Keystrokes are not backwards-compatible. For example, in Microsoft Word I'm used to typing Alt-E, U for Edit/Undo. Now rather than undo it adds a U to my text. Very aggravating. The \\"ribbon\\" may look pretty, but it's difficult to use.You can install a free shareware addin called \\"Search Commands\\" from this website: http://www.officelabs.com/projects/searchcommands\\"Search Commands\\" makes excel bearable, but doesn't help much for Word.Outlook is missing entirely. If you want Outlook, don't buy this version or you will need to buy Outlook separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007","review":"Too expensive. Just think, most people in America have purchased Microsoft operating systems which is pretty much a monopoly, and generally buy others of their software and have made Microsoft what it is today. We have spent BILLIONS. They still break one off in us every chance they get. When will Microsoft finally give the public a real deal.....YEAH RIGHT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going backwards","review":"Microsoft has blown it this time. Forget about being able to customize toolbars. Forget about being intuitive. forget about all the training and practice you've had in office up until now. Microshaft has hosed the faithful with a new version that ignores all the good ideas that had become industry standard until now.To eat up a huge portion of my screen with useless \\"ribbons\\" that I infrequently use is crazy. When I need to change ribbons and then scroll down a menu bar when before it was a customizable feature that I could add to my main menu...whew.It's a memory hog, slows your system and does not improve production. You don't even have the option of choosing a \\"classic\\" look. Wasted my money, that's for sure. However, support will probably soon stop for the oder software so we are stuck. Thanks Bill"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke ...","review":"I am a novelist and have been writing on WORD since version 1. Every upgrade I have ever made of this product has been an improvement until this one. It is awkward to use, inconsistent in function, and requires constant fixes to both text and format. I am seriously considering an uninstall. If you have any version before this one, don't upgrade to 2007. If this is your first go at word processing, consider WordPerfect. Someone at microsoft should have said to the poobahs at marketing, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"Frederick Ramsay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid/resist 2007 until MS actually improves on 2003","review":"In creating Office 2007, Microsoft has tried way too hard to stuff too many things into the Office 2003 space, instead of streamlining and making the latter more user friendly. The Fluent User (FU) Interface is a chaotic jumble of stuff that is less than useless to the average user of Word (at a minimum) and the other non-Outlook components (2007 Outlook is a slight improvement over 2003). And, because Microsoft wants to drive you toward FU, the quick access toolbar (similar to the old 2003 menu systems) icons cannot be enlarged for ease of use.All in all 2007 is a massive software de-evolution, so let's hope that 2007 will pass quickly into the night and Team A at Microsoft can soon release a new version of Microsoft Office 2003 that's cleaner, tighter and more functional than 2007 will ever ever be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as claimed !","review":"Received product promptly.Supposed to be good for three pc's.

I've been a user of MS Office since its first issue in 1990 - and I still can't figure out what they've done to make the product any more useful to me in almost 20 years. Yes, it's gone from 5 floppy disks to almost a gigabyte - but formatting in word is still a problem, plus with office combined with vista, most of my pdf writers no longer work as they once did, if at all. very disappointing issue - i'm just glad i didn't pay 600 dollars for it, or i'd be furious. Message to Microsoft - IF IT'S NOT BROKEN - DONT MESS WITH IT. The old menus were intuitive and simple to use - i need to go back and get a ph.d. to learn this issue - if i didn't need this to be able to read things people send me - I'd literally throw it away - go back to the old menus which worked just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evaluating attempt to purchase software from isuntrust","review":"After sale of software, the seller issued as fake shipping notice with a nonexistant shipper, collected the money for the software and shipping from my credit card and did nothing else.

In less than 24 hours Amazon credited my credit card for the software andd shipping. Amazon has earned five stars for their role in this transaction.
