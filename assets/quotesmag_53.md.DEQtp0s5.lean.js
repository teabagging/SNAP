But let's move past that and acknowledge that \\"Green\\" is still a pretty darn good album. Labelled \\"sellouts\\" by many of their hardcore fans, R.E.M. managed the tricky feat of going mainstream without compromising their artisitic principles. Great songs such as \\"Orange Crush,\\" \\"Get Up\\" the untitled final track have plenty in common with earlier R.E.M. Overall, this is a solid album with some definite high points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid performance","review":"REM is pretty much the exemplar and paradigm of American Underground rock. They've pretty much gone the distance and stayed the course as far as rock bands are concerned, having been around for over eighteen years and are still releasing albums. In this case Green is one of their earlier albums, but that hardly means it isn't worth listening to. While many bands tend to experiment with disparet sounds and styles, as if they suffer from some sort of dissociative syndrome and can't connect with whom they really are, all of the songs on this album bear the distinctive stamp of REM's sound and style. While the non - rock historian and the non - REM fan may find little of interest here, most fans will find this an enjoyable and entertaining performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminder of a time long gone","review":"The music on this album perhaps does not deserve five stars. Doubtless, there are some absolutely kick-$#@ songs, but I think it deserves five stars more for what it represents as a sum of its parts. For me, this album harkens back to a time (even if it was only a decade ago) when a band could compose an album full of innovative and engrossing sounds and not worry about conforming to a norm, or concentrating on producing one of the three or four single kinds of music which is now played on the dreadful MTV. A band could compose something creative, different, perhaps take many chances, and still have an album be hugely successful. That does not happen anymore. Albums like REM's Green are the only memories from a once boundless musical time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The long dark fall into night","review":"After 5 of the greatest albums in rock history (Murmur, Reckoning, Fables..., Lifes Rich Pageant, Document) + pre-Murmur EP's and singles, REM started on the downhill track with this one. The songs are dull and offer no compelling reason to listen. Before this album, I would automatically buy the new REM sound-unheard. After this one, I had to think carefully whether it was worth the money - now THAT's green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring pop music from a usually fascinating band","review":"I am a big REM fan, and I advise new fans to stay clear of \\"Green\\". I'm also old enough to have been an original fan of the Byrds, the Band, other great acts with whom they are often compared to, and I can tell you that REM is more interesting, more adventuresome and more versatile than the Byrds or almost any of the '60's bands to whom they are compared. But not on Green. For newer fans who wonder what REM was like in the '80's, choose Murmer or Documentor the sort of Greatest Hits,Eponymous. Also,I have nothing against good REM pop music, and for that, I like to Out of Time, from 1991, which sold millions and deserved to.Green's \\"Orange Crush\\" is a good rocker about a serious subject. Otherwise, totally disposable. Sounds like they owed the record company an other album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst album by an otherwise compelling band.","review":"I'm a huge fan of REM, and have been for years, but this album is without a doubt their worst. Stipe is at his most pretentious, and the prosteletyzing becomes cumbersome, to say the least. Not a single redeemable song. I actually lost interest in this band for several years after the release of this dog. Two stars is probably generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this REM effort ...","review":"This is the second REM record in a row that disappointed me. I like 3 songs -- World Leader Pretend, Orange Crush, and the untitled Academy Fight Song. Many of the others are throwaways.Stick to Murmur, Life's Rich Pageant, and Automatic for the People."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major Label Debut and Transitional release","review":"R.E.M.'s first release on a major label shows the band to be bringing in all it's musical directions for one disc.\\"Green\\" was hugely successful, providing the band with it's first #1 single (\\"Stand\\") as well as FM radio hits \\"Orange Crush\\" and \\"Turn You Inside Out\\". Other tracks feature the arty scat side of Stipe's lyrics and the dreaded mandolin makes it's appearance felt here on several tracks.Largely overlooked now for unclear reasons, \\"Green\\" can be seen as a transitional release from the rocking, politically charged \\"Document\\" to the poppy disaster (but commercially successful) \\"Out Of Time\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh","review":"The worst thing is that some of these guys are capable, even skilled musicians. But it all falls flat. You need a PhD in BS to get any meaning out of \\"Orange Crush.\\" (Actually, you can get every meaning out of the song since the lyrics are nonsensical and vague). Stipe grunts/mumbles his incoherent blather and then expounds his \\"message\\" via interviews and t-shirt slogan. With so many artists out there who have something to say, why would you waste your time with these featherweight intellects diddlng simple riffs the Beatles made obsolete years ago?Stay away, unless you like REM and its souless egofest, then by all means, strap on a bib and dig in to a thoroughly incomprehensible meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun album","review":"The lyrics on this album are pretty dumb hahaha, but the songs are upbeat and soooo catchy. People make fun of me for liking this album, but I don't care, I love that song \\"Stand\\", I could listen to it over and over. Other very catchy tunes here too. This is the CD you take with you to the beach, the songs are very beach-y.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"just have something to add to my review","review":"One more thing- Micheal Stipe's lyrics, usually inaudible or cryptic or both, are actually relatively straightforward this time around. One exception is \\"Orange Crush\\"- I didn't realize what that one was about until someone told me it was about Agent Orange. Once I knew, it made sense(?) Still, it doesn't seem to be the most effective possible critique of the use of Agent Orange, although \\"Follow me/don't follow me\\" and \\"We are agents of the free\\" are good lines. My favourite lyrics on this album are \\"You are the Everything\\", and \\"The Wrong Child\\"- not terribly ambiguous, but very evocative. The fact that they are both vignettes from childhood might partly explain their power and appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precursor to Out of Time","review":"I would say that Green paved the road to Out of Time. It was a move to more popish sounds and catchy tunes. There is nothing wrong with that if it's done by R.E.M. They managed to include Mike's cryptic lyrics in some songs. This album doesn't grow old. It's a fresh beginning of a new direction for the band. One of my favs is World Leader Pretend. I would classify it as having good \\"old\\" lyrics and new sound. It's one of the most intellectual songs by the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasting Impressions","review":"I can still remember coming home from Camelot's Music Outlet when I was 13 with a brand- spanking- new R.E.M. \\"Green\\" CD in my hand. It was the first rock album I had ever bought. They say first impressions are lasting ones, and I have been a die hard R.E.M. and modern rock fan ever since that day. Everything about this record catches your attention- whether it be the bright orange cover art or the undeniable originality and quality pop flavor of \\"Stand,\\" \\"Pop Song '89,\\" \\"Orange Crush,\\" and \\"Get Up.\\" \\"Green\\" was by far R.E.M.'s best album from the 80's, and ranks favorably among the best efforts in rock and roll history. My only question about this record is why it was called \\"Green\\" when everything in the packaging is orange?"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't be put off by the tree hugging","review":"Denis Leary does a great comedic riff on one of the songs off another album (\\"Shiny Happy People\\" on Out of Time) which does hit home about earnestness and \\"saving the Earth.\\" And laugh as I do at it, this Green album is still so solid I never let that get in the way of my enjoyment.\\"Orange Crush\\" and \\"World Leader Pretend\\" still hold up today. \\"Pop Song 89\\" sort of is a forerunner to \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" in its guitar riff.Anyway, the REMulans were still musically relevant when this came out so this is a must-download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling it their best work may be damning with faint praise","review":"This is the only National record that does a whole lot for me, and it's mostly because of \\"Wasp Nest,\\" one of the few tracks not to be reprinted from one of their full-length albums.

Rush had seen it. I suppose I read more into their comments than was there. It is a rather slow movie, but then they needed to develope the theme which did hang together. I believe they were trying to demonstrate how absurdities in public life and politics become accepted and no one challenges them because of who accepts them. I do think they succeeded. But I kept thinkig about where I would have gone with the theme and they did not go there. The ending was one more absurdity on top of the rest with Gardener walking across the surface of the lake. He even demonstrates for the audience that the lake is deep by dipping his umbrella into it. But the meaning of this last action was lost on me.

I've seen it several times and I catch something I missed before. It is NOT slap-stick comedy, but a little tongue-in-cheek razzing of the \\"political establishment\\". Chance's never-ending kindness and caring about people are so endearing. Maybe the \\"simpletons\\" understand better how to be \\"true to yourself\\" than the rest of us.

At that point, the whole theme of the movie is realized: Is Chance walking on water? Some people in the movie thought he did--they built him up so much with with the ideals that they wished to see in him, so it would seem unbelievable if, by the end, he couldn't walk on water. If you thought that Chance, of all people, could walk on water, you must be deluding yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being There with Peter Sellers","review":"The film has to be seen, in whatever format you can get hold of. It is one of Peter Sellers' finest works and a great story. It concerns a gardener, who has lived his whole life in the confines of the house of a wealthy benefactor. His only contact with the outside world is a small selection of TV programmes. When his benefactor dies, he is thrown out into the world and his homespun, naive philosophy, ralted only to his gardening and TV programmes, strikes a chord with all he meets - with astounding results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sellers the genius","review":"This is a film to rent or see on TV before purchasing, its not going to be to everybodies taste. However in my opinion it is Peter Sellers greatest performance, beautifully played and understated. He had wanted to make the movie for years and put everything into one of his last acting performances. There is no other film with Peter Sellers in it like this one. There moments of great comedy, pathos and sadness all held together by a wonderful script (which won the BAFTA best screenplay).Of course it wouldn't happen in real life - but if films were only made about reality the world would be a much poorer place. This is a satire/fable on the ease with which an obviously mentally retarded man can rise to be almost the most powerful man on the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, blu-ray transfer so-so","review":"Great movie. Peter Sellers delivers an outstanding performance. The comedy is muted; the movie goes from being serious and thoughtful to screamingly funny (the \\"bear rug\\" scene with Shirley MacLaine for example).Regarding the blu-ray -- I found the digital transfer lacking. Specifically contrast, depth and detail (edge sharpness). The picture had a muted, washed out, grainy look to it that was, while better than DVD, not up to the level I've seen with transfers of other movies which are much older. One reviewer here mentioned excessive use of DNR -- I'm wondering if perhaps the master they had to work with was degraded and required serious work to make it presentable. Whatever, I am not an expert, just giving my lay impressions.Despite the lackluster video quality, still a great movie to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"being there dvd","review":"It is obvious that some portions of the movie were cut out on the dvd version of Being There which was disapointing to me. I don't know if the vhs version is the complete film or not, but I would have opted for vhs if it was a complete version of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Overrated","review":"I found myself waiting through the entire film for this genius to reveal itself. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Right until the credits start rolling over unfunny outtakes, which seem harshly less appropriate here than say, in Talladega Nights.Chance, played by Peter Sellers, is painfully disconnected, not within the narrative but from the narrative. He's a fortunate simpleton. I get it. Tom Hanks got it too in Forrest Gump. The difference is that Forrest is dynamic and likable, Chance is a roulette ball that rolls obliviously for 2 hours and never drops. But the movie is not about Chance. The star turns into the backdrop before which society plays the real fool. That's profoundly ironic, let me tell ya.It's slow, quite dated, and the extent to which the viewer is asked to suspend their disbelief is absurd. Would I sit through it again? As Bartleby said, I prefer not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being There","review":"This is a very entertaining (and cute!) film. Peter Sellers is outstanding as a simple man that is taken for a genius. A film classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most HILARIOUS films!","review":"This one really brought all the belly-laughs...just sheer absurdist delight! Yes the first 10 minutes is kind of slow but once it picks up speed you're hooked. Sellers' priceless deadpan, post-lobotomized expressions had me rolling on the floor throughout.This somewhat reminds me of Forrest Gump though it has much sharper and smarter satire about our political system, and our cultural and psychological biases.I wonder if Sellers had any idea that he was in many ways impersonating our current semi-retarded President (Bush Jr.) minus the country-bumpkin arrogance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being There (Deluxe Edition)","review":"This is a fantastic movie. I remembered it from years ago and wanted to see it again. I guess not that many people remember this fine movie, but it's well worth the trouble and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deluxe Edition? Bluff package!","review":"I don't intend to question the movie, which is excellent indeed. My rating is based on the fact, that this so-called \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is only a hoax, a bluff package.The only bonus material are the recollections of Melvyn Douglas' granddaughter (16 minutes runtime, intercut with scenes from the movie) and the trailer.Sorry, that's not luxurious, but simply ridiculous. Thanks Warner Bros. for another rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best endings ever?","review":"I read through every review and I cant believe that nobody really mentions the ending. It has to be one of the best, most unexpected and yet most satisfying ever committed to film. Just when you think that you understand the point of the movie and what his character is about - BOOM along comes that ending. Yes the movie starts off a little slow, and yes some of the humour is a little dated, but stick with it. The movie has a message and if dont get it, your probably not meant to. Peter Sellars was a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Moments in Comedy","review":"I won't focus on the obvious, the socio-political satire and brilliant use of the media as foil. Instead, I want to make everyone who is thinking about seeing this movie aware that it contains one of the greatest moments ever in the history of comic film. Sellers and Shirley MacClaine in the bedroom, the \\"I like to watch\\" scene, is one of the most perfect moments ever. Sellers is uniformly terrific, but MacClaine really steals the show in this scene.

Not too many films have this capability. The genius Peter Sellers is spot-on perfect and the rest of the cast is also quite up to the task.This is a different kind of comedy than the standard Hollywood fare. It is really best described as a satire, and it would make an excellent double feature with Chayefsky's \\"Network\\", which, like \\"Being There\\", seems even more relevant and prophetic now than it did in the time of it's initial release.Regardless though, if you want to see something with a lot more grace than the usual garbage coming out of Hollywood's film studios/trash bins then check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic you will never forget!","review":"In brief 'Being there' is one of the most interesting gems that world cinema has offered us. No, I am not a fan of Peter Sellers and I am hardly familiar with his works in the industry, but it was his presence throughout the film that made me just sit and stare at the screen. Mr Sellers as 'Chance' can be described as a plain human being, just like you or me and how he can inspire the world with just a simple statement. Fabulous performances from Melvyn Douglas and Shirley Mclaine, the two support Peter Sellers into making this film a priceless gem in the history of cinema. A simplified direction from Hal Ashby makes the film unforgettable just like his previous work 'Harold and Maude'. Dont miss this gem of a film, you are gonna remember it for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being There -\\"Special Addition\\" DVD","review":"Great classic that will resonate during a time when simple speech and true truth can pass by ones mind without realizing it. \\"Being There\\" shows the fragile part of life as well as the simple aspects of honesty and pure humor and satire that mimics life to its fullest, which todays world has forgotten.

He accidentally stumbles into the lives of a powerful senator and his lonely socialite wife (Shirley McClain). From there, his simple ways are misinterpreted as political brilliancy and he's pimped out by the puppetmaster senators into the media--a new possible candidate for the upcoming presidential election.

Virtually none of the classic sixties songs that we all know and love from the Original are played in the new version of the movie. It's upsetting really. At least I was a little confused.So basically, this is the Official Soundtrack of the new DVD version of the movie, not the original.

The story line is erratic, the acting passable, the editing alright, but you'll not be able to make sense of the movie at all if you've passed puberty by more than a few years. If you're tempted by it, don't buy it until you've rented it first - if you can sit through this drivel more than once, buy one of the used copies as cheap as they come.

But, overall, the movie was just boring. They tried really really hard. The special effects were top-notch, the cast was generally good (although their talents weren't used very well), and they at least tried to have a underlying moral message at the end. But the plot wasn't, well, INTERESTING enough.There's some action, a love story, and the average joe will probably be entertained enough to spend the $8-10. The violence isn't too bad for younger kids, and most teenagers will probably get a kick out of the action sequences. Adults might appreciate some of the humor (though it is used sparingly and not always with success).

Considering the capacity of these discs, I would of really liked to have seen the original cut of the film on there as well as the Gerald Mc Boing Boing shorts from the first DVD release.

Every comic book movie excluding the 'Spider-man' and 'X-Men' films have lived up to expectations. I was certainly surprised when I read quite positive reviews for the film. I picked up the dvd the other day to see what all the buzz was about, and I was pleasantly surprised. Director Guillermo Del Toro(Blade II) did an excellent job bringing this hero to life. Using the right amount of humor, action, and a great introduction film, 'Hellboy' was great. Ron Perlman was quite fun to watch, and it was nice to see this veteran actor finally land a starring role. While this film may not be quite as good as films such as the forementioned 'Spiderman' and 'X-men,' 'Hellboy' succeeds in all the right facets and hopefully del Toro can further the series along with a sequel. 'Hellboy' is worth checking out and even if you have doubts like I did, you may be surprised at how much fun this film is to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"america's critic","review":"hellboy was great straight outta the comic cool and neat effects hellboy was action packed and will be great on blu ray get this movie if u dont have it yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the movie","review":"This was an awesome movie...

The commercial was intriguing, and that was what brought me in. When will I learn? Cheap, and I mean CHEAP special effects, and the thinnest (literally a comic book) script.

Stay away from this waste of intelligence, money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great Movie... not","review":"I watched the whole movie twice becase my brother wanted to see it. I hated it. So did my brother. I thought the action was lame and boring. THe special effects if thats what they are were weird and not interesting. There is no moment of character developement. THe creatures weren't unique and looked like they were just drawn by a 5 year old. It could have had as great action as the great movie Lord of the Rings and i still wouldn't have liked this movie. Hellboy, is a rip-off and the biggest one alongside Van Helsing another lame film. I don't see what there is in this movie that is good. Usually in movies there is a joke you might not like but in this, there isn't one joke to laugh at. Or even crack a smile. Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"IMO, this film is like X-man and Spiderman but this one is not as successful as the other two. The story is neither attractive nor novel.

And I will also admit that it was better than I expected it to be, but it's plot was severely weak. The whole seven gods of choas locked in crystal and the keys and random freaks were all rather confusing and silly. And the best character, \\"Abe,\\" did not even get into any action after the first half of the movie, which was a great disappointment. If you're planning on going to see it, just save your money and rent it from blockbusters or something...trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing","review":"When I first heard about this movie, I was not impressed. But its opening seemed to generate some buzz, so I talked my 2 sons out of seeing Scooby Doo 2, and seeing this film instead. They seemed to enjoy it, and I was happy that the language was not littered with inappropriate words, sexual innuendo, and vulgar displays like so many other PG-13 films. If you are going to bring kids, be forwarned that some of the characters die in the movie, so it is not for the overly sensitive.It had good characters, plot, and effects. The movie was entertaining from start to finish.The reason that I did not give it 5 stars was the bad guys (humans and monsters) were a bit one dimensional. The hell hound was cool at first, but by the end of the movie it gets to be tiresome. The final climax was anticlimatical and cliche as well. MiB was a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy- Not worthy to be shown in hell","review":"Recently a lot of movies have been made or are being made based on classic comic book characters. My brother and I, being comic book fanatics when we were younger, went into this movie hoping to find another entertaining adaption of a cult classic. Unfortunatley, instead we walked out realizing we had just lost an hour and a half of our lives. Despite the excellent effects, the movie lacked to entertain. The dialogue reminded me of those cheezy \\"bad movie\\" stereotypes. I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. The plot and casting I felt portrayed the comic book well, but the deliverance of it was not even decent enough to be put on televison. BEWARE! Do not waste your money or your time on this boxoffice junk, unless you feel like making your own version of Mystery Science Theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already Hellboy Time?","review":"I'm extremely excited about this set! I saw this twice in theaters and really enjoyed the story as well as the bad guy, Kroenen. A great cast and great characters. I can't wait to see all the cool extras they have planned, especially the storyboard to screen comparisons that are real time side by side with the film. NICE!!! Hope to see some bloopers too, but don't know if that's going to happen.This is going to be a great DVD!Bring on Hellboy 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell hath no fury...","review":"A spawn from Hell, Rasputin, and Nazis! And its funny?! I was truly surprised and pleased with the outcome of 'Hellboy'. Fearing it was going to be a dark clone of 'X-Men', director Del Toro smartly focuses on the primary character. Probably becuase he is the most interesting, as said character has real human emotions (lovelorn, angst-ridden, and so forth).Moreover, the 'heavy', Kroenen is simply wonderful as the sheared assassin of Rasputin - rarely in film is a bad guy with no lines so fun to watch on screen (remember the 1st 'Nightmare on Elm Sreet' BEFORE Freddy was given cheesy dialogue?) Though not as dark as 'The Crow' and not as prepossessing as the last two 'Batman' movies, Hellboy successfully teeters between the two with aplomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy Blu-ray","review":"Apparently not all machines are capable of playing Blu-ray. None of mine were able to play this disk. Had to reorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful picture quality","review":"I like this movie although I would not say I love it based on the story. I picked it up thinking the picture would be awesome on blue ray. I was not wrong. As another review stated, the blue flames were brilliant. I really noticed the detail on Hellboys face. Sound was great. I noticed alot of sound I did not hear before. It is (or was when I bought it) one of the cheaper films on BRay and it was well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellboy, not your ordinary superhero.","review":"I went to see this three times. I never do that. In fact, I didn't really want to see it in the first place. I took my grandson, because he is a big Spiderman/superhero fan. While the continuity is flawed (people who are seemingly important to the movie seem to just fade into the sunset), from start to finish, Hellboy is a wild, escapist ride. Which is what this movie is, escape. Anyone who is looking for a cinematographic masterpiece will be disappointed. Try and see it through the eyes of an 8-year-old. We were all young once. This brings us back in touch with those days when comic books were one of our main sources of entertainment. This movie just simply rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why a devil?","review":"The bad thing is the good guy is a devil. He is a good character though. His room has a bed, posters, tvs, and a whole bunch of cats everywhere! The baddies include Rasputin- some evil guy, Kroenen- nazi assasain gets impaled but brought back to life, nazi lady- ???, Sammaels- Lizard god. The End"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"What a major disappointment. Maybe I expected too much from Guillermo del Toro, but is this the same guy that made the great Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, not to mention the at least entertaining Blade II. Why do directors always screw up their dream projects? This movie had one great character (the sardonic Hellboy) and one cool villain sidekick (knife wielding Kroenen) trapped in a clichéd story that never went anywhere. I think del Toro just got too ambitious and bite off more than he could chew, trying in vain to juggle too many things at once. Sometimes that is admirable, but not when the whole things turned into such a complete mess. There is a director's version DVD coming out later this year of course, but since it's longer and not shorter, I doubt it will stop the film from simply clonking along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Evil Hell","review":"First off let me say,I've never read a comic book in my life.I never found you had to read the comics to understand or love the films.And Hellboy was no expection.I never even heard of the comic book created by Mike Mignola (I'm sure some people hadn't heard of it too).Ron Perlman was born to play Hellboy,he was so perfectly cast has the half-human,half-demon..You just can't see anyone else play this character.John Hurt was good as Professor Broom,the man who raised Hellboy and I didn't reconize him at all,I knew lthe voice but couldn't place the face.Selma Blair who's an actress who sometimes really annoys me,but this time she didn't.Directed by Guillermo del Toro,whom turned down the chance to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to do this,did a great job and not really changing the story like most directors do with Comic Book films.If someone else directed Hellboy it wouldn't have been as great as it was"},{"rating":"2","title":"good comic to movie presentation","review":"This is a good science fiction/comic book movie. Even though the characters have \\"powers\\" its not like X-Men, it definitely carries its own plot. Guillermo del Toro has a great vision for this movie that makes people enjoy it even it they didn't read the comic books. His movies just keep getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Movie!","review":"Had seen this movie on TV a number of times, but never got into it till I happened to watch it on TV one night. I really got into it and found myself getting a kick out of it. I ordered the second movie and it's great too. If you like a camp action movie that's just a be different then you'll like this and the second movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree, the trailers are misleading","review":"Now, when I saw the trailers I felt that this movie was going to be a big flop, a disappointment, a let down, a, ah you get the picture. It wasn't though by any means. The movie, going along with the many comic based movies of recent, is just a good fun, and quality filled movie. Now it is not going to necessarily work your mental muscles, but it is perfectly okay to relax those every now in then. The characters are humorous, the plot is creative, and well, it is a movie that I personally would not mind watching again, which is saying something; take my word for it. If the Hulk turned you away from comic based movies then come back with this one, and it will charm your socks off. In other words, I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"READY FOR THE SEQUEL","review":"Okay this was like the first Batman as far as the mood of the movie, with added comedy!

You'll enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellboy","review":"The latest comic book adaptation to hit theaters is Hellboy, a non-conventional super hero played with gusto by the great Ron Pearlman, best known for his role as Beast in the Beauty and the Beast TV show. This time he is the headliner, thanks to del Toro who only wanted him.Hellboy came to this world as a result of a Nazi plan that was thwarted by the Allies. Raised by American scientist Professor Bruttenholm (Hurt), Hellboy grows up as an agent of the FBI's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, bumping back against the things that go bump in the night. When the bad guys return to bring evil gods to Earth and start armageddon, Hellboy and his band of \\"freaks\\" jump into action.Filled with action, humor, and special effects, Hellboy is an entertaining experience, even for those who never heard of him before (like me). Great excapist entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another second rate comic book movie.","review":"Yes, the art direction was first class. It moved along well, the acting and tone was perfect for a comic book movie. BUT, what the heck was the plot all about? Who needed Hellboy? Everybody could have knocked off early and gone out for a beer if they just let the character with pyrokenesis fry the baddies in the first place. And, the ultimate demon from the darkside gets taken out with grenades? Talk about the ultimate anti-climax. Who knew that the forces of evil were such a light load? Another second rate comic book movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perlman's Chin wins the award for best supporting actor.","review":"The only reason to watch this movie is to marvel at the enormous magnitude of Ron's Chin.

So why is it so bad? The story line is just lame!!!! It is not even simple to follow, it just seems to be a load of pointless action scenes.

I've actually seen the movie, unlike some people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time & money","review":"I'll admit up front, I never read Hellboy comics. Still, when I saw it today, I was immersed in the story & characters. Beyond all the fighting (too much CGI, as always, Del Toro!), and the \\"All I want is to fit in\\" schlock that actually works, there is some character development that has lacked in other comic crossovers (X-Men, Spider-Man, etc...)Major positive points: WOW! Ron Perlman was fantastic! Perfect blend of \\"tough-guy\\" along with the uncertainty of an over-protected adolescent. The backstory was EXTENSIVE, but worth it. Great solid supporting cast. Del Toro's fascination with horror and the almighty BOO! pay off a few times, though of course there is lots of goop (a la Blade 2).Overall, I have to sum this up by saying:I am going back to see it again within the next 3 days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice way to waste your money","review":"Okay, I hope that if you plan on buying this copy of the film, you haven't already bought the special edition.

But still why do the studios feel compelled to release the director's cut when the special edition has been out for 3 months? Because they're all about the money.

Ron Perlman is the best thing to happen to comic books since Stan Lee. He plays Hellboy like he was born to do it. Selma Blair is fragile and delicate just like you would expect her to be, but oh man.. Don't make her mad. I think the coolest thing in this movie tho, is Abe Sapien. He is just awesome. Hellboy is proof that the monsters aren;t always the bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy is a Soulless Special Effects Orgy","review":"This movie's target audience is 14-year-old boys. There's no question about that. It's packed with special effects, weird characters and plenty of over-the-top action. It's also packed with corny dialog, mediocre acting, and just about every action movie cliche you could think of. It could easily be called the Masters of the Universe of the 21st century. Lots of window dressing and not much else. Oh, and what's with the fey fish-man? Very disturbing. Rent before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL GOOD 4 and a half","review":"I really enjoyed Hellboy. It is without a dought a must own movie. The only thing holding this back in my book is that the story is sometimes unbalaced...it has great patencial and is a great movie but the story does have some flous. In one hand it does a great job of pleaseing the croud and does many great jobs of dilivering a good movie that is well worth the maret, but in the other hand the story is in someways unbalaced to where yu loose the audience. But dont let that stop yu from watching Hellboy it is a great movie, and you will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"you do that blue fame thing, girlfriend!","review":"A flick that can easily rival XMEN, but unfortunately , than characters are a little more complex than \\"Dude with metal claws that kicks ass!\\" or \\"Hot chick that can move things\\". That's one thing that I loved about this movie, and it's a welcome change. The movie is centered around Hellboy ( Ron Perlman ) and a gang of pseudo Xmen as they live among human, battling evil in all of it's forms, etc. etc. etc.Anyway, the movie rocked (the best part was Selma Blair's blue fame thingy), unfortunately, the plot was so overwhelming, than fans will be left wondering if Hellboy #2 (if there is one) can measure up!

Thoroughly recommended for any fan of a good action movie, superheroe movie, and specially for any HELLBOY or Mike Mignola fan. The best comic inspired movie yet (I even liked it better than Spider-Man 2 and X2, even though I was a fan of those properties YEARS before I was a fan of Hellboy).

The first album in this two album set is an unknown classic. It has everything - bits of sixties psychedelia, skewered blues, beefheart, even a little jazz.

Seems like people could rotate vacations, yes? I found out after I paid big $ for expedited shipping and then found out I may have to wait a out their vacation for it to be sent. !!!Still - kudos to the staff for FINALLY agreeing to ship them before they left (I ordered 11). I only wish it hadn't taken several angry phone calls to make it happen.Overall - an amateur firm. Probably shouldn't do business with progressive company like Amazon. Maybe a mom and pop somewhere in like Kansas? I dunno. It was odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"i can't believe they're all here","review":"I stumbled upon gene vincent by accident when I bought a rock and roll compilation and fell in love with his music when I heard him panting on Ain't that too much.

If you haven't heard him before this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff on the Challenge label-- underrated!","review":"This disc is usually sold for a song but it's worth the money even at a premium price...I had Gene's Challenge recordings on vinyl back in the 80s but they never sounded this GOOD! (And they were hot then, believe me!) Gene was still a legit rockabilly when he cut these sides, even if it's obvious he was looking in the direction of a Conway Twitty type CW comeback. Even songs like Haggard's FUGITIVE come out rockabilly somehow...And the voice... MAN, that guy had an expressive voice! LOVE IS A BIRD will make you cry if you think about it enough... but don't think, just listen... you won't regret it!BONUS: Gene's speaking voice is clearly heard on this disc, including directions to the band... it gives great inside into Vincent's musical prowess.

I've given it away twice now but feared I might never be so fortunate as to stumble across this gem again. You cannot imagine my joy to find it here!I love that cover bears the same illustration as the dust jacket. On the down side, I wish there were a better mix of boys and girls in the artwork.

Jake, once nearly trapped into marriage, distrusts women (and incessently talks about it) while emma, theproduct of an abusive father, is afraid she's losing her mind (and incessently goes on about that.) I am halfway thru this book and find absolutely no reason to continue. There is nothing likeable about Jake Turner and the only thing I liked about Emma was her horse, scout, who tried to bite Jake in the butt every chance he got.

The 18% figure is contradicted by the Jerusalem census figures that he gives on p. 60 where the real percentage (after calculating it from the population figures) is 9%.Also on p. 268 the author quotes Riah Abu El Assal that since the Israeli annexation in 1967 that \\"the number of Christians dropped from 28,000 to 7,000.\\" On p. 60 his census figures show that in 1967 the Christian population of Jerusalem was 12,646 and that in 1999+ it had grown to 20,000.Either the technical editor was incompetent, or this was a clumsy insertion of Palestintian propaganda for the purpose of scoring a few propaganda points."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a travel guide !!","review":"Buying this book was a complete waste of money !This book does not tell you anything about present day Jerusalem.

Because of this I can not recommend you buy it. Very disappointing that such a great comedy got this type of treatment from the producer of the DVD. It looks like someone took a VHS copy in SLP mode and copied it to DVD. I sent my first copy back to Amazon because I thought it was defective.

Season 1 is somewhat different from subsequent seasons; it has a couple of episodes that feature Barney Miller's family at home. This included Barbara Barrie as his wife & also featured two daughters. The home life got very little attention after the initial season.Barney Miller was one of the first ensemble sitcoms. The cast of supporting characters were indeed an eclectic group; Chano, the Puerto Rican, Fish, the old cop, Wojo, the macho Pole, Harris, the Black with aspirations, & Yemana, the gambling Chinese. Most episodes were focused in the squad room that featured a zany collection of criminal & not-so-criminal types.

The time setting is early in the Peninsular war as Wellington and his troops are trying to push the French from Portugal. The heroine is wonderful as well as she helps him to come to grips with who he is and how to love. There is quite a good story here and though I did firgure out what was going on early I loved how the author spun the tale as our wonderful hero Val grew to understand love and what it meant to be loved. Ms Farrell's ability to show the transformation was quite good. There were great secondary characters but they never took over. She even added a bit of humor with the hero and a piglet.

Furthermore, they made a few mistakes, and a subtle anti-Catholocism was evident in their writing (i.e. by not mentioing that Covadonga is a pilgrammage destination where a virgin's apparition occurred, and that the Oviedo's cathedral hosts the suderio santo, the rag Jesus wore while on his way to the Crucifixion).

As a result of this grave \\"injustice,\\" Howard flips his lid, gets fired, and veils his rage as a clarifying moment of truth when he must embark on a quest for authenticity of the self.

To make matters worse, the text offered up in these pages is embarrassingly sophomoric. Unless you are very new to witchcraft (and were paying absolutely NO attention to anything you read in high school) you will learn nothing from this book that you did not already know.

I am generally loathe to remark negatively on something someone probably worked hard on, but I can't say that I believe fully that Morrison worked very hard on this. It's severely lacking in anything that most people don't already know and there is a curious focus on Christian symbolism for what is supposed to be a witch's book of symbols. Though I suppose(doubtfully) that perhaps Christian witches might find it interesting.

Second, why is Have A Good Time on this?Lastly, the CD is an abridged version of the album, resulting in the dropping of one of Paul's biggest hits, and his favorite recording--Graceland.When the CD first appeared, the maximum length was less than 70 minutes. Now, CDs can fit over 79 minutes of music. Why hasn't Warner Brothers remastered this and restored the song?Finally, Paul likes to edit his works. Mother and Child Reunion and Loves Me Like A Rock lose 20 seconds each.Warner Brothers has yet to remaster any of their artists catalogs. Make Paul Simon your first, and give this best-of a needed facelift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING!!!","review":"Warning - Do not play this CD while driving in your car, it causes uncontrollable dancing and singing.

He falls into a similar category to the Beatles and Beach Boys in that he has so many hits he cannot have a good greatest hits album.

The Graceland songs are great, but they don't fit in with the 1970's songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generous, if Flawed, Anthology Album","review":"\\"Negotiations and Love Songs,\\" judged by its own merits, is a decent anthology album, containing a generous 16 songs drawn from all of Paul Simon's albums through \\"Graceland.\\" Unfortunately, Simon's previous greatest hits album, which did a better job of covering the highlights of his popular 1970s albums, has not been released on CD. Basicially, \\"Negotiations...\\" replaces several cuts from the first greatest hits collection with the soundtrack song \\"Late in the Evening,\\" three songs from \\"Hearts and Bones,\\" easily Simon's weakest solo album, and two songs from \\"Graceland.\\" These inclusions, particularly the \\"Hearts and Bones\\" stuff, weaken the collection. That said, there are still a dozen of Simon's best known and loved songs from the 1970s here, most of which sound as fresh now as when they were recorded.Overall, this album is a good introduction to Simon's music for the casual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Artists of my time","review":"One of the Great Artists of my time, Music of an era.

I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend it, nor view any like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad","review":"I had to watch this film in a university class called the Apocalyptic Consciousness. It is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.

Poor acting and poor script would be a good summary of the movie. The preaching is heavy-handed and causes one to cringe in embarassment for the actor/actress. It is a movie for the converted.

It does not even pretend to empathise or accept the diversity of religious beliefs on our planet earth.

But this film is about a HS star that did make it, and it also documents the realities of becoming pro - good and bad.I think the most interesting part of this film was when he goes overseas to see his brother on a European team. When we think about basetballers \\"going pro\\" we automatically think the NBA, but we're reminded that there's an even bigger world out there and that pro basketball is a worldwide phenomenon. Also its a reminder to young Sebastien Telfair that the hardest part about being a pro baller is staying pro - he saw how hard his brother works to stay in the Euro leagues and gets an understanding that he'll have to work very hard to be in the NBA.This movie is great for everyone, not just sports fans.

The music on this classic fifties album is great and so is the sound (remastered by Bernie Grundman) but what really, really is a big annoying disappointment is the pressing of the two 45 RPM LP's. Manufactured by Record Technologies, Inc, which sounds great for a High Quality pressing plant, but pops and clicks like you wouldn't believe. Just a casual glance at the surface of the records is enough to give you hyperventilation.

First, two of the tracks (side 3, tracks 2 and 3) have enough surface noise to make those songs almost unlistenable. Second, and this is my taste and not a problem with the recording, I found the sound of London's voice unnatural. It suffers from hyperresonance-- it's way over the top. I love the album but wished I had not gotten this particular reissue. I wrote to Boxstar Records about both issues a few days ago and have yet to get a response. Will update this review when/if I hear back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear 35mm negative sleeves","review":"These sleeves are clear and make negative viewing easy, including through the ten power loupe I regularly use. This feature alone provides a decided improvement over my thousands of individual translucent sleeves that protect the six frames inside but require each strip be pulled out in order to view it -- to tell what's on a negative. However, the clear product is more difficult to load negatives into as the sides tend to collapse in and hold strips from making it all the way inside. A puff of air and some wiggling are required to release the strip. A little practice reduces the problem. I find the sleeves so convenient for making selections from thousands of frames that the one disadvantage is of such minor consequence I otherwise rate the product a solid five. I intend to order more of these sleeves and gradually transfer all of my negatives from my old sleeves into this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"sinamon NOT green tea","review":"its not a green tea it just teast like hot milk with sinamonNOT green tea latte"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly inspiring and practical dictionary of Spirituatlity","review":"Susan Muto's \\"Catholic Spirituality from A to Z, an Inspirational Dictionary\\" truly lives up to its title.

In order for that to be the case, \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", \\"Songbird\\", \\"The Chain\\", \\"Landslide\\" and others would have to be included. The album is also a little light on Lindsey Buckingham for my tastes (only 3 of his songs!) and the two new tracks simply don't compare to the classics. The other 14 tracks are a testament to the majesty of the Mac and their greatness cannot be denied. The liner notes are also very interesting as they give one a backstage look at a 1988 Mac concert.

This album truly has most of the best of Fleetwood Mac, though one song I would have like to see was \\"The Chain\\" from the \\"Rumours\\" album which I believe was one of their better songs.Even so, every rock-n-roll collection ought to have a decent supply of Fleetwood Mac and this album will meet the needs of most of the fans.

Nonetheless, I must advise that you get the original albums \\"Rumours\\" (which I have on cd, having replace the vinyl) and \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" (which I still have on vinyl). There is nothing wrong with this greatest hits cd, it's just that \\"Rumours,\\" (see my separate review of that cd) in and of itself, is so full of great stuff that it is almost a greatst hits album on it's own. Additionally, the earlier \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" cd is also rich in really good stuff.

Very easy to listen to, very positive and upbeat music. It's like having a really great radio station on for an hour. Because Fleetwood Mac has three lead singers, and three to four different songwriters, the songs do not all sound the same, which keeps the album from getting predictable.If you own only one Fleetwood Mac album, this should be it. If you are not familiar with their work, they are one of the best pop light-rock bands ever to exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits, but not the Best of Fleetwood Mac","review":"I lost most of my Fleetwood Mac in a Burglary a while back, and recently I came across this CD and grabbed it without reading which songs were included.Don't get me wrong, all the songs on the CD are very good, they are I'm sure the biggest hits for the band.

To name a few of the songs missing here, \\"The Chain\\" \\"Songbird\\" \\"Crystal\\" \\"I Go Insane\\".However, this set is good enough that I am convinced that I need to buy some of the albums again, and this will tide me over in the mean time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very good book","review":"The book teaches the content better than most CPA review books with a lot of examples.

It will only open on a PC, MAC or iPad, not an actual Kindle, Kindle app, or the Kindle reader in Chrome.Eh???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for sliding, not for protecting","review":"I used these on my dining room chairs, but I ended up replacing them with good ol' felt pads. The sliders are easy to install and seem a perfect solution for skinny-leg chairs, but I was hoping to prevent my beech wood floor from getting scratched. Say hello to swirly scratches if even a grain of salt gets on the slider because these have a hard surface. Felt pads have crappy adhesive and continuously want to slide off, but it's the only way to keep the scratches down to a minimum. I'm sure these magic sliders will work wonders to move heavy stuff around or to sound-proof wooden chairs on, say a kitchen tile floor, that screams every time you inch a chair. But don't use them if you're worried about scratching the surface beneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stays better than stick-on, but nails come through","review":"We had these on our dining room chairs on a wood floor. They seemed great at first, but over time the nails protruded through the plastic on the back legs, which left terrible marks on the floor. When we moved to another house with a tile floor, the nails squeaked something awful.I recently took them off and the black plastic bit holding the nail was so battered that the edges crumbled easily.So these might be okay for carpet or occasional use, but aren't up to heavy-duty daily dining room usage. That being said, sticky-pad ones never stay put, so I'm still without a good solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading all the great reviews of this product, I have been very disappointed. The chairs slid very nicely on our wood floors for a few days, but now they rub on the floors just as much as they did with nothing on, and I notice that the floors are continuing to get worn. I guess old fashioned felt is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"I have had a set on a kitchen set for more than 7 years, they finally need replacement. I used larger ones on the table and other heavy furniture. The work great on tile and wood floors. It was easy to pop off the original plastic glides and replace with these. It takes a little effort to get these on the rubber mounting piece which is nailed to the furniture leg but I found that rotating them while applying some down pressure gets them on quickly. When replacing, use a flat screwdriver to get under the rubber mounting piece and lift gently. They come off easily. I plan to continue using these. I wish Amazon sold these directly I could take advantage of Prime shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"The teflon caps simply cannot be pressed into place atop the plastic fitting as the instructions so wishfully suggest. There is not enough give in the rubber that is suppose to yield when you press the cap on. I wasted my money and my time on this ill-conceived trinket. I have to wonder why there are two pieces to begin with. Couldn't the nail simply be countersunk into a recess within a single piece?Off to the hardware store to see if someone has thought this through any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to go to school in India","review":"Young children speak through child-interpreters about what makes their locale special, what they do with their friends, how they play, what they learn.

No book has hit a greater nerve with me. I don't know how many times I have gone to work thinking that my real calling lay elsewhere. And after reading this book I was amazed at how all pervasive this feeling is: it got me thinking about how much happier we would all be if society had a different system for career placement. This book is a tremendously effective motivational tool. I am not a big fan of so called self help literature, they all come on so gung ho and hokey, as if they had all been written by Richard Simmons on Mescaline. The Lemming Conspiracy is an engaging and intelligent read, it does not talk down to you, and it is written with a passion that jumps from the page. I cannot reccommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"the hulk meets \\" darkness-powered moffia man.\\"","review":"the hulk crosses over with the darkness. talk about a swift storyline!!also, i'm sad to say this was one of the worst cross overs i have ever read. not much thought was put into this cross over. not nearly as good as i thought it was going to be. check out my boy supes' ( Superman) when they cross HIM over with the darkness.

Additionally, this book all but presupposes the existence of a god, which I found to be a flaw in the overall \\"open\\" discussion of the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pickover's worst book to date","review":"Actually, this effort can not be appropriately called a book. It can be more appropriately described as a collection of random thoughts.When Pickover tries to really dig into the problem he posed to himself, his efforts end up either being shallow or degrading into rumblings about mathematical formulas. No significant advance in the matter is ever reached.Almost all of his premises can be seen, by any mildly intelligent person, as false from the beginning, which turns any effort in reading through the entire book a Herculean task.I have read almost every book Pickover wrote to this date and enjoyed them very much, which prompted me to buy this one mostly because his name was on the cover... Suffice to say that I won't be making that mistake twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must-read about paradoxes and God!","review":"Paradox of God is an excellent book about the paradoxes brought about by true omniscience. Each section of the book first leads the reader on an imaginary adventure involving an omniscient being, such as the alien Dr. Eck, or God Himself. After using the story to introduce a paradox, he goes on to look at it from a logical point of view. I enjoyed his methods of using game theory to simply explain exactly how the paradoxes work. Pickover even shows that in some scenarios it can be a disadvantage to be omniscient.The book is an excellent overview of many famous paradoxes, that challenges the way we look at religion. I highly recommend this book, as it covers many subjects that anyone can become enthralled by. Pickover has a wonderful gift of being able to explain even the most complicated of these paradoxes in a way that is easy for anyone to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family viewing at it's best","review":"This movie was a wonderful family movie. It brought about numerous discussions of biblical history. We would very strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Beginning...but...not so great after that...","review":"I originally watched this miniseries when it aired on NBC in the fall of 2000. I specifically remember watching the first 2 hours and realizing I could find a better way to spend my time than sitting through the last two hours.The performances are uniformly mediocre, with only Martin Landau standing out as Abraham. The scenes of creation, including Adam and Eve, as well as the Fall, are quite nicely told through flashback, as Abraham tells the story around a campfire. But, it quickly falls apart after that.If you really want to watch the story of Joseph, Moses, and the rest, I recommend watching the animated films JOSEPH and PRINCE of EGYPT. If you want to watch a classic story of Moses, go with THE TEN COMMANDMENTS--it's a classic that still rates close to 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Beginning I thought...............","review":"As I first started to watch this I was really excited, because one of my favorite movies is Moses. As you go along, you see how many important things they cut out and it is so chopped up. Someone who knows nothing about Moses, may enjoy this, but once you have seen Moses with Charlton Heston, this movie does not even begin to match it. The best Actor was Martin Landeau, he was quite good. The rest of it left something to be desired. I guess the funniest part was when Eve ate the fruit, come on, was it really blackberries and not an apple!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE!","review":"I recommend this movie to anyone who desires to know more about the events that occurred in the Old Testament, this is a close as you'll get to the actually truth. I bought the VHS and was so pleased with the characters, costumes, location and scenes that I loaned the movie to friends and other family members. Well, somewhere along lending it out someone liked it so much never returned it to me. So, I purchased another one. I also own the Ten Commandments and it is a good movie as well, however, if you know the Bible, you will also know that Mose had no romantic relationship with an Egyptian princess. (this love triangle was added to the movie). All I say is if you want to know what really happened in biblical times, buy this movie. I'm sure after you've seen the movie it will build up your curiousity to read the bible. It's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible Teacher","review":"This is an interesting and well done video that in my oopinion is good for a basic undrstanding of some of the Old Testament stories.

Wallace's characters are honest, funny and real. They are not perfect, like most of us. Protagonist Manny Ramos and his teammates talk like real kids. They learn their own lessons, teaching each other -- instead of waiting for an adult to solve their problems, as in the old-fashioned sports novels. Best of all, Wallace writes unmatched sports game action.

While there are mild, somewhat noticable power gains in the middle gears, between 2nd and 4th gear, it does not seem to have a big effect on takeoff acceleration or any effect on top end performance.

Yes, thats it, it was on top of a minitower under my desk, and it flipped over and fell onto some soft carpeting...and never worked again. I thought, you have GOT to be kidding! I have an old 80 gig unit from another company that isn't in business anymore; that one has been moved, packed away, etc, and yes, even dropped from that fearsome height onto jagged carpeting, and it still works.

I bought two, and they worked OK which is why I gave a 2 star and not a 1. The case breaks apart very easily, and it has rainbow lights that are always on. The lights are very bright and the one in the center flashes in many colors all the time. Very annoying... I actually broke it apart and took out all the LEDs with a soldering iron so I didn't have to look at it flashing anymore. It also doesn't provide enough power to charge phones and might have fried some of my peripherals.If you don't want to pay more than a few bucks, then go ahead and buy it because they do work. If you care at all about the quality, spend a few more bucks on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY low quality","review":"This item isn't even woth $1, you are better off spending $10 on a hub that actually works.

Aside from being badly faded, and aside from being poorly panned-and-scanned from the original widescreen, the print is so dark that you can hardly see anyone's faces. It's often difficult to see what is occuring, or whom is speaking. I'll admit that I had never seen the actual movie before, but surely there must be a better print somewhere. I'm quite tolerant of less-than-perfect prints of rare films, but this one is very hard to watch, and even harder to enjoy.

I would love it if it were of decent quality.This is the roughest blade hinge I have ever experienced. The blade grinds and balks when it is opened or closed. I don't believe I have ever felt such a rough knife hinge. It is even worse than a knife that has been dropped in sand. The blade is decent when new, but is poorly sharpened and dulls quickly, especially where it contacts a cutting board. The corkscrew does work smoothly and seems well-finished. They missed a good design opportunity on the corkscrew by not fitting a folding projection to make it a waiter's corkscrew. Nobody likes the brute-force corkscrews, you know. Many people can't even use them. Leverage is a wonderful thing.The only good thing I can say about this knife is that it is pretty until you use it. It would make a nice gift for someone you knew would not use it, or know the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would pay double for quality","review":"Chinese made pocket knives are poorly made. Always beware of a product like this when the price is low. A decently made knife like this could sell for closer to $40 and it would be worth it because with proper care it would last a lifetime.

If your into Concrete Architecture then add it to your library only if you can pick it up somewhere for 1/4 it's price."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Who Love Index Funds","review":"Not for those who are active fund managers. The author makes quite a logical, compelling case to invest in his style. The main thrust is passive managed over active managed funds.

Like a lot of financial books, it gets a bit bogged in numbers at times, but overall the flow is excellent. It changed my investment approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note of dissent","review":"In addition to the fact that I, too, felt that I was enduring a commercial for DFA, I was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need: Index Mutual Funds and Beyond - The Way Smart Money Invests Today, Swedroe's May, 1998 book. He introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations, but if you've read the first book, there's no reason to look at this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well-written","review":"The writing style is OK, but not great. Basically this book boils down to repeating over and over again: index funds are the way to go. He presents study after study showing this. I agree with the conclusion, but a couple of his points I think are misleading; mostly, however, they're just not very exciting. Instead of this book, I'd recommend 2 books that are much better written: A Random Walk Down Wall Street covers about the same info, but is more entertaining to read; or Making the Most of Your Money, which covers the same info plus tons of other useful topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Scottish music boosts my mood!","review":"Enjoyed the seasonal flare of Christmas music by the Scots!

I recommend this band to anyone who like Jack Johnson, Sublime, Ben Harper, G. Love or any other music of that style. Can't wait for another release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album that is sure to please!","review":"If you are a fan of Jack Johnson, Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, Pepper, or anyone else along those lines, Bag of Toys is another band you'll be adding to that list. I discovered the band through a friend of mine and bought Nooner the very next day. Their laid-back acoustic sound and rich (and often relatable) lyrics make their music perfect for a nice relaxing listen, be it by yourself or with some friends. Their sophomore album Afternooner delivers the same great tunes; I highly recommend both of their albums to any fan of the acoustic surf-rock genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has been several months and I have not yet recieved my order","review":"I have sent numerous emails in reference to this purchase, to this date I have not recieved my order!!Very disappointed and upset"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption of a Soul","review":"The thing that rings through Harsh's book is the honesty of what he tells and of how he wasn't a perfect man but found the strength to lift himself above what had happened and to redeem himself and his soul.

Her actual album is great as well. I like her more tradtional songs like Im Nin Alu and Love Song. I love the effect of acapella middle eastern music. It is like prayer. Her voice was very haunting and soothing.What i cannot believe is that Ofra Haza has died of Aids of all things. Very shocking and disturbing. I hear she was only 40.

The screws supplied to attach them do not seat completely flush, and they are so mild that, even with pre-drilling the holes, some of the heads snapped off before the screw was fully seated. I am surprised,because Cold Steel usually makes some fine weapons. On a side note, the 30\\" handle is a bit awkward for single-hand use, but a bit short for two-handed.

I was also missing a piece as well. The biggest thing was that on the head there was stamped made in Taiwan and on the other side was an American sticker.

Arguably I could have been a little bit more meticulous in assembling the hammer. I was overly excited in taking it outside for some watermelon smashing action.

The book's writing style varies from chapter to chapter (chapter 3 manages to climb all the way to mediocrity in it's clarity), but all in all you can read this 100 times and still get very little out of it.The book proves theories with 2 lines of text stating \\"it's obvious this is true\\". Well heck, pigeon hole principle seems obvious, but that doesn't seem like a proof, just an observation. Many of the examples skip important steps, which means you spend extra time wondering \\"how'd he do that\\".All in all, this book fails miserably. It's too basic for anyone advanced in the subject. And the miserable writing style and horrible examples make this book pretty useless to the layperson. And teachers, unless you want your students to turn in proofs like the author (proofs... what proofs) then don't give this book to your students."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need a camel to get through this one!","review":"\`The Frontier War for American Independence' is a barren desert of a book with nary an oasis of refreshment between its covers.

Contrary to 1994 and all the media hype surrounding his ex-wife's grusome death, O J was the measuring stick that all running backs were measured. I think the person or persons who put this video together aught to be ashamed of themselves for snubbing the first player to rush for 2000 yards in a season.

Capra which are just like Garden of Life used to be before the change. Garden of life cheapened the formula by removing the good stuff(the fermented goat milk protein) and adding a sweetener(makes it grossly sweet). Look at most all Garden of Life products and they use a fermentation process to help predigest for easy assimilation. They removed that key ingredient in the new formula, making this a low quality product when compared to the others(by the way, Mt Capra supplies Garden of Life with main ingredients). On top of that, Garden of Life is more expensive than the other products.

In the book, Heyerdahl recounts his adventures in Peru in his usual, inimitable style, while the two archaeologists (one American and one Peruvian) discuss the archaeological finds at this fabulous site. The book is full of drawings and photos, many in color. Some of the artifacts are truly spectacular, but just as interesting are the insights into how archaeologists put together a picture of the past from the dusty bits and pieces left in this desert center.

However, it does not wick up much water as the pure paper ones so it defeats the purpose of having a humidifier. Since I replaced these with the stock paper only filter/wicks, I get over twice as much water into the air in 24 hours. I would not recommend these if you want humidity in the air from the humidifier. Look for the accordion paper ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wet Wicks","review":"This wicking filter is designed differently than the OEM filter in my Sears humidifier.

I also removed the cover and placed my hand on each motor and they were definitely very hot (ruling out that I had one faulty motor). For a quick fix I 'bowed' one filter in each side, breaking the airflow seal to allow more airflow and reduce stress on the motors. This helped but, of course, breaking the airflow seal kind of defeats the purpose of drawing air THROUGH wet filters for humidification. I do like the construction of the product - maybe they work out better in other manufacturers units. For me it's back to the OEM filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit the humidifier fine...","review":"But for about the first week of use they smelled odd when the humidifier turned on.

But if you are looking for the same water wicking performance as the original filters, don't buy these. With original Sears filters my humidifier empties itself every day (8 gallons). With these filters, more like 2 to 3 days. So if you want a lower output, great.

Every jeweler I took it to thought that this ring cost me $4,000, when it only cost me 1/2 the price! All of my friends awed over it and it's big and flashy like an engagement ring should be! Everyone was shocked that it had 15 stones, not 5 and that made them even more impressed. I love the uniqueness of this ring.

Some questions in my mind:- If Revelation was written over 30 years before 2 Esdras, what would that mean for the theory that Babylon is Rome? Perhaps the usage of Babylon for Jerusalem in the Dead Sea Scrolls might be relevant?- If the 70 weeks of years in Daniel is purely symbolic with no objective meaning, why did so many people in 1st Century Judea believe the Messiah was about to arrive? Why do the 490 years line up so well with Jesus' birth?- If Paul didn't really write Ephesians, why does \\"Paul\\" promise to send Tychicus to the Ephesians on his behalf? If it was written late in the 1st Century, wouldn't the Ephesians know Paul was already dead and he couldn't send anybody?Finally, can Professor Hill address these questions without calling anyone a \\"fundamentalist\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs of the 80's","review":"Few bands were bigger in the 80 in.That helped bring rock&roll back to center stag after the Disco sounds of the 70's"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent bar.","review":"A bit expensive but if you need it, you need it.

The taste isn't bad, but if you use it, only use a very small amount because it does foam up a lot!

If you want to learn how to grow using CFLs or soil, you're out of luck - they're not even mentioned. Nor does it tell you what items you might be able to build yourself instead of shelling out for. Basically, this book doesn't tell you about different ways you can grow, it only shows you one (very expensive) method.In addition, it's poorly edited. There are several places where a word is missing or misspelled, and at least one paragraph that was printed entirely in the wrong place - the heading is \\"Exhaust up through the attic\\" and the paragraph below is about light reflectors.I've found more useful information for free on grow forums than I have in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow Great Marijuana","review":"This book is ok but for the price its not worth it you can buy the Marijuana Horticulture The indoor/outdoor Medical growers Bible for 10.00 less and it has 10 times the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"this does not even show pictures of bugs / pestsTHEY ARE LITTLE KID DRAWINGS ......and says things like spray bleach on your plantsNEVER SPRAY ANY PLANT WITH BLEACHthe book goes on and onabout pointless things like how to dress and actwhat car to but, what light set ups there areworst book everdo not buy there are way better beginers booksget a recent up to year date one insted of this old one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"Great guide for beginners.

Unless you march to Bill Gothard's robotic tune you will quickly realize this is a comical piece of fanatical propaganda used to keep young teenagers in line. Of course that could be exactly what your looking for. I would have thrown my copy out years ago, but it is a great ice breaker for conversations about the hilarity of the ATI sub-culture. I'm sure someday it will make a great fire starter on some random camping trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time to rock","review":"Rock n roll may seem like an odd choice for a pivotal moment in American history but altschuler supports his thesis very well and by the end I was convinced. This book is an overview of the business, politics, race relations, and generational relations stemming from rock and roll. It looks at rocks early years through the \\"day the music died\\". If you are looking for a book that will serve as an introduction to the rock n roll movement then look no further. I was very impressed with the information presented and as someone who knew nothing about the history of rock when I started I was pleased with how much I learned. It leaves a few places hanging such as what happens to Elvis after he joins the army but mostly it covers everything in the right amount of detail. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"A fine and compelling read, even if the author fails to nail down the premise in the subtitle. One or two factual errors don't detract from the overall fascinating story of the rise of rock and roll in the mid-1950s and the payola scandals of the late 1950s. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This book offers an overview of the astrological signs in the Hebrew calendar so there is a need to convert your birthdate first from Gregorian to Hebrew, as your constellation of birth is not always the same in both. It then gives a list where your correction or tikkun sign can be found. I have found the comments for each sign quite applicable, as a birth sign as well as for the tikkun sign. Furthermore it gives us the general character of each month, and its effect on all of us, which is interesting to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different View","review":"This is a totally different way of looking at astrology.

When I read the book I found that there were many aspects that didn't let Che prevail in Bolivia. From Mario Monje and PCB Party's betrayel, Fidel's lack of re-establishing contact with the guerrillas, lack of peasant recruiting to create a people's army, lack of conditions being right in country for an insurection, etc. Even with all these things stopping Che I was very amazed on how far he got, any other leader wouldn't have lasted 2 months. Che's tactics in his ambushes was incredible and even with lack of guerrillas he wiped out mostly all army forces that opposed him. Che was doing superb until US intervention. To understand Che's mission and how he failed is to understan Latin America today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson Gift Perfect","review":"Derby horse was perfect gift for my grandson. He loves it.

Because of it, Annie had decided love had no place in her life. Brett had decided love had no place in his life, either. Though he was determined to save his ranch, there was something about Annie which changed his mind. Rachelle Morgan's writing has improved tremendously since Wild Cat Cait. The juxtapositions between Annie's past and present lives are very nice here. Brett is sympathetic but doesn't have quite as much depth as Annie does.

I will say it doesn't like fringe but will go over a low rug with no problems, the chunky wheels are nice. The less obstacles the better but if it can make it in my house it can make it anywhere, it just takes it a little longer. Would be nice if it went in rows somehow. If you have open rooms you will need to baracade it in one particular room to get the job done faster or order the the extra gadgets to do this. I clean it after each use brushes and all and it is fairly simple. Love the tool that helps comb and cut the hairs from the brushes. Oh and it does make noise, but hey, it's cleaning not me. :) You do have to turn it off as well.

Dirt Dog does not have a vacuum, it just sweeps and I do believe the Roomba does a little better job. If money is an object, buy Dirt Dog though. You will be happy with it. The only mandatory thing with these products is you HAVE to take the 2 minutes to clean them before you use them.

It follows a circular pattern so the less stuff you have on the floor the better it keeps to a set cleaning route. Where there are objects, it bounces off and re-sets itself on a new path. Transitions from hard wood to area rugs and from wall to wall to linoleum with no problem. Be careful about very thin rugs and those with long fringe.The side brush helps clean along mouldings. Picks up cat litter, bird seed, shed fur with ease. Dust collection bin sufficiently large to enable a lengthy clean without emptying.Depending upon the amount of fur and hair on the floor, you do need to clean the brushes quite regularly which is a pain. The floors had not been vacuumed in a while, though, so with regular use, the need to continually clean (several times removing fur from brushes when cleaning one room) should be reduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd ones a dud too","review":"Within 30 days of purchase the 1st one broke...now this one has broken in 90 days.

I opened the paints and poured in all of the corresponding cups and she started painting and I started to smell thermaldahyde. The smell was horrible. This was the same smell of when I was in cadaver lab in college and I wore double gloves since it smelled so bad. I threw all of the paints away and the paintings into the outside garbage. I could still smell the thermaldahyde on the kitchen table where I put her painting after she was down. I washed the table with wood polish and kitchen cleaner and still smelled of thermaldahyde. I definitely would not recommend the paint from Melissa & Doug. The box says non-toxic, but it is also made in China. It did not smell non-toxic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes good with easel","review":"This set goes good with the easel and they were both cheaper on here than they were at our local toy store. The paint containers are sealable and it makes the paint last a long while. There are dedicated paint brushes for each color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Accessory Set","review":"This would get 5 stars but the \\"washable\\" poster paint stains.The spill proof paint cups are excellent. We didn't use all the paint the first day and I put the lids back on, we were able to use the leftover paint a few days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK starter set, but will not buy this again","review":"We bought this when we ordered the easel. It is an ok starter set as it has most of what your toddler will need to use his easel.Then marker arrived broken - the point pressed in the first time we touched it to the whiteboard and we had to throw it away.The chalk is horrible - it makes a lot of dust. We will definitely buy another brand ASAP.The paint cups seem very nice - this is the only item we will probably keep.The paintbrushes are only ok - the hairs come off after only a couple of uses. It is very nice that the brushes are color coded with the paint and the paint cups.The set only comes with one eraser - we had to get another for the whiteboard. The one it comes with works well for the chalkboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Companion Set","review":"I bought the Melissa and Doug Easel and this companion set to go along with it for my nephew. There are no drawbacks. The brushes match the cups. The cups are spill proof. It has everything your child will need to paint, draw, or write up a storm. This was a well thought up and executed product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easel Companion Set","review":"The Deluxe Easel Companion Set was definitely a good set to purchase to go along with the Easel, (make sure you get it along with or before the Easel, or your child will have to wait to get started until it arrives!). If I could change something about the set, it would be to have the company try formulating the paint to a kind that doesn't smell so bad and so overpowering. (It smells for hours throughout the house whenever my child paints.) I will definitely be buying the refill of my paint from a different source! Another very minor thing, would be that I feel that the paint brush bristles would be better if they were bigger and fluffier. Less drip, and better for 3 and 4 year olds to handle paint with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Don't buy this kit. I bought it with my daughter's easel and i'll have to get her something else.The paint cups are spill proof true but too big.The paint is awful and comes with only 4 colors. it smells, is thick and low quality. I prefer by far Crayola paints that comes in small jars.The brushes frankly are very bad.There is only one eraser -- at this price ( i bought it $30+) an eraser for the chalk board could be added.The chalk and the rest of the kit are okay.Summary: i do no recommend this kit. If i knew about the quality, i'd have bought items separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stuff, but paint is NOT VERY WASHABLE!","review":"My 3 year old loves to paint, so I got her the easel plus accessories. But seriously- you guys need to know- that M&D paint is not very washable! Go buy some Crayola Washable Fingerpaint to replace it, don't even bother with this crap! My little girl has been a messy painter for a while now, and crayola washed off, but this stuff has stained all kinds of things in my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"I looked at buying all of these products separately and it isn't worth even looking. This was the best deal and my kids love it! The paint is still lasting from Christmas my daughter uses it almost daily. The cups do exactly what they say they will (no spills), and the brushes have stood up to my daughter's \\"creative\\" ways of painting without tearing up.The red paint can stain clothes if it is left on for too long. I suggest old clothes if they are painting but who lets their kids paint in their good clothes anyways, right?The chalk is triangular shaped so it's easier for little hands just learning to write to hold on to it. It's a great set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Play for All","review":"Melissa and Doug really know their business. This accessory set is just right for little hands. The paint comes in squirt bottles, and the paint cups have lids that actually secure so no spills happen. The lids have holes in the top for the brushes to drip, and the brushes clean easily. Best of all, the lids of the cups and the brushes match the colors of the paint - red, blue, yellow, and green - so little ones won't mix up their paints until they put it on the paper.This set also comes with a roll of paper for painting, chalk, an eraser, and a marker for the whiteboard. Best of all, everything fits right into the tray on the Melissa and Doug easel, so kids have everything they need to be creative in whatever way they choose to express themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - would not buy again","review":"This was our 4th Melissa and Doug easel we have purchased for our grandchildren. The quality was very disappointing and probably should have sent it back (arrived dented and the holes not drilled in proper place for assemblage). I will not buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed accessory kit for the Deluxe Easel","review":"Bought this along with the Deluxe easel for my daughters second birthday. Highly recommended as it contains quality products, especially the paint cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this for my 2 yr old grandaughter to go along with her Melissa and Doug easel. It's a must buy if you get the easel, makes a perfect set! The only thing I would say negative, is that there needs to be more markers and another eraser (one for the chalk and one for the marker side). The paint washes off different surfaces very easily too!! All our Melissa and Doug purchases have been well worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"Over all a great deal and my daughter loves this. the marker ran dry the first night, but we did forget to cap it. the paint is very goopy but does go on smooth and is very bright. Cups are a breeze to clean and very spill proof, chalk is kinda fragile and dusty. paper and paint brushes are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Just a quick warning - don't get this kit if you purchased the table top easel. The paper roll is too large, and there aren't holes for all four paint cups. My fault - I didn't check before buying them together. Other than that, it meets expectations. My daughter would have liked more colors of dry-erase markers, but I'll buy her some of those for her birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion","review":"Great companion to the easel...only problem is the marker....difficult for little people to use as the point has to be pressed quite firmly against the white board..purchased a replacement at local office supply store and my granddaughter had much more success with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painting is always a Blast","review":"My daughter loves to paint and I love the spill proof paint containers. She is a bit of a spill princess:) Highly recommend and comes with everything. I use with a little tykes art easel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of Alex brand paints","review":"Alex paints are absolutely NOT washable. My child spilled some paint on my carpet. After the professional tried cleaning my carpet, I had to pay someone to replace the section with the quote \\"washable\\" paint. Alex brand paints cost me almost $200 that day. Spare yourself the potential aggravation and buy CRAYOLA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful for the paint","review":"Rather than repeating many of the comments already mentioned, I just want to write here that the paint alone is worth the cost. Despite the fact that our 5 year-old works on a large, plastic mat, he still manages to get paint on our kitchen floor (brand new). Luckily, the paint wipes off with ease with a damp cloth - no scrubbing or rubbing whatsoever. Same with the issue of getting paint on his clothes - it washes off in the laundry. We're also sometimes lazy about washing the paint containers so the paint dries up, but if you mix in a little water (I swear, even weeks later...) then the paint is like new again, so we've never really had to waste paint. We've had this set for about 12-14 months now and we haven't yet had to buy a new supply. My son uses the set moderately and I've been surprised at how long the paint has lasted.We're not into the chalk that much and we did also buy our own dry erase markers to supplement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Buy again","review":"We bought this for my 3 year old to go with the Melissa and Doug easel. It comes with one dry earase marker and the point collapsed into the pen the very first time my quite gentle daughter used it. The chalk comes in pretty colors but makes such a dust storm I would not buy these again. I'd add up the cost of the paints, the spill free paint containers which are great, the paint brush and the roll of paper (which is also optional. I think clipping single sheets is easier) and compare costs. I think buying just the items you want seperately would have made more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't need to buy this set","review":"I bought this with matching Melissa and doug easel. All the things seemed nice. It's too pricy and you don't need to buy all of these. I'm not sure why other moms like this set. You can buy these things at your local store for less,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stinky Paint","review":"This is a nice set and a good value for the money. We purchased it to accompany the M&D; easel. The paint cups fit well and the brushes are heavy duty for preschool-age children. The only complaint I have is the paint has a strong odor that lingers even after you put it away.I understand why a white board is fun for children but a grease marker stain is impossible to remove. It would be nice if this set came with a washable grease marker instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Spill proof cups, color coordinated paint brushes, chalk, paper, markers, etc. How do you argue with this? My daughter uses these daily and everything has held up wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compliment to M&D Easel","review":"This is a great accessory to the Melissa & Doug Standing easel. The paint holders fit very nicely into the easel's tray. I would recommend this as a must get accessory with the Easel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this set","review":"I don't actually have the M&D; easel but wanted a set of paints, brushes and no spill containers. We also happen to have a chalkboard (the M&D; small one), so even though I didn't need the chalk I figured it would get used.The no spill containers are great and they have covers (which I wasn't sure about). They're bigger than I was thinking they would be. There are 4 coordinating paint brushes- 1 for each container. I'm also happy with the paints.Chalk set comes with quite a few colors and are higher quality than the thinner chalks our small M&D; chalk board came with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set!","review":"This artist set is great! Everything is good quality. The paint cups are the best feature due to the fact you can keep the paint in there and seal them with the included covers. No more trying to dump unused paint back in the bottles! No more waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the kids","review":"Got this for my nieces and nephew for Christmas. It was a big hit. I look forward to buying more Melissa & Doug products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The chalk leaves much to be desired","review":"i bought this to go with the Melissa and Doug Easel... because I haven't used any other kind of chalk with it, I'm not sure if it's chalkboard itself or if the Melissa and Doug chalk sucks, but it really does not write well at all. The line are kind of faint and don't draw on smoothly, if that makes sense. I plan on getting some Crayola chalk to see if that works better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this easel!","review":"I bought this for my daughter for her 2nd birthday. I had concerns that it might be a little old for her, but I was proven wrong as soon as my daughter opened this gift! She LOVES it. It is a perfect height for her at her small size and adjustable as she grows tall. I only let her play with the paint when we can do it together, but she loves to color on the chalkboard and whiteboard every day. I have already noticed an improvement in her imagination and drawing abilities in the few weeks we have owned this. Would recommend over and over again. Durable, well made, and absolutely adorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best present for my 3 year old!","review":"We bought this for our daughter's 3rd birthday a month ago along with the easel and she LOVES it. My husband put it together with relative ease and had it set up for the next morning so she could start painting and drawing. The supplies are great, although I wish it came with more markers! The paintbrushes and cups are very sturdy and while I might buy some different paint due to the staining we had the first few nights, they're all high-quality items. We're very happy with the product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this to go with the M&D easel my son received for Christmas. The paper fits it well and the cups for the paint to go in are nice beacause they help prevent dripping. The marker didn't work at all. The paint brushes are horrible- the brisles are coarse and don't paint well. I would suggest getting the M&D paper and the paint cups seperate and buying your own washable paint and your own dry erase markers/eraser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ease;","review":"It was a Christmas present for a friend's granddaughter and from what I hear she is enjoying it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkids love it.","review":"Great product, grandkids have it set up in the kitchen! They love to draw while Mom and Dad cook dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set - Needs more dry erase markers","review":"The set is exactly as described and works perfectly with the Melissa & Doug Easel. I love that the paint cups have tops to be closed when not in use.However, several colors of dry erase markers would be nice. The dry erase board is my daughter's favorite part of the easel and she gets bored with the one blue marker. I plan to purchase additional colors at a local store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy, but I might even recommend other titles by him","review":"I picked this up from my school library because it looked awesome. I was browsing the jazz CD's, opened the wrong drawer and found it by accident. I was in the mood for something ethereal and trippy, which this album totally is. And it is very Japanese in a very good way. You can tell by the way Kitaro plays, that he feels the music inside him. This album is very well crafted, and the songs flow into one another. I am now interested in some of his other, more famous works, such as grammy award winning \\"Thinking of You\\", \\"An Enchanted Evening\\", \\"Gaia Onbashira\\", and \\"Ancient\\"; or his first two albums which had a cult following: \\"Ten Kai\\" and \\"From The Full Moon Story\\"I would probably recommend one of those, because while this album is great and I'll definitely listen to it a lot more, I feel that he has so much more potential than what I just heard. He has so many albums out there you might as well start with the more famous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent depiction of Russian womens' lives","review":"Baranskaya swears this is not a feminist work, but it's hard for American women to read it and not think about feminism. The thing is, there is no thesis here, no statement of injustice or plea ofr reparation: Baranskaya's novella has a \\"suck it up - this is how it is\\" tone. This tone makes the work uniquely Russian and it maddens most Western readers. Must read for anyone interested in Russian daily life, comparative cultural studies and women's studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Heavy-Handed","review":"Walter White is a man with a true mission. Part black, he was born without any trace of this race on his skin or in his features. As an employee of the NAACP in its early years, he uses this \\"ability\\" to go under-cover in the South and investigate lynchings. He faces grave danger from both communities and struggles with the concept of the greater good. Along the way he is attracted to a white girl and black girl, has to rescue a racist man from drowning and barely makes it out of town when he is discovered.This was a train wreck from the start. Walter's story is try and fascinating, but the fictional rendering of events of 3 days is boring, trite, insulting, employs ridiculous stereotypes and cliches, is full of characters serving no purpose and others who are under-developed and ridden with silly philosophical mini-soliloquys of Walter - with no end message to walk away with. People should read an autobiography or historical book on the NAACP instead of this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, just wonderful","review":"I borrowed an advance copy from my sister's friend, and with no expectations, I was seriously blown away.

Lovely, wonderful, and fully alive...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more Lisa Gabriele!!!!!!","review":"This book was so good. I always read other peoples' reviews and I've never posted my own, but I was surprised that this book didn't have more reviews so I decided to leave my own. This book was so real, it evoked feelings from that time during my life as a high school girl when you are so unsure of everything and just yearning for attention from males. Especially if you don't have a father figure. When I look back on those years and I did some of the things that Faith did, I realize that was probably the reason. Anyway, this was a great book and I can't wait to read more from this author. Almost Artcher Sisters was great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring bildungsroman...","review":"I usually like coming of age tales, but this one didn't do much for me. Faith DiNapoli is the second child of four and the daughter of a father who speaks heavily accented English and a mother who chain-smokes, both of whom can not get along with each other. The inside of the book flap said we were supposed to be able to follow Faith's life from eight to eighteen, but most of the time I couldn't tell what age she was supposed to be. I think this was a combination of lots of flashbacks and the fact Faith never seemed to really grow up. Lots of secondary characters were thrown in who we were supposed to care about, while little was said about her actual family. I got bored. A lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"I did not like this film. The female main actor was terrible. The male actor was good.

And, if you need to make appetizers and want something different the Cream Cheese Penguins are absolutely irresistable; they're also fast & easy to make and delicious. From holiday drinks to appetizers to vegetables to entrees to desserts, the book is a gem! You'll get seriously hungry looking through it.

The story is okay, media companies try to buy each other to dominate the industry and hire hit man. Young journalist from America finds himself in the trouble and solves the puzzle.

A terrible waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad script","review":"Some movies I see, I wonder why anyone could greenlight them for production. How could a producer get the \\"Crusader\\" script and say \\"Yes, let's make the movie\\"? Because the script is what ruins the movie. Half of the time it feels like you don't know what's happening up there on the screen. Bo Derek and Michael York and Richard Tyson and most other actors do their best, but they can't save the movie.I thought the movie would be an entertaining low budget action/thriller, but it was just a mess of a movie, and failed to entertain.

These are two professionals who are tops in their field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Sad to say,I agree with \\"Thin\\" and \\"Forgetable\\". Probably worth the $1.06 used price... maybe. Such a difference from Seger's earlier book, \\"Making a Good Script Great\\", which I liked very much.It seems like such a rehash of the obvious, after which we get painfully detailed exposition about what, for example, \\"Conflict is an essential element of almost all fiction writing\\" means (p.92). Do we need examples of conflict dialogue ? Maybe??I am not a novice screenwriter, so maybe I'm being too critical, but I have not learned one thing from this book. Sorry Linda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so unforgettable","review":"Linda did a good job here in brewing up all the bits of advice dreaded by any writer: finding the voice, writing with power and energy, beginnings, middles and ends... So at the end (if you make it so far) this book leaves you dizzy and if you're out for hands-on advice, go get yourself something else. What I find particularly annoying are the endless quotations of writers, Linda thinks are important and famous, but who infact are - well - not so important and not so famous and serve up a lot of not so great platitudes. So why 2 stars?

Roger Hodgson's talent and meticulous attention to the enjoyment of music is very much appreciated.

Both are tremendously gifted. I feel that whoever views this concert will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger is \\"acceptable\\", \\"respectable\\", \\"presentable\\", and \\"unbelievable\\"...","review":"Are you a Supertramp fan? A little bit? Then be a \\"Dreamer\\" with Roger and see how a solo artist can amaze you without a band, just him and a saxophonist! He really has fun you can tell \\"up on the stage, how they adore him\\". I did catch some minor sound sync mistakes with Roger's mouth during a song or two but if you blink you'll miss it. Also, Roger sounds great with the DTS audio (if you have decoding capability) its awesome. A very worth while concert DVD for your collection... Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-Roger-Tramp","review":"It is hard to expect the \\"magic\\" to keep occurring as some of us more seasoned fans see live shows, however thankfully every once in a while you start watching either live or on video and BANG! it happens the concert draws you in and you become unaware of the room or crowd around you and you feel elevated to where music is created. This video should be put on just after you shut off the phones, close the drapes, lock the doors and then get ready for the BANG.....Supertramp...man they were something"},{"rating":"1","title":"He forgot to bring a band!","review":"While he does a pretty good solo performance, I was quite dismayed that he didn't have a full band to give some \\"ooohph\\" to the songs.Without the band, it was more like singing along at a pub at night during a vacation with plenty of drink to be had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than The Original Songs!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Supertramp. Their music is fantastic and fluent. However, only Roger made all that possible. Once Hodgson left in 1983, it was no longer the Supertramp we all used to know. Davies, had some great hits, but no where near as good as Roger's hits. His voice still sounds great to this day and the performance will blow you away. This DVD has all the best hits and includes some extras as well. Definitely a must buy for a music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Supertramp Fans","review":"This is by far one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen. In the short amount of time it took to produce this DVD, it was beautifully filmed and it captured Hodgson's talent without fault. Seeing the reaction of the crowd to the music simply put me in awe. Aaron MacDonald's accompaniment and backing vocals added that much more richness to these classic tunes.From the concert to the bonus features, you will not be disappointed with this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SHOW!!!!","review":"What can I say about this incredible artist,an amazing show.Ijust got the Dvd yesterday and got blew away by the music of Roger, even if I saw him live two years ago here in Montevideo, this show, shows him at his best, almost all the Supertramp's Greatest hits are here so if you are a Supertramp fan don't hesitate just buy this DVD right now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must have DVD","review":"I ordered this DVD off of the Roger Hodgson website,got a signed copy .It is amazing seeing him play all the SUpertramp stuff alone ,how great it sounds,they guy is amazing great DVD would buy it again if anything happened to it.THe sound quality is great as well as the quality of the video .The guy that plays sax and sings harmony is real good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahhh","review":"ok....but its solo...needsat least a backup band...nobass or anything...its soloman what a backup band coulddo for this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Concert","review":"I have seen Roger Hodgson perform open-air in Luxembourg-City in July 2008, and he was fabulous. One keystroke on his keyboard, and I was 30 years younger!This DVD is not open-air - but the songs are the same, the performance is fantastic. His songs, compared to his time with Supertramp, are brought to the essence: the uncomparable voice, the keboard/piano and a saxophone - what else do you need? - nothing in my eyes (or ears).The next-best thing to experience him live.If you like Roger Hodgson, this is the DVD to get. If you don't like new, or different (maybe even better) ways to known things -then it's probably not Hodgson you want, but Supertramp, so you better should get a Supertramp album...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Hodgson - 'Take The Long Way Home-Live in Montreal' (Eagle Rock)","review":"Good sixteen song gig here by the voice and talent behind Supertramp. Only downside of this 2006 DVD is that 'Live in Montreal' turns out to be a Hodgson solo performance. Had there been an entire band here, I would have given it a five-star rating. Still, good to watch. Sort of like a PBS special - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many Supertramp gems here, like \\"Take The Long Way Home\\", \\"Give A little Bit\\", \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Breakfast In America\\", the tear-jerker \\"It's Raining Again\\", \\"School\\", \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Logical Song\\".

I didn't bang it on anything, and actually had been very careful of it. To be clear, this is not the band that broke, but a plastic piece that the band connects to, so its not a matter of replacing the band. I super-glued it together, and wore it for another week before the plastic piece on the other side of the band broke as well. I super-glued that, and got another week or two before it fell off again. Thus, if you buy this, don't plan on wearing it, or else consider it disposable, and have a new one ready for each week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller's customer service is poor","review":"I ordered this for my son for Christmas, when it arrived I wrapped it.My son opened it on Christmas morning and the box had no instructions in it.After pulling the instructions off of the web, we found that the watch still did not work.

It draws too heavily on assumptions regarding Japanese attitudes and motives without adequately proving them.

The backing orchestra is of a lower quality than she deserves. I really think Lea needs to part with her brother and find a composser and producer that can really put her talent and voice where it belongs.

There are several good songs on here, such as \\"Epic\\" (everyone knows that one!), \\"Surprise, you're Dead\\", and \\"Zombie Eaters\\", but I think the track that stands out the most would be their incredible cover of \\"War Pigs\\". It's very hard to top the original, but I think they may have done it. Jim Martin is one talented guitarist. After all this praise, one might ask, why only four stars? Well, simply put, I'm just not a fan of rapping in metal, I much prefer Mike's croon or hard growl, but hey, don't let that stop you from buying the album. This is nothing like Limp Bizkit or Rage Against the Machine, in fact he only raps in about half of the songs, and none of them have rapping all the way through.

This had three big singles off it, \\"From Out Of Nowhere\\", \\"Falling To Pieces\\", and the trend-setting \\"Epic\\". However, what makes this disc so sweet are the remaining cuts. \\"Surprise! You're Dead!\\" and \\"The Real Thing\\" are two of my favorite FNM songs ever. Then the second half of the album is nearly as great, with a Sabbath cover to boot.

So, if you are making a workout mix, you can't put the fast songs first and then cool down songs. You can't listen to albums in their entirety or intended order. You can't control anything about the playback experience. So if you don't mind having Hayden and Hendrix mixed together, this is the player for you. But if you want to experience music how the artists intended to be experienced, or how you intended when you made the mix, then steer clear of this one.

I found myself sitting in the car to listen to the remainder of the disc. The songs are filled with passion, and that emotion can be felt in the melodies and lyrics. I recommend it to anyone looking for some good rock music that also has soul. This CD rocks! It makes great driving music, but is also smooth enough to listen to in the office or in the evening at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book - Highly Recommended!","review":"This is a great book told in plain, easy to understand language but still shows overall depth.

Between Something and Nothing and Lovesong were played non-stop on Live 105. This song still evokes memories of listening to Live 105 on my low-fi car stereo in high school on treks to lunch and back. I had the LP from Tower Records, when they were still selling records in crates. To me, this album is timeless, and evokes a time in my life when I was young and carefree, and everything was new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant","review":"Not much time here to write a review, but as I'm paging through amazon.com, this cd title flashed up, and though some brilliant cd's came out of the late 80's, this is truly one to be mentioned. Perhaps even one of my top ten, the debut by the Ocean Blue is beyond words. Sure..perhaps influenced by The Smiths and perhaps some other jangle pop British 80's bands, they truly have a unique sound of their own. Though their debut is their strongest, it's truly a gem to not overlook. If you like to blare music in the car and sing at the top of your lungs, this is definitely the cd for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to get back to...","review":"Like many others here, I dug out this disk from my ever-increasing collection. It's been at least six years since I've last listened to it, and ten since I bought it. I had a tape of it with me on a trip to Prague in 1990, and found it great listening while driving around at night. (There I go getting nostalgic!) Anyway, this disc has not lost any of it's impact with me. I heard and met them a couple of years later at a gig near their hometown of Hershey, PA (*not* Illinois as someone else here commented). So if you're an approaching 30-something and feeling nostalgic, check it out... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transported Once Again","review":"I've said this before on another Ocean Blue review of mine (Cerulean), and it bears repeating again. One is immediately transported when you put on an Ocean Blue CD. Sometimes haunting, sometimes drifting along, sometimes merely just a toe-tappin type of music. I grew up in Maine and if, when listening to \\"Frigid Winter Days\\", you can't feel the cold sting of icy winter air on your face, smell wet mittens drying on the radiator, and hear the crash of icicles breaking off from the eaves, then you should have your heart checked to see if it's beating *S*. And how about \\"Love Song?\\" Wow! Simple lyrics, but the upbeat, catchy tempo captures that giddy feeling of the first tingles of love within a couple. I have over 2,500 CD's in my collection ..... this album gets more airplay than any other ... a MUST for any serious music lover .... I agree with many others here .. Ocean Blue is perhaps the most underrated band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow and lovely","review":"The Ocean Blue are amazing. I really like this cd, even though I'm the type of person who tends to like heavier and/or electronic music most of the time...sometimes you just want to relax and mellow out. This is perfect music for those occasions and the lyrics and musical performance found on this album is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Music","review":"If you are a true music fan, this is a required addition. Buy all 4 of thier CD's and hear them mature. This is some of the best underground pop to come out of the late 80's early 90's. I also believe 'Frigid Winter Days' is an anthem worth noting. I still get visions of snowy campus life everytime i hear it! Don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best albums ever.","review":"I had purchased this album when it first came out and it was stolen out of my car. I could not remember the title of the album, but I have other albums of The Ocean Blue, I was looking on Amazon.com and found it again. I listen to it at least once or twice a week. The music is calming and energetic at the same time, it just makes you fell good. VERY MUCH Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American \\"Smiths\\".","review":"This is an excellent debut from them, and a nice slice of alt-pop from before the \\"alternative\\" scene blew up. They actually have a brit-pop kind of sound, depite being from the eastern USA. It's not too terribly deep, but the songs are happy, the singing is sublime, and I play it often, even after 13 years. The track \\"Drifting, Falling\\" has some cool sax in it, \\"Just Let Me Know\\" is a favorite, and \\"Familiar Face\\" is a nice closer. Another superb album of theirs is \\"Beneath The Rhythm & Sound\\", though it's out of print. Overall, this is a must have, especially if you own cd's from \\"The Lightning Seeds\\", or \\"Trash Can Sinatras\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazin'","review":"I don't remember exactly how I stumbled across the band, but as soon as I heard \\"Between Something and Nothing\\" and \\"Drifting, Falling\\" I was hooked. I immediately bought \\"The Ocean Blue\\" and \\"Cerulean\\" and couldn't be happier with them both. The sound is so mellow and unique; I have a hard time expaining it to my friends. The day after I received them I had a 5 hour drive and made it the entire way just listening to these 2 cds, and I never tired of them! If you're looking for something unique and wonderful, look no farther. The Ocean Blue rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No melt, but water problem","review":"This is the best nylon spatula I've ever had as far as melting goes...no problems with that. My only complaint is that when you wash the spatula, then dry and store it with its handle down (in a crock next to the stove), then pull it out to use it, water runs out of the top part of the handle and onto the flat part of the spatula. Rather annoying, if you don't want water falling into your hot frying pan or on your cookies. It is easily remedied by holding an absorbent kitchen towel over the joint while in the \\"working\\" position. But why did Calphalon not make this spatula handle in all one piece so there's no places for water to stagnate?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"Save your cash and buy the equivalent at Walmart.

I noticed the end of the spatula was melted! Then, last night I used the slotted spoon to stir some pasta, and the very same strong plastic odor filled the kitchen. These tools are not as they are advertised \\"heat resistant nylon\\". They ruined the meal I prepared and actuality stunk up the drawer they were stored in. One can still smell the noxious odor on the spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploding lights","review":"I ordered these to put in my boy's room. When we unpackaged one set, the bulbs virtually exploded in my son's hand.

In a matter of minutes we had three of the lights broken and glass everywhere.I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Genius","review":"Enuff Z'nuff shed the gloss and really get down to business with this dark and somber album. The dark temperament is felt not only in the music but the subject matter, drug addiction. It's a brilliant concept album where Donnie Vie really let's it all out. Some of the band's best songs can be found on this album. If your tastes are more toward insipid pop, then by all means skip this one and buy a Warrant CD but if you want a brutally honest album with some excellent songwriting and musicianship Tweaked is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like EZN, Then Skip This Dog!!!...","review":"... I own all of their cd's and have had the pleasure of meeting them and hanging out with them for several hours. Now that we know where I stand on Enuff Z'Nuff, I have to be honest and say that this album is their worst, in fact it would be bad if anyone recorded it. The songs are weak and the instrumental arrangements are boring and difficult to listen to, in fact there is not one track here that stands out. Just an atrocity from this band who usually puts out great stuff. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool record!!!!!!","review":"I love this record. The songs are clever and addictive. Yard Sale is great.

That's the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars. As with the Raiders track, this album should be expanded and re-released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetly my favorite INDY album.","review":"I always knew this soundtrack would be satisfying. The reason I bought this album is fact that some tunes just wouldn't get out of my head. Previously I played the Indiana Jones and the Last crusade PC game about 10 years ago. Thats where the soundtrack had me hooked. So I admit I like basically the only songs on the game soundtrack.Scherzo for Motorcyle and Orchestra is the standout. And because of the computer game influence \\"Escape from venice\\" is my next favorite. Fellow reviewers say that a lot of material was left out. They must be right. The album is ultra short. Some songs really do put me to sleep, though. Somewhat boring songs are here and there. But that is expected from a soundtrack, since I'm not watching to movie to correlate.Among John Williams soundtracks, this one is still among my favorite. The star wars trilogy soundtrack is without a doubt my favorite though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This soundtrack blew my ears up! Perfect!","review":"John Williams truly is a master. This album features most (but not all, BLURGGG!!) of the musical masterpieces from my favourite motion picture of all time, Indy After Holy (therefore, one in possession of a number of holes, right?) Grail, making it equally sacred an artifact as is the Grail itself. Buy it or perish, I say. A track particularly in my favor is \\"The Brother of the Cruciform Sword\\", featuring the entire \\"Indy stalks the Nazi Castle\\" theme in all its immense potential. May Williams live long and prosper, and grow himself a beard."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing better on Earth.","review":"The Last Crusade soundtrack is far and away the best Indiana Jones music on the market. I cannot begin to understand why and how anybody could mistake Raiders as a better score. I hope John Williams lives a long, long life, so that he may share the rest of his musical creativity with the world. He can start with Indy 4, due in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but still fun","review":"I got about 7 different experiments to do at my son 7th birthday party.

Along with some traditional baking soda, citric acid, and red cabbage powder experiments, I decided to try the Insta-worms. It was a big hit, the kids really enjoyed making slimy blue worms with the \\"worm goo\\" and then wrapped them up in a napkin to take home. It has plenty of worm goo to make enough worms for probably 30 or 40 kids (as long as you watch them to make sure they aren't wasting it). According to the directions, you can save the liquid and the goo for another time and it's supposed to be non-toxic.

Test print (black and white photo on Epson Exhibition Fiber) was 2 coated using instructions on can. Uneven gloss. 3 coats still uneven. 4th coat evened out the surface but added unwanted gloss. At this rate I might be able to finish 4-19x13 prints per can which would equal $5 per print. The surface of Epson Exhibition Fiber is extremely delicate, scratches while printing. The spray might protect the printed surface but does nothing to hide scratches already on the paper. I am forced to use a resin coated paper. Bottom line: Krylon Crystal Clear spray is cheaper and worked better for me with this paper. Can't recommend Hahnemule Spray for semi-gloss or glossy photo paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile--Connected to The Awakening","review":"This is an excellent book, written around and shortly after the time of Chopin's feminist classic, The Awakening. The editors have seemingly put together the collection that was rejected by publishers after The Awakening became a scandal. The stories are well worth reading. Withing its pages are \\"The Story of an Hour,\\" one of her classic character sketches; \\"Lilacs,\\" a poignant story about leave-taking and the cost of freedom; \\"Her Letters,\\" a predictable but touching story of love and obsession in the aftermath of a spouse's death; and the title story, an intriguing story concerning gypsies and religion. Catholicism as a theme runs throughout the collection. Some of these seem to be more occassional pieces, and on the whole, there is some uneveness, but a delightful and worthwhile experience nonetheless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I to have had the honor to train with Mr. Avi Nardia.When it comes to the book, the book is a great tool for self defence training.

I love that the key to KAPAP is to \\"use only what works for you.\\" As I have been involved in numeorus martial arts for more than 50 years, the material is easy to follow and learn from; however, like any self-defense skill, one has to actually practice the material to master it. Though this book just covers the basic combat concepts of KAPAP, it is still highly recommended for anyone interested in practical and effective combatives.

I consider this book almost worthless...

This book doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction into the original Israeli fighting art.","review":"This book has been a great help in understanding the concept of \\"Relative Position\\" and its application to self-defense. Although this book is only a guide to understanding the fighting system of modern Kapap, it gives just enough information to allow readers to explore Kapap and use the concepts in their own training. Like it says in the introduction, this book is not a magical solution to self-defense rather it is about upgrading the \\"toolbox\\" through a variety of resources. I also agree that today's Kapap is more of an \\"international\\" self-defense/fighting system than an \\"Israeli\\" system and commend Chaim Peer, Albert Timen, Avi Nardi, David Arama, and Professor John Machado for their contributions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"It took almost an entire month for them to get this book to me.

Shortly thereafter, the black ink had to be replaced.

Rather, it is a litany of presidents of Argentina during that time period. It details how they got the office and how they failed.There is nothing, as another review has noted, of the people. None of their stories. How did the dirty war feel? What was living with hyperinflation like? Defending Argentina on Goose Green--how did that solider respond?There is nothing about culture, art, music, food, literature. I suspect Argentina--and her history--are much larger than her presidents.Frederick Lewis Allen used to write (US) history, combining both the presidents and the people. It would be great to find a book about Argentina in that style. This is not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rote and Boring Timeline","review":"I am very interested in Argentinean history, but this book was very disappointing because it presents Argentina's history as a bland series of events from an extremely objective point of view.

It was basically a Hillary/Haylie Duff promo. They left out the better songs like \\"Hear You Me\\" by Jimmy Eat World. If they had put Mya, Jimmy Eat World, Goo Goo Dolls, and the original singers from the movie on the sound track and left out Jesse McCartney and The Duffs as much as possible, the cd would have been a million times better. It's so bad that iTunes won't even carry it. OH, and they RUINED \\"I'll Be\\" by Edwin McCain. Don't try to fix what's not broken. My rant is now complete. The movie is much better than the soundtrack, even though Hilary Duff is in it. Save yourself the torture. Buy the movie, not the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome soundtrack","review":"specially if you already have the movie because Jesses first song and Mya song on this disk are too reasons to buy this cd everythin else sucks except for Hil's songs and the song they play when there dancing about her eyes i love that one too sooo get this disk"},{"rating":"2","title":"~*~I LOVE A CINDERELLA STORY!!~*~","review":"This is a really great soundtrack CD!!!

All of the songs are good if you like music (that is, if you don't pigeonhole yourself into listening to specific genres only, and you're open to all types of music).There is one big problem with this disc, however. Edwin McCain's \\"I'll Be\\" skips at 1:15 into the track. It repeats the last couple of seconds instead of what should be there (so technically, it doesn't skip, but there was a problem in the manufacturing process). At first I thought my encoder messed up, but a second encoding had the same result. I looked at the disc, and it looks perfect, no marks or scratches or anything. I checked it in my stereo, and sure enough, the track skips at 1:15."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cinderella story it's so good","review":"This product was brilliant; all of the songs fit together perfectly.

MxPx and the Goo Goo Dolls are REAL bands. And so is Nine Inch Nails and Chevelle. And if you're into pop, try Natasha Bedingfield, Tori Amos, or Anna Nalick.

I ordered the cd, and was dissappointed that 3 of the 4 songs I was buying it for were not included.1 Busted - Falling for you. Great fun song, why it isn't here is a mystery.2. The football song by Jimmy Eat World3. The song that is playing when Hilary is standing at the top of the steps, in the Wedding dress. It MAY be on the cd by Jesse McCartney, but it is SO different from the film version. Anyone know who the songwriter of the song is? I think it was listed in the film credits as performed and written by the same person. Any Help?My last, and more minor problem is that I would have liked the different Version of \\"I'll Be\\", considering I already have this one on numerous other cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song from Football Scene","review":"In response to someone's request, the song from the Football Scene at the end is:Jimmy Eat WorldHear You Me Lyrics"},{"rating":"2","title":"CINDERELLA STORY OF A SOUNDTRACK!!!!!","review":"This soundtrack features 2 songs from smash superstar Jesse McCartney, and new Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff songs.

She can really sing, and I want her to release an album SOON. Overall this CD Soundtrack is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"Unlike most of the soundtracks from this type of movie, A Cinderella Story Soundtrack is actually pretty good.

I read it in 3 days, and it was so good that I didn't put it down except to eat and sleep, and I didn't sleep much. I really liked how the hero doesn't always win and can be humiliated and unlucky like anyone else. I especially like the parts where it seems like he is going to go crazy and how his hallucinations are described. I was very surprised that this wasn't a best seller; it must have been overlooked or something, and that is a shame, because one of the best writers in the world isnt even on the top 10, while books like Harry Potter and the Magic Pot or something are selling millions of copies. I HIGHLY recommend this book. You'll be glad you got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unnecessary Book","review":"Originally, the manuscript mustn't have found a U.S./U.K. publisher, as is made obvious by the fact that it first appeared in German translation. Consequently, it wormed its way back stateside and Algonquin Books took mercy on it. The book is a cut-and-paste, Readers-Digest-Condensed-Books version of the solid biographies available for each and every woman treated here. The author has not added a shred of original research or insight. Bessie Smith's connection with Harlem was tenuous. She played, and recorded in, New York a few times, but never lived there. A much better choice would have been Mamie Smith - but that would have required research, see? The Queen of Greenwich Village, for instance, was a woman known as Romany Marie. Again, the author would have had to do her homework. And neither Bessie Smith nor Ethel Waters are anything to do with Bohemia. Thus, the reader is tricked by both the book's title and subtitle, as well as by a lazy author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I received this as a birthday present and can actually say that this works great!

Its hard to tell the differences between the sizes of the earpieces but they are actually marginally bigger or smaller than the next.

Unfortunately this isn't the case with my right ear, not samsung or the BT's fault, I just have differently shaped ears (as does everyone). Some will be lucky to have a great fitting BT, some won't.I ordered a set of jabra eargels off ebay anyways to try to see if I can get it to stay in my right ear since I prefer it on that side.Range is amazing! sound quality is excellent and my gf can't tell that I'm on the BT when I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"close but no cigar","review":"The sound quality is great. When I first got it I thought this is it, no need for any expensive bluetooth headsets. However this feeling died fast as the head set never stayed on my ear. It would never take more then 15 minutes before I was putting it back in my ear. If it had a hook to rap around my ear with the earbud piece to help it fit snug it would be a 5 star rating.

Jennifer Jones, loaned to MGM by her husband David O. Selznick, portrays Emma Bovary with flourish, passion and deep intensity. However, her portrayal is marred by severe tics, grimaces and facial contortions which director, Vincente Minnelli failed to control. These flaws in Jones portrayal are a bit distracting. By the last reel one is simply tired of Emma and her wanton ways and her death is a relief and a pleasure. The poor woman didn't know a good thing when she had it..namely a husband as portrayed by Van Heflin who seems miscast in his role. We would have had more sympathy for Emma if a less dynamic leading man had been cast...or a lesser attractive one.

This book does a tremendous job of not only answering these pressing questions, but does a superb job of providing practical advice, tips and questions parents can ask in a format that is easy and enjoyable to read.If I learned anything as a school board member, it was that the parent / teacher partnership is sacred.

In case you don't know the song, it's the one Enid was listening to when dying her hair green, going for a vintage 1977 punk look.

Plus those songs were written by Terry Zwigoff himself, I believe, for the movie so there's an element of camp and toungue-in-cheek added to those songs. They were supposed to be obnoxiously bad! I believe that the \\"We off the hook\\" song in Wowsville (\\"Who could forget this great 50's hit\\") and the noise-industrial-rock song in \\"Zine-O-Phobe\\" (that comic book shop with the annoying \\"redneck hick\\" that gave Thora Birch's character a hard time) were also written by Zwigoff, so be thankful that they weren't included in the soundtrack also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The dying hair song?","review":"Does anyone know the name of the song playing when Enid is dying her hair green?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the Nighthawks Alone","review":"Here's a great CD, a neat mix of new, old and much in between. Now, I have to admit that I'm coming into this as a huge fan of traditional jazz - the more modern pieces on the album do nothing for me.But ah, the vintage recordings are golden, and Vince Giordano's recreations are the kind of stuff I come back to again and again. The focus on Skip James serves as a great introduction to his work - I'm so glad to think of folks of the younger generations discovering these gems, as well as original 78rpm recordings, for the first time. Vince Giordano and his Nighthawks are as splendid as ever (my favorite band, hands down), featured in four selections. Their right-on-target renditions of great early jazz blend in perfectly with the original recordings featured - it's the real McCoy, only minus surface noise.So sue me - the newer music contained just isn't my cup of tea.

I love the Bollywood song, and the old blues records are good, too. Should they have left the intentionally bad contemporary songs on the album? I think so. The \\"rap\\" song is really short, so it's not too intrusive. And the modern blues song works well as a parody of contemporary blues songs.

However, I glanced at the cover and thought this is what my husband keeps claiming is needed even for the Feds in an international economy. Plus I must admit I grew up with brilliant self-destructive Wile eating the Road Runner's dust. I decided to read this book and found it humorously entertaining with references to the Warner cartoon universe and with specific pointers on how to compete in the age of overwhelming instant information where objects communicate and not just in C language. Though quite interesting, well written, and cleverly packaged, this how to not suicide in business by really trying. It offers nothing new even with its \\"seven new rules of the road\\". Sports teams from the fifties and sixties or even the recent Yankees and Bulls understood and implemented that teamwork and learning are the keys to winning.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh New Approach to Business Advice","review":"Beep Beep is refreshing - not only for its unique choice of the Warner cartoon characters whose antics serve as a metaophor and offer object lessons for business success - but also for the lessons themselves. There are loads of new ideas here - practical ways to build customer partnerships and create a more customer-focused organziation. The best part is you can apply most of them right away - and they do get results. I'm going to keep this book close by for awhile - and re-read portions particularly appropriate for my business (sales). The ideas look simple on the surface - but they gain strength as you spend time with them. Powerful stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beep Beep","review":"WOW...just finished reading Beep Beep.

Death Metal?","review":"I've heard a couple/few songs throughout Testament's albums where the lead singer uses a growly/death metal voice, but this album is ridiculous. The whole album is death metal. I've very glad this was just a one album thing, cuz this was horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"well that was unexpected","review":"This cd from the first track just catches you off guard...Chuck takes a different turn on the vocals and really pushes how heavy the band can be. Low comes out to suprise you with who the band was. While this coems out with an explosion with who the band could really be. We read reviews of how good Alex Skolnick really is. He is an amazing guitarist but james has really placed a mark on the band behind some of their hardest and heaviest hitting cds. While the sheer talent and skill may not be their the heart is and I will listen to James any day over Alex. The cd has all the riffs, power and heaviness of low, but brings a new element, chuck is now pushing his vox beyond the norm. A large death metal aspect is added to this thrash metal band that adds pounds per pounds and punch for punch heavieness. While still not my all time fav this lies near low and just under The Gathering. Testament is a force to be dealt with and these are the cds that have made their mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dig it soooo much! \\\\m/","review":"I own the re-release by Prosthetic. Oh man! This is full of crunchy riffs and powerful grunting vocals from Chuck Billy. You bet it is like no other Testament release, but these guys excel on this thrashy death metal variant anyways. Just the energetic \\"The Burning Times\\" is worth the price of the entire album! Production-wise, this is just perfect. The rhythm section is intense and pounding, and the guitar riffs will get you air-guitaring until your wrists will melt. However, it's a shame there are not too many flashy solos (I do miss Skolnick) and that \\"Hatreds Rise\\" sounded to me so close to Scorpion's \\"The Sails Of Charon\\". But besides those two very minor flaws, this is enjoyable... as hell -- he, he. Crank it up to eleven, bang your head and you'll see... It's just so nice when artists dare to throw you a curveball!

This is a short album in the tradition of \\"Around The World In A Day\\" or \\"Parade\\". Prince gets right down to business. This soundtrack works better than most because there's a common theme.

Though \\"Batdance\\" reached the top of the charts, it exists primarily as a novelty single.

Annoying to say the least!!!Then a day later I noticed one of the buttons didn't make any sound at all. Now I had two buttons causing me problems. It looks decent and sounds nice but what is the point of having an instrument if you can't play it! The handle had a screw that kept coming loose. I thought this particular one was maybe a fluke so I sent it back and got another one. I just wanted to be able to play a concertina and the price was decent. So I gave it another try.

While in Hawaii, Gidget surfs, water skis, tries to make Moondoggie jealous, and survives a scandal! There are a couple scenes that could have been left out: a dance by character Eddie Horner--people on vacation would not go to see him dance. However, Eddie is one of the sides of the love triangle.

Maybe mine was defective, but based on customer pictures I've seen of this device where they stick something on the tempo dial so they can turn it, I'd say I'm not the only one to have this issue.Too bad.

I liked the wheel and large digital display, much easier to jump to different values without those tedious up and down buttons. But the wheel is almost impossible to turn if on a music stand! One has to put down their instrument, use one hand to hold the metronome, and one finger to turn the wheel. Even that is a bit challenging due to the stylish but useless indent on the wheel. Still, I liked the product enough to risk a modification. I driilled a tiny hole in the wheel, and then screwed a 1/4 inch bead on the wheel so I could push the wheel around with one finger(I have the metronome in a frame to hold it tightly to the music stand.

I play congas and I love the ease of flipping on a clave rhythm and playing along. I wish there was also a 6/8 clave or bell pattern, but no such luck. As for other features, the sound is decent, the volume is mostly sufficient, although a little more would sometimes be nice. All in all, a great value and I would definitely buy it again.

What about the real names for G-d. Like Hashem and Eloheim and Adonai. Where did those flutter off to? Because those names are not included or explained. This book is a total misrepresentation. It eschews traditional kabbalah and its only merit is as a coffee table book or an art book. The title is totally deceiving.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"First of all, as one of the reviewers mentioned, this book has nothing to do with kabala. Second, there are no explanations regarding why the 72 three-letter combinations mean what the writer says they do, you just have to take his word for it. Third, they do not appear to work at all, and I gave it an honest open-minded try. Finally, when at the end of the book pronunciations of the letter combinations are given, some letters have numerous pronunciations, which further diminishes credibility of his whole theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but some problem with design in color","review":"I had a problem with the color of the content. The silver used throughout the book does not work with the other colors especially gray. The silver is nice, but when used with graysh colors, it was not visually effective. The design should have had more consideration in colors.The content is nothing but a list of 72 names and the definition of them, with pretty images with bad color selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in new condition ..!!","review":"The seller post a this beutiful book ..

Books like this are of the demonic realm and should be avoided. What the author calls \\"technology\\" is nothing but Satanic philosophy pretending to create what cannot be brought about without the power of Jesus Christ to transform the human soul. To experience your new life, you must repent of your sins, deny yourself, and live through the power of the Resurrection and shed blood of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Authentic Kabbalah","review":"This is totally opposite Kabbalah Methodology.

It is a nice book. It references the Kabbalah. It has 72 names for God in Hebrew. I can even meditate on each name or it's concept.The question is why? Use it for daily affirmations or whatever you like, but I don't consider this as any type of reading material if you are interested in the Kabbalah.I appreciate the author's love for his work, but would have liked to see a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Table Book with Little-to-No Value","review":"This book is difficult to read because of the colors and stylistic layout.

If you want a great book on making great bread, buy either Crust and Crumb or The Bread Baker's Apprentice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handmade Breadmaker's Heaven","review":"I found this book very useful, even though I am a confirmed bread machine user and this book is intended for handmade bread makers. The chapter on grains is an indispensable guide for any cook, as it covers storage, selection and cooking grains; as well as a description of eleven different types of grain, from the various wheats to kamut, rye and more. You will also find information on leavening agents, sweeteners and tools. The 250+ recipes cover quick breads, sourdough, yeasted, flat and natural rise breads; and includes spreads, sauces and sandwiches. The chapter on sourdoughs gave me the knowledge and confidence to begin making a sourdough myself (it makes a delicious and aromatic bread). My favorite recipes to be found in this book are \\"Mellow Muffins\\", \\"Got the Blues Muffins\\", \\"Fruit Sauce Raisin Bread\\" \\"Sourdough Grits Bread\\" and \\"Sprouted Wheat Bread\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sad, pathetic (but unique) creature!","review":"An extraordinary life - an extraordinary misfit.

His style may be a bit too much for the reviewer below, but don't be put off - this is an absorbing read. It will, inevitably, reach about as few people as her music did, so I salute Mr Witts for taking on this task. By the way, James Young's book \\"Songs They Never Play On The Radio\\" documents his time playing with Nico in the eighties.While it is not in the same class as this book, it complements it as Mr Witts has, understandably, focussed on the more important earlier years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject matter destroyed.","review":"Nico was indeed an icon.

Sadly, this \\"demastering\\" ruined the album with a ludicrously overblown bass boost. On both of my two music systems (hi-end and well-tuned) this remix inflicts boomy headbanger bass onto what previously was a gloriously balanced jazz performance.

First off the Laser guide required a seperate battery, not a large problem but a bit of nuisance, after all if you make a battery powered saw why not operate the laser off the main battery? the main problem, However was that the saw batteries simply would not hold a charge, by the third recharge I was lucky to have enough power to cut a single one by board. Both batteries were sub-standard, the tool was useless, If this was Kawasaki's initial entry into the cordless tool market I suggest they go back to the drawing board and come up with a decent Battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like I wanted","review":"Needed the laser light to cut paneling for wainscot .

First it consumes batteries (3 AAA) as fast as my daughter consumes bottles. Generally about every 2-3 days it needs new batteries - and that's with having it plugged in most of the time. And because the battery cover is a screw, it's not easy to change. Secondly, the low battery monitor continues to go off even when the unit is turned off. So the only way to get it to stop is to remove the batteries.I would look at another product instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent long distance monitor","review":"This monitor works for long distances, but it's not a very user friendly monitor. My children's room is about 180 feet from ours, so tge regular monitors I tried didn't work. This Fisher-Price one does, but it also has lots of static, so every night I wage a battle between turning it up enough to hear my kids but then needing to turn it down to quiet the static. The volume dial isn't very sensitive, so it's easy to turn the monitor up too high or down too low. The green light that shows the monitor is on is very bright, so I usually throw a towel over it or the room is bathed in a green glow. All that said, though, the monitor does work over \\"long\\" distances - we've gotten it to go about 300 feet - so I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for older folks too!","review":"The baby monitor works well for aging parents as well.

It is a bit thick (i.e. long sleeve shirts with cuffs need to be loosened a bit) but everything else about it looks great. My only other caution would be to make sure you are within 500 miles of the radio signal site (Colorado).

This stand-alone novel is well written with great characterization (a strong point of Feist) with a wonderful blend of Irish, German Folklore combined in today's world, make this book impossible to put down. If you are a fan of Feist and have not read this book yet then you should read it while waiting for his next book. If you have not read any of Feist's work, then this would be a good starting point.

This novel is at times a light romance, whimsical fantasy, historical fiction and soft porn - to name a few. However, none of these elements gel and one is left with a feeling by the end of the book that you don't really know the characters well, and for that matter don't really care what happens to them. There are an awful lot of characters introduced throughout the book, however the main action in the climax and conclusion involves only a handful - actually less - so all the \\"character development\\" that has been painstakingly undertaken previously is for nought.

Also the never ending re-chewing of Celtic mythology (more, in a wrong way!!!) is boring too. Some new ideas?

Every free moment I had, my nose was in that book. At night I would stay awake until my eyes hurt and I couldnt see straight. Then I'd go get some water, rub my eyes and keep reading until I fell asleep.After I finished I looked for other books on the same subject and all I could find were the same stories and behaviors we hear from Disney.

Right out of the package you can see how flimsily made it is. The vest comes in only one size: huge. Unless you are very tall and very large expect it to fit like a dress. You can use safety pins to pull it in a bit, but that is about all you can do. Like another unfortunate reviewer I purchased the Grip vest for use at night during a relay race. It broke down at the starting line. At that point I tossed it in the garbage. This vest might work (and I emphasize might) if you do not mind wearing an oversized vest and plan to use it while standing still.

Neither of us could get them to work and eventually returned both of them.Even if we could have gotten them to work, the lack of information on the front of the player is really irritating. Plus, the on light never goes off, and winks back at you any time you use the remote for some other device. But the worst thing of all was the non-reponsiveness of the buttons. I clicked and clicked and clicked and only a third of the time would the unit respond. This was true with both the buttons on the machine and on the remote. My friend had the same experience.I recommend you stay away from this player and spend a little extra money on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste your money?","review":"Do not buy any product made by Orbitron.

Gene Kelly plays D'Artagnan as though he were in a musical, which isn't surprising since George Sidney directs \\"The Three Musketeers\\" as though it were \\"Anchors Aweigh.\\" At least Kelly doesn't sing. This 1948 production finds plenty of actors stuck in the wrong genre: Lana Turner, Van Heflin, June Allyson, Vincent Price, Gig Young, Frank Morgan and Keenan Wynn! Only Angela Lansbury and Reginald Owen emerge unscathed. Sidney approaches the Dumas adventure with an uneasy, uncertain tone - not helped by the cheerfully garish Technicolor.

I was truly amazed.It was just a really good movie, and the four actors portraying the Musketeers had great chemistry together, especially Gene & Van Heflin. The sets were okay, the costumes were very good, the acting was great, and in some cases, such as with Vincent Price, outstanding.

Topics such as embalming, the moral character of funeral directors, the viewing of the body, and the role of religion seem to be things that throughout the decades we are always circling around but never really confronting. Therefore, the same debates keep coming up on the same subjects.

The nose and brow ridge protectors keep the sweat off the lenses, but these protectors eventually disintegrate from the perspiration in about 6 months.

Then a couple of years ago I rented the video and couldn't believe how gory it was. Even though this movie came out in 1972, it's just as gory as any \\"Friday the 13th\\" film. A man's hand is chopped off, a guy is shot point blank in the eye with blood and brains oozing out of the socket, and a woman in a wheelchair has her head lopped off with blood spurting from the neck.

I never had a student that could sound the three notes cleanly in their first several lessons. After using the method for several years I realized that it was probably too difficult for young children (4-7). I decided to make my own method, which I have had great success with.

My 3 month old loves \\"making music together.\\" Of course \\"making music together\\" is better for small babies because they like music and you should always sing to them. \\"Moving together\\" is for babies that can already move a lot more, walk, etc...so maybe that's part of the reason I didn't like it. I found the songs a lot less catchy and the situations a lot less cute in general. I don't really like the presence of Sarah Jessica Parker, maybe because I associate her with \\"Sex and the City\\" and she just seems out of place on a video for babies.

The Robert Larson brace was more than twice the price of the Fuller model, but the Larson is better built and did the job I needed of it well. For me, I would rather buy a more expensive, more robust tool and know that it was going to last.

Consequently, the jaw quickly stripped my 1/4\\" hex-shank bit's shank, ruining the auger; 2) The threads that engage and tighten the chuck aren't machined, they're simply roughly cast, making it very sticky and impossible to apply sufficient gripping tension to a bit shank, even if the jaws themselves were adequately designed.In short, I am absolutely, completely, utterly dissatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!","review":"Used the whole bottle on a very very small spot of nail fungus and it did nothing.

Along with those well-built vessels, so they also provided the men to act as crew - all of whom had to contend with the perils of an unforgiving coastline. In many ways, this is their story.This distinguished author has brought many an account of ships, shipwrecks and piracy to life in his detailed works over many years. On this occasion, however, he surpasses all previous works as he follows the exploits, adventures and mishaps which befell the men from this region. In so doing he recounts tales, true experiences, of shipwreck on foreign shores and in open ocean, of murder, cannibalism and piracy. There are also instances of enslavement by the famous Barbary Corsairs who used the men folk from this land to man their galleys.This a wondrous work, made all the more so because it is also the work of a master narrator.NM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Excellent book, very few errors.

He said some terrible things even though there was a kid in the audience. At one point, Russell even said that and his mother (I hope he was kidding on this) was also in the audience, which is even more terrible. He said repeatedly that he has a lot of money. I do not understand how that is funny or relevant to his comedy? Complete waste of time. Do check some snippets of the video to see if you like it before you buy it.

I guess my \\"mind was blasted.\\" Peters knows how to play the audience well and things that happen in the audience only seemed to add to the jokes without any letup in the pace. Russell is a master of capturing different ethnic accents and no matter who he picked on, it seemed that those people laughed out loud.Now I know that an Indian ghost is not scary and that there are different levels of cheapness among ethnicities.

You can't watch tv without the annoying buzz in the background. To quiet it down and feel the vibration, you have to really press your feet in, which is not relaxing at all.

Faced with scrounging up some batteries or finding a cord, I opted to dig up an adapter...bad idea. The unit started vibrating. I put my feet on it and had to press them down pretty hard to feel the weak vibration. I could have just set my cell phone to vibrate and placed my feet on it and got about the same quality massage. A few minutes later, I noticed a funny smell and realized that the unit was smoking. I guess using electric power instead of battery power was too much for the old girl.

But if you love the best work of these artists you'll be alternately snoozing (at the music) and laughing (at Lydia's third-rate Goth-raps).There's nothing especially annoying about this disk (maybe there should have been), it just sounds like all three musicians' usual tricks watered down to a bland consistency. And I'm not sure if the word \\"industrial\\" means anything any more; it's thrown around so often that it's becoming an umbrella term for anything with no tune, energy, traditional instruments, or content besides poseur morbidity.

Roof design takes some patience but you can do fairly complex roofs with practice.If you want the best 3D rendering look for newer software, but if you just need an inexpensive, basic design tool this works very well.

The realism is terrible. I aimed a pitch right down the middle, threw it very hard, and it ended up being a close call on a pitch down and in! Another instance is I had the bases loaded, and the batter grounded back to the pitcher. Double play right? Wrong. The picher caught the ball and took his time and lobbed the ball to the plate. The runner was barely out and no double play. I was holding X the whole time, too. They also over-exagerate on the super-stars. Randy Johnson is now a submarine pithcher. In the homerun derby Jason Giambi hits like 12 homers in a row, then gets 3 outs in a row. Another problem in Triple Play is that you either get out or hit a homer. When you do hit a homer it doesn't even show how far it went. Very bad game. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triple Play Baseball","review":"Triple Play Baseball for PS2, is a awsome!

You can control your picthes with ease and your hitting is also simple to configure. This game captures in true definition, the looks of all the Baseball stadiums. TPB's Animation is great, you can see everything from the fustration in the batters or pitchers faces to the dirt on their uniforms from a slide. The sound quality for TPB is awsome!

The base running give you the player about 25%of control of your base runners. The tend to steal and advance to the next base without any command giving the defense the free will to threw you out with ease.

What EA really needs is to make the batting cursor/visible strike zone OPTIONAL. For a beginner, this would come in handy, but for hardcore baseball fans and gamers, the batting cursor/visible strike zone must go. It's too easy to hit the ball! That's no fun. As a result, boredom is inevitable and replay value is low. So, I returned TP and bought High Heat, which is the only baseball game out on the market that DOES NOT have the batting cursor/visible strike zone, but the graphics look like PS1.

I think it has the best graphics out of the three PS2 baseball games.Now the bad: If you want a 1-P game, this game may suit your need if you just want to smash home-runs after another.

First, the fielding in the game is awkward and slow. It was a major mistake of EA Sprots to drop the automatic fielding option in the game from previous years. Second, there are no historical players, like in Triple Play 2001. I always thought it was fun to be able to get Babe Ruth off the free agent market. My advice: stick to last year's version.

I gave this four stars because personally it's a little to high scoring for my tastes. I am looking forward to tyring out HHBB which while the graphics are'nt as good, it makes up for it in realism.

The graphics were good. Thats where my praise ends. The Announcing is terrible, I can't stand it. The AI stinks to high heaven (Shortstops going way into the outfield to get the ball.)The fielding stinks, I couldn't catch anything sometimes.

When a fielder does catch a ball, they are not quick to get it to the appropriate fielder...firt baseman, cut off man, etc. When pitching... if the batter takes practice swings...the pitcher cannot start his windup.

The game play is completely unrealistic. For some reason, it's easier to get a hit off of Pedro or the Rocket than off of some loser like Pettitte. You can NEVER walk, making it less fun, and there is no way to bunt for a base hit. You can't move in the batter's box without starting the runners sometimes thanks to the direction you move, and occasionally the game freezes up. The funniest thing I found, is that Matt Perisho throws a 110 mph sinker. It's completely ludicrace. The guy can't even throw 90. There is no franchise mode! This has to be my biggest gripe. Why couldn't they add some farm systems and a franchise mode? How hard would that be?

Wiffle ball is way more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too High Scoring even in All-Star Mode","review":"I love the games that EA Sports has put out ont the past. I could always depend on them to create the best sport games of the bunch.Was I ever wrong with Triple Play for the Playstation 2. Many of the things others have mentioned I also do not like. I have very high scoring games even in All-Star mode. The fielding interface makes it hard to catch any fly ball that is not hit near you in the outfield. I have players hitting HR's as much as the big HR hitters.Unfortunatly, I forked out $.. for this game. I will be renting other baseball games now before I buy them to see if they are any better.Anyone looking to purchase this game should rent it first to see if they like it. I would rent some others to compare it with as well.One more thing, Where is the Living Room field for the Home Run Challenge? I liked the off beat fields for a change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring","review":"This game is made for very young children. Its not realistic at all. You can hit homerun after homerun if you know what you're doing -- regardless of who's playing who. The stats, details and game-play are all totally simplistic.I've had this game for one full day, and I think I might be done with it. Don't waste your money. The only people who should buy this game are (maybe) younger kids. Any real baseball fan will be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you really want?","review":"This is a good, fun game. If you are looking for a realistic game this probably isnt for you, but the graphics are incredible, and its just fun to play.

The graphics are excellent. The best I have seen on PS2 so far. But, as a sports junkie, I alwats find the best sports game are those with a general manager mode. EA has been the cornerstone of in-depth Season modes for sports games. TP is no different. Trades, Drafts, Free Agency. Its all here. The gameplay is a little lacking in the fact there is no automatic fielding. Getting the hang of playing of the field is very hard. Had there been a automatic fielding made I would have given TP 5 stars. A excellent start to the PS2 platform for Triple Play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly written, insightful story","review":"A tough tale but held me from beginning to end.

Banks is Raymond carverish, very plugged in to the struggle for self- expression. Superior narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"As I read, I was filled with hope.","review":"In the end I was disappointed. Throughout the book two separate stories take place. One is a record of Bob Dubois, whose life is ruled by circumstances and bad life management skills. The other tells of Vanise Dorsinville, a young Haitian woman, who struggles to survive as she makes her way to America. Neither is a pretty story, and when the two characters finally meet it gets even worse. When I finished reading this book I was angry at myself for muddling through all the italicized Haitian accent dialogue and French Creole voodoo terminology.

The writing is insufferably grand and serious in comparison to the mundane material, the characters are unrelatable caricatures, and the story (or as much as I could read of it) is depressing, predictable, and, in places, gratuitously pornographic. Back in the 80s folks thought stuff like this was \\"gritty\\" and \\"hard-edged.\\" Me? I just find it intolerable.If you can't tell, I didn't like it.

There is not a single character in this book worth knowing about. There is not a single event worth hearing about.

Bob Dubois is a classic tragic figure, unable to effectively control his own destiny; constantly at the mercy of others and unable to love or be loved. Whenever he has a moral choice, he weakens and destroys the only thing of any worth; his humanity. His pain is so palpable, that reading the book is physically exhausting. Banks is bent on illustrating the consequences of a life not well lived. This book confirms his genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy","review":"Just exactly what my boyfriend needs for the summer. It's very comfy and casual, great for the summer.

What kind of a roaster is THAT, I ask you??? They will replace the roaster but now I think of it as merely a lasagna pan with a rack.

She used it a total of nine times in about two and a half years of ownership, for such things as holiday turkeys and hams, and for roasting pork shoulders for pork barbecue. It was on the pork shoulders that the roaster exhibited the same behavior that so many others have reported. The Teflon coating started to bubble and peel, to the point that about 30 percent of the roaster was exposed bare metal. Fortunately, very little of the Teflon got into the meat, and we were able to save it. But the roaster was toast, and KitchenAid refused to replace it. She'd had it too long, even though it had hardly been used. I can only advise others to avoid this product.

Might as well have purchased a disposable pan for a few dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-made, but shouldn't have gotten a nonstick roasting pan","review":"This pan, like my previous experience with KitchenAid products, is sturdy, well-made, and a good design (mechanically speaking) for the task. My only complaint is that it's nonstick - I knew this going in, but am now realizing that nonstick is less than ideal for a pan that routinely gets stuff baked onto it, which requires scrubbing.

After trying it out, I noticed the direction pad (left side) did not work as I would like it to. Too often when I try to move in a single direction, I hit another directional button, which can be frustrating. This seems to be because the directional pad, instead of having the 4 directions separate, has them linked together in that circular piece that moves as you press any of the directions. This makes it easier to move in diagonal directions, but more difficult for simple movements in only one direction. Other than that, I have no problems with the controller.

When you attack life as David Livingstone did, head on fearlessly, you bring the excitement with you! Trough a lion attack, threats from canibals,injurious falls, malaria, wrong information, lost rivers, frequent separation from his familly, David Livingstone never flinched nor lost his fervor to press on to do what God called and continuously kept calling him to do. Because of his perseverance to Map Africa in a day before airplanes and GPS, for the purpose of getting the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ to people in darkness, He pressed on. When others thought he should give up, or criticized him, or equipment failed, he pressed on. If you have sons who want to read about righteous adventure, let them read a TRUE adventure.

Wouldn't get it again, even though I love the actual mold shapes. Plus cybertrayd shipped 5 business days after my order, which doesn't adhere to Amazon policy.

I am still wondering those who read the review and still purchase this product must have found the item delighted in some other ways. For example, falling apart might not be so bad since you can disassemble them and wash each and every part thoroughly!! Even though I don't like the part that it will fall apart, I do find it is quite handy when you use it to make a creamy kind of soup in the non-stick pot.

A must read for anyone who's had trouble explaining his or her mariage to the parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too heavy, not too light--A great first novel","review":"Nina Solomon's book is full of some of the freshest writing I have read in quite a while. This particular story has a few holes and a couple of paths that lead to dead ends, but the characters are so real and interesting that I still really liked it. And once again, the writing is great. Solomon never seems to run out of new ways to describe things that a less artful writer would probably ignore just to avoid using cliches. (Or worse, would use cliches, which would sink this story with banality.)Oh, and I love the ending which you'll just have to read yourself. Knowing how and when to stop writing takes enormous skill. Kudos to Solomon and her editor just for that.Nina Solomon is definitely on my list of writers to watch. I can't wait to see what she does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty, Manhattan tour-de-force","review":"This is Solomon's debut novel, and it's a winner. Women who live/work in Manhattan are a quirky breed, and Grace Brookman is no exception: she's living a lie, trying to hide the fact that her husband has left her yet again. The machinations and details she attends to in order to preserve the secret of her embarrassment are hilarious and very telling as to what mid-town life in the Big Apple is all about. I mean, she even cares if her CLEANING LADY finds out! Then...something clicks, she decides to make some changes within herself, and with a certain leopard jacket comes self-awareness...Very neat little package, this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Grace","review":"I loved this novel. I read it over a weekend and continue to think about Grace, and all the other characters in this sweet,funny,thoughtful and engaging first novel.

Mmmmmmmmkay. She's a rich, cold, bored housewife...no, not very likeable and certainly not a sympathetic character. Add to this the brief, inconsequential details of a conspiracy surrounding the husband's absence which, unfortunately, were not enough to keep me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple of good quotes, but not much else","review":"I just checked this book out from the library after reading a review about it in People magazine. In the review it sounded like an upbeat, almost comedic novel about a woman truly finding herself after being released from the imposition of another's will (see The Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin). Unfortunately, I found very little upbeat in this novel and spent most of the time wondering if she wasn't just going slowly mad. The fact that she would go to such lengths to deceive everyone around her, when many knew the truth anyway was a little bizarre. I never really got the whole private investigator line and felt like Laz was lurking around the corner throughout the whole story.I loved Chloe and got a couple of good quotes from Grace's visit in Chicago, but other than that I was sorely disappointed in this book and won't be jumping at the chance to read another by this author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The whole time I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. The entire plot is outlined in about the first ten pages, and then the rest of the book repeats basically the same events over and over. I found the main character so inactive as to be annoying. She managed to actively create the appearance that her husband was still there, but that's about all she does. I was also amazed that the more practical issues of her husband's disappearance, those related to money since he generated the only income and paid the bills, weren't really addressed. The author makes references to bills being unopened and past due, but Grace merely writes checks and solves the problems. Finally when she does act, at the very end of the book, we're left with a wholly unsatisfying, too vague ending. I think my strong dislike of Grace made it impossible to enjoy this book more."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Do not waste your money. Even if someone gives it to you do not waste your time. This book is worse that the worse sitcom. How do these things get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and painful","review":"The novel was grammatically well written but painful slow in terms of the plot. The main character did not grab me and for the most part, struck me as being very idiotic. That was my main reason for not liking the novel. One of the other reasons at the top of my list is that it was not until page 232 or so that we finally got to the part where it seemed the wife was being followed, or that there was something sinister happening with her husband that could be a possible link to his disappearance. The jacket listed that as one of the selling points of the novel. I was not happy being made to read 200+ pages of the same nonsense only to get to what did not end up being as suspensful as promised. This novel was about 150 pages too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD set contains EDITED episodes....","review":"Unfortuately the practice of studios using the edited for syndication versions of shows rather than going back to the uncut masters (as seen on the network) continues with THAT'S MY MAMA.

This is the third one, after Orphans and Wildflowers. Unfortunately, this miniseries was the worst he had written so far. None of the stories reflected V.C. Andrews, and all four stories fell flat. Mental disorders (Cinnamon's mother, Rose's mother, Honey's grandpa) are caricaturized as to make these characters unsympathetic because their insane episodes are written so comically. Personally, I think Cinnamon was the best story of the four - but that's not saying much as all four stories were terrible but Cinnamon's story only SLIGHTLY less so despite her mother and her completely weird antics.The conclusion to this series, Falling Stars, is also extremely lackluster, and if you're a fan of VCA (or the books written under her name), this is definitely a series to avoid. The Wildflowers, while lackluster in its own right, was a better series than this one because the Wildflowers focused more on family secrets and was more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, excellent - utterly dynamite ukelele playing","review":"For more than just Ukelele fans.

It's extremely overpriced for the clarity that it offers to anyone attempting to learn for the first time. I am using it in my Modern Physics course right now and find that it is void of details necessary to offer a thorough, precise introduction.

I just wasted 2 hours of valuable finals study time reading sections 1.1 through 4.4 looking for the solution, only to turn 2 pages ahead after giving up to find the necessary information right there... words cannot express how enraged I was after discovering this and I hope this review will save some others from lighting their book on fire and throwing it out the window like I almost just did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Modern Phyics Book","review":"Does a decent explanation and derivation of the basic ideas and equations necessary for relativity and modern physics.

It goes through history and experiments too much and doesn't focus on the concepts. The book gives equations that are complicated (that is until you self teach yourself how they work).

I may as well have been eating lemon-scented glue sticks.Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety. Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later. They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.I will never buy cheap marzipan again, and I have thrown out the bulk marzipan that I purchased from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of marzipan!","review":"I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.

I consider myself a light reader and I was never once distracted by the way in which Park chose to present the material. Rather than use an overly bombastic tone, he presents it in a nearly conversational, concise, and easy-to-read prose. I too felt that the book ended too early, and the organization of the various stories throughout the book served to keep me interested to see how each would resolve.

What is great about the scientific method is that it's designed to bring mistakes out into the open. Unfortunately, many people have a misunderstanding of the scientific method and lose touch, believing in phenomena that will simply not stand up to scrutiny. Sometimes scientists are guilty of this error, and the credulous public is flim-flammed. Worse still, the public seems to enjoy being flim-flammed. I turned on the TV today and there was a \\"psychic\\", claiming to be communicating with members' of the audience dead loved ones. Such nonsense! I wish I could've been there to expose him.

Earlier I had come across discussions of pseudo science and junk science, but this book gives a clear, coherent in-depth analysis of pseudo-science and junk science. Several examples are given: the inside story behind Star-Wars X ray laser failure, Cold-fusion, Anti-gravity etc and attempts to cover these up. These may be well known (and well kept secret) to the insiders within those groups but Prof.Parks exposes them to the public in an easy, readable manner. Then he exposes the usual charlatans like those touting Quantum healing and Perpetual Motion Machine. More complex and debatable issues, like the demerits of manned space exploration, effect of power lines on cancer etc are also dicussed. However I am not fully swayed by those although Prof Parks has raises good points I was not aware of.

Dr Park has been campaigning against voodoo science in its foams for 20 years. His book outlines his experiences. In gebral the book does not aim to deride silly science as amuch as other like minded efforts have; however, he does make his point. The style is rather gentle for thsi genre and very narrative. More importnatly, the focus of the book is its criticism of bad science within the scientific community itself, rather thanan all out attack, only, on nut-job UFO \\"researchers\\" or new-age archaeologists. A notable example of bad science he notes are is the space station. He also targets those who, having made wild claims about some amazing new phenomenon,lie rather than admit they were wrong.

Park's methods are ridicule, character assassination, and an arrogant omission of published data that disagree with his premonitions. This book is a perfect example of Science becoming Religion in the hands of a master of public relations. Skeptics must address the literature, especially the peer-reviewed kind, and refute the methods or conclusions. In the case of global warming, cold fusion, magnetic healing and other topics, Park most certainly did not do this. Of about 12 published reviews, only 3 showed outrage at Park's methods, and only one was written by a reviewer who bothered to look up the facts on one topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a balanced portrayal","review":"I've been reading Bob Park's What's New column from the American Physical Society for some years now and this book appears to be a booklength version of that column. Park is not an objective physicist by any means. Physicists must walk a fine line between skepticism and open mindedness. Unfortunately, Park is simply skeptical and prefers to attack research which he doesn't understand (and doesn't try to understand!) rather than look at the research with an open mind.

Much of the material is about issues that most people have heard of (power lines causing cancer for instance). It explains scientifically why the claims are not valid and gives a historical account of the debunking of them. My only criticism is that Park does spend a bit too much time on perpetual motion devices and could have covered some other topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodoo Science is a must have.","review":"Voodoo Science is a must have for every Skeptic's bookshelf.

Unlike other books on Pseudoscience this book explores both the psychology and the faulty science behind such clams as homeopathy.

From the dark \\"main titles\\" to the fun \\"Face-Off\\" to the expolsive \\"Final Confrontation\\", this soundtrack has it all.

I will never buy a T-Fal product again because this shattered without any warning, pressure, etc. and I do not trust it around anyone.

Well they were right. I never put cold water into the hot pan. I seasoned before I started. I did what you're supposed to do. I'd guess the bottom thickness isn't adequate and the TFAL circle pops up from the bottom when on the stove. It's a bit elevated so any liquid pools to the sides unfortunately. The lid also has a \\"knob\\" that is too close to the glass lid, so you can burn yourself pretty easily. I actually use an old lid from a same sized pan so I don't care about the lid flaw. I'd love to return this (anyone from amazon reading this?) but I waited too long even though this warping started within a month or so. Don't buy this model.

My stove & the bottom of the pan Warped really Bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan","review":"This pan is absolutley great, i recommend this pan to everyone, it's big, cooks great without having to use a high heat and the deepness also helps with splashes from sauces"},{"rating":"2","title":"For what I was looking for, this is perfect","review":"Very happy with this purchase. I'm just a college student so I needed something that was a decent price and had some durability too it. Found this, bought it and have been happy ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted - 4 uses!","review":"As others mentioned, this pan is made in China. It's lightweight and not sturdy. However it looked nice upon arrival. After 4 uses, it has warped. It no longer sits flat on the surface (a flat cooktop) and a gentle nick on the handle sends it spinning away. It was used a total of 4 times over 2 weeks. Now to see what T-Fal will do for me. It was not put in the oven or used over high heat or abused in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan, not perfect quality","review":"While this is an excellent pan and will cook everything without sticking. I was not impressed with the condition that it came in. There were big scratches on the handle of the lid that my mom (whom I bought it for) had to sand off in order to keep from cutting her hand. Hopefully this was a fluke and not a common occurence. I do recommend this type of pan for anyone though. It is EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly serviceable inexpensive pan, high capacity","review":"This is what you'd expect-- a well made, low-end pan. It's light and thin-bottomed, but the glass lid is nice and tight and the nonstick surface is excellent. The handles are comfortable and sturdy, which is good because the pan borders on huge and can be heavy when full. It cooks just fine, though the thinness of the bottom is going to mean you have to be careful about heat distribution. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend more on quality","review":"cheap is cheap, this pan does not even sit level on my flat top electric stove top"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like a quality pan","review":"I bought this a couple months ago, and have used it a few times since. The non-stick surface and size of the pan are great. The drawback and reason for only four stars is due to the directions. They say to go above medium heat which limits some of the cooking that can be done in the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it !!","review":"I bought this for my wife cause she loves to cook and she was sooooo happy, hubby done good !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and gritty","review":"What a great read. The story is at turns violent, insightful, clever, and funny. The characters are thoroughly believable -- from the series' regular cops to the minor characters(especially Doleen). And ever since I read 'No Human Involved' I've believed that Munch is a very real person. This ain't no cozy. And I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing geologist!","review":"I had Chernicoff as a geology professor at the University of Washington, and we used his book. Not only were his classes fascinating, but his book was fabulous. The way he put it together and explained everything was fantastic; he excells at making those of us foreign to the world of geology interested in the subject (especially undergrads who are taking a geology class because it's required!). Furthermore, he does so in a way that is easily understandable and not at all confusing. He gives countless examples of what he is describing throughout, making the material even more easy to digest. It is easy to tell that he has a passion for what he does; it shows through in his writing. This is a perfect starting place for those interested in geological matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful book.","review":"I loved this book. I have enjoyed all of Fern Michaels books especially the trilogy ones. This book was very well written. I was kind of confused at some point, for example, when did Logan Kelly receive the check from Stedman. I was extremely happy when Logan got his at the end of the book. $69.00 to live on was to much if you ask me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily I didn't buy it new!","review":"I simply can't believe this is on the best seller list! I actually read some of the pages outloud to my husband for a good laugh. She talks about a hotdog dinner for three pages. Think I skipped most of the book. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars to this one..","review":"I picked this book up at a time i was in need of a good read and boy was i disappointed! The situations were so contrived and unbelieveable! Its fiction but please a little bit of reality is needed! Who brings a woman they don't know all the way from Africa to the U.S, sets up a job and house for her out of what sympathy?? The heroine was so weak, has no backbone, is so unlikeable and full of self pity! The dialogue was very poor, the children, yes we were set up to hate Logan from the very beginning but something about him must have been good at one time!And the list goes on and on. Never picking up this author again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Characters","review":"Very little character development. I didn't like the \\"heroine\\" most of the time because she was incredibly stupid. I hoped to see her \\"grow\\" but was disappointed throughout the story as she never really developed. The overall plot of the book was good, but the poor writing ruined it. I flipped to the end to find out what happened and let it go at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment!!!","review":"This book reads as though it is a working draft not a finished novel. The author should treat her fans with more respect. The plot development is non existent and many of the events simply so far fetched to be totally without credibility. Don't waste your time or money with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cabin Fever Read","review":"If you are a true Fern Michaels fan you will love this book as I did. For me it was a quick two day read. I found the characters believable and learned to loathe Logan almost from the beginning and was waiting for him to get his due. I had no trouble visualizing the house, grounds or the barn where the Yorkies were raised. As always it took me on a pleasant escape away from the every day real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I didn't think this author could top Finders Keepers and the trilogy book but WOW, she did! This book moved almost at the speed of light. I dearly loved the animals, the kids and Kristine. It just reinforces my belief that no one is perfect. It takes some of us longer to learn things and act on them. It was totally believable from beginning to end. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The main character had no backbone","review":"On page 300, Kristine told herself that, Tonight she'd show her backbone. Wrong!! This is a woman without backbone. On her own recognizance, she could never throw her ex out. I won't reveal what finally did it--but this woman needed a big batch of guts throughout the book. And . . . how many years did Woodie wait for her? Give me a break!!! I can't believe people gave this book five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read!","review":"I'm astounded that a book this poorly written could get published let alone be a New York Times best seller. Character development was non-existent and the plot was incredibly stupid. It was as if she just added to the storyline as she went along without giving any thought as to how it would fit with what was already written (I know, let's have her inherit $8 million even though there was no hint of her family's wealth in the first part of the book!). What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebration","review":"This is a \\"can't put it down\\" book. An incredible story and leaves you feeling like you have just read a masterpiece. Where does the author come up with her stories? She deserves the award of the year for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Delight","review":"I have always been a fan of Ferm Michaels but I found this book to be exceptional....I laughed and I cried it kepy my interests and I loved the way she was able to intertwine all the characters...a definate read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fern -- how could you?","review":"I adore Fern Michaels -- but how could she create a character so completely devoid of ANY backbone? One minute she is drinking her way to oblivion because her children don't like or respect her (her own fault) and the next, she is right back to being a wimp for her awful husband. I truly, truly was disappointed. Fern's people and their dialog is her strength -- what happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long, but enjoyable read","review":"I, too, found myself cheering for Kristine. Co-dependent relationships happen all the time and I'm glad the author addressed this issue. It was a great ending. I'm not sure she deserved Woody, but I'm glad they ended up together. Ms. Michaels referred to the tense relationship between parent and child at the beginning and then Kristine later refers to her parents as being, 'great' and 'there for her', etc. It was confusing, but maybe that mysterious money that popped up at the end changed her views on 'those rotten parents'....That along with that 'weird' slave trading story were misplaced in the story and I wanted it to end sooner, but I was glad to see that Kristine didn't cave in when Logan returned. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and neverending...","review":"This book really had the potential to be a good one, but the author didn't make it easy to relate to the characters. All of the conversations that took place within the book were very shallow and sometimes laughable. Overall, I thought it was poorly written and I thought it would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Fern Michaels' best!","review":"This book had the potential to be very interesting, but the dialogue throughout seemed really fake. It was almost uncomfortable reading parts of it because you know that people would not interact that way in real life. If you're a big Fern Michaels fan, pick another book and skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many sub plots, no development","review":"I felt as though this book was written in the manner of someone who talks too fast and had to meet a deadline so just added many ideas that really deserved their own story. Paragraphs had more than one subject and left me feeling as though I had missed reading something that would pull it all together. This is the first book by this author that I have read and I doubt that I will read any of her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"This book was absolutely awful...My first F. Michaels and definately my last. Many times I considered putting it down, but I persisted, hoping it would get better.....was I wrong...I couldn't seem to find any empathy for any of these characters...nothing made much sense and their behaviour was at best illogical. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR?","review":"I must admit I got sucked into buying this book by the blurb at the top about New York Times Bestseller. I don't believe it! Talk about a book based on nothing but dialog. Never do you see beneath the spoken word to any kind of real people below the surface. I quit. I don't even care enough to find out what happened to Logan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story!","review":"Just when I thought this author couldn't get any better, what does she do? She tops her last book by a mile and it was wonderful, too! There wasn't anything missing in this book. I found the characters real, loved the situations with Woodie, the kids and the animals. I cheered in the end when Logan got his. Yah!Mitzi Pakness"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fern Michaels is a pseudonym","review":"Fern Michaels is a pseudonym for Mary Kuczkir and Roberta Anderson. If you notice, a lot of the reviews on Amazon are by Mary Kuczkir. No wonder this book has an average of 4 stars. I would have given it zero stars but the scale wouldn't allow for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book!!!","review":"You won't be disappointed when you read this book...in fact, once you start it you won't be able to stop until you've finished it. And you'll feel like you really know Kristine, Logan, Woodie and all the other characters. This is a great read...don't miss it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebration","review":"Great read interesing characters and a plot that keeps you turning the pages, wish she would write a follow-upto this bbok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"Surprised by the turn of events, the reader keeps going. One of Fern Michael's best reads. It also reminds the reader to have hope when everything seems to be going wrong, and to listen to your children - they have the wisdom of the ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read almost all of Fern Michaels' books and have enjoyed every one; this one was hard to put down!","review":"Fern Michaels knows how to grasp the reader's attention and hold it throughout the entire book! She amazes me in her writing, with so many twisted situations that somehow manage to turn out good for the right characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, frustrating main character","review":"The main character is frustratingly weak and trusting even when the object of her trust has proven to be a liar. I've liked Fern Michaels' books in the past, but this one was painful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebration","review":"I love everything Fern Michaels wrights. When it comes out on kindel I buy it.The story was great and keeps you going thru the whole story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a review","review":"I've rarely been unable to leave a book unfinished. Celebration unfortunately falls into this category. The central character (Kristine) is a weak woman throughout the novel (or at least through half of it). The limited growth she experiences is a result, not of her own inner strength, but due to the intervention and persistence of someone else. The dialogue is flat and sounds completely contrived. It is impossible to get engrossed in the story and visualize these conversations as actually happening. The plot is entirely predictable so there is absolutely no desire on the reader's part to turn the page to see what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"This was one of the worst romance novels I've ever read. I expect to have to suspend my disbelief somewhat, but this book was ridiculous. The dialogue was beyond believeable, the situations were contrived, the characters were not appealing. The heroine was a total weak-spined wimp. I cannot believe there are so many people who enjoyed this book. Don't waste your money or your time. It does not get better as it goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Once Again!","review":"Once again I thought I'd give Fern Michaels a try, and once again I was thoroughly disgusted that I had thrown away my money! The plot is awful, the characters two dimensional, and if every female who has read this drivel isn't totally disgusted by the weak and totaly unsympathetic heroine, I would be truly surprised. The dialogue is totally unbelievable, and there are so many contradictory things that are said, not to mention done by the characters, I was thoroughly frustrated by the middle of the book. I couldn't even manage to get through it, and have definitely given up on this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too painful to even finish!","review":"I would like to believe that there are few women in this world as idiotic as the main character of this book. But, hey, I'm sure most women would welcome a man into their home after they stole eight million dollars from them. Please. Give your readers some credit and your characters a brain. I wouldn't even recommend this book as a quick read for the beach. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money AND time!","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read in a very long time! The plot is so obvious and slow.. When I was in the middle of the book I said to myself..I could tell this story in 50 pages instead of 400! Maybe I should start writting.."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK","review":"I must admit I haven't finished this book (listening to the audio version) but I already know I hate it. This sap of an immature women seems to spend all of her life sobbing her eyes out, passive aggressive in the extreme. The story line was incredulous. For example, she starts a dog business and can afford a full time veterinarian, what the heck is she running some kind of super puppy mill. Her children leave in a huff, she has no contact for three years when she shows up at their college graduation and all of a sudden she mom of the year. What a roll model for motherhood. What a pile of sophmoric garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good family laughs","review":"If you enjoy old sit-coms this is a must have for your collection.

Jackson began her singing career in 1982,but when her CONTROL album,her second,was released in early 1986,she instantly catapulted to superstardom. Jackson's singing career is still going strong today. Although she carries no royal title like her King Of Pop brother Michael,she's one of the all-time greats. The Gary,Indiana native later had a starring role in John Singleton's 1993 film POETIC JUSTICE.

The uninitiated should be warned that they're not buying a \\"regular\\" CD. There are no vocals in any of the songs - just a bunch of tracks that sound like jams by a bunch of session players. Which is essentially what Hiland is. Yes, the playing is technically proficient. Hence my 2 stars instead of just one (which is really where my satisfaction with this CD lies). But this guy is no new \\"master of the Telecaster\\" or anything close! There is nothing jaw-dropping here, folks, and all the hype is definitely UNjustified. Don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've heard in a while!","review":"Johnny Hiland has the best southern rock licks I've heard since Danny Gatton. Maybe I don't get out as much as I should, but this guy is the best I've heard in a while. Listening to Johnny play is like nothing else. He credits a lot of his success to Danny Gatton.

It has been brilliantly collected and edited. 50 drummers of various genres eg. country, jazz, rock and metal are present and in top form. There are drum clinics and live shows by various sized musical groups. Demonstrations of brushwork, sticks and various percussion instruments are plentifull. The sound is excellent throughout, and although there are no audio options, I am sure that it has been digitally remastered. The visuals 1997-2000 are very good and those from 2003-2006 are excellent. This is an excellent buy, whether you are a drummer or not. Buy it now!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short.","review":"It seems like they didn't really want to sell this as the actual \\"best of show\\" rather it is more of a sampler so that you buy the full DVD of each year that you liked the most.I was waiting for the whole Bill Stewart Trio show with Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, but they only put Jive Coffee in here.Instead of buying this either get the Modern drummer festival 2003 DVD or just visit moderndrummer.com and checkout bill stewart's page.Besides that well, the Antonio Sanchez clip is the only one i actually considered useful(from MD Fest 2000 i think). The rest kinda sucked in my opinion.

To say \\"Lavey\\", et al, exhibited any kind of talent on this album is stretching the truth at best. But of course, so-called 'satanists' know little of truth to begin with. They parade a social misfit and charlatan as their grand influence (Howard Levey) and take to heart everything he's said or done.The fact that mediocre miscreants [like this] exist in our society isn't the issue here: If you sincerely believe that the \\"music\\" on this album is worth buying, then by all means buy it (get it out of the local music store where the rest of the world doesn't have to look at it).

Until that time,it would be better for you to rest and for us to wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Nightmare","review":"Wasn't feeling this record, too jazzy and sassy for Xmas time.

As with most of Anita's songs, I just love the way she works each and every song and makes it uniquely her own - whether a standard classic, or a one-of-a-kind song written just for her. She's an awesome talent that just gets better with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazzy Christmas Fun","review":"Ms Baker's jazzy vocals are superb on this collection of Christmas favorites. With the help of George Duke, Larry Carlton, Joe Sample and The Yellowjackets, the selections are extremely well crafted, and fun. Spiritual selections include God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and O Come All Ye Faithful.In addition to the previously mentioned classics, there are two other gems on this collection. They include Frosty's Rag and Christmas Fantasy which is an elegantly smooth Anita Baker original.Christmas Fantasy is definitely a worthwhile addition for loyal Baker and smooth jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked!!","review":"I've gotten hooked on this cd on just the samples alone!!

And Ms. Baker is outstanding at what she does. When I hear her sing, the words and feelings of LOVE come forth effortlessly. Hopefully, I won't overstate her excellence, but, I listen to---and understand---every thing from Led Zeppelin, Earth, Wind & Fire, Wynton Marsalis, Jimi Hendrix, Coltrane, T. Monk, Max Roach, Art Tatum and Take 6 for example. And Ms. Baker seems to have a constant synergy with her musical expression that is overwhelming. A very classy artist, leader and example for anyone in music. While listening to her driving to work, I felt moved to write a review because of how great she was in the 80's-90's and now with this new Chrismas CD. The accompanying musicians are very effective and complimentary. They sound like an established group! Peace and Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but Limited","review":"Although the book is filled with very nice and informative pictures, it is nevertheless quite limited. I needed to relocate a toilet in a renovation project. Advanced enough, right? Well this book was useless. There was no information on venting requirments. If you like learning-by-example, this book may be for you, but only if the examples match what you need to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole package","review":"This book was the best. Most books on e-commerce are either too high-tech or too low-tech, this book was just right. Most of my experiece is in intranet development but I recently aquired a position where I am in charge of developing an on-line gift shop for a major academic institution. Not having any retail experience I needed something that would give the business and marketing perspective as well as the technical perspective of developing on-line stores. This book is worth every penny and more, and even though it was originally published in 1998 the topics and technoligies covered are still very relevant in Feb 2000. This book should be a staple of every web developers professional library, whether involved in E-Commerce or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating Stores on the Web, Second Edition","review":"If you are interested in finding information on the wide range of knowlege required to be a successful web store owner, this book is a great place to start.This book is co-authored by a man who started a fledgling web-based business in 1993. Through his experience and successes you get all the tools you need to make informed decisions on your web design. You can go to his website and see that all the ideas he outlines for you in the book are in practice on his website.I am a computer technician who is researching starting my own web based business to sell custom framed wedding invitations. I have read many books and articles in my research. I found this book and one other to be an incredible asset (101 Ways to Promote your Web Site). Both these books are written in \\"lay-mans\\" terms that any beginner would be able to understand.A must have for anyone who wants to know where to start with creating their own web-based business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creating Store for Dummies","review":"If there will be a new edition for the book here I suggest a new topic \`Creating Stores on the Web for Dummies\`. This book is nothing if you have a little bit knowledge about how any kind of business is done and internet. So if you want to learn on this subject try another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper elsewhere","review":"Great hat, bought it for my husband, I bought it knowing that the skull didnt line up with the middle, the offcenter looks great. Only problem was that after a lot of wear and tear, about 3 years, the seams along the brim of the hat separated, exposing the inside of the brim. Still a great hat over all. I found it cheaper at the band-tees website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Hat","review":"Excellent seller, recieved the hat quickly, and the hat is very nice. Only problem is that the dead symbol is slightly screwed up, in that it doesn't match up at the middle seam. basically, I have 1 and one quarter skulls and 3 eyes on it instead of 1 skull with 2 eyes. Furthermore, the price is a little steep. Otherwise, nice though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"Does what it was intended to do. I have it hooked up to a Flat Pane. (58\\" Panny).

It is mountable with 4 holes (I have mine mounted behind my plasma TV). It has only two outlets. The indicator LED lights let you quickly check on the status. My only complaint is that the metal strip logo doesn't seem to stick too well and is coming off - that doesn't affect the functionality though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"This is a beautiful clock and I was excited when I got it, but I ran into some problems very early. First the glowing hands only glow for about 30 minutes so most of the night you can't see the time. Second the clock has a very loud tick. It is loud enough that it is hard to go to sleep with it on the nightstand. The Third issue is the alarm. It is very loud for an ascending alarm. I am a light sleeper and don't need to be shocked awake. I bought the clock because reviewers said it was very soft. This is not true. This clock really could have been great with some small changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not be used as an alarm clock.","review":"This clock looks nice. The alarm can not be set accurately, so it can not be used as an alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This book tells us a story of some terrorist that kidnap five girls in France and ask for five things, each thing that the french people does they release a girl, the problem with this story is that the french people wanted to make an international problem and they made all the meetings in New York and nobody in the world care except Israel, In this book never goes out the secret service of any country, the French police makes all the arrangements and they solve the case, just boring.This is the first book that I read that the prologue doesn't has anything to do with the rest of the book, so you can skip this part of the book as well as other 100 pages that just have words that doesn't have to do anything in the book.SKIP this book, it doesn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Dictionary","review":"This is a must have for Traditional Catholics. The definitions are very clear, concise, not too long or too short. TAN has republished the book in paperback, but the hardback is preferable if you can find a book in good, used condition. It has 531 pages of definitions with 4 Appendixes besides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Senor Coconut/Atom Heart CD","review":"Senor Coconut fans should note that this is NOT the new Atom Heart/Senor Coconut cd. Instead, it's a various-artists cd compiled by Senor Coconut, featuring quirky electronic funk/reggaeton/cumbia artists from Chile, Brasil, Argentina and Panama. Still, it's quite enjoyable. Many of the tracks remind me of latin versions of 2 Live Crew or Lady Sovereign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkly funny, yes. Radical? Hell no.","review":"The Scum Manifesto divides its readers in a truly amazing way: according to who you read, it's either a classic wind-up lesbian farce (like Hothead Paisan) or it's incomprehensible hate speech. You can get it on the web for free, last time I checked, so you need not shell out cash to AK Press to find out what the commotion is about. What you will find is that it is a conservative's dream: feminism revealed as a man-hating conspiracy of idiotic slogan-shouting lesbians, scenarios lurid and laughable but extremely dangerous... and nothing more.The people running AK Press (the publisher) and Chris Kraus (who glowingly reviews this book on this site) are anarchists whose opinions I generally respect, and it completely baffles me that they see this work as thoughtful or radical in any way. Solanas is just another fundamentalist ready to inflict \\"collateral damage\\" for her cause. Don't pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So you're a feminist....isn't that cute!","review":"How any of this ranting gets passed off and believed as truth is beyond me. Sure Valerie mentions some obvious 'half-truths' in this book but only ruins them with her violent anti-male slang. And personally, I think that attitude goes against anything feminism is or should be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it what it is : Hate speech !","review":"I have not much to say but that if any man was publishing a book promoting genital mutilation of females it would be banned and labeled for what it would be : hate speech. The fact that this book, not only was edited but reedited in 1997 is very worrisome to each individual caring about dignity and human kind. This is hate speech, please do not spread such desease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solanas is the incarnate of Kraemer or Spranger","review":"Okay this book is AWFUL. This is to males what the Malleus Maleficirum was and still is to females. Why can't we all just get along instead of always trying to compete for who is the better sex. Instead lets learn to accept each other's differences. What really got me mad about this book,is that she said that woman shouldnt have sex anymore. [...]. Also we still need men to reproduce,even if we do have sperm banks,duh where will the sperm come from....... Yes it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"People feel justified in giving this book credence.

The quality is good and it looks awesome on the wall. What made it extra special was that we also purchased the Trapeze clock. They really pull the look of the room together.

When I received the item, the glass of one of the frames was shattered and broken along the entire length. I really expected better.

It's at the top of our Christmas video viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Christmas Collection","review":"Kenny Rogers has released a plethora of Christmas albums, and of the ones I have this is the best. The title song is a very appropriate mix of patriotism and Christmastime-a seemingly odd combination that works very, very well.Except for this genre-bundling selection which is reprised throughout the disk, all the other songs are well-known Christmas standards.In addition to the title track's uncommon concoction, the disk also departs from the norm by featuring a snippet of this tune between all the other songs and having the music play constantly; there are no silent pauses between cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite holiday collections","review":"I had this album years ago, but it was lost during a move. It is the one holiday album that my entire family loves. We remember watching the Kenny Rogers holiday special on TV the year the album came out. We were living in southern CA at that time, and on Thanksgiving day, following the parade, we would put on this album to herald the coming season. In particular, we all love the song \\"Christmas in America\\", which I believe was the name of the TV special as well.I am a big Kenny Rogers fan, and I have many of his cd's. I was so happy to find this one on Amazon after all these years! Keep it up, Kenny! You'll never go out of style.Thanks to the seller for having this album for my collection, and for a timely and seamless transaction. And also, as always, thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truely a benchmark movie","review":"If you are into bad B movies then Skeeter is among the benchmark movies you can use to rate all others. Use expressions like \\"it ain't no skeeter\\" when you find one worse.

If your home movie turns out to be skeeter then you may just have a career in making trailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it a zero star...","review":"This movie sucks. I wanted to stop watching but I mostly fast forward it to see the mosquito parts but still wasn't much. This movie has alot of talking and boring as hell. I could say more but not even worth it. Watch Mosquito(1995) instead if you want action and gore, it's not bad for a low budget movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Neck Style","review":"There are some artists whose contributions to R&B that will forever be immortalized. Enter this with the Isley Brothers. They have been a mainstay in the business for several years with Ronald Isley at the helm of their soulful dynamic. Though through the years after the loss of their brothers Marvin & O'Kelly, then Rudolph to pursue a calling as an ordained minister, the Isleys are still a very vital part of the R&B community & still remains as necessary as the day that that they went from a 3 piece outfit to 6; which the album 3+3 was appropriately named. The merging of the older brothers with the younger brothers with cousin Chris Jasper.Still one of my most important artists of all time. No music collection should be without their timeless classics. This album changed the sound of R&B music as a whole, b/w Angela Winbush's keyboard genius and arrangements, this CD was way ahead of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the job it was designed for","review":"All the button hooks I've tried use wire that is too small in gage and is too soft.

Most frustrating (to me) is that by adding ONE MORE WIRE around the case, they could have made this a very useful product. No idea what the manufacturers of this were thinking besides keeping material costs down; the design of this is useless. As most of the cost of this item was shipping, no point returning.

But those metal hooks give me the heebie-jeebies. Keeper makes a very good tow strap, but this isn't the one. The one I use has strong, sewn-in loops instead of those metal hooks. I attach it to the stuck vehicle and my truck with shackles that can't come loose and fly around like cannonballs. Plus it's made of nylon, which stretches to absorb shock and can be used for kinetic recoveries. This is better than nothing, but not the best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"How very sad","review":"I thought this book was very well written. About Mary Bell, well I sure wouldnt want her around my children. I feel very sad for this woman but here is the definition of antisocial personality disorder: Hostile to or disruptive of the established social order; marked by or engaging in behavior that violates accepted mores. A personality disorder characterized by chronic antisocial behavior and violation of the law and the rights of others.Could she have been different in a more positive enviornment, I think so, but I believe she is still a creation of her upbring.I would be afraid.VERY GOOD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Qualifications?","review":"The book was ok...very redundant in parts. My real gripe. What exactly is the authors expertise? Is she a legal expert? Is she a psychologist/psychiatrist? She criticizes the legal system and the pschological system a lot in the book. Maybe rightly, maybe not.Gitta asks good questions about the legal/psychological systems, but I don't see her qualifications to make evaluations or critiques of either. If she got answers/ideas from legal/psychological experts that should be noted. There is nothing to indicate she has any of these qualifications...she just \\"feels\\" this way! That in itself diminishes the legitamacy of the \\"story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable Cries","review":"Without a doubt, the most disjointed, poorly written narrative I've yet to read. Both the author and the subject constantly jump from one issue to another...the result is a jumbled mish-mash attempt at conveying the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"The author does an excellent job of approaching the subject without attempting to invoke sorrow for the circumstance. She addresses it very professionally and remains to her objective, how we, and most importantly, governments view and discipline troubled-children. She is also careful not to take everything Mary tells her without corroborating stories from others that were laced throughout her life. Excellent read for those interested in the Mary Bell case and the sadness that many societies may ignore or give less regard to reasons, and great regard to consequence for child-killers."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL THOUGH SHOCKING!!!","review":"I believe that the book did what the author intended for it to do. It explained, though slightly clumbersonly, why she killed. HOWEVER I do not believe this book should be taken as the reason children in general kill.I feel that Mary Bell committed a crime that she did not know, at the time, was a crime and that she herself CAN NOT and SHOULD NOT be held resonsible for her actions. The system is designed to help children, not permantly condemn them. This book, in my humble opinion, acomplishes the goal of showing this to the public. I commend this book highly and rate it as a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive account of child killer","review":"This book is a sensitive account of the life of a child who killed other, younger children. Mary Bell killed two small boys when she was just 11 years old. The book tells of her early life and abuse at the hands of her mother that led to her crime. It relates her life in prison, relationships over the years, and post-detention life trying to avoid the aggressive tabloid media. A story that will be enjoyed by any who know children, and should be required reading for those who work with troubled children."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I preview this book for my son.

It made me think about what i could do to change some little things in my life that i wasnt satisfied with. Like my behavior towards my parents and family members.It also made me think about how i was treating myself and others with such disrespect. Another thing i taught me was to lave me for who i am and not for who everyone else wants me to be.See i think that it made me think these ways becuase i took the time to read deeply into the book and try to look into the deeper meaning of what they were reallly trying to tell us (girls the ages of 12 or older). i also think that i feel this way becuase iam a chatholic and belive that what god gave you was given to you for a purpose nto becuase he wants to punich you but becuase he wants to make you unique. another thing is that this book takes you to the next level with cofidence and the next level with god."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinister Minister","review":"This is it! The original recording resurrected & brought to CD! At long last, the echoes of The Satanic Mass can be heard in your home, compleat with The Hymn To Satan, The Destruction Ritual, The Lust Ritual, & Zeena's Satanic Baptism, which I found to be particularly moving. But that's not all! We are also graced by the Doctor reciting The Book Of Satan from THE SATANIC BIBLE. If that wasn't enough, we also get treated to The Hymn Of The Satanic Empire as a bonus track. Plus, the mysterious ninth track, \\"March D'Anunzio\\".When listening to THE SATANIC MASS, remember to keep the light off. Or have dim illumination in the dead of the night, as recommended by Doctor LaVey, & dictated by uncommon morbid sense. The Satanic Mass is sure to entertain, as well as keep one in deep contemplation, & bestow great solemnity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I can't believe everyone is giving this five stars! This CD is very entertaining indeed...for a minute or two (and only if you're one who is tickled by such kitsch [and if I weren't, I'd probably give this just one star]); however, the spooky organ, the gongs, the thunder claps and several \\"Hail Satan!\\" refrains that accompany the Black Pope's monotous baloney will likely cause you to consider this as your haunted house soundtrack come next Halloween. (Hint: repeat track one--which clocks in at over 18 minutes--ad infinitum.) Alternatively, I recommend putting your money toward the documentary Satanis (1970) instead. --One gets to see The Black House which is no more! LaVey's lion Togare! And naked chicks on the altar! Hail Satan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, But Not Impressive","review":"For anyone who has already read The Satanic Bible or practiced Satanic Ritual, this CD will bring no surprises. It's basically a ritual exactly as LaVey described in his book. Nothing spectacular. LaVey uses J.S. Bach's Hymn To God as the intro, although he rather unoriginally calls it The Hymn To Satan. The Battle Hymn is included, which is the high point of the recording. An unlisted march is also present, so after you think that the CD is over, keep listening. Readings from LaVey's Book of Satan chapter in the Satanic Bible are included with backgroung music by Wagner, Sousa and others. Again, no real surprises here; only worth the money if you're really interested in LaVey memorabilia, but guaranteed to tick the Christians off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for LaVey Fans!","review":"The best part of the CD is the track not listed, some 2minutes after the Battle Hymn of the Apocalypse. It is a powerfulinstrumental that evokes images of a military parade in Hell (at least for me). The readings of the Book of Satan by LaVey are nice, but better is the Hymn to Satan that opens and closes the ritual portions of the album and the reading of the Enochian Keys. The liner notes on the album are also interesting. Definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old bit of fun.","review":"Considering this was made in the 60s and 70s, and also that it introduced a lot of closed minded people to \\"something else\\", it's really quite nifty. Consider it a little bit of fun, and something a bit left field. You won't find anything seriously \\"occult\\" or \\"Satanic\\" here.. but rather a bit of in-your-face attitude coupled with some rather unique invocations and musical tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who know...","review":"I first got to listen this album at a gathering I went to a few years ago, a friend of mine had the old vinyl copy and put it in his record player, and listened, and I just had these feelings... these feelings that were so emotional it's hard to just put in words. I hadn't heard it for some time after that, but then I saw the CD version one day in a CD folder that someone left when I was taking the bus home; imagine the shock! I took the folder home and popped the CD in stereo, and just closed my eyes and let it take me there. It's one of those cherished possessions I will keep for the rest of my life, and if you are a Satanist and you don't have this I highly recommend it. It's more than an album to me, it's a gate of wisdom and listen to it is to open that gate.

It presents a fairly simple scheme for creating a flower bed that will have perennials blooming throughout the growing season. For someone wanting to create a new bed or who has just purchased a newly-built home with nothing but minimal landscaping, this book would help in planning a more colorful landscape. However, I do think that adding a chapter on incorporating perennials and shrubs would have enhanced the book as so many situations call for them. For instance, foundation beds with nothing but perennials would mostly be bare during the winter; shrubs, particularly evergreens, would give additional structure. Otherwise, this is a great place to start in planning a design with it's simple to follow, well thought-out steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"a huge help for one new to gardening","review":"Being pretty new to perennials but having read many books I was having sort of a writers block when it came to WHAT to put in my new garden.I knew all about HOW but with so many choices I was overwhelmed!This book has a good number of templates to give you a jump start and many outstanding photos of combinations of flowers that work together. In fact this has some of the best photos I have ever seen in a garden book.It also covers difficult situations like what works in Heavy Clay and wet sites an so forth.My plan was a butterfly garden and they had the perfect template for a 12x8 garden.Excellent book for beginners or people that are looking for new combinations!!

This is perennial combining 202 with no spark of imagination in the pairings that can make a garden jump for joy. The photography is so ordinary and the color is extremly garish. Is that due to the Digital Imaging Specialists Dale Mack and Jane Ramsey or what? I can find no photographic credits (except for the cover) which is probably just as well. Obviously in a book this size (351 pages), from someone who is as accomplished as Mr. Burrell, there is useful information to be gleaned but I already have books that serve that purpose. If I had seen this in a book store, having thumbed through it for a few moments, I would never have bought it.

Not the case here! There were plenty of plans and ideas for all zones and everything was very comprehensive in drawings and text. Just within the first few minutes of looking at it I had several ideas for my yard. What's also nice is that it covers everything from small spaces that need just a few plants to fill in to large areas that need coverage.

This book was a easy to read book that showed how a frog grows and develops. The illustrations were bright and colorful, and kept my students' interests. It was easy enough for my struggling readers to read and understand and interesting enough to hold the attention of my higher readers. This was a book that stayed out of my book check-out center because a child was always reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cookbook ever !","review":"I was hopeful for a good Thai cookbook and the item description was very helpful and why I chose the book, but to my surprise, this book is better than described. It has great pictures of how the food should look; exactly what the ingredients looks like that you are suppose to buy and gives simple cooking instructions. There is a wide variety of food to cook, from soups to deserts, I only wish there were more recipes. THIS IS A MUST HAVE for people who love Thai and have no idea how to cook Thai!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"The instructions are fairly easy to follow, and the recipes I have tried are great. However, the pictures of marinated dishes don't show the marinades as mixed together, which is weird. Also, I wish the author(s) were a little more clear on exactly which cuts of beef to use on the dishes...it just says \\"sliced beef\\" or \\"tender sliced beef\\". I'd like to know which cuts they would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy thai cuisine","review":"I loved this book. If you want to try cooking thai food. This is a great book to start. You can find most ingredients at your local asian stores. The instruction is very easy to follow and the content of this book is pretty authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"This is a very straight forward and easy to understand book since it is mainly based on pictures. Now it is easier to buy what is needed at Asian markets, and follow their simple directions.The only drawback is that this is a small book with not that many recipes, but I really do like the SELECTION of recipes in the book. They are the more useful ones and tend to be more of the things that I like to order at a Thai restaurant rather than something very strange or with lots of ingredients that I will never make.Overall, this is a good book to have if you want a simple to follow Thai cookbook and I am not disappointed. It has most every recipe I really hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for all your senses!","review":"First I would like to thank those who left feedback about this book! This book is AMAZING. I anticipate making at least one dish per week. The recipes are concise and e-z to follow. Once you get your ingredients together - the rest is gravy (couldn't resist).I picked up most of the ingredients from Whole Foods but I am lucky enough to live near some Asian markets so I don't anticipate having trouble finding what you need but I did use bottled lime leaves and lemongrass - so don't think that you can't make these dishes if you don't have access to fresh ingredients.And here's this - even if you don't make anything right away - you can simply enjoy all the beautiful colors and the overall design of the book while you dream about all the things you can make. But once you make something - you'll be hooked.Buying this book is a win-win. Honestly this book makes me feel like an experienced chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Thai!","review":"This cookbook is most appropriately titled: the recipes ARE quick and easy.Great Thai food is said to have an etheric, uncontainable quality...and I find that is true.My partner and I love to cook together, and this book has served as a sure starting point on which we build.The spices are easily and cheaply available in local Asian stores and usually much cheaper than your local supermarket. Here in San Diego we shop at 'Ranch 99'.One suggestion for readers; Mazola oil is a great choice for the deep frying entrees. I substitute coconut oil for the other recipes.If you haven't tried cooking with it, you might like it :)Altogether a really fun, easy and inspiring book!If you're going to get ONE Thai cookbook, THIS is the one!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Birding Book I Have Found","review":"I have several books on birding and my husband and I enjoy watching the birds come into our front yard.

The ring came on a Wednesday after ordering on a Saturday. It came in a jewelry box (blue velvet) which I was worried about. I took it out of the box to present to my fiance and the first thing I did was look on the inside and there I saw 'PLAT' stamped. I dropped it into the palm of my hand and was immediately impressed with the weight and heft of this ring. It slipped on nicely and looked wonderful. Unfortunately I had to take it off him and fought for a while, deciding we might want to go up 1/2 a size.I returned the ring and within 3 days, the CC was credited and I bought the 2nd ring, this time in the right size. This style of platinum ring was $1300-1600 at our local jeweler. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Amazon as a source for fine jewelry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon is in fact stamped on the ring","review":"I wanted to help clarify the question about the inside stamping on the ring. Yes, it is stamped \\"PLAT\\" for platinum, and yes, it is stamped \\"Amazon\\" for Amazon.com. I would have really preferred the ring without the Amazon stamp on the inside, but it is a nice ring. I'm still trying to decide if the fit is right, but it looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon stamp","review":"I recently purchased this ring, and I must say that it is nice. The only problem is that the words \\"Amazon\\" are engraved on the inside of the ring, so if you want to place your own engraving it will be tough. I emailed customer support, and there is no way to purchase a ring without the \\"Amazon\\" stamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"McHale's Navy","review":"I don't care too much for most of the tv shows that my kids have to choose from, so I started to introduce them to the shows I grew up with. My son has become a huge Gilligan's Island fan! But, with only 3 Seasons, they became repetitious, so I started to search around for some similar humor. I found Abbott and Costello, and you guessed it~ McHale's Navy. As predicted, Ernest Borgnine is a hit with him! Alot of the plots are more advanced than Gilligan's Island, they're meant for an older crowd than 10yr olds! But Borgnine keeps him interested!"},{"rating":"1","title":"McHales Navy Season one","review":"This was very misleading, I thought I was getting season one.

I would recommend this album to anybody who likes Christmas music not just Randy Travis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Country Christmas Album!","review":"Randy Travis is the most unappreciated artist in country today. Not since Hank Williams Sr has anyone been able to put so much heart and soul into his songs. Real country fans have got to appreciate his style, he's not a tag along to the \\"Young Country\\" fad today while essentially being of the same generation of artists like Garth who sing top 40 country. Even Christmas music illustrates his soulful style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas album there is.","review":"I have loved Randy Travis since I was 5. My mother brought home a tape of this album when I was about 6. I loved it. It holds so many memories for me. The music is just beautiful. \\"White Christmas Makes Me Blue\\" and \\"Oh, What a Silent Night\\" are, as some say, \\"typical country songs with a Christmas theme\\" in the way that they are sad, but still good. There are also two love songs, \\"Meet Me Under The Mistletoe\\" and \\"How Do I Wrap My Heart Up For Christmas,\\" both are upbeat and catchy. Old favorites include \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town,\\" \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentelmen,\\" and (my favorite) \\"The Christmas Song.\\" This album is the best Xmas album ever, and I prefer it over Bing Crosby any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ask Santa for this one","review":"This is a musical stocking stuffer that will become a part ofyour Christmas tradition.No frills.

The characters were not fully developed. How or why a change was effected in Maggie was not clarified. How Maggie moved into and got accepted into another family and how she became a loving person is unknown. Uncle Morris is a mere sketch of a person, and the aunts are outlines of a sketch. Seems that the author was up against a deadline and had to tie things up before the story matured in the author's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found!","review":"I have literally been searching for this book for YEARS. I've tried to search by every detail I could recall from the book, to no avail. Finally a friend suggested a title to search (\\"house in the attic\\") and I managed to find it by a fluke. I read this book as a child, and the story has stayed with me all these years, even though I haven't read it since.. I am 29, now. I am thrilled to have found it, so that I can share it with my daughter. Such a beautifully written story, touching and engaging.. I find now, after reading so many reviews, that I am one of many who was affected by this book, reaffirming it's wondrous qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorites...","review":"I remember reading this book as a child, and I loved it!

It just makes you feel very good about yourself, and it raises all kinds of imaginative levels within your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read!!!!!!!!","review":"I read this book all throughout my childhood and into my teenage years. I still think of it sometimes. It's certainly as good as Madeline L'Engle's \\"A Wrinkle in Time,\\" which I have never forgotten, either. I got chills and cried everytime I read \\"Behind the Attic Wall.\\" I still get chills when I think about this book. It's perfectly written- almost creepy. Dolls can be so creepy. I think this book must have fostered my current love of psychological thrillers. Please give this book to your pre-teen ASAP. Then read it yourself (if you're female, of course- a man would not like this book- too girly) It doesn't matter how old you are. You won't be disappointed. Trust me. Now go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"This is possibly one of the best-written, most-descriptive books I've ever read.

Beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kara's Review of Behind the Attic Wall","review":"This book was about an orphan, Maggie, who could never fit in at orphanages, or girls' schools. She would get thrown out of everyone she stayed at, until finally her great aunts took her in. Maggie hated it at first, and thought it was just another school, but after a couple of days realized that she was the only kid there. She still pretended to hate it, but liked it a little more. Maggie started hearing voices. At first she thought of it as nothing because they were so faint, but then one day she truly heard a man and woman talking. She thought it was her aunts having people hide to tell her what to do, but her aunts did not hear it. Maggie grew to listen to them always, and found out they were looking for someone. It was Maggie.In this book Maggie is telling the story. I thought it was a great book, and that any age would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought I was weird","review":"Exactly!

Buy this book, it's awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered wrong product","review":"I guess I would have liked a written desciption of the ingredients while I was ordering. I thought ARTH-X was the same as ARTH-X Platinum. I was wrong. ARTH-X does not contain glucosamine or chondroitin, the two main ingredients I was looking for. I ordered the wrong item, and did not realize it until after I opened it, so can;t return it. Other than that, the prouduct was delivered timely."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HARMONIES!","review":"This book does provide a great concise history of the Mamas and the Papas and does have all 16 songs it claims, but if you are looking for the harmonies in the songs DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It only contains the melody and not a full instrumental section. This was a sore dissapointment for me because I already know all the melodies and their history. Beware: if you are looking for a REAL music book... this is not the one for you. If you are just starting out reading music or playing the piano, its a very concise book with 16 of their greatest songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Honeywell Air Cleaner Yet!","review":"I have owned many Honeywell Air cleaners and I do own many still but this one is great. This one comes with the UV Light so it is an air cleaner and purifier in one. I put this in my living room/office area and it absolutely kills all odors. I have another small honeywell cleaner running in the room as well but with the addition of this one and the uv antibacterial feature it is great. Got asthma - buy this machine, got pets - buy this machine. It is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"allergy sufferer","review":"Purchased this product to alleviate my allergies to dust and pet dander. Had it for a month now and notice a slight difference in air quality. The product does eliminate odors to a certain extent. Did notice there was less dust on the furniture after leaving it on for at least 12 hrs a day. Its very quiet even on medium speed (which is great because im a light sleeper). I also noticed I started to wake up with less congestion. Overall, would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not perfect","review":"I am searching for an air purifier to take care of dust and germs. I had a sharper image pro gp and tried this one to replace it. The features are great and it does circulate the air well, the only downside for me personally is that at the lowest setting, you can still hear the fan. Some people don't mind or like the noise but I personally like machines you cannot hear. That's my only downside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattling Sound","review":"Picked it up at Target. After two days it started making a vibrating sound while in oscillation mode. In another two days I couldn't position it so it would be quite, even on the slowest setting. Poor build quality and loose plastic parts caused it to make the sound. Returned it. Now looking for a better build quality HEPA filter. Wish db ratings were given to make the selection easier. Seems most HEPA units will do the job of cleaning the air sufficiently, but the sound level and build quality matters. Reading the reviews the Winix 9000 or 5300 units seems like a reasonable gamble. Although the 5300 isn't listed on the Winix web site, but is sold here and other places online. Not sure why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo Noisy!","review":"Really disappointed. It's not \\"whisper quiet\\" at all. After 6 months of use and regular cleaning, it became very loud, even at the lowest setting.I can get it replaced, but why would I want the same noisy appliance? I'm even more disappointed that the Honeywell customer service supervisor had nothing to offer as a solution other than replacing it.I can not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be dissapointed, too","review":"I know how tempting it is to ignore the bad reviews when there are so many good ones. You may also think that surely a product that costs this much and made by such a well-known manufacturer can't be as they say, right? Well, believe it folks....this is definitely not worth the money. I'm certainly glad I did not pay anywhere NEAR the price it's selling for here. It is really loud on all but the lowest setting, and even then it's very noticeable (unlike the big, round, old hassock-style honeywell HEPA air purifiers, which were really quiet on low speed). As others have stated also, the motor eventually starts to make a little noise (not horrible, but definitely erodes one's confidence in the product). The oscillation feature can get noisy as well, and mine even stopped working for awhile. Doesn't even filter that well. Trust me, avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"no power","review":"Unit does not power up after many tries. Piece of cheap plastic and the filters don't seem to be well seated at all. $240 used to buy something solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the bells and whistles, no worky","review":"I bought this purifier at Target because it was the most expensive one there so I figured it would work. After a week, it started making rattling noises on the low settings. The unit is very quiet but compared to other units I don't believe it moves very much air. It is cool looking but I doubt it's as functional as some of the other Honeywell Purifiers. The purifier also says HEPA clean, not true HEPA. So basically you're paying because the unit looks cool with nice lights. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked ok, but only for a couple of years","review":"Purchased from Target and it worked ok but then we started running into problems. The first to go out was the UV lamp. Fortunately Target had them on clearance because they're fairly pricy. Then just recently everything seemed to die. No power to the display.

Then I decided to move it into the bedroom. Turned it off, unplugged it, moved it to the bedroom, plugged it in....can NOT turn it on again. Have tried plugging it into every electrical outlet in the apartment--nada. The power light will blink a few times and then that's it. Called the company like the box instructed (specifically told to call if there are problems rather than returning the air cleaner to the store). Customer service was stumped after telling me to check to be sure the filters were in place, that the back grill was in place, and that I'd pushed the power button. She told me to bring it back to the store. Well, it was a gift, the store and the receipt are both over 500 miles away and this just sucks all around.

This is ridiculous because there is a lot of great factual information available, just do a web search.

Hedgecoe covers a lot of ground in this book and always has an image to illustrate a particular point. The book is well organized and easy to understand. His pictures come from around the world and are very diverse. There are both black and white and color. I think this book by a master photography educator is good for someone looking for a good introduction that covers all aspects of landscape photography, or for more experienced photographers looking for new approaches to the subject. Many of the images could benefit from being larger, but that would necessitate an increase in price for a book that is now well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book , as all of John Hedgecoe","review":"This is another very helpful and clearly expressed photo novel from John Hedgecoe.

Fr. Dubay is nothing if not clear thinking and comprehensive in his analysis. Remember the priest you had in college that would go on and on (and you saying to yourself - \\"Alright already, I get the point!\\") And now, years later, you realized that you should have been paying more attention? Here is another chance to see what a well thought out and studied argument should look like! \\"...a secure certitude in ultimate religious matters is possible.\\" (p. 77). Here is a book that can help you get to that secure certitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any budding theologian!","review":"This book by Fr.

I was deceived and bought it, thinking it would be a great companion to Sixties classics like Gilligan, Get Smart, Andy Griffith, and the Munsters. It's not. It mentions all of these shows and more but doesn't do any of them justice. Most of these shows deserve books devoted solely to each of them; they certainly do not deserve this Round-Robin type approach. Let me give you one concrete example: the Gilligan's Island chapter spends practically as much space on the two actresses who followed Tina Louise as Ginger Grant in the sequels as it does on Tina Louise herself! Does that make any sense? If you think so, go ahead and order this book. You'll learn all about guest stars and bit players on a dozen classic TV shows...MUCH more than you want to know, I'm sure!

Not only does the battery somehow still work(!), it still looks as good as the day I bought it. My only complaint is that the analog time is annoying to have to reset,since you have to do a full round the face move, but other than than, this watch rocks.

Being a runner, I am not to happy with the small display area for the Stop Watch function, which is hard to see at times when the hour and minutes hands are between the 4 and 8 positions. This is also the same problem I get when trying to use the night light function to check time when it is dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited usefullness","review":"I wanted a watch that I didn't have to worry about what activities I was doing and be cautious about easily dinging it up. This is a very well built waterproof watch, but beyond basic timekeeping, the other features really seemed like an afterthought. The digital display is small and dim and in moderate to bright light, it is very difficult to read. The recessed buttons were a good idea, but actually using them is difficult (keeping a button pressed down for any length of time kills your fingers). The watch face is small and barely luminous in the dark. I dread having to change the time back an hour for DST or when traveling because you have to hold down the buttons for a looong time until the hands make it all the way around again. It's a decent rugged timepiece, but don't get it for it's bells and whistles."},{"rating":"2","title":"My watch","review":"I was looking for a watch that resist a lot because I am careless about watches and found this one, It is a little difficult to put the time and date because the brochure comes with very small lettersbut I found a site in internet that tell you how to work with it and with big letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better.","review":"I just received this Casio. I have to say I'm disappointed.The first thing I noticed is how hard it is to see the digital display indoors. Virtually impossible in medium to dim light. There's a light button but I don't want to have to hit that every time.The other thing that bothers me is the lack of precision regarding the hour hand. If the big hand is at the 12 o'clock position, the hour hand is always off of the hour it should line up with. There is no way that I know of to adjust this.I was expecting more from this watch. Perhaps that was my fault, perhaps not. I'll probably be sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average watch.","review":"I've had this watch for over three years and haven't had any problems with it.

That got me concerned so I thought I would change it myself. Not ! Once I got the back off I see the most complex battery clamp I had ever seen !I paid $5 for the battery, and then another $7 to take it to a watch repair place to have them do it right. Took the guy about 5 minutes to do it.The band still looks good. The first G shock I bought had to have the band changed once a year.And that watch lasted over 12 years before I had to replace it.Another thing I wasn't happy about is it's not made in Japan, but assembled in Thailand with Japanese parts...Over all, I'm happy with it.It's been a problem free watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch","review":"My son loves this watch and is really enjoying it!

There are only 2 things I don't like about the watch. 1) The head of the watch is a bit smaller than I was hoping.

When you have to 'fall back' each fall, you have to press a button and cycle through until you get to the correct time. Thinking \\"not a big deal'.

No disappointment here. Very easy to read in all light, even glows in the dark after sunlight. I was looking for a simple rugged watch with a basic alarm.

The digital display is too small with too little contrast between the characters and the background. One cannot glance at the digital display, one must pause and focus on it to read it. I too usually leave it displaying the date and just glancing at the watch, like when signing a check, isn't a causal gesture, it requires holding the watch at the right angle, right distance and without motion. And give up on the digital display between :22 and :37 minutes past the hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casio G100-1BV Watch Review","review":"This watch has a very nice appearance. I am fond of analogue-digital watches and this one is one of the most attractive.... but it has a killer design flaw that made me return it almost instantly. You can only adjust the analogue hands forwards ... very slowly. You can only move the hands forwards in 20 second increments, so if your watch is running a few moments fast then you have to go through more than 11 hours in 20 second increments. I.e. Press a button once and move the hands 20 seconds forwards with each button press! What about time changes required with travelling? What about changes required with Daylight Savings Time? This design makes the watch an absolute no go with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Functional Value...Nicely Styled","review":"What's not to like about a seventy dollar waterproof, shockproof multi-function watch that also looks good. It's a seriously rugged-looking watch but very light weight. An inset digital screen is controlled by a mode button that advances through the date, digital time, alarm time, stopwatch, and second time zone functions. The screen can be backlit in a cool (really) blue light for night viewing. The rectangular screen is a bit small and not easily read with these baby boomer eyes in certain offlit situations. It is also difficult to read the screen when the analog minute hand sweeps across the screen through the 4 to 8 hour period. I'd pay another ten bucks to see this screen replicated on the top of the watch face (between 10 and 2 o'clock)to avoid this. No big deal. Hey, it's only seventy bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjusting analog time -- not user friendly","review":"Very nice watch in terms of appearance, accuracy, and reliability. The analog hands feature is great, in that it combines the accuracy of a digital movement with a display that can easily be read without glasses (great for us increasingly-senior citizens). BUT -- adjusting the time display (analog hands) is a major pain, at daylight savings time. The hands can ONLY be advanced in the forward direction. So plan on spending a good while slowly rotating the movement through a full 12 hours when you need to adjust the hands only ONE hour back. The upside is that the movement is accurate enough that you should not need to adjust the hands, other than at DST changeovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Men's G100-1BV (Black) Watch","review":"I would like to inform people is that the dial and the watch itself look pretty big in the picture (which is why I ordered it), but in reality is medium-sized...I would say 'smart'.

It leaves one's mind opened just that bit more to all the possibilities out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...It Ends","review":"Imagine traveling zillions of light years and battling murderous enemies so that you may find the meaning of life or failing that how to stop a Satanic invasion from overrunning humanity. You finally meet God, and you're so exhilirated that somehow you got to this point that you even manage to ignore that God is an idiot who tells you to have faith, and what you do is what you believe. After reading 3,500+ pages in order to reach the plot's resolution, and while the trilogy really was a waste of time I have to admire Hamilton: he wrote almost 4,000 pages of crap, managed to get it published, and managed to get a lot of readers (myself included) to read it. Is life really this boring and meaningless?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ending Ever","review":"Three words: Deus Ex Machina. I couldn't feel compassion for any of the possessed.

A great read if you like long books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton, an SF great, writes a classic.","review":"The timeline start was a little weak, I was barely hanging on by the end of it, as there was no conflict, no story, no character. It was a bit like reading a LotR Return of the King appendix BEFORE you read the book itself. But, once the story started, it grabbed me. The very first paragraph had a stumbling long sentence, but after that, I was there. The character was sympathetic (a kid under unknown threat) and there was enough mystery and pseudo-tech going on to keep my SF sensor happy. Things rolled very well from there, and as the story has been well reported from many reviewers, I'll leave it at that. A pro piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly long, poorly edited, strange mix of hard science fiction and very preposterous fantasy","review":"Mr. Hamilton shows hubris and poor judgement in writing a 3,400+ pages trilogy, which if it had beenrigorously edited down to, say, a 500 pages novel, might have been at least barely tolerable.The book contains some good hard science fiction ideas, but unfortunately they pale in comparisonwith its many totally absurd fantasy and supernatural elements. The author makes the same mistake ofoh so many writers of putting himself and his characters in an increasingly impossible situation, which at the endof this endless trilogy is resolved in the most preposterous, utterly silly and childish and poorly imagined manner.If the book had been removed of all its gratuitous hard core sex and violence sections and, again, substantially and mercilesslyedited down to a reasonable size, it might have been a good adventures book for early teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy doorstop","review":"This was the first and only book I have ever read by Mr. Hamilton. I found it to be overly long poorly edited space opera. A bunch of cardboard characters surround a ridiculously lucky space captain who screws his way across the known universe. There is nothing clever about the plot. There is no character depth. There's no interesting speculation about the future. I can't think of anything redeeming about this book. It's over 1300 pages of juvenile garbage. And it's only the first book of a trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy Shoes!","review":"I must admit when I first saw these shoes I thought they looked like witches shoes.

AI couldn't read it any more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for younger readers...","review":"I had to read this book for a college class (Literature for Adolecents) and was less than thrilled by it. I think it is certainly on a very low reading level, while at the same time using stream-of-consiousness techniques that could be confusing for some younger readers. The plot is very predictable and the characters are not very engaging. However, younger readers would probably not see the predictablness in the plot as much (they haven't had as much experience with plots as older readers and so don't know the patterns as well). Also, maybe a younger reader could relate to the story and the characters better. It is written from the point of view of a young girl and the scentence structure and language, as well as the mentality, show it. I don't know. I never read it when I was younger so I can't say that a younger reader would enjoy it, but they would very likely enjoy it more than an adult......"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Low Ratings are BOGUS!","review":"As a young child, I read this book. I had to be about 10 or 11 and at the time I enjoyed it. Being an African American girl I identified with the book and remembered reading it a couple of times. A lot of these reviews listed on this book are from an adult point of view, and it is quite unfair to rate it based on an adult understanding. Seeing that most reviewers on Amazon are adults, there will probably be a bias no matter what. Virginia Hamilton knows her audience and that is all that is required. She captured attentions and wrote this book on a juvenile level, which I have found is hard for most adults to do. We're so bent on literary elements that are not even introduced to children until they get to about high school. Think - we do not understand Spongebob, Teletubbies and Yo Gabba Gabba. It's not for us. Adults, do not buy this for yourselves, buy this for your child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is simply not worth it.","review":"I'm sorry to say, I found it rather boring.

Cellular companies still have these chargers and still want over $30 for them even though they no longer sale the phone and since I am not a rich person, I found myself in serious need so I ordered this charger............BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Great price, shipping cost is where they got me and then the product didn't even last a full week and then you're stuck with it as the price to return is about as much as what u paid to ship it. Once again I am without a charger and thus without a phone. I CANNOT CONSCIOUSLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR PURCHASE.

Mr. Brewer will not only make you think about the details of this story but at the same time challenge you to live a life where you too can experience God Moments in Time. I have just begun to think about the impact my life can have on future generations if I too will be faithful to the doors God opens in my life.If you are looking for a book that is challenging, motivating, and also easy to read, God Moments in Time is for you!

No doubt when you see a collaboration like that you automatically assume your going to like it. Tracks 1,4, and 9 in my opinion are the only ones that really stand out and there are only 12 tracks.

Perfectly free of the contemporary idea that cooking is supposed to be fun, she deals humorously with the challenge of getting in and out of the kitchen as fast as possible. Her chapter titles (\\"Company's Coming, or, Your Back's to the Wall\\"; \\"Dinner--Can't We Take Them Out to?\\") and her recipe titles (\\"The out-of-season unstuffed turkey dinner, or, of all my husband's relatives, I like myself the best\\") compete to amuse you. Her endearing honesty (\\"A lot of these recipes aren't very exciting. In fact, some are pretty dull. So are recipes in the other cookbooks, but the other cookbooks don't admit it\\") creates an instant bond between her and the reader. Even if you like to cook, you'll enjoy reading this book. And, if you hate to cook so much that you're never going to make a single one of even these simple recipes, you will still enjoy reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I am doing the low carb way of eating.

My mother got this book when I was in highschool and together we looked through the recipes and laughed till we hurt. Stayabed Stew was my favorite.

I learned to cook using this book, the Doubleday Cookbook and the Joy of Cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny little gem of a book whether you cook or not!","review":"I confess that I'm the type who likes to occasionally read a cookbook whether or not I cook much of what's in it. I do not have a lot of time to cook and my mother before me wasn't into it either, but man, Peg Bracken's cookbooks are funny reads even if you don't cook anything out of them. (Although the recipes are pretty good when I do make them, and most of them have aged well and can still be made and served today, 40+ years after the first book came out. ) Her \\"I Hate to Housekeep\\" book is also funny and contains a lot of time saving tips. Hilary Knight's drawings add a lot to the overall tone and humor of the book as well. The effect is sort of like Betty MacDonald decided to start writing cookbooks with the help of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. I would recommend the older editions of the books if you can find them, because stuff tends to get edited out of later editions and you don't want to miss any of Peg Bracken's funny bits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Funny! And So Tasty, Too!","review":"My mother had the I Hate To Cook Book when I was growing up in the 60s. The recipes are good and fast (if not very healthy -- when was the last time you browned ground beef in a little oil?) and the text is just hilarious.

I have only known him as an actor, so this was interesting to pick up. I loved this story! It has a magical element that both children and adults will love, I am sure. The choice of vocabulary he uses, alone, is amazing. Children, (and maybe even adults), will find new words, or artists mentioned in this book. This squirrel loves art. It makes one almost giggle how he after observing many works of art, he comes to make his own, and...(well, you just have to read the book to see how it ends.) It is a very cute story, and if you are like me, it will get you thinking about the sqirrels you have seen in your life that have more than one color on their tail. A very cute thing to watch for with the children. It will bring a smile to your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful picture book but not for kids","review":"I was pleased and intrigued when I first picked up Micawber and began to read it to my precocious 4 year old. Unfortunately she never listened past the middle pages. She lost interest quickly as the text was not geared at all for her age group. I contunued to read the story more for myself than for her at that point and was surprised to think that this was a story written for children. I don't think it would have held the interest of my older child either and he is close to 8 years old. As much as I respect John Lithgow as an actor, I'm sorry to say that this is a children's book written for grown-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"My almost 3 year old daughter loves hearing this story and will pick it out of the bookshelf to read over and over. She keeps asking if the squirrels in our yard are Micawber and looks for their \\"painted tails.\\" I explain the book as we read and I don't feel that it's over her head...yes, some of the words are more adult oriented but they can be put into simpler language for a younger child to understand. She will sit for the entire book then ask for a re-read. Hooray for an interesting and more intelligent children's book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough interest for young children","review":"Perhaps I am in the minority here, but I was not impressed with this book. The best thing about it were the pictures. The basic story is good, but the book uses language that many adults, let alone kids, don't understand. I do believe we should use \\"grownup\\" language when talking to kids to help their grammar and vocabulary, but the flow of this book seems awkward and out of place to me. We bought several books about NYC before a trip to try to aid in educating the children about NYC, but this one did nothing. Other books, such as \\"A Walk in New York\\" or \\"From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\", however, were very much enjoyed and requested over and over. This book was read once and put aside. There are so many better books out there with more interesting, educational stories for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painteriffic!!!!!!","review":"My nine year old daughter thinks this was a really good book which was easy to read and very creative.

And it could be if I could overlook the constant lame woman jokes in every paragraph.Why does everything geared towards women have to be cute, or funny, or talk about Prada? It's just insulting, I think. This book talks down (I just really found it stupid how she brings up needing Tequila 4 times whilst working on a toilet...).I'm actually a pretty girly girl but I just don't like books like this that think they have to talk to me in a cutesy voice and use pink tools to get me to do something.The Readers Digest book of Home Repairs is FAR superior with great photos, a list of tools and simple explanations with easy to follow instructions.

Changing a lightbulb is about as technical as I get around the house. But I needed to patch a small hole in the drywall (I made it, so I figured I should do the honors), and this book told me everything I needed to know. The most shocking part is, it's also fun to read. I think it's important to have a sense of humor if you're going to tackle home repairs and this book has a great attitude.

This book provides a really solid foundation and good recommendations for starting your tool collection.In reading the book you definitely see Norma's spunky New Yorker attitude.

Realizing that Christmas is not always the uplifting holiday that we hope it will be, these stories still left me feeling more depressed than thoughtful. I originally bought several copies to give as gifts, but after reading the entire book, I felt that I could not give someone else something that made me feel worse than I did before I picked it up.

Southern or otherwise. These stories are NOT the typical mistletoe and happy endings. But then, neither is reality. There's a difference between fiction and literature. Literature is a fictional portrayal of TRUTH and that's precisely what we find in these stories.

Thank you Charline McCord and Judy Tucker for making it available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern fiction at its best","review":"The South has long been known for its great writers, and this book captures many of those currently working. So few collections of short fiction are published these days, that the short story is becoming a lost art. The authors in this collection have it down to a fine science.We're allowed to share in the very real thoughts and emotions of a cast of characters, from a young girl who prays for wrath to descend on the heads of all those around her who do not worship with the fervor she wishes to see, to the Louisiana man who learns the lesson of giving. The writing itself is a pleasure.There are no finer masters of short fiction than Tim Gautreaux and Mard Ward Brown.

An updated 2nd edition would be very welcome, but I guess there is little chance of that happening...In the meantime, try to get hold of a copy of this book if you plan to visit Indonesia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Yourself an Edge","review":"Mrs. Spudman tells me that these are her favorite pair of scissors, and she has no shortage of scissors.

The production by Chris Thomas is stellar and the songwriting superb. While a little monochromatic in the overall \\"sound\\", this album would pave the way for the superior COUNTRY LIFE.The lyrics see Ferry's themes emerge mature for the first time. While the earlier album was recorded by a group playing at being a rock band, this is an album by the rock band itself. Serious themes(religion, love, the crush of civilization)would reappear in various forms on later albums until the band broke up for the first time in 1976.Some of the songs require repeated listenings to fully appreciate their depth, but are well worth the effort. While the casual fan won't appreciate this album perhaps as much as the hardcore Roxy fan, after giving popping the cover and allowing it to breathe, they'll find like fine wine, STRANDED gets better with every listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENO LIKED THIS ONE!","review":"I remember reading an interview with Brian Eno way back in the mid-70s where he told the interviewer that \\"Stranded\\" was his favorite Roxy Music album.I can easily see why Eno would say this. This is Roxy Music's last overtly bizarre album. \\"Country Life\\" and \\"Siren\\" would take Roxy into a harder-edged, more commercial universe. \\"Stranded\\" revels in its eccentricity. The entire album has a threshold of drones and white noise bubbling under the surface- most notably in \\"Amazona\\" which has one of the strangest mixes I've ever heard.\\"Sunset,\\" the final song, has to go down as one of Roxy's most beautiful numbers. The simplicity of the arrangement, featuring acoustic bass and piano, is exquisite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute classic","review":"Although I've been familiar with several cuts from this album for over 20 years, I only recently purchased it. To hear the album in it's entirety is a wonderful thing, and serves to confirm the fact that this band was consistantly creating pioneering and ingenious music that was unrivaled in it's time. Things began to really click for the band at the time of this album's release. Though the first two Roxy albums were ingenious in their own right, this album demonstrates cohesion and vision that had yet to be fully realized previously. And although I'm a huge Eno fan, I must admit that he is not missed at all here. Music, vocals, lyrics, emotion, and style are in almost perfect balance. \\"Country Life\\" still remains my all time favorite Roxy album, but this is a VERY close second, and in some ways feels like a companion piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im Stranded...","review":"Its hard for me to pick one alltime greatest Roxy album....if I had to, it might be this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"without question, a masterpiece, if not the greatest piece of music ever!","review":"the quickest way to increase the quality of your life, the ability to reach higher levels of joy and sadness and to finally say goodbye to that nagging ennui is available for the price of one c.d.STRANDED WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.

And the premise of this book - a musician trapped in the Panama Canal, due to the fact that she is travelling by ship because of a fear of flying. There are enough interesting ancillary characters to go somewhere. So why one star?Where do i start? Partly because of the annoying dream sequences that have absolutely no relevance to the story. Partly due to the fact that none of the characters are really developed. Partly because the cutting between the present and past of the central character is annoying. And partly becuase the story is simply stupid. The only reason that i have given it one star is because it started off with an interesting premise.I seriously recommend that you don't waste your time on this book.

Isn't this supposed to be a book about positive change? Gretchen Buchenholz's efforts to save border babies somehow seems more a vanity attempt, promoting herself, inviting her friends (the political, the rich and famous), and photo ops. Ms. Buchenolz always seems to have her name in the front of advertisements about her programs. What a beautiful facade....promoted for the benefit of babies. But if her purpose is to help babies, it doesn't seem that her track record is that good. In fact, it is shameful. Ask about Tanae Green and Stephanie Ramos, babies in the foster care agency run by Ms. Buchenholz.... Both babies died of horrible neglect, and Ms. Buchenholz didn't show her face to protect, protest, or speak up for them, even at the end of their lives.

Not written in ivory tower scholarly dialogue, but it is, at the same time, quite lofty.Sr. Teresa is a tour guide through the mansions of prayer with the utmost reverence for our Lord, obedience, and charity for the faith.

As far as ripping, my help cannot keep a consistent measurement utilizing the gauge marks, maybe because I erroniously believed it would rip a shingle in one cut, not two or three lops. The preset holes are for either a three tab or the larger highend shingles. Regular metric dimensionals cannot be ripped,for the starter, they are 13\\" high. For the money, I assumed it was American made, and what I had been tracking for the last 5 years. My bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"Wish I had a shingle cutter like this years ago. Time saved making quick accurate cuts pays for this cutter in no time flat. I build gazebos and nearly every shingle requires a miter cut. The easily adjustable miter fence makes cutting any angle a breeze. After more than a thousand cuts on dimensional asphalt shingles there seems to be no appreciable wear on the blade and it still cuts like new. One word of caution, however. The cutting action requires a somewhat forceful chomp of the cutting arm. While the blade is not particularly sharp (much like a paper cutter), keep your fingers well away from the blade during the cutting action. There is no finger guard, thus the slightly lower rating. This machine performs well but needs to be respected for safe operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Show Butchered...No Sale!","review":"WKRP is one of my top 5 favorite TV shows ever, but I won't be buying this shoddy release."},{"rating":"1","title":"no way without real music","review":"I saw it for sale last week for $13.00, still wasn't worth picking up for that price without the orignal music.Lots of people probably say, so what, it doesn't have the original music.Well maybe next time they release a movie or TV show, why not have it dubbed with someone else's voice, I can't wait for someone to come up with the idea of putting in commercials.

In my opinion, it cannot be referred to as WKRP as it is not the show as portrayed by the DVD cover art. Not only has the music been replaced, but to hear that some of the episodes have been cut is unacceptable.If I really wanted to watch the syndicated versions with the replaced music, I would have been one of the few that actually watched the show when it briefly aired on Nick at Nite. Shame on Fox for trying to fool real fans of the show by making this attempt. I have no doubt that the stories of Hugh Wilson's involvement were shamelessly planted on the various blogs to increase sales for a poor representation of a great show that unfortunately could not find a home when it was originally on TV and still cannot on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show butchered","review":"I had the disks pre-ordered, was really excited when I received them and extremely disappointed when I watched them.Still waiting for the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WKRP still rocks","review":"I have just finished watching the entire season 1 and I still love it as much as when it was on tv.

I definately recommend purchasing these DVD's if you miss the good old WKRP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Replacements Make Better Sense","review":"First of all, contrary to original reports these are NOT double sided disc.Secondly I think the music replacements make better sense for WKRP than the original rock music. Think about it. Would a station with the futile staff of WKRP play actual top 40 rock music or cheesy generic rock? This would also help explain the terrible ratings. Also we do get the Red Wiggler, Ferryman Funeral Home jingles, Scum of the Earth and Hoyt Axton songs.Also contrary to popular belief Jennifer's doorbell scene has not been cut, however, Fly Me to the Moon has been replaced with a public domain song I can't quite make out the name of it.I hope they release the other three seasons rather quickly"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW CAN YOU REVIEW IF IT IS NOT OUT?","review":"If this is a preorder how are you CERTAIN the music is NOT contained?

The entire scene about Pink Floyd's \\"Dogs\\" may as well have been cut out entirely because it completely loses any sense of what Carlson is going on about.

You want me to pay for that, put a $5 price tag on it, and I'll buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good or Bad, I didn't cancel","review":"If no one bought this, would they ever make more? If the sales were huge, would they release an unedited version later? This was my quandry. I am disappointed at a couple of things. There are only 2 episodes that have a commentary. The extras are a bit short and seem incomplete. What about a documentary that looks at the casting process? The show is my favorite of all time.

Buy VHS (or watch reruns) if you really want to watch WKRP.. by far one of the best shows of it's time (and still quite funny). Just don't buy this DVD.. it will only encourage them. Stupid record labels don't even grasp the concept that people will hear the song on the show and possibly go out and buy the song (or even the CD). Nooo..

Folks, WKRP's treatment by the network that ultimately resulted in its cancellation (how often did they change its time slot?) was bad enough, they shouldn't have had to deal w/the same treatment again some 25 years later.If you can live w/the cuts and music changes, don't let me stand in your way...however, if you're like me and will only accept these eps in their original form, you might try looking for original broadcast copies that circulate among video collectors...for me, that's the only way to see this show the way its creators/producers intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aww, HELL NO!!!!!!","review":"I got the email recommendation and got really excited to click \\"buy\\" but thank GOD for customer reviews!

Hilarious scene!!If they can't release the full episodes then I for one will not bother. And shame to the record companies for making it prohibitive to license music that is no longer top 100 and is 30 years old.

But I'm sufficiently disappointed by the release of these episodes without their original music that I will not be buying this product. I agree with previous reviewer sentiments that (1) the original music is integral to the show, and (2) it would have been a much better idea to increase the cost of the set marginally and bought the rights to the music. This show was an ensemble masterpiece, and it's been compromised."},{"rating":"1","title":"wkrp????? too bad.","review":"As much as I waited for this release. To buy it at its chopped up worst would justify the distribution. Then watch other shows just be thrown out on the market because if the consumer will settle for this and spend his hard earned money, then why not see how far they can go. Please!!!!, it saddened me to cancel my order but join the fight to stop this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS!!!!","review":"Just have to add my name to the long list of disgusted fans of this brilliant show. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!! If we all band together and decide that this is unacceptable, perhaps there is a small chance something might change in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone buy this set now?????","review":"Man, they got cheap over the music, but to show the shortened synicated versions of the shows is clueless! I imagine the image will look terrible as well...no sense spending any money on this series, people will buy it in any way, shape or form, right???? Wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WKRP In Cincinnati","review":"This is truly a wonderful set. Of course with the hype about the music not being original it wasn't as big of an impact as you would have thought. Great!!!! A good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"20th Century Fox: Recall WKRP","review":"I was so excited to learn of the release of WKRP several months ago. When I heard, however, that 20th Century Fox was deleting certain music tracks from the show, I said to myself no way could they be so stupid. Well, not only is 20th Century Fox stupid, they're incompetent! The shows have also been cut to pieces. They do not have the same running time as first aired! Wow, you just lost another customer 20th Century Fox for this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cancelled order","review":"i buy TV series on DVD to see uncut,original versions of the shows.this may be the greatest show ever on TV,but i will not support a version that has cut out scenes and does not have the original music.as a consumer,i would have paid a high price to have this one right-but if it is not right,i'll just stick with whatever i can find that is original and uncut."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy it either","review":"I'm glad I read the reviews before placing my order. I've decided not to purchase this set. What I will do is rent a disc from my Netflix account when they're released. I don't mind wasting a rental or two but there seems to be no reason to own this just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"aaaaaa....nope.","review":"I was over joyed to see that WKRP was finally coming to DVD. But them I was quickly heart-broken to find that the \\"Complete First Season\\" will in fact not be complete. I have waited far too long for this series to come out on DVD and now that it does, it's altered. The music has changed, some of the episodes have been shortened from hack job editing. The music was just as much a part of the show as the actors and to have them changed just goes to take away from the show. Sadly I will have to wait even longer for someone to get this one right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this classic TV show. I pre ordered it, got it in the mail, and watched it. After the first couple episodes I thought something wasn't right. Then it hit me; the music isn't right! There's only one original song in the whole season. What a disappointment! The music was a huge part of the show and it's absence is a terrible omission. Now I read that the episodes are missing alot of scenes. They really seem to have butchered one of TV's great shows. Unless these things are fixed I won't be buying season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy this Show?","review":"I was really looking forward to purchasing this great sit-com but now that I know that almost all the music has been replaced and some episodes are the syndicated versions why bother? Why couldn't at least some of the songs be included. Box sets of SCTV and SNL included all the original music so there is no reason why more of an effort could of been made to include as much of the original music as possible. I would gladly have paid twice the price to get the original un-cut episodes but now I will just watch my video tapes of this series I recorded twenty years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO EXCUSE FOR EXCISING THE ORIGINAL SONGS","review":"Stop being cheap Mr. DVD producer. Use the original songs, pay the $10 per season royalty the greedy music shysters... er, executives demand, and then raise the retail price a little bit.We fans are willing to pay extra to get the show intact with the original songs.We are NOT willing to pay for butchered episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-order cancelled","review":"After reading the news about what is actually on these DVDs, I had to cancel the pre-order. I was so excited when I heard this was coming out. The early info said that Hugh Wilson was involved, and I had hoped it would be the same quality effort as was put into the short lived Sledge Hammer! series when it came to DVD.I can live with the music changes to get the DVD's out, but I cannot justify spending money for episodes that are just 22-minute syndication cuts. I can hardly watch them on TV-Land or wherever they show up now and then because of that the cut scenes.Can't get Pink Floyd \\"dogs\\"? Don't cut the scene! Go get some audio of some freak'n dogs barking and dub it in!Unbelievable.Sorry Fox, you will have to do MUCH better for me to spend money on this.Just to make sure there is no confusion; I *LOVE* WKRP, but not enough to spend money on crappy DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money On This Set...","review":"...unless you don't care about heavily altered music and scenes cut out of the episodes. That is exactly what you will be getting if you spend your money on this lackluster effort by Fox Home Entertainment.I will wait this one out, and hope that the extremely negative attitudes from the buying public towards this set will make Fox realize that if they intend to do this, they had best do it RIGHT. Down with shoddy efforts like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just canceled my order, too.","review":"Very distresing that the music has been replaced, scenes have been cut, etc. Some would say that something is better than nothing. Can't argue with that for those so inclined. But revisionist history is not for me. I'll stick with my memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I called you here today for a bit of bad news.","review":"The first reviews for this set are in, and here's what we've got:1) Even less original music than the infamous late-90's syndication package2) All original music that has been replaced has been replaced with generic background music - most of it the same as in the aforementioned, much-hated late-90's syndication package3) Several episodes are the 22-minute syndication versions instead of the network originals4) Whenever a song needed to be replaced in a network original, and the song could not be un-intertwined from the dialogue of a scene, the scene is simply very sloppily cut out altogetherSo, there you have it! Pretty much all of our worst fears confirmed - and then some. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"WKRP - arrived beat up with shrink wrap torn!","review":"Have been waiting for almost a month now for a link to return the postage. The item arrived without bubble wrapping - the corners were beat up, the shrink wrap was torn up. Seller said they would send a link for postage to return the item for a replacement; however, it has been almost a month and still NO postage or replacement. I hope that AMAZON will look into this matter. My next step is to contact my credit card company and dispute the charges.A very unhappy customer,Carolyn Phillips"},{"rating":"2","title":"good experience","review":"The DVD came in a very short time and as advertised. It was a little disappointing that elevator music had been substituted for the original songs but I understand about the whole licensing thing. A great nostalgic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digitally Enhanced would have been a nice touch","review":"I was looking forward to a nice, sharp picture quality, which this DVD set doesn't have. It would have been nice if they would have done the digitally remastered or digitally enhanced thing, but it doesn't look like they did. Otherwise, the content is as good as I remember it, just not the sharp picture I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge, huge disappointment","review":"I was all ready to pre-order and then thank god I read some of the reviews. I knew about the controversy surrounding the cutting of original music but I was not aware that some of the episodes are not even the full version but instead are a cut syndication version.Sorry, but I won't be buying. Give me WKRP uncut and with original music and I'll buy it in a heartbeat.EDIT - To all those giving this set 4 and 5 stars....You do realize that the episodes are edited right? They are the truncated syndication versions. I could possibly live without the original music, but I can't live with \\"edited for syndication: versions of my favorite TV shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rates a 0, which is what people should spend on it!","review":"WKRP was the single best sitcom on television when it originally ran. For anyone to try and convince people that these hacked apart pieces of junk are truly \\"magic\\" as they are, is a freaking travesty! It has nothing to do with being a purist, nor elitist, or anything else.Without the 2-2.5 minutes of cut scenes in each episode, and the replaced with studio noodling music used, large chunks of the jokes and plots no longer make any sense - the music was an integral part of every single episode!!And the fact is not that it was truly too cost-prohibitive to retain the original music, but that it was too GREED-prohibitive to do so. A lot of extra cash was pocketed at the expense of the fans who will be wasting their money by buying this piece of crapola!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree With The Rest..Ruined!","review":"All I can say is what everyone else has. I did not buy this knowing what happened and how it was destroyed.Instead, I've got hold of the entire series with original music intact from the late 80s/early 90s syndication reruns via one huge internet download, and made my own complete DVD-R set..just look around if you know how to do that stuff, and you can too :)However, if the REAL stuff is ever released, I will def buy ALL of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered episodes for 26 dollars? No way!","review":"When are these companies going to learn? First it was the incomplete Complete Mr. Bean, then it was the badly butchered first season of The Cosby Show (they learned their lesson and season 2 is great). Now as if having the great rock and roll songs from the original episodes replaced with generic songs weren't enough, these guys have the balls to ship the butchered syndication versions of these episodes! This show deserves 5 stars, but this DVD set deserves zero. The cost of or inability to license the original songs is understandable. Not using the full versions of the episodes is inexecusable. There is no way I am going to buy ANY season of old TV episodes that are treated with so little respect and I urge any of you considering doing so to instead send a message to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same without the music","review":"I bought the first season knowing the original music would not be there. It's still fun to watch but loss of the music takes away the depth of the shows. For instance does anyone remember when Jennifer (Loni Anderson) says yes to Les' request to go out with her to an awards banquet, and in front of Herb no less. Les buys a wig and an outfit to get ready for the date and if you remember Foreigner's \\"Hot Blooded\\" is pumping out as he puts his outfit on in time to the music. It's gone, they overdubbed it with some studio garbage. It's not the same. Imagine Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas cruising in the pilot episode in the Ferrari Dino with muzak blaring instead of Phil Collins \\"In the Night.\\" Nevertheless, it's good to watch this stuff again. I just wish they would have paid the fees and charged us 50 bucks for the season with the original music instead of 25 bucks with a band like Spinal Tap playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money - Go For the Bootleg","review":"What a disappointment! Do it right or don't bother... Many of us would have paid top dollar for this thing done right. We've only been waiting for a couple of decades. The best sitcom ever made and this is what they do to it? If we're lucky, they won't waste anyone's time releasing any more krp like this.Don't waste your time with this dreck, get the bootleg!One star only because the system doesn't allow NO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price not compatible with what you get","review":"I am not a fan of the show, just an occasional viewer. I am going to buy this as a gift, but I HARDLY think this price tag is worth THREE MEASLY DISCS! That is a rip off and rummaging the pockets of long time fans who have waited for years for this, not to mention the numerous complaints I've read about the music and the actual scenes missing. What a gyp! I actually don't know what to say, either wait until this goes on sale at your local Target and get it cheaper or live with this price tag.I know there are no extras, so I don't understand where they get off charging almost $35 for 3 discs. That is ridiculous! I think it's only worth it when it finally goes on sale somewhere. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have all 90 episodes","review":"I bought this first season set and enjoyed it thoroughly because that was all there was. But I went to Iofferdotcom and purchased the entire series with the original music from collectors who have preserved it from TV. I don't have to wait for copyright problems or studio battles to finally give way to the other seasons-I have mine and enjoy them everyday. Just look to the private sites people, get your fix without all the hassles cause this sitcom is way too good to be without!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WKRP In Cincinnati - The Complete First Season","review":"I just love this show. I'm grateful that it's out on DVD. I would have preferred having the complete series all in one set, but I'll settle for them one at a time. It really is too bad they had to cut out the original music from the show (licencing issues), but other than that, I think It's a great purchase. Brings back a lot of great memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS ABORTION!

BOYCOTT ALL FOX DVDS UNTIL THEY FIX THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sitcoms of the era!","review":"Difficulties with getting music clearances aside, I still think WKRP is one of the best sitcomes of the 70s. I was a radio annnouncer for over 25 years, and let me tell you that ALL of us worked somewhere where there was a Johnny Fever, Herb Tarlick, Les Nessman, etc. Admittedly these characters are exaggerated, but for all that, there's a fascinating humanity to them.

My bad. I loved the show but a huge part of that was because of the music. No \\"Hot Blooded\\" for Les!!!!! No intros for the \\"Doctor\\"!!!!! Very disappointing. Needless to say I won't be bothering with the rest of the series. Question.....are FEMA and Fox run by the same people? Does Fox/FoxTV look for the stupidest people they can find and make them decision making exec's? Just wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"just the way i remember it","review":"I wanted to get this because I always enjoyed the show growing up. Some of the past reviews stated they were disappointed that the original music used at the time is not used in the DVD's now. It is a little strange when you know that thats not the song that is suppose to be playing, but, the show is still funny. I am glad i purchased it and will continue to watch it when i want a great laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic funny","review":"My son was showing me Youtube videos he thought were funny, and I remember the funniest thing I ever saw on TV. WKRP's Thanksgiving special. I remember howling with laughter with my whole family as they released the free turkeys. So funny ... even now."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crying shame","review":"Bad news: If you love classic TV on DVD that contains original music -DON'T BUY WKRP. Fox didn't license the rock & roll music in a show about a rock & roll radio station!!!! They could easily have sold a \\"Collector's Set\\" or sold it online only (skipping retail) and it would have done great.Good news: If you love classic TV on DVD that contains original music - PLEASE DO BUY \\"FREAKS AND GEEKS\\", \\"SCTV (numerous volumes), \\"Saturday Night Live: the Complete First Season\\", \\"Miami Vice\\" or others. Those are great shows that deserve your $ more than the badly butchered WKRP discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks!!! but there is hope.....","review":"I bought this because WKRP was one of my favorite shows. After watching a few episodes I was disgusted at how the show has been butchered! The generic music stinks and the show has been edited to cut out any references to the original music or bands.There is another place on the web that is selling the ORIGINAL UNEDITED episodes with the ORIGINAL MUSIC and no station logos. Google \\"WKRP in Cincinati Complete series dvd unedited shows\\" and you may find it.I won't say if I bought this set or not but I will say I'll never watch the edited dvd again. Maybe I'll toss it in the river."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever","review":"This is one of the best comedies ever on TV with one of the best cast ensembles ever to go with it. Herb, Les, Baily, Andy, Dr Johnny Fever, Venus, Jennifer and the Big Guy what a group. Real laughs and so many crazy bits that I had forgotten about. I can watch these shows anytime. It's hard to believe that this didn't have a much longer run. It easily compares with Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke and is way better that Seinfield or Everybody Loves? Raymond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I have to agree with many of the nay-sayers about this DVD. I loved this show and they've blown it by editing the soundtrack. Some of the jokes and the whole theme of certain shows were highlighted by the soundtrack. I bought it because I loved the show, but it's with a heavy heart and big dissapointment. I hope they release season 2 as-is...heck...I'd rather have crappier quality and an intact show than the crap they give us in the Season 1 set. As for copyrights...what a bunch of crap...these artists should be thrilled their music is getting airplay through this popular series. Heck...they would even boost their sales for a new generation if they'd let it alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WKRP in Cincinati","review":"I love this show. I realize it would be even better with the actual music track, but the show is fantastic. I can't wait for rest of the seasons to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Don't Know What the Edit Fuss is About","review":"I Love the WKRP shows and hesitated after seeing other reviews complaining about the music editing. This set is great and includes scenes that were censered in the original shows. I prefer this release to the original shows and the bonus material is great. There is nothing of significant lost by the editing -- can't agree with the other complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending the set back!","review":"I guess it pays to read the reviews before you pre-order. Unfortunately I didn't. After learning that the WKRP set is filled with syndicated versions of the show and has been stripped of its music, I have decided to return it to Amazon.Sorry, but I'm a purest. I believe that when a TV show or movie is released on DVD, it should be the complete, unedited version. (This is the reason why I would not purchase the 21 Jump Street collections)You would think that the musical artists and the studios would come to some sort of agreement when it comes to releasing older TV shows that contain popular music."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI","review":"Some of the scenes you won't see here are available on YouTube with the original music. Especially the \\"Dogs\\" scene. Far out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered- do not reward Fox for this!","review":"Two unforgivable decisions: 1) editing out the original music; 2) using the shorter syndication versions vice the original aired episodes. It's a show about a radio station switching format to rock - and THEY REPLACED THE ROCK MUSIC WHICH WAS OFTEN TIED DIRECTLY TO THE PLOT?? I love WKRP, and would have happily paid double the price listed for the original uncut versions, but cannot buy this shameful hack job. YOO-HOO IDIOTIC TV EXECS: STOP DESTROYING THE TV MEMORIES OF OUR YOUTH BY BUTCHERING THESE CLASSICS! I hope the marketing genius responsible for that decision loses his/her job."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'll pass","review":"Well, it would seem that the news is getting worse and worse about this long-awaited DVD release. I used to work at a local radio station here on Orlando when WKRP was on the air. I even saw Loni Anderson and Gary Sandy as they were entering a local restaurant. I had a ton of laughs watching this show and seeing the similarities and the incorrectness to actual broadcast radio. Now, I am laughing at the people who are trying to put this shameful set together to hopefully get some money for a probably worthless product. I can understand music rights aimed at the \\"free downloads,\\" but what I can't understand is that their music isn't played in its entirety on the show, where we can rip the audio track out. I would be proud to have \\"my music\\" on this great show stay intact! I don't see how the artists are losing any money over this. I may have to rent this video just to see if there is a hidden surprise. If there is one, I'd buy it! So for now, it's \\"pre-order cancel time!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Krappy Rotten People","review":"I speak of course of Fox and the stupid artists who wouldn't license their music. Keep in mind it may NOT be all on Fox. Greedy artists and record labels can refuse to license the stuff at any cost. But from all the reviews everywhere, I'm hard-pressed to think Fox even made the effort. If they hadn't TOLD us that most of the original music was there or at least replaced by other real music, it might not be a big deal. This was 100% bait and switch at its finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon Jump","review":"I just heard that MTM couldn't afford to license Gordon Jump's actual voice on the discs, so they got Fred \\"Gopher\\" Grandy to re-dub all his dialogue.But seriously, this was a fantastic show and the music played a very large role in it. Why bother if you can't do it right?Two stars because it was great once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unhappy order-canceller","review":"Count me in on the swelling group of pre-order cancellations. I'd rather wait and see if the product stinks as bad as it sounds from the preliminary reports. If we're all wrong and it's really a great package, then I'll re-order it. But if it's as big of a hack job as it sounds, then forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aiiiiiiiigggggghhhhh!!!!","review":"Thanks for all the tip-offs in the reviews here. I was eagerly awaiting this, but now I've canceled my pre-order. This show was about a _rock_ radio station. If they cannot play the music, then it guts the core of the show--a great show. And why the heck would I want chopped down versions of the episodes rather than the original length versions? If they're doing this to the show, I would not be surprised if the image transfer, the audio, and the other things like the menus are lousy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastated! I won't buy it...","review":"I've been waiting for years for this release and am devastated by the news that they butchered it! What I don't get is why the music rights is such a big deal to begin with. If you're lucky enough to be able to catch an un-butchered original episode, you'll notice that the music is key to setting up the humor but each sound bite is VERY short. With the exception of Jennifer's doorbell, which is recurring, for the most part only a tiny fraction of any single song is played - enough to be recognizable and set up the humor but that is all. If I were in the music business I'd be honored to have my work represented in this show. At any rate, I won't be buying and it is so sad that one of the best comedies in TV history has been abused this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Dr. Johnny Fever.....","review":"\\"Booger\\"!!

This space is for rating the product.WKRP will not be released until April 2007. We don't know if it will contain original music, we don't know what bonus features will be available in the set, we don't know anything about the packaging, and we don't know anything about the mastering or the transfers or the audio quality. So anyone that is writing a \\"review\\" of the WKRP set is just commenting on whether they remember liking the show. They are not helping the reader make a decision about the purchase of the disks.To all you \\"reviewers\\" out there - stop wasting time and space by writing about products that you don't own and haven't seen. Get the product first! Then review it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been waiting for a year for this series","review":"I've been waiting a year for this series; however, since hearing how the original music has been removed from the episodes I'll be passing on the set. I would have paid double even triple for the real thing. Very disappointed in whom ever made this decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be other ways to do this","review":"Looking at Hugh Wilson (the show's creator) and Fox's comments, it seems like they missed an important point to the show - that the music is one of the characters and is integral to the show. They also seem to feel that they can only sell the show at $30.It's unfortunate that they didn't pass the rights onto Rhino or Shout and let them work through the licensing issues and release it under their brand titles.My guess is that they may look at this option in the future, so vote with your wallet and send a message to Fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete? What a CROCK!","review":"This is such a huge mistake... releasing a crummy WKRP set after making us fans wait so long.

Fox, do it right or don't do it at all!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No music, not buyin' it!","review":"How can they produce a DVD about a radio station without the music and call it a complete season. I've removed this from my cart. Either the music industry needs to get less stingy or the producers of DVD sets with a lot of music need to charge more to keep the original product in tact. I guess I'm a purist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Shame","review":"What's this? FOX cannot afford to pay for the rights to use a few 1970s rock songs? Aren't these the same songs we've all heard 50,000+ times on the radio over the past 35+ years? Certainly FOX has enough lawyers and money to work something out. But the music isn't the end of the story here. Another major disappointment for me was the transfer quality. Maybe they didn't have the best equipment back then, but hey, things can and have been digitally corrected. I can't believe that you can actually see serious convergence errors clearly in the opening! What did you guys do, hold a camera up to a TV screen? The loss of music and the poor quality make this a terrible waste of money. It's too bad, too. I was waiting a LONG time for WKRP to come to DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still very good","review":"Okay, it doesn't have the original music but it is still funny and the best sitcom ever.

I watched this T.V. show every chance I got when it was first run. I heard from others that copyright issues on the music originally featured on the series was the reason it's taken forever to get it transferred to DVD...and that some songs will be different. No matter: what really made this show was the great ensemble and zany writing, and still does. WKRP deserves its place amongst classic television shows simply because it's very good.Nearly thirty years since its debut, WKRP is still a gem.My feelings of elation?

It deserves much more respect than this horrible excuse for a DVD release.

This is not \\"The Complete First Season\\" but rather \\"A Bunch of Scenes from the Complete First Season Poorly Strung Together\\".Come on FOX, you should know better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show but avoid this DVD release","review":"This release is a bastardized version of the great show that ran on CBS. Music replacements abound and since the music is integral to the show, as it took place in a radio station, the edits are glaring. In addition, there are scenes cut out where they couldn't easily edit out the music. And on top of that, a couple of the episodes are the cut to 22 minute versions. Send a message to the studios that we won't accept garbage releases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't see the point.","review":"Just adding another voice to the negative reviews in response to the decision to replace the original music, in the faint hope that some day somebody in charge will look at the numbers and say, \\"Whoa, look at all these negative comments, all because we didn't pay for the original songs\\". The show itself is one of the best ensemble sitcoms ever made, and it's simply a crime that it's been compromised in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't licensees learn from Guitar Hero???","review":"Guitar Hero has reintroduced a new generation to some great, classic rock, and the artists have seen sales revitalized as a result. Why doesn't Fox use this as leverage to get the music licensees on board with these DVDs? These shows only had short clips of the music - nothing worthy of bootlegging - and could spark tremendous interest and generate sales the same way as video games. I would think licensees would be scrambling to get their music heard again, with the declining rate of CD sales! They should just ask for appropriate credits, so that viewers can easily track down the songs to buy them later! What DJ today is even remotely as cool as Johnny Fever??? If I were an artist, I'd want him on record as digging my music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY IT!!! WASTE OF MONEY. DISGUSTING.","review":"I Love WKRP, but this is a waste of money. So many scenes are edited, you miss punchlines, you miss parts of storylines. Music is thrown right out the window, with elevator rock. You miss intro's to songs because they had to replace music. Listen, I love WKRP, but this was such a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. They really screwed up with this one. I hope they realize this and fix it and get it out the right way. I hope that the sales sucked so bad that they either have no choice to do it right or they won't bother to release the other seasons. Why bother? If you are not going to do it right, don't do it at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It is a joke how bad this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss the original music!","review":"The comedy and the acting is as I remember from years ago; a truly enjoyable series.

I thought Turkeys Could FLY!","review":"That has got to be what FOX was thinking when they released this butchered mess. I know it costs more to retain the original rights. I'd Pay at least double to have uncut, unchanged WKRP even if it was only selected episodes. This was a monumental program, some of the sharpest best television ever produced, now reduced to muzak. I disagree with the Amazon Reviewer. The sharp Scripts, with the freshness of actual pop music is critical to the success of the program. Is it \\"watch able\\" without it? Yes, you can watch it. You also can watch paint dry. This is like expecting to hear Fats Domino singing \\"Ain't that a Shame\\" and getting Pat Boone. UGH AVOID THIS SET AT ALL COSTS!

Dr. Fever and Flytrap, Herb, Les, and Mr. Carlson along with Jennifer(Loni Anderson;WOOOOW!) make up this madcap cast of misfits. They took out most of the top 40 music in the original episodes due to network red tape but replaced it with decent, although not as good, songs. The opening and closing(my favorite) themes are still included. Funny, funny comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interested any more!","review":"I cannot believe that the editing has been so poorly done on such a good show... and what is this situation about the music?!?! Those younger ones out there who never saw the program have no idea how important that music was to the show and therefore are unable to appreciate what an important part that music played in the atmosphere, the humour of WKRP. How disrespectful to the cast and crew of this classic. How tragic.

I know music rights are expensive but dvds are not exactly expensive to make. You know they're making tons of money selling this stuff; the least they could do it present it as it originally aired ESPECIALLY since this show is about a radio station! \\"WKRP\\" deserves no less-it was a hiliarious, one of a kind show that many people would LOVE to own. Because of the lack of the original music, I will bet sales of this set will not be good and, as we know from \\"Murphy Brown\\", if it doesn't sell well, there won't be more seasons. It's sad to think we fans won't get to have this great show in our video libraries just as we remember it.

Do I wish the original music had been used? Of course. thats why only 4 stars. I've only been through the first 5 or 6 episodes but nothing I've seen so far has made the show less funny or unwatchable. They have done a pretty good job with the new music they have used and unless you are a purest, the show is still a good buy. Check out your local wal-mart, target etc. though because their prices are cheaper than amazon and no shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"WKRP rocks, but this set? Forget it!","review":"I saw a few episodes of a friend's set of this, and the friend decided to get the series through a site that offers the entire series uncut and unedited.

I liked the show so very much, and was excited that it was out on DVD, but I also will not spend money on a hatchet job. I agree that Fox cheated the marvelous actors out of their due, and that if one is going to do something, let it be done right. It would have been worth the little extra. If there really was no other way but to compromise, (and I don't believe that), at least it could have been done without cutting so much. The others' suggestions are all very good valid ones. I'm just one fan and only one opinion, so here there you have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it one star but it should get zero.","review":"Definitely not the original broadcast versions. Original music gone and syndicated versions of many episodes. I made the error of buying this turkey but I won't buy any subsequent seasons. Fox needs to get their act together. The show by the way gets *****, but this is the worst DVD release I have ever seen. Fox might have well as not done the show rather than to release this. Fox is guilty of gross mendacity for peddling this product as the real WKRP in Cincinnati when it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrary to what some others have written here, the DVDs do NOT contain the syndicated sliced-up shows...","review":"...but DO contain the whole episodes as originally broadcast, with the following exception: the only thing that has been changed is some of the music (necessarily, for licensing reasons) as others have mentioned. I, too, would have paid more for the \\"original\\" shows -- but let's face it -- they are never going to be released in that format (with the original music intact).

The list price of this watered-down IN\\"Complete\\" version is $39.95?? For that, you think they could have worked out their differences and produced something the fans actually want. I just got \\"Maude\\", uncut and nicely presented, for $22.95 - HELLO?? The original music was a key part of this show, especially in the closing credits.

(I don't know how that rumor got started) They are indeed the full original versions, each episode comes in at around 24 minutes. In the pilot episode commentary, Hugh Wilson confirms these are not edited-down. Some of the music is different/generic or edited-out but, for me at least, that's not a dealbreaker. Would you throw out a diamond with a slight flaw?The original music (and much of it is still in there) was intregal, but I still don't see how a few seconds of a song intro or outro keeps you from enjoying it. If you know what's supposed to be there, just imagine it. (Anybody NOT know the first couple of notes to \\"Cocaine\\" or \\"Stairway\\" by heart?)

Not to mention the abridged versions of many of the episodes.

Stories and characters are as remembered but what is readily apparent is how many of the punchlines had a direct connection with the rock music played during the scenes. Classic rock songs now are generic rock sounds which flattens some of the memory bubbles for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Radio Station Without Music","review":"There are other series suffering the same fate, such as Quantum Leap. The music is important for context reasons, it helps to date the times. WKRP is dated, that is why we love the show. The music adds to the show, it expands the depth. A rock n roll station playing generic music is absurd, even new fans will be able to tell there is something wrong. It is sad that money can play a role in sustaining great entertainment. WKRP was a great show. I waited every week to hear the samplings of music and the dialog. The dialog has suffered as well as each episode has been severed in length, in the name of saving money. Season two? I hope not as things stand. Please let it be known that I loved this show. Thanks to all the reviewers who saved me this anguish."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no!!!!!","review":"You have GOT to be kidding me!! I've waited all this time for this great show to finally be acknowledged, and THIS is how they do it?

Yes Fox , the music was intergral to the show . It is a radio station comey !! Can't be any more obvious than that ! Yep , i cancelled my order and have ordered it from one of the DVD online nostalgia stores . It may not be perfect picture quality but the REAL shows can be watched .

Years I've waited for the chance to see the WKRP show again, and what happens - Fox decides we gotta sell it for $ 19.95 cause, well, gee, that's a magic number isn't it? And so to ensure to sticker price meets some marketing guru's vision, they make a DVD with elevator music and cut out not only the original songs, but too much of the dialog and scenes that occurred during the songs. The voice overs to try and salvage some of the script - boo!You know, I'm not rich, but I'd pay a buck or two more to get the original songs/dialog/scenes, which ought to cover the cost of licencing most of the key songs and salvaging the continuity of the show.Just one more ripoff cause someone at Fox can't be bothered to do the grunt work of getting the rights to the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is wrong, but even worse, stuff is cut out","review":"I received this as a gift and have to say that it is a total ripoff.

Releasing such a well-crafted TV show -- set in a radio station ! -- with the original songs removed and/or with scenes deleted -- is inexcusable. Universal has resorted to this same practice with its releases of \\"Northern Exposure\\" and that case is equally reprehensible. Clearly the music selection was carefully thought out and integral to specific scenes and the themes presented in both of these excellent series. Removing the songs changes, and typically destroys, the original dramatic or comic impact of those scenes. The release of these TV series so revered by fans, in such hacked and despoiled versions, shows flagrant disregard for, and is a disservice to, all involved -- fans, cast and creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"WKRP in CopyRight Doom.","review":"I understand reasoning behind the music rights. Still one would think Fox could make deals with all record labels cause when a song is heard in good or bad context it brings back memories and thus people will think I would really like to have that CD or go to itunes and then buy the track! it is complete free publicity for the artists and record labels. A deal cou;d/ should have been worked out. Sales will falter so bad on this series. Fox acts as though they are broke. They can't even release all of Mary Tyler Moore and blame poor sales - Blame FOX they waited FAR too long to release the second season.

FOX is only concerned with it bank account and not the fans/ consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Original Music, No Sale From Me!","review":"This never should have been released like this.

There are so many discussion topics that came out of the film: inequality, poverty, heritage languages, student activism, cultural chasms, the connection to the civil rights movement, I could go on. I urge everyone to watch this film. I encourage my fellow teachers to incorporate this film into their curriculum. And you don't have to be from an urban area to feel the power of the inequalities in the film or be Latino to feel the pride of these students.

The Victorian Era settings and costumes are portrayed quite well and the characterizations are excellent. Most appealing to me, is Hardwicke's Dr. Watson. He is portrayed as the quite able (though not as astute as Holmes) friend and assistant rather than the buffoon as portrayed by Nigel Green in the films with Basil Rathbone. The video and audio quality of the DVDs is great. I would definitely recommend this collection, as well as the others in this series, to Sherlock Holmes aficianados as well as to those who enjoy good mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe enough has been said, yet...","review":"Actors Brett and Hardwicke, with the entire production team, produced a thorough and captivating series.

Yes it can stink too if poop gets cooked in the hopper, just like any ohter box you need to clean it.Basically there is no such thing as a perfect box this one can be programed and is very elf sufficient but it has issues just ilke other, butif you hate scooping this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Genie - A Bad Experience","review":"After receiving my Cat Genie - it worked one time and quit.

The shipping on the Cat Genie is more than the cost which was $300.00. When we tried to contact them through the only e-mail on their website, it was returned with an undeliverable error. This is an ongoing fight but I would advise against this product and company."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 hours for 2 minute installation and still not there","review":"The water supply line is not as long as the drain line for laundry room intallation therefore you must buy an extension at local hardware store.

Fittings leaked and then the compression nut splt into 2 concentric parts. Obviously not a brass nut just brass plated. No response from my emails to customer service.

It is easy to hook up and maintain. Our 15 year-old cat has no problem using it, and since we previously owned an automatic scooping litter box, the CatGenie did not scare her.

The Cat Genie eliminated all problems that we had been having with one of our cats eliminating outside the litter box. It is completely hands free and so easy to set up! We love it! We have tried the Litter Maid, the Litter Maid Elite, and the PetMate Purrforma Plus litter boxes. The CAT GENIE surpasses them all!!!! The only downside is the sea of plastic pellets tossed outside the box. But we were having the same problem with the cat litter, so I'd much rather have plastic pellets floating around than dukey balls any day! It also elimated the constant smell of kitty pee and doo doo that was in our house previously with the other litter boxes. Not to mention the cats love it! They had always had a fascination with our toilet, and now they have one of their very own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product!","review":"love the CatGenie!

But after a couple of use small parts of the waste get left behind in the litter box because the scoop doesn't do a great job and that left over waste gets washed and dried with the litter and you whole house ends up smelling like shampooed poop. It's disgusting.I have purchased this item about 2 months ago and I have recently found out that im pregnant and the smell of cat waste is very harmful to my fetus so I decided to return the item back to Amazon but they won't give me a full refund and are making me pay for shipping.

I ended up spending more time and effort fixing the clog (not an enjoyable job) than I ever would have scooping it out myself. I am going back to the litter robot. Great product if you have a cat with short hair or enjoy playing endlessly in foul-smelling water.

On top of that, the poo is being baked with the smell of the porta-potty. I could'nt deal with the smell. Also, my cats did not take well to the genie. I tried all the things they suggested.

Customer support was not helpful in getting the thing to work for her and I learned that she gave up on it and returned to the LitterMaid litter box.The one I had was working well and my cat had adapted to it pretty easily. Recently it stopped draining, so I followed the instructions and cleaned it really well. I ran it through the cycle and it overflowed all over the bathroom floor.

A simple change of the \\"sani-solution\\" every 2 weeks (we run ours 4 times a day) and occasional hair removal from the blender shaft, is all it takes to keep your home clean and smelling nice.

Sometimes it doesn't catch all the poo, when that happens the smell of baked cat poo and cleaner can be quite potent. Purchased a arm&hammer air freshner to put in the cat box.

They always take the time to help me figure out what is wrong and they have sent out the replacement parts quickly. We have 3 cats, 2 of which spend at least a part of each day outside, so they should not over work the catgenie. However, I have to take the machine completely apart and work on it monthly because it is blowdrying cat feces. Which is a smell you cannot forget!

However the excitement didn't last. I can't even tell you how many calls we have made to the support desk to help us fix it. We now have become experts at tearing it apart. It always gets clogged and I can't even begin to describe how disgusting it is to deal with soupy cat poop. Also, if any poop gets left behind then it gets blown with hot air and stinks up the whole house. I would not recommend buying this until they fix a few things.May 6, 2009I have truely come to hate the Cat Genie. I am 2 steps away from throwing it into the desert. I have called customer service so many times I've lost count. I have done all the upgrades, etc. And it still won't work. I would not reccommend this item unless you like dealing with smelly cat poo.

A big problem is that the granules get scattered all over the floor, either from sticking to the cat's feet or blown out by the drying cycle. Additional thought is needed in this machine's design because the granules are not cheap to continually add.Another big problem is the smell. Even with the solution added to the granules, there is stiil quite a smell from the cat waste. It would be a wise move to have the unit turn on automatically AFTER the cat uses the box, instead of waiting for the next cycle to occur. Although the machine can be turned on manually anytime, it doesn't help when cat waste stays in the box for ANY length of time. The machine should use motion sensors to not only sense when the cat is in the box but to turn the machine ON when it leaves.Cat waste also sticks to the scoop and the machine operation should be designed to rinse it.Perhaps the designers of this machine will take some advice and improve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love ours, though it's not perfect.","review":"Many other reviewers have given details, so let us simply say that we loved ours until we replaced it with the latest model, the 120.

Every couple of days it give the error lights and beeping telling me that it is clogged when it is not in fact clogged.

It was easy to install in the laundry room where the cat box is kept. The cats seem to like it fine.Unfortunately, it cannot cope with the output of my two cats. I've had to manually run 3 consecutive cycles to end up with clean litter multiple times. Also, if feces are not adequately dried, a horrible bowl of soup can result. The sanitation chemical is probably effective as it is very very pungent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product!","review":"One of the best inventions for cat lovers.

Had a bit of trouble with initial installation. Hose leaked, but called customer service department and they were very helpful and sent new hose via overnight FedEX. The only area of improvement that I can see is a way to prevent the litter from being kicked back out when the scooper is dumping.

But I have had a few occasions when it has given me problems. Most of the problems are easy to fix on your own. But the ones that aren't so easy to fix require a call to the customer service.First of all they are next to impossible to get a hold of. Then once you do reach someone they have no accurate way of telling that you registered your product via their website. The worst part is that I was told that I would be sent a \\"New\\" part for my machine to replace a malfunctioning one and they sent one that was old, cracked, and malfunctioning. It wasn't even clean. I can not believe that I wasted my money on TWO of these things. Like I said, when the product works it's not bad. But the warranty they claim to give you is awful. I am now out 279 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when it works, but expensive","review":"I must note that there have been updates since I purchased my unit 2 years ago. I have multiple cats and multiple litter boxes. One cat took to it without any problem, another started using the toilet, one won't use it and the fourth took a while but got there. Their customer support for this unit is fantastic - I know because I have had to call them numerous times. It has jammed, refused to flush, refused to fill - at one point they determined that the motor was faulty and sent a replacement overnight. It may sound like I don't like it, but I actually do. It is expensive to maintain because of the granules and sanisolution smart cartridges. It would be nice if stores carried them so that you didn't have to pay postage on top of the cost of the actual product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Diabetic Cats","review":"We've had the Cat Genie for about 9 months. I think it is wonderful. We have a diabetic cat who urinates a lot. Other automatic litter boxes didn't work as well and ended up being messy. The clumps were too big for the Litter Robot and the clumps would stick to the LitterMaid's rake.We've never had any problems with the Cat Genie clogging. The little white litter pellets are annoying and do end up all over the floor. I am willing to overlook that since it is much easier to sweep up the pellets than to scoop a smelly litter box.I'd also recommend the non-scented sani-solution. The scented sani-solution can be a bit strong.If you have a diabetic cat, the Cat Genie is definitely the way to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most expensive piece of Crap","review":"I am disabled and at first I was pleased with this machine.

The plastic harbors the smell and you can't get rid of it. The granuals also hold the smell in. Ya it washes everyday and when it is drying your house smells like Cat Crap soup with a Perfumy cover. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

I was less than thrilled but with 2 children under the age of 2 I decided to give it a chance. What a waste of money. The cleaning cycle lasts over a half hour and is loud. The sani solution which is pricey smells very strong like dollar store air freshener. oh and my upstairs bathroom gets at least 10degrees hotter when the thing is running. My cats have yet to look at the stupid thing. After reading other reviews and hearing about the clogging problems this has done it for me. This is going back after a week in my home.

Cleaning cat waste that has been sitting there for a long time took over 2 hours and the most disgusting thing I have ever done. Had to buy gloves and a mask. Not all waste is expelled through the machine so it collects and builds up into a vile putrid paste.

Besides that, you lose a LOT more plastic litter granules down the drain than advertised -- I've gone through three boxes in six months, at twenty bucks a pop. Ouch.

Much better than the speakers in my MacBook."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible choice for portable audio.","review":"I find it hard to believe that any of the reviewers who have made positive comments have actually listened to and compared several different sets of portable speakers. If they had, they would tell you to avoid these losers.The sound is tinny, even with the amplifier on. With only .15 watts per channel, you get volume only marginally above that of a typical set of headphones just lying on the table. These might do OK if you put them on the pillow next to your head, but I suspect that you will still be disappointed.Instead, consider the Panasonic RP-SPT70 travel speakers. They are, when folded, only slightly larger than the T33s. They use four AA batteries and have 1 watt of power output per speaker. They also cost about $10 less than the Sonys.To be fair, the Sonys DO fit in just about any handbag or briefcase. And they are very solidly constructed. But this does not compensate for the poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accessory Error","review":"I purchased this product and specifically wanted to use it with an AC power source. As you can see from the technical specifications, it can use the optional AC-E60A AC Adapter. (The same note is provided on the Sony web site.) That is not true. I spent a long time today with Sony support and the same answer from everyone was that, in fact, this speaker is not compatible with an AC adapter.

They recommended Peacemaker mediation in which this book was required reading and the mediation focused on this book's principles. Through the counseling, my husband was empowered and began seriously threatening my life because of it. Matters became much worse for me with this counseling. If you are in an abusive situation, do NOT agree to go to any counseling with the Peacemaker book as it's focus. I fared much better at the local abuse crisis center.

It is absolutely NOT useful for addressing when sinful behavior is habitual and harmful which seems to be true in the break-down of most marriages, and definitely in those which include any type of abuse.

At first I was leary, but upon opening the book and diving into the material, it was a worthwhile experience. I wanted to share that for readers who are not biblically versed this is a valuable book because it utilizes different aspects of Jesus's teachings and others; then relates those teachings to practical exercises for resolving conflict.For those individuals that are lost in how to appropiately resolve conflict with others in a Christian orientated fashion, this is the ideal book to learn how to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"A book to be read and studied over and over.

This will help you with everything from small conflicts that should be overlooked to something that has torn a family apart.Ken Sande uses many applicable Bible verses and a well written summary with questions at the end to make this book a great reference for any conflict. If one carefully reads through this book I don't know how they would be able to continue on in conflict with anyone.I would recommend this book to anyone and I think that the world would be in a much better place with a mentality that the Peacemaker instills. If you are hesitant at all about the book you can download the first chapter and read it for yourself on their website www.peacemaker.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very confroting","review":"This book is Biblically based and very challenging. It puts the western view of conflict under the microscope and informs Christians on how to resolve conflict God's way.

It stands head and shoulders above my old standard mailbox that the post-person kept complaining about. However, my complaint is that this box does not accommodate the weekly grocery store flyers and magazines that are a little too big to fall down to the floor of the box. Instead they get wedged in a diagonal position and block the rest of the mail from accumulating neatly; making the whole pile of mail difficult to wrest from the bowels of the box.

This is not the only example. She just muddles up American and English terms and turns of speech and you're reminded every few paragraphs that its an American novel really. I would have bought an Angela Lansbury mystery if I wanted that. Its really unsatisfying reading this book, because it doesnt give you the cozy sense it should. She has spun out, to breaking point - phrases that you keep running into in each book of hers and its not endearing.

Emily Brightwell's pleasing heroine is just this person, and, like an army commander, also manages to marshal the rest of the inspector's staff to help with her task. In this first book of the seventeen, I think, stories about the Mrs. Jeffries solved mysteries, the clever housekeeper encourages her Inspector Witherspoon to question the manner and motive behind the apparent suicide of a local doctor. Naturally, by book's end, it is Mrs. Jeffries who succeeds in uncovering the relevant clues that lead the Yard to conclude it is murder, not suicide, that did the doctor in!Other than the story's fine \\"upstairs-downstairs\\" descriptions and actions, there is little other history here, and we find the story a bit bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off","review":"I feel that I have been royally ripped off and wasted $12.00 on a book I have already read.

The soloists are very good and both Emma Kirkby and Panito Iconomou have richly evocative voices. The choir is also very good and Parrott conducts them all with aplomb. This piece (and often this recording in particular) is often recommended by various sources as a \`must have' to get your classical collection started, in fact that is how I came to find this, and I have to say after listening to more classical music in general and other recordings of this I have to agree. It is a gentle way to ease yourself into a Mass of this kind and shouldn't overwhelm you. I still enjoy putting this on at odd moments and this is one recording you will keep coming back to.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mass in B minor review","review":"Enjoyed this version of Bach's Mass. It's nice tohear it one voice on a part - quite different thanthe sometimes overpowering big choir recordings.One voice has just a touch too much vibrato, but that isa small gripe.

The singing is very precise technically, but incredibly lifeless and dull. For example, \\"Ladaumus te\\" is sung as if it was an exercise in breath control and diction and the singer conveys not one iota of joy. All of the climactic moments (Gloria, Gratias agimus, Et resurrexit..) become depressingly anti-climactic as the \\"choir\\" (which is actually only 1 person per part) drones on, singing notes but not music.

The Sony Vaio computer has 3 speaker inputs for: front, rear and center/subwoofer. The speakers have never lived up to expectations. Sony's own software test for the speakers failed every test - as in hearing sound coming from the speaker the sound is supposed to come out of: front, rear, etc. It's easy to connect all the speakers as long as you know which speakers get connected to which input on the back of the computer. I had no problem connecting them. I did have a problem with the sound quality. The subwoofer kicks only when the low end of whatever you're listening to is overwhelming - like a big explosion or something like that. Other than that they sound cheap and tinny with almost no bottom end at all.

Many people have commented about the granules ending up around the house and they do get kicked or tracked out of the CatGenie pretty easily. We have ours in our bathroom, though, and have found that keeping a dustpan nearby and sweeping them up every few days works well. As long as you're not picking up a lot of floor grunge with them, you can just dump them right back into the CatGenie and they'll get washed clean on the next cycle. This cuts down on the amount of granule purchasing we have to do. Also, be sure not to overfill the CatGenie - overfilling can cause clogs.

This has NO dust- which is wonderful. They seem like really hard plastic though and I never see one looking biodegraded at all (over a year of use). If you are really having trouble with tracking and you have good litter mats in place- make sure your unit is washing correctly.

This bed has a strong chemical smell. The smell was strong enough to make my throat itch. As soon as we opened the packaging, we immediately noticed it. We tried airing it out in the garage for a day, which helped a little, but the smell was still there after we brought the bed back in. It got gradually better after a week, but I could still smell it when reading my child a bedtime story. I know the finish is supposed to be non-toxic, but after doing some research online (and finding many similar reviews where people had problems with the smell), I have not found any information on VOCs. I returned it and exchanged it with a similar bed by DaVinci, which did not smell at all. So if you are trying to decide between the two, here's your answer. Otherwise, the bed is beautiful and sturdy, and so is the DaVinci one.

The issue I had with other toddler beds is they were too high for my 22 month old toddler. I saw this bed online and it received great reviews so I decided to order it. This bed looks exactly how it looks online when you take it out of the box. It is absolutely beautiful! It is made well and my daughter is able to climb in and out of the bed, with no assistance, because it is low to the ground.

Assembly took a while since the slats have to fit into holes so after you put one in and try to put in the next one then the previous one slips out. When assembling the slats, you will have to figure a method that works best for you.

It took the TWO bed to make one decent one. I am still not satisfied but I do not want to keep taking this large boxed bed back to UPS. I am keeping this bed only because my grandson needs a bed and I can't keep waiting for a replacement which will probably end up like the first one.

Muhammed Suicmez is a killer growler, his growls are comprehensible and his lyrics are very intelligent. He is also one awesome guitarist, he plays lightning fast, and solos with the second guitarist, and - no lie - THE BASSIST SOLOS TOO!! All three mix together perfectly. Oh yeah, and we can't forget the drummer, he is fast and on beat, just like Dave Lombardo (Slayer) and Pete Sandoval (Morbid Angel).This album is fast paced, starting with \\"Stabwound\\", then slows down a bit for \\"The Stillborn One\\", but then gets speedy again through the rest of the tracks. There are no standout tracks because they ALL rock, so no skipping is necessary here.If you don't have this, be sure to obtain it.

Necrophagist is chaotic yet incredibly tight and refined, with sound production quality that is a cut above the death metal average. The sinister, virtuoso guitars leads are plentiful but not merely guitar wanking adhered to the arrangement. The songs are well-crafted and the band is an organic unit where different instrumental elements weave, join, and fracture. Song structures are wild, overflowing with shifting times signatures, herky-jerky rhythms, and with a level of finesse that summons the \\"thinking man's metal\\" tag ascribed to Spiral Architect, but with a brutality and intensity that could only be that of death metal. RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"already overrated","review":"Please, people, can we have a little objectivity here? Firstly, this band is about as original as ice on the north pole. Did anybody mention Morbid Angel yet...or Chuck Schuldiner's Death? So their stuff is a bit more on the technical side but rarely is there a memorable riff. The vox are your generic cookie monster style but the drumming is pretty good. On the whole this thing isn't outstanding in any way. Songwriting is rather messy with a distinct carelessness for arrangement - these songs lack point and purpose. Nothing groovy or blasting to bang your head to; barely interesting for music theorists though - to keep them counting all those crazy (rah rah) odd time signatures.

At the end of the day, it's pretty much what i expected.

As such it was something of a landmark recording. This CD re-issue has all those original tracks plus mixed some additional ones from various recordings of Scottish regimental pipes & drums on the EMI label. The end result is a great collection of vintage army piping the like of which we shall not see or hear again. The quality of the original recordings has not been modified as they were good enough as they were. Each regiments history is briefly highlighted in the linear notes. EMI released a later recording on LP in 1977 for the Queens Silver Jubilee which again had all the regimental pipes & drums plus massed Military bands of what was then the Scottish Division Beating Retreat in Edinburgh.

It even prompted me to visit the site of the last remaining standing building that housed one of Nashville's black clubs that showcased this music. I was saddened to see the sign painted over but could still read \\"The New Era Club\\" under the paint. I was also able to contact one of the few remaining living artists featured on the CD.Night Train to Nashville features mainstream hits created here by the original artists, as well as many which were covered by top rockers in the 60's and 70's.

It is filled with outstanding photos and practical advice. The author explains the usual dilemmas with film, cameras, composition, etc. but also includes very good information about labeling, storing and organizing your work (a link is included for a software program that I was not aware of - thank you!).I bought this book mainly, however, for learning more about taking nature photos with a digital camera. While the author raves about the digital format and even confesses that he uses digital for most of his work now, there are only 2 photos in the entire book (out of hundreds) taken with a digital camera. This is a little disappointing and kind of puzzling. I would have liked to know more about the specifics for using digital photos for publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a Ripper!!","review":"I picked this up for a bit of gratuitous escapism and it turned out to be a really enjoyable book. OK, so it isn't in the same class as a good Stephen King novel, but Laymon wastes no time in dropping you into the deep end and doesn't get lost along the way. This story is less of a supernatural chiller and more of a splattering gore-fest. The book is actually a very good analogue to the classic B horror movies that were spawned in the 70s - Bravo! It is intentionally confronting as Laymon seemingly tries to squeeze strong scenes into every chapter and this might disturb some people or indeed many. But, if you are looking for a somewhat tongue-in-cheek, page-turning book, that makes no apologies, then this is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book should be called, \\"Make you wish you WERE dead.\\"","review":"First of all, if your going to write a plot about a mummy than at least attempt to feature alittle more background story on the mummy than metering out the same lines to blithely encompass her existence over and over again.Also, Laymon interjected a random side story about young people being kidnapped and sexually molested and tortured without ever being able to tie it into the plot plausibly except for a brief moment towards the end.Another thing that bothered me, if the mummy was supposedly granted eternal life then why was fire able to destroy it so easily?The foreward by Dean Koontz was not only the best part of the book, but the only reason to ever pick it up and open it.What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it less than 1 star?","review":"I am not a horror genre fan, but picked up the book when it looked like a good old-fashioned cheesy \\"mummy\\" story.

Also, I was induced to try her recipe for Eggplant Parmesan even though I've never liked eggplant, and it's now one of my favorites.Most of the dishes are easily scaled down when cooking for one or two people. For instance, I halved the Eggplant Parmesan recipe and cooked it in a 9\\" square pan instead of a 9\\"X13\\" one, and it came out great.The only things that seem disappointing are the vegetable side dishes - but maybe that's because I haven't tried any.

My spouse loved the chapter on using divination techniques like the pendulum for further divine guidance. My favourite chapter holds lovely vows and instructions on how a couple can write their own heartful lyrics. This book is essential for handfasting couples and is likewise full of incredible ideas and information for couples who want to personalize a traditional wedding ceremony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for students","review":"I'm a student of Naturology in Portugal, and I find this book very useful when it comes to descriptions and explanations about the cell and the cicles of cell functioning. It as nearly every topic we students give in our classes, and the language of the book is very, very acessible. It is clearly recomended for students of Medicine, Biochemistry, Biology, Naturology, etc. etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but packs a big punch","review":"As a muliti use tool this is the best. Small but tough when you need to get into the wall or other areas to overhaul you need something that will do the job but will not take alot of energy.The chrome is easy to keep free of junk and never needs painting. Just alittle polish and you are on your way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truckman Fire Axe","review":"I bought this axe for my husband's collection. He is a retired firefighter and we have a room dedicated to fire memorbelia and collectables. It is very nice. It makes a nice addition to his collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just got done watching \\"You've Got Mail\\" and I enjoyed it","review":"Well, I bought \\"You've Got Mail\\" on DVD having not seen the m 2f8 ovie but I heard from people it was good. Plus I really enjoy Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan the work great together. I have to say I really enjoyed the movie and I found both Ryan and Hanks did a nice job. Also the DVD version has some nice features. The only problem I had was when Meg's character all of the sudden saw Hanks as her good friend, even though she hated him before. Other then that I enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy camper","review":"The item that was shipped was a completely different item. Different color, different internal holding material, and no hook on the to attach to something. While the item I was sent is still an SD holder, it's 100% not what I ordered. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as shown","review":"Two of the items (separate orders) arrived in separate packages today. The shipped ones are black, opens differently than shown and both are missing a connecting strap although the package shows how to connect same to the case. The connecting strap shown on the package is like a shoe lace not with a metal connector as shown. My advise is go to Walmart to get such an item.I am returning both at Amazon expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not received what is in the picture","review":"I received a black case, which is nice in the outside, but I'm not really convinced about the hard foam it has in the inside. I had bought these cases before and the inner material that holds the cards is solid and perfect because it holds them tight yet it's easy to take them out. This new foam doesn't seem as good. And they didn't send what they announce in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRODUCT PICTURE IS FALSE!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Received the item., it is NOT what is shown but has the same brand name. The one received is cheap, flimsy and has NO keychain attached. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! Not even worth it having to go to UPS to ship it back. Amazon is going downhill, be careful what you order on here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little storage unit.","review":"Tidily and securely stores 4 HD cards AND you can use it as a key chain. I wouldn't, but you could. It's kind of cute too."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine!","review":"What can you say about a case? It closes and stays closed. It does a great job of protecting our cards. My wife likes the key chain thing, because she can move it from purse to purse. We use ours to hold SD cards that have videos on them.Note: this thing is a bit \\"clunky\\", by that I mean that it is pretty big, but that just means that you won't have to worry about finding it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulky & heavy but safe","review":"Actual outer dimensions: 2.17\\"W x 2.56\\"D x 0.75\\"H. Weight: 1.9 oz. Good hard plastic shell exterior and protective rubber interior. This case is not waterproof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal travel memory card storage","review":"I don't know a better and smaller case for the 4 memory cards I take with me on a trip"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sense of Security","review":"Purchased this to be able to store the memory cards for video and camera on a trip to Japan. It was easy to find, and held the cards securely.The only thing perhaps to ask for is some kind of labeling option to say what card is where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Photo","review":"Based on the photo, I expected to receive two pieces, an 8-card case and a 4-card case. It is only an 4-card case. The description did not make it clear that it was two separate items in the photo. If it had been the 8-card case I would have been satisfied (not happy, but satisfied) because that is what I wanted. I had to buy another product to actually get what I wanted. It would have cost me nearly as much to return it as a buying the new one so I just kept it. The description and photos need to be more accurate. I will say the that the 4-card case seems to be good quality for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad advertised photo","review":"Be careful when ordering this product. I purchased this believing it to be 2 separate cases as shown in the advertised photo. What i received was just one case (the smaller one). I was planning on returning this product but the cost to send it back would be more than what i paid for it. It is bulky but a decent and durable case if you're looking to purchase one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case","review":"This is a very durable case that holds four memory cards. The interior is a rubber which cushions the cards and the exterior is plastic. It has held up very well. I also like that it has a hook to attach to your keys or to a bag for easy access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital memory case","review":"I purchased this item last Christmas and LOVED it, came exactly as the picture shows in the ad. However, I purchased one this Christmas for my mother and it looks NOTHING like the picture. There is NO key ring with it (the main reason I liked this one so much). The rest of it is pretty much the same, but there is NO key ring with the item I ordered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CLIP","review":"The case I received has no clip. Must be \\"new and improved\\" version.... Too bad because the case itself is nice, there's just no way to clip it to anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I purchased this item because of the chain that is shown attached to it but when it was delivered, there was no chain attached to mine. I am very disappointed because the chain was my main attraction to it. I feel like the picture is very deceptive, if the item you receive does not match the picture you've been shown. I'd like to return it but for the cost of shipping it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storage Device for Digital Memory","review":"My wife and I travel frequently and we also shoot a lot of pictures in Nikon Raw file format. Because of the large file sizes, we need to carry several memory chips with us and these storage devices are perfect. They come with a clip and chain which makes it easy to clip the device on a camera bag or a belt loop. I would recommend these to anyone who travels with their camera gear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I was looking for a place to store my used and unused memory cards. This is perfect! I ordered 4 of them and my only complaint is I should have ordered more! They are sturdy, and small enough to fit in my camera bag. Love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly large","review":"I didn't expect this case to be almost 1/2\\" thick. It uses up about the same volume as the 4 memory cards in 4 separate plastic cases. It does have a lot of padding, but I don't believe that SD cards are that sensitive to damage on being dropped. This case looks like you could drop it off the top of a tall building and your SD cards would still be OK. I'd like something slimmer in my pocket."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},x={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-3eebb93d"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/53.md","filePath":"quotesmag/53.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/53.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
