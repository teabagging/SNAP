While informative, it fails to capture the reader, who comes away knowing a little more about the disorder, but never fully comprehends what life was like for the author who grew up with Tourette Syndrome, though tantalizing glimpses are offered.

After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings.The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right.Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record.For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' \\"Freak In\\" or the aforementioned E.S.T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Cherry Moments","review":"My first CD from Nils, will check out more.There are sections of Khmer where his playing reminds me of Don Cherry from his Codona or Multikulti eras.

If that sounds intriguing to you, I'd say check this Nils CD out.But Cherry is not the only sound here. Much is B+ Laswell-ish and that's fine in my book.There is a spot or two with a sort of Death Metal-ish growling which I could definitely do without. There lies the 4-star rating rather than 5-star.ps - The ECM sound that I'm familiar with is smoother than Khmer, think snowy Winter.

I was torn between this item and the name brand Xacto knife kit, which cost more but looked very similar. Convinced that if I bought the Xacto knife kit, I'd be most likely paying more money for the name, I opted to purchase this cheaper kit instead. Well, the quality is definitely cheap! You can tell it just by looking at it! I only paid $4.95 for the kit...it will serve the purpose...however, in my opinion, it is NOT appropriate quality for gift-giving!

In my opinion, the material in this book is derivative, and the judge's comments only reinforce my view on the state of poetry in america in general...i.e. [its bad].Can't compare to any of the greats: Pound, Bishop, cummings. Save your $$ and buy something from someone who can actually write...instead of buying the \\"best first book of poetry\\" some hayseed has read.I would rate it 0 stars but amazon.com doesn't give us that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it didn't have aberration","review":"I'll start by saying I like how compact it is.

I have followed this series since Season 1. The characters have come a long way. Some have grown up and some will never change like Pope. The introduction of new characters are great and right on time. It was getting a little boring with some of the same old characters. This season started off slow but has picked up a bit with the Season Finale approaching no telling what's going to happen. Looking foward to the Finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"syfy","review":"It was great. Hopefully will not have to order another episode to watch.

Decent acting for the most part, let's face it Noah Wyle is no Robert DeNiro, but I've liked him ever since his ER days, and with this genre of television on TNT you're not going to get someone of that caliber anyway.The CGI could of course be better; although again, with a TV show you just don't have the budget comparison to a theatrical release.All-in-all, a pretty well rounded series and one that I enjoy watching. Keep it up Noah/Steven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth watching","review":"My husband and I are becoming huge fans of the post apocalyptic genre and Falling Skies has become a solid addition to our repertoire. We started watching it because the Walking Dead season was over for the year and we needed a replacement show. It did not disappoint! The story is original and unpredictable (for the most part). Noah Wylie and the actors that play his sons, especially the actor playing Ben, are all solid. I would love for another station with a higher budget to pick up this show so the special effects wouldn't have to be so SYFY channel bad. Other than that, great show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ending for a show","review":"Quite frankly, unless these new Super Aliens are there to help, the last scene with the whole crew standing in a crowd, rifles and pitchforks at the ready and in a perfect position to be wiped out in one large explosion, would have been a satisfactory ending for the series. I don't know if i'll continue to follow for a 3rd.

This is an interesting and provocative show, the storyline is engaging. There is the macro world that they deal with, down to the micro world of the day to day living with people, the day to day struggles of being hunted, the intrigue and mystery of not understanding the enemy nor their greater intentions, makes the whole show fascinating to watch. I actually feel that the show is getting better and better as it develops and goes on, the characters and their struggles seem more real. I sincerely hope this is not a 2-3 season wonder, but a show that evolves and explores a number of twists and turns through the journey of a theoretically plausible scenario of our future. No, I personally don't believe that this would ever come to pass, but it is a theoretical possibility and thus it leaves one feeling intrigued if not frighten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major episode","review":"A little more drama, a little less Pow-Pow!, but this was well placed.

Our DVR had a problem and recorded choppy video which was unwatchable. So, big points for coming through with the rest of the season. Looking forward to the new season when it comes out.Having said that, we've been Very Disappointed with the reliability of Amazon Prime streaming video. This includes TV shows and movies. Most of the time the service informs us that we have insufficient bandwidth which is demonstrably untrue. On more than one occasion we have switched to [competing video streaming service], sometimes for the same exact show, and had no problems at comparable video resolution. So there is something about Amazon's video delivery that is creating a delivery bottleneck. We sometimes give up because we're spending our evening watching slow orange circle clock icons.

It's sweet.Also, the plots move significantly with Ben leaving and becoming a leader in the new rebellion of the slaves. It's a copycat of the \\"V\\" idea of a fifth column behind the invaders, who don't want to be slaves. However, it's still great humanity.Everything is moving well for political intrigue as well.

It seems to me that any advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel wouldn't mess around with bombs and lasers. If they really wanted to exterminate the native species, they most likely would have used some kind of genetically engineered bio-weapon that would have a near 100% kill rate. Also, some of the episodes have become more and more like a soap with the various on and off again relationships.I have noticed that this series has been renewed for a third season to air in the summer of 2013.

Jericho was by far the best post-apocalyptic show until this show. In some ways, FS is better because it answers questions that Jericho did not. There were many unknowns in Jericho that could irritate some people but the interpersonal dynamics of the show redeemed it. Falling Skies has incredible relationships, deeply defined characters, action, aliens, & even a little romance.

It seems it covers everything while, in fact, almost all results are just presented rather than analyzed, let alone analyzed in depth. The best thing about the book is probably the table of contents, as one gets an overall idea of what econometrics deals with today. In fact, no other book aims at covering so much. Otherwise, it looks, feels and performs like an undergraduate text ...On top of that, this edition in particular is especially bad: the blue ink stains your hands, and there are MORE typos than in the previous one. If you absolutely want to get it, buy the third edition (if you find one used).If you want more serious general econometrics, have a look at Davidson and MacKinnon's book.

New to this release is a move to 3D graphics, and a speed-kill scoring system. At first glance it looks a bit different from the Raiden we've known, however the basic gameplay elements are unchanged: Shoot stuff, collect medals, and avoid flying into bullets.The 3D graphics are a pretty good representation of Raiden's 2D roots. I can easily recognize old friends (enemies) before giving them a hug (blasting them).As you destroy enemies, you'll see little numbers appear in the corner. These are scoring multipliers, based on how quickly you shoot them down. To maximize your score, you'll need to play aggressively and blow up everything as quickly as possible. This is generally a good idea for survival as well, because craters don't shoot back.If you like Raiden games there's a good chance you'll like this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME SUCKS","review":"If you're a shmup fan then this game certianly isn't for you. It suffers from the worst problem any shooting game can suffer from, you constantly feel underpowered. Not as bad as Karous but on par with Homura. What's worst is that you can upgrade your guns but the upgrade usually suck worst than your defualt gun. You have a green laser and a blue laser, both of which are next to useless. If you get enough power ups you'll get some missles with the lasers but it doesn't do much good at all. Beyond that the game is extermly boring. Theres rarely any time that the screen is filled with bullets (even on the hardest setting) usually it's a boring burst that speeds through the screen.It's puzzling to me how games like Mushihimesama and ESP Galuda don't get ports over here but garbage like this does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 31- Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightment","review":"This little book beholds every answer to the questions I have long searched for.

Jake, depressed after an iffy battle, is given the oppurtunity to go back in time, walk past the construction site, and live life normally.The resulting story is nonetheless somewhat entertaining; indeed, a new perspective is shown.

This album certainly occupies a much lower place, in which, as another reviewer put it, jazz-rock noodling and synthesizers replace the \\"country with a funky beat\\" that (for me) defines the \`real' Little Feat.By the time of this album, Little Feat was effectively two bands: one backing Lowell George's synthesis of rock, country, and funk; and another without him, dabbling in now-dated 70s-style fusion with little lasting appeal.

It has to be the most unthrilling \\"thriller\\" that has ever appeared on my bookshelves.It took some stamina to plough through nearly five hundred pages of the fictional ramblings of a self-obsessed woman who doesn't trust anyone around her and just moans and groans about her circumstances. To be fair to the author, there are a couple of chapters of action towards the end of the book, but they are far from convincing and I was willing the protagonist to put the narrator out of her misery. Sadly, she survived to inflict more tedium on the reader.Had this been Minette Walters's first novel, she would have sunk into oblivion along with thousands of other wannabe authors.

If you're a woman, you're bound to find you fantasy here, whether it's a hot eyed little Cajun on a New Orleans holiday, a passionate intellectual in your local library, two(!)lovely men focused on only you, or one of the most passionate and sexy takes on the vampire myth I have ever read.

First of all I am from the generation that can truly relate to the music and the times of the sixties so it might have less appeal for someone younger or older. The Beatles music is very well used to tell the story, and I love the way it was sung. The music and the dialog are seamlessly intertwined so that you wonder if the music was written for the movie or the movie was written for the music. Most of the turmoil and issues of the sixties are fairly captured, and for me the movie brought back not only memories but almost-forgotten feelings about the events. It is well worth the time to check out some of the special features.

Here is the deal, i am a huge movie buff, musical theater buff, beatles fan, love julie taymor's previous works, etc. This movie, at the turn of each plot change, did not work. The cinematography is wonderful, musical arrangements pretty solid, decent singing, etc. However, the plot seemed almost non-existent; everytime another part of the story began there was yet another seperation making me not care about the characters. i think the best way to sum up my perception of this movie is that it's a lot of \\"moments\\". there were many wonderful moments in the movie, but nothing to sentimentaly tie them together for me.

Simply put they tried to cram too much character development into a short period, what they should have done was tone down on the backstories and make the film somewhat more linear. i didn't recognize a solid plot that progressed until midway through the movie.

Plus it's really difficult to write a story around existing material and make it work... and these people didn't. It's also overwrought in many places - and while some sequences like \\"A Little Help From My Friends\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" work, others (particularly \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"For The Benefit of Mr. Kit\\") are horribly... well... laughable. Eddie Izzard is particularly terrible and improvises dialogue (or delivers lines from a really bad screenplay, I'm not sure which) during the song, and it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up already.","review":"I very much enjoyed the films Mulin Rouge and HairSpray, so I was open minded when going to see this one as well. I was seriously disapointed. I was bored throughout 95% of this movie.

Don't expect to see some lavish performance with spectuacular special effects; you just won't see it here. The plot, actors, and writing were all extremely boring to me. For me, a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plasticine movie","review":"Here's the short version: Take every stereotype of the Sixties and every stereotypical photographic/videographic image of the Sixties, then throw them into a blender with the Beatles catalog. What comes out? This tasteless mush of a movie.The longer version of a critique involves the fact that the creators of this so-called movie want to tug at our heart-strings with familiar images that are supposed to elicit sentimental feelings out of historical parts of our lives. Images of 'Nam are supposed to make us remember how horrible the war was. Images reminiscent of Kent State try to evoke the horrors of that tragedy. Referencing common themes of the Sixties does not make this a good movie about the Sixties. \\"Across the Universe\\" lacks any coherent narrative voice that makes us care about the characters in the story.And, as a side-tangent, Bono's cameo was comical in that he came across as a Robin Williams caricature of Bono."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't wait for it to end","review":"I was told I would love this movie because I am a Beatles fanatic and love the 60s culture. So like so many others that were miss guided into thinking that a movie worth of being associated with the Beatles was made was sorely disappointed. The writing was terribly unoriginal, a majority of the songs were butchered to pieces and I felt absolutely no chemistry amongst the cast. I kept watching hoping for something better to happen but ended up just glad it was finally over. If you love the Beatles and find yourself in Vegas go see Love because that was one of the greatest shows have every seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really horrible !!!","review":"I'm a huge Beatles fan and gave this movie a try. It was horrible. Simply put: Bad acting, Bad Beatles covers, and especially BAD PLOT!!They basically stole the plot from an NBC made for TV movie called \\"The 60s\\" (or something like that) from 1998. It really is, more or less, the exact same plot, but dare I say it? The NBC movie is actually a lot better!!On the soundtrack: I love the Beatles music, as they recorded it however. The people who sang the covers are not even really singers, just actors pretending to be singers.And the director is a major hack and a pretensious snob. Special effects subpar, direction horrible, etc...This movie likes to romanticize the 60s, and I can see how it can appeal to 13-14 year old wannabe \\"hippies\\" but anybody over 21 with any self respect should not get caught praising this \\"movie\\" or whatever this piece of **** calls itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with portable device","review":"This movie is INCOMPATIBLE with my Sony NWZ-S545 Walkman, even though Amazon claims otherwise.

But when they started introducing new characters with any name they could pull from a song regardless of what the song was about I couldn't believe it! Prudence, Sadie, Jude, Lucy, JoJo? Are you kidding me?I didn't care for the covers, the story was just about as thrown together as you could get. Some of the imagery was interesting, but the song placement was disorienting and sometimes downright boring. I went with a friend who knew I was a The Beatles fan, and when we left the theatre he just looked at me, and I just looked back. What do you say? I wanted to like the movie, I really did. It should have been one more way to celebrate The Beatles.If you need modern day The Beatles interpretation, go see LOVE, the Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.

It just went crazy on me. The songs weren't sung or performed that well and left me wishing to hear the original versions instead. The plot also didn't seem to have much purpose other than a thrown together love story mixed with a little anti-war for good measure.

The songs truly come to life when situations are put to them. The covers of the songs are just as good as when Ringo, Lenon, McCartney, and Harrison did them in the 60's. Jim Sturguss is an amazing actor and singer. He takes over the movie with his Liverpool accent, and inviting eyes.

Steer clear of this dreck!","review":"This movie insults the music of The Beatles and musicals in general. This movie fails to provide even one remote reason to indulge in any of these characters.

Xanadu at least had original songs and of course the beautiful Olivia Newton-John on roller skates. How can you beat that?? LOL. Stay away from this overhyped pile of junk.

The songs chosen are the generic Beatles, none of the true good ones (come on, no A Day in the Life? or Sgt Peppers? or Norwegian Wood? or Back in the USSR? the list goes on and on). They throw in random Beatles songs that don't fit into the plot what-so-ever (Blackbird, Come Together, While My Guitar Gently Weeps just to name a few). Oh, but there are plenty generic Beatles songs: Hey Jude, I Want to Hold Your Hand, Something, All You Need is Love, and the list keeps on going. Don't get me wrong, those are some great songs, but the Beatles defiantly have better songs. If you are not a beatles fan or a somewhat beatles fan, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this movie. If you are a die-hard, like myself, you will not. All of my other die-hard beatles fans haven't liked it either, but those who aren't will like it.

What were they thinking? It looked like the film was being made up as it went along. Whimsical nonsense pretending to be sincere. My friend said it seemed like it was made by someone who didn't really live in the 60's but only imagined what it must have been like. Even though the original Beatles songs are great, this movie managed to dull and distort even these masterpieces of enduring artistic excellence. I would not recommend this film to anyone except for perhaps the very young who otherwise would not listen or be exposed to the Beatles songs in any other format as even this movie couldn't completely demolish their brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmorizing...","review":"\\"Across The Universe\\" is two films in one: the first a linear story, and the second a travelogue in time. The story aspect, told through Beatles lyrics and musical numbers, is uneven and at times wanting for more depth and direction. Were \\"Across The Universe\\" judged by this alone, it would not hold up. Luckily there is the second film within the film, which grandly succeeds in visually and emotionally transporting you back into the sixties, where the love began, minds expanded, and, inevitably, the grand bubble was skewered by reality. In these segments there is true cinematic brilliance, where the viewer can almost smell the flowers and taste the acid as the music and imagery take them on an unforgettable ride through the beauty and tumult of the times. Though the very beginning and very end are a bit flat, the rest of this amazing film should be more than enough to both entertain and engulf you in a seductive, disturbing, and intimately moving experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"What a great movie to speed you through the events of the 70's using the Beatles' songs to tell the story.

Like FORREST GUMP, the film lightly hits on the major events of the decade. The Vietnam War, rise of FOLKIES in SOHO, and Teenagers falling in love.The film, like the sixties, metaphorically uses the music of the BEATLES as a soundtrack. The major characters are named for persons mentioned in BEATLES SONGS (i.e. Prudence, JoJo, Sexy Sadie, Dr. Robert, etc.)The film is (SGT?) Peppered with Cameos, BONO, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, etc.) and uses the most amazing visuals to tie in the sometimes Psychedelic lyrics of the BEATLES very smoothly into the events of the basic storyline:\\"A Boy from Liverpool journey's to America to meet his biological father, only to feels stranded, and eventually meets a GIRL, who he falls in love with at first sight. Sadly, She's taken, and her boyfriend is due to head for Vietnam. NUFF SAID...the tender love story is even more touching than...well, LOVE STORY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a film, but a beautiful venture.","review":"I love The Beatles, and their music is flawless. We all know their story in the camera eye, but what resides in the songs they wrote and sang? Perhaps this film explains it beautifully, and not only do the actors perform it, they live it! I went to see this film on its last week of screening because I wanted to know what it held in store, and fortunately, it exceeded way beyond my expectations. As of now, this is my favorite film of all time, and that's saying a lot. My sister also enjoyed it to call it her favorite as well. Thus, the important message in life is always \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and it is something that will wake us up and bring tears to our eyes because that is a world we need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beatles music Covers very artistic look at the 60's","review":"This cast of relatively unknown actors sings their way through the 60's and 70's, but it's more about the history of those times than it is about the Beatles. If you lived through the Beatles, Vietnam, Kent State, the race riots, this movie may explain the mileaux better, and more artistically, than anything currently available.Across the Universe came out the same month that my wife, son and I saw Love, the Cirque de Soleil show set to original Beatles songs re-mixed by legendary producer Sir George Martin and his son, Giles. That piece of live theater starts in post WW II bombed out London/Liverpool, with themes of British aristocracy being lost, the kids equally lost, and everybody looking for their future.While Love stays with British history, Across the Universe looks at both sides of the pond, as they say. I don't think you'll have any trouble following the history, and you'll love the music, some of it very serious, some very avante."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie","review":"Almost as good as watching it on the big screen.

I was 23 in 1967 and lived on the lower East Side of New York City where most of the scenes in the film takes place. It all happened the way Taymor describes from the street people, to the draft, to the Bread and Puppet Theatre marching down Fifth Avenue. So if you want to experience or relive that moment in time or explain to your children why that moment made such a difference watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical","review":"This is a rock musical set in 1960s America.

I must say that I definitely should have followed my first instinct.The music was fantastic and for those who love Beatles music as I do, will not be disappointed.The movie however was a completely different story. This movie was extremely drawn out with little flow and just plain boring. I watched this with my 16 year old and she couldn't wait to watch. When the movie was over, we looked at each and said \\"Thank goodness that's over.\\" Not a reaction I was expecting.I can say that I would be tempted to purchase the soundtrack, but know without a doubt that the movie will not make my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"I ama beatle fan and i\`ve listen that this movie was full of song of the beatles, but when I saw it and listen how they destroy those beautiful songs I was very disapointed, the only song that sound nice was Being for the benefit of Mr kite,"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing... but only for adults","review":"I've already said quite a bit about the film, but a few more points of warning. This movie has a PG-13 rating. It's regrettable. It deserves an R.The amount of language is quite minimal, though they do drop the f-bomb. The violence level is quite high. What really amazes me though is the amount of nudity.There's no *graphic* full frontal, but it's still there, and quite obvious in many scenes. There's also a considerable amount of partially and fully topless women. I didn't realize the MPAA was so lax on their standards these days. For those reasons I think we should have an R-rating on Across The Universe. It would give the movie a decent excuse for the skin, and a chance to make the movie a little edgier as well.This is an A+ movie still lacking. The psychedelic visuals, especially in the Mr. Kite montage are really disturbing, a true PG-13. I'd have loved to see more. A little more of Ms. Wood would have been nice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When actors try to become professional singers, the results are usually disappointing. In \\"Across the Universe\\" they try too hard, hoping that the audience will be impressed with their singing. Their renditions are too self-conscious, too forced. It would have been better to use professional (talented) singers, rather than trying to turn actors into quality singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Across the Universe Movie","review":"\\"Across the Universe\\" is a great movie. We received it in great condition promptly. It's one of our favorites. The movie is highlighted by most of \\"The Beetles\\" songs. The makers of the movie did a wonderful job of colors and automation throughout the whole movie. The storyline keeps moving along to the beat of the Beetles! A personal view of the 60's in America. Awesome to add to our movie collection. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED it!!!","review":"Just scanning a few of the reviews...they all said it very well. Bottom line, I am ready to buy the movie and also for good measure the soundtrack so I have options. It was creative, fun, and just when it got to be a bit much..they broke into a fab song..what more could you ask??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love the Beatles and I like how they put their songs together into a story. They put some different spins on the ideas behind the songs, but it comes out good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitch Shifter H*LL","review":"There is a lot about this movie to like. The vignettes associated with the various songs worked well enough. Unfortunately there is blatant autotuning applied to much of the singing - like pop country music. Why are we not allowed to hear the actual singers' voices without this manipulation? It is very off-putting. Technology destroys art."},{"rating":"1","title":"tries to hard.","review":"the idea of coming up with a story to connect songs into a musical has potential, but the story felt forced. I can dig artistic movies, but this one didn't come across as artistic, but as trying to hard to be artsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Terrible. This movie was TERRIBLE. If it was just a musical about the sixties, that would be one thing. But as someone who holds the music of The Beatles so dearly, I was appalled. Pretty much sums it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"This movie is almost not even worth reviewing! This abomination of a film has ruined all that I love of the Beatles. The whole thing sounds and looks like a bunch of high school drama drop-outs on valium singing and acting to standardized situatioins and backdrops of every 60's anti-protest, anti-Vietnam image/visual stereotype you can possibly imagine! The only parts bareable within were Bono's and Eddie Izzard's cameos...but you know why they were good?...because they are talented! On top of all that, they respect what the Beatles represent and still do to this day! I'm sorry for all the Beatles' fans out there that loved this movie, but it really just made me feel ashamed and embarrassed. This movie was made already with a better message and a better crew a few years back, and without disgracing itself with the Beatles as propoganda (\\"Forest Gump\\" ring a bell anyone?) This movie is a mockery of everything good in the Beatles, the generation, and good taste in film-making!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"A complete mess. Horrid singing, terrible acting and just a boring drag on forever snorefest. Avoid at all costs. Did I mention the horrid singing......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie ever . . .","review":"One would think that the creation of a movie based on the music of the Beatles would be a good idea. And, in fact, it was . . . see A Hard Day's Night or even Yellow Submarine. Although some of the music was well-done in ATU, the plot was very loosely pieced together. Add somewhat psychadelic cinematography to the mediocre acting and dialogue and chunk hurling will ensue!If only it carried on the tale of those curse-wielding cowboys of the cosmos Memsahib Duran so accurately portrayed in her critically acclaimed The Duke of Shadows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"By By Birdie meets Forrest Gump","review":"My brother told me that I had to see this movie because I am a Beatles fan and that this movie was full of Beatle songs. Based soley on that I bought the DVD. My mistake....I should have read the cover closer. The songs are sung by American Idol wanna-be type actors. I just about turned it off when this Asian cheerleader is singing \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\"...awful, just awful. But the story got a little better. But this is more than anything else, a \\"musical\\" and quite frankly, the musical performances are not very good. I made a mistake buying this. Should have rented the movie from iTunes for $3 in lieu of spending $20. Good idea on paper ...maybe, but having anyone else but the Beatles do Beatle songs is always gonna fall short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I've loved this film since the first time I saw it, and how cool to have it on DVD with some extras!Actually it makes me want to check out the 3-disc set just to see what OTHER extras there are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good movie","review":"great movie. not for the whole family but older teens are ok, and if they are too young they wont get it anyway. The music is wonderful. Great director and producer. Very creative interpretations of the beatles songs. Fun to watch. Brings back memories of the sixties and seventies. Makes people talk. Makes you look at the events of today differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voyage in time via THE iconic of genre","review":"A great recap of the era sure to tug at memories and heart strings for those that grew up in the era and sure to entertain and explain to those too young. The use of all those rich Beatle-isms and songs to tell a story and dipict an era is too rich to miss. A definite thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Across the Universe","review":"Besides the fact that I am madly in love with Jim Sturgess, this movie is utterly fantastic! With great visual effects and AMAZING songs, Across the Universe brings a story that has never been told to life. This is the movie that people have been waiting for their whole lives and never thought it would come. Well it came. And it is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Across Crosses Generations:","review":"As a teenager growing up in the sixties and with the music of The Beatles, this movie magically transported me back to that turbulent yet revolutionary decade.The story creatively weaves the lyrics of the \\"classic\\" Beatles songs with the fictional story, as if it had always been meant to be!. This touching motion picture is best enjoyed if you like movie musicals and even better, if you like the music of The Beatles. The colorful sets and cinematography are complemented by the powerful music performed beautifully by the young cast which turned out very believable performances.This is a film to be watched over again like listening to your favorite music album or music video. Whether you are 16 or 60, this music and story transcends all decades. If you can, watch in on a BIG screen and in HIGH definition and 6 channel sound for a sublime experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it once and you'll watch it again and again and again","review":"I have never been so captivated by a movie before. I have favorites but not like this one. I cannot get enough of this movie. I watch it over and over and over again. I talk about it to anyone who will listen. The imagination of the director, Julie Taymor, combined with the phenominal singing by the actors leaves you in awe. It's a love story inspired by 33 Beatle songs set against the backdrop of the 1960s amid the turbulent years of anti-war protest, mind exploration and rock 'n roll, the film moves from the dockyards of Liverpool to the creative psychedelia of Greenwich Village, from the riot-torn streets of Detroit to the killing fields of Vietnam. It is a must see. Caution...you will be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"for anyone who loves beatles songs and a good love storyu have got to watch this!just brilliant other than a few scenes which are pretty strange and out of synch with the rest of the story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Music, Love The Movie","review":"I enjoy listening to the music of the Beatles and welcome remakes of their music.

Good music, fabulous in Blu-Ray!","review":"\\"Across the Universe\\" presents Beatles' songs in quite a different way. The rendentions grow on you the more you listen. The actors are of fresh and new talent and sang live througout most of the movie. The storyline was made to go along with the songs and was very familiar. The colors are absolutely astounding in blu-ray. There are a lot of special, but weird and vivid, effects which seem to take you on psychedelic journeys. I feel these may have been a bit overdone. The extra features include a lot of material and are very interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially the music. Great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss It!!","review":"This movie has had a HUGE impact on me, it is definitely in my top two movies(along with Moulin Rouge!). Across the Universe has made a Beatles fan out of me, and everyone I've showed it to. The music is great, the cast is awesome and even though this movie is set 25 years before I was born I loved it and it has changed the way I think about a lot of things(Yes, I am totally obsessed). So go rent it, you wont't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JULIE TAYMOR, OPUS 3","review":"***** 2007. Written and directed by Julie Taymor. An Academy award and a Golden Globe nomination. The 60's seen through the songs of the Beatles. A unique vision developed by one of the most interesting directors of our time. I was already enthused a few years ago byFridaand the way Julie Taymor managed to give life to some of Frida Kahlo's paintings, now I can't but praise this film. The screenplay is uttermost smart, the actors perfect and Julie Taymor a director one has to count with. Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Across the Universe...and Into the Heart","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this film...I had already ordered and listened to the soundtrack previously because my wife and I love the Beatles' music. Additionally, I had seen Hair and Rent in the past and had those 2 films to compare it to. My expectations were, thus, pretty high.Apart from the \\"magical mystery tour\\" with Bono in the middle of the film, I found it moving, fast-paced, interesting....despite the 2-hour-plus length. I liked it much more than \\"Rent\\"; the Beatles' songs were appropriately placed; the visual art was enthralling and unique and had a poetic depth, i.e., it had many levels of meaning beyond the purely breath-taking visual effects.I was not at all disappointed. I highly recommend this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"This movie speaks to the soul and sings in the heart. The lovingly remembered songs of the Beatles are given to interesting characters to live through. As they do, you live through their lives too. Open you mind and you will enjoy this movie through the progression of song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it be more","review":"The movie starts has great pace with the early Beatle lyrics blended beautifully into the screen dialog. About half way into the movie the songs get too somber and the pace gets too morbid. Julie Taynor's puppet effects that were used in the Lion King slows the movie and it attempts to be too trippy and we get dragged through these boring drug sequences that were too long and gimmicky. The Beatle music was sung at a pace that added new style and meaning. I loved the Beatles and thank Julie Traynor for even a vain attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Fun Film","review":"I've been a Beatles fan since I was a kid and was even lucky to be front row at Live 8 when Paul McCartney performed. This movie did the band justice and was a work of art. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-alteringly good!","review":"This movie is one of the most creative musicals I've ever seen. Julie Taymor has produced, what will surely become one of this decades most celebrated and cherished musical love stories. Across the Universe is a somewhat subversive and yet heart touching story wrapped up in a package of timeless Bealtes classics, all sung by the cast on screen. All of the actors are phenomenal singers, and each cast member weaves their way through the story perfectly. A MUST SEE and MUST BUY for beatles lovers and art lovers alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best!!!","review":"Across the universe is one of the best musical pictures I've seen in my life.

It is a musical and that is what makes it exceptionally great. It is a heartwarming film that will make you laugh, cry and even blush. There are some cameos as well (e.g. Bono). The setting takes place during the 60s and the Vietnam War -- the movie makes you feel like you are living it with them and each of the love stories touch you every time you watch it.

There are many drug induced sequences that take you through the characters journey and how they eventually \\"come together\\".

The dialogue is abysmal, the plot non-existent, the \\"hallucinatory\\" special effects sequences laughable, and the Beatles songs are crudely shoehorned in whether they fit or not, complete with some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a film. I've liked Julie Taymor's other films, but she scraped the bottom of the barrel on this one. As far as recreating a vision of the late 60s, this film makes HAIR look like CITIZEN KANE in comparison.

This movie does have some tripped out scenes that are cool and memorable parts. Unfortunately the music begins slow down and the film becomes incredibly boaring at the end, minus the last two songs at the end. It gets back to its lively self once max returns from the war but from his departure up untill then, its dull dull DULL!!! I to thought I was judging this film to harshly so I watched it all the way through. Nope, dull and to make it go faster I skipped to the ending as I should of done from the very begining. Other then it slowing down as a herd of turtles stampeedeing through peanut butter, the pros to this film is great effects and *some* memorable songs. All this is killed by the slow ending. I was somewhat disappointed but all I have to do is skip half the ending to the final few scenes to avoid the tedious parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beatle fans...","review":"I'm a Huge Beatles Fan and this movie did not made justice for the kind of music they used. The story was so plain, the singing was very teenage girl-like and the videos were so forced into the songs that they did not even made any sense. I believe making a movie with this theme was essential for our times, but this one does not keep up with the weight of working with something that is so important to so many people as Beatles music. If you are a Beatles fan, see it and see for how long you can watch without getting angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: DVD won't play in all players!","review":"My friend bought the deluxe 2-Disc edition and neither disc will play in his older DVD player!

Since Columbia is owned by Sony, who are famous for messing with established formats in an attempt to prevent casual copying (but which does nothing to stop real piracy since \\"rip\\" copies were available weeks ago), it's not surprising that they'd release a DVD that can't be played on all players.Make sure to keep your receipt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, so very very sorry!","review":"I'm sorry, I wanted DESPERATELY to like this movie as I LOVE the old Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals.

They do a great job of tying in the story line with the songs, or tying in the songs with the story line; regardless, the writers/producers/singers are spot on with this movie!

I contacted Nite Ize, how promply issued an RMA and replaced the light under warranty. Shortly after receiving the replacement flashlight, it failed with the exact same problem as the first flashlight. I won't go with this light again, I am not very hard on flashlights, and this one failed during infrequent use around my home, I never even took it outside or camping or anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best AA LED Light","review":"This is a terrific everyday carry flashlight. The Inova Bolt is sturdy, easy to grip, fits in any normal pants pocket, and the light is a steady 120 lumens. I've had this light for about a year now, and it's been a joy to own. Obviously, it's a bit more expensive than a similarly sized Mag-Lite, but I'd say the quality of body construction and candlepower output easily trumps the more familiar brand.I rate this as a four-star only because the flashlight is not waterproof (the button is obviously not sealed) and the mechanism for keeping the light on hands-free is a bit inconvenient. The button at the base will only keep the light on with constant pressure. Hands-free mode is accomplished by twisting the base which is tough to do one-handed.Besides those two drawbacks, I'd recommend the Bolt to anyone looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the $60 LED beasts on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so tough","review":"All the claims of toughness by the manufacturer aside, this is not a very robust product. The Bolt 2a slipped out of my pocket while I was sitting on a deck chair and dropped 12 inches onto the concrete. We aren't talking a very big fall. I figured, oh well, it will have a small scratch or ding but should still be ok. Well, it didn't have any marks, but it also didn't turn on any more either. If I shook it very vigorously, I'd get it to briefly flash on for an instant, but for the most part it was dead. Inova very cagily describes the flashlight as having a \\"limited lifetime warranty\\", but nowhere defines what this is. Come to think of it, I'm not sure I'll spend any money to fix it. What is the utility of an emergency flashlight I can't trust to not break in a small fall like this? I'm getting a Fenix to replace it with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This flashlight stopped working after a month! I bought another model, the X1, that didn't work from the beginning. I switched to Fenix and I am very happy with that brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to brag about","review":"Inova BLT-2A Bolt 3.8 Watt LED FlashlightThe only good thing I can say about this flashlight is, it seems to be well built. Aside from that it doesn't even start to be as bright as any of my other 3 Watt flashlights. It seems like a candle compared to any of my other 3 Watt lights. Far too much money for what you get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light akward on and off switch","review":"It's well built (very solid) and the LED light is great. The minor negative for me is the rear cap on/off switch. This arrangement seems awkward vs. the traditional arrangement. Someone else mentioned these were made in the USA; however this is not the case anymore. These are presently made in China. The best feature despite the strong led light is the fact it is not round. This really is great if you are working on an uneven surface and don't want your light rolling out of sight.Overall the positive far outweighs any negative observation. This small flash light really puts bigger ones to shame. It's great for the car, boat or if you just want something not taking too much space at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"Light, powerful light, great for urban exploration and light painting with my Nikon D7000.

Along the way, it tries, through massively simplifying the kind of vicious social system of a high school, to make a heavy point about cliques being bad. As always with SVH, subtlety in delivering the moral isn't its best point. Despite this, the gradually developing on-line romance between football star Ken and arty intellectual Olivia is nicely handled, and the characters are likable and amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interactive Romance?","review":"Like you can see, all the reviews under this are very positive for this book. That's the reason I bought this. I must say that this was great book. Awesome! But this missed something. Something very important. Like action and excitement?

I'll rate this with 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Readers expecting a lively,left of center interpretation of a prosperity decade in the manner of J.K. Galbraith's The Great Crash had better look elsewhere. Economist Joseph Stiglitz is a Clinton era \\"New Democrat\\", and the Roaring Nineties is appalling evidence of it. The book is more a history of Clinton's perfidious economic policies which Stiglitz admits were wrong, Republican even, policies which created greater eonomic inequality here and abroad and which allowed the predatory CEOs of major companies to plunder unsuspecting investors, individual and institutional. Stiglitz says that the policies were shaped by fear of Robert Rubin at the Treasury Department, Alan Greenspans's Federal Reserve, conservatives in Congress, and, revealingly, heavyweight campaign contributors. The book is a weasel's mea culpa. It's too little and too late. I'm embarrassed that I spent $29.95 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed and self-aggrandizing","review":"Although Stieglitz has been lauded and showered in accolades, this book is nothing more than a re-statement of his mainstream left-wing economics.

Instead, I got a carefully constructed rewrite of history from the 1980's to the present.This book's primary motivation is to blame all of the world's current economic problems on political conservatives. It is wrought with inconsistencies and ommisions, in classic Clinton Adminstration fashion.Do not be fooled into thinking the author's has an objective viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Clinton Spin","review":"Another book of many written by those in the Clinton administration to spin their failed legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"The reason I would not recommend purchasing this item (Hunter 30730 Tower Air Purifier) is that the price of the filter seem way too high priced for what the replacement hepa filters cost. At almost $30-40 a pop, depending on where you buy them, plus the carbon filter that has to be replaced as well, you can almost buy a brand new purifier. At some warehouse stores, you can buy TWO brand new purifiers for about $125.The Purifier works fine and seems to do the job it says it will do but until they lower the price of the hepa filters, I'll continue to regret ever buying two of the purifiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low cost effective filter.","review":"This does it all with a very active Hepa system as well as a great Ion generator. Really does the job and love it's whisper sound which helps me to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I have had this air filter for at least 4 years now. It works really well to keep the air fresh. I can definitely tell the difference if it is not on, the air smells a bit stale without the purifier. I keep it running pretty much non stop and it is still working really well. The one downfall to this machine is it's not really quiet flow. However in it's quiet- est mode it's definitely quieter than most other air purifiers I've found."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Quiet\\"flow it is not!","review":"To be effective, this unit must be on the highest speed.

The requirements were that the games had to be something we didn't have and it had to have multiplayer.The most expensive game of our gaming day was a huge let down. It was amusing for about 15 minutes, then we realized it's just the same awful graphics over and over. Some of the weapons were fun to try, but mostly it was just really repetitive grinding in an ugly game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glitch tastic","review":"The good things about this game: tons of enemies, tons of unlock able guns. The bad there are a ton of glitches in this game. Most of the unlock able weapons are just the same weapon with tweaked stats. The graphics are terrible your ai teammates are useless. Over all should be cheaper. Only purchase if you're looking for a mindless shooter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get how people could find this fun","review":"I thought this game to be very behind in todays market. the gameplay was not interesting or fun, the story was awful, and the monsters childish. i must have played this game for a half hour before turning it off and posting it on ebay. i found Jet-Force Gemini to have more redeming qualities. i wouldnt pay more than 5$ for this title.Jet Force Gemini"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun!","review":"This is an old-school shoot-em-up remade into a last-gen quality 3rd person shooter. Doesn't sound exciting, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Lots of weapons, destructible environments, giant bugs, robots, vehicles, funny radio chatter... This game isn't trying to be great, it's trying to be fun and it succeeds admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game not fancy","review":"This is a fun game. Not super pretty but fun. I was in the midst of Rainbow Six:Vegas when I received EDF 2017. I popped it in the drive to give it a look see and I was hooked. Vegas took a back seat until I forced myself to get back in the game before I forgot the button setup.If you liked the Serious Sam series, especially the first two, you'll probably like this. It's a third person view but you barely have time to notice. Fun to play with a buddy too. You can replay a level at a higher difficulty level and possibly earn better weapons. Regarding the weapons, you're only allowed to carry two at a time but there is a boatload to choose from so choose carefully. Many times I have replayed a level with a different load out just to experiment.In a nutshell: Lots of fun, swarms of monsters, all big, some huge. Good weapons. Fun to play with a buddy in co-op mode. Easy to play a casual game. Not up to the 1st tier games with their refined graphics but just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Co-Op","review":"Local cooperative is the only way to play this game.

After returning it for another one, we found the same thing. I contacted the manufacture, and realized that we were trying to pluck the strings. Plucking doesn't work.

At times my younger son (9) would say, 'Now it's starting to get interesting' only to have it continue down the same boring trail.

Annie Fischer presents some interesting views of Beethoven's sonatas but, sometimes, these views seem to be far away from the composer's style. The piano timbre is too harsh and, in some tracks, the Bösendorfer is out of tune! The sound quality is poor, the number of editing points is impressive and you can easily hear that classical analog editing noise; If the original session tapes were available, I think Hungaroton could release a digital editing master version; although this technology can provide some outstanding results, maybe it wouldn't solve the problems concerning tempo and balance.

The first season introduces us to Stars Hollow, Chilton, and Hartford.

The grandmother got plain annoying, the grandfather always looked clueless, the supporting cast were given stories that were not the least bit interesting, and the season finales always looked like poor takes off of Dallas and Dynstay.

This is the 1st season so if you want to start watching it you should watch this first. I watch Gilmore Girls on CW every Tuesday at 8:00. It is about a 32 year-old mom, Lorlie and her 16 year old daughter Rory. As you noticed Lorlie had Rory when she was 16. A lot of this story is about them taking life as it comes and handeling twists. This mother-daughter relationship is great even though they sometimes have fights they consider themselves best friends. This is a very realalistic show and it is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lorelai The Queen of Television","review":"I love this show. The first season is so sweet, funny and original.

I think the show rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show Ever!","review":"If you haven't already seen Gilmore Girls, I'd suggest you run out and buy this box set.

I'm very sad that the show ended, but now I have all 7 of the seasons to watch any time I want to keep Stars Hollow alive.

Now I know what the Friday night dinners are all about. The blind date was hilarious. There's Gran, wow what a character. Then Dean, yep the Dean, he is such a wonderful boyfriend to Rory (he is every mother's dream boyfriend for their daughter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"gilmore girls first season","review":"This show is amazing!!

I just ordered another volume.

If however, you share my tastes -- everything from early Baroque to late Beethoven and not too much thereafter, you'll probably despise this.To see why, consider for example, track 2 of disc 1, entitled \\"Réminiscences de Don Juan\\" -- almost 20 minutes of music based on Mozart's Don Giovanni. I love Don Giovanni and know it very well. I would say about 4 or 5 minutes are completely recognizable Mozart, about 10 minutes are butchered Mozart and the rest are pure Liszt extravagences. You will be very impressed with Howard's playing, but if your looking for recognizable transcriptions of both well-known and obscure operatic works, you will be disappointed. This track is more Liszt than Mozart. And one can make similar comments about the other tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The basic point seemed to be that if you pay attention and listen to your child all will go smoothly.

An extraordinarily foolish and clunky collection of (mis)readings which calls to mind D.W. Harding's famous observation about the novels of Jane Austen: works which appeal to precisely the sort of people whom the author most despises.

The idea of a space ship that automatically creates its own energy source (and crew) is a brilliantly original SF concept. King has also written a few other good SF stories (like \\"The Jaunt\\" in the \\"Skeleton Crew\\" anthology). Unfortunately this story does drag on much longer than necessary. Not his best work, but even King's mediocre stuff out does the best of the competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"**SIGH**","review":"Once in a while, Stephen King writes something that makes me swear off Stephen King for awhile. This was the first time I had read something by Stephen King that I didn't like. The vast majority of Stephen King books are great or at least good. In this one, King creates likeable characters - then kills them off. The protagonists left over are completely unlikeable. There is also an improbable, unhinted-at plot twist: the aliens lack common sense. It felt like King wrote the story into a corner, then had to throw in a way to beat the omnipotent baddies.I am not saying that this book is bad or not worth reading - nothing Stephen King writes meets that description. I would start with something else and put this at the bottom of the pile, under The Stand, It, Salem's Lot, The Dead Zone . . . and just about everything else King wrote except Cell (which has the same plot problems, albeit with likeable protagonists)."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's wrong with you people?","review":"People who are panning this book, I must ask you, what is your problem? The main critique seems to be that the book has no direction. I assume that is because it shifts the focus from the main characters for a huge chunk in the middle, to focus on what's going on in town (the fictional villiage of Haven, ME). But I contend that this is where the book really takes off. I found this novel to be very satisfying, and so far I've read it twice. It's a unique science fiction story, with extremely interesting characters, plot twists, imaginitive situations, genuinely creepy scenes, and not a small amount of humor. I also thought the ending was pretty cool. I really don't understand the negative reviews. What were you people looking for? This one has it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"His absolute worst!!!!","review":"King's worst book ever--and I am a huge fan. THis one is long, slow, unbelievable (and unbelievably boring).

Read something else: QUICK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"They dug, they dug, and they dug some more. Get the picture? Oh yeah, then they dug some more. King does it again!

Sure, it's exciting in the starting with the digging up of the spaceship and the end also, but in between King just goes on about little side stories about things happening to the people of the town, which were mostly boring and time-consuming. If you want to read this book, read a shortened edition without all the useless information in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book RULES.","review":"I have read this book many times and it gets better and better each time.

Really picks up speed near the end. It's very similar to Needful Things because so many malicious things are happening at once, hinged around the huge UFO. Wouldn't we all want to find a one in our backyard? That aside, the nuances of a less than perfect community were hysterical. Stephen King's books are considered horror, but life itself is horror enough at times. someone goes into a business (or a high school) with a firearm and starts taking out people. The nightly news, and local news--now that's real horror. At least Stephen King intertwines a sense of humor to lessen the fictonal horror. Even so, as the book progresses, the horror factor escalates too. (shades of Alien). I really enjoyed the flying Coke machine. That just blew me away.P.S. I needed a root canal after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a stephen king fan...I liked the whole idea of the story, girl trips over an alien craft hidden in the ground and can't help herself from digging it up...if you like stories about aliens and mystery, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes... this is different from his other stuff...","review":"But I think we would all get a little tired of reading various iterations of 'Salem's Lot, or The Stand every time Mr. King wrote a book. The Tommyknockers is solid writing, a bit disorganized and rambling, yes, but solid. I also found the book the be full of the same elements that made Mr. King famous--the horror is here, but in a different context. All in all, its a great read--and an interesting look into King's work as a whole. I think, by now, we have all realized that each of his work is just a piece in the grand scheme of things, and The Tommyknockers provides a few pieces to that puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"\\"The Tommyknockers\\" starts as many of King books do. Something unusual happens to a Maine resident, a blue-jeans everyman. Then, an apocalypse of events follows and we get what we like so much in his fiction: ordinary individuals facing problems which are usually too difficult for them to overcome. Snip: (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LONG, TOO TEDIOUS","review":"The book starts out promisingly enough with a female novelist unearthing a spaceship buried on her land. But then Mr King dissolves into hectares of verbiage that don't advance the story one iota. You could take out whole chapters and no one would notice, because the plot doesn't advance an inch in that time. Add to that Mr King's customary infatuation with scatology and what you have is an utterly tedious piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's unfair...","review":"...but this book made me give up King for life. I just didn't wanna invest so much of my time into a bad book ever again.It would have been nice if the editor had caught the fact that King lost track of whether the aliens control people with radio waves or a gas. As it is, either a metal plate in your head or a gas mask will protect you. Maybe it's radio gas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know how anyone could be \\"creeped out\\" by this mess...","review":"I have been reading Stephen King novels consistently for several years. Normally I am able to put up with disappointing endings that seem to be common in his works but this story was disappointing from page 1. I was attracted by the alien theme of the story because I was terrified by the movie \\"Fire in the Sky.\\" Several times while reading Tommyknockers I laughed out loud because the plot got to be so ridiculous/corny. It would have made a better short story rather than a 700+ page novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is boring....","review":"this is my first stephen king book and its a disappointment, the book length is too long and could be shortened by half, it's one of the few books that i cant seemed to finish(which is rare), its a very slow-paced story and utterly boring although the concept of the story is fresh and rather good and since i read this i have not read any other stephen king book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite!","review":"Stephen King is usually more brilliant than this. The movie was a complete disaster. However, since books always seem to be better than the movies, I thought I'd give this one a try. Trust me...stick with the movie. It sucked, but not nearly as much as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for people of a certain age.","review":"I am about the same age as Stephen King and have read his works throughout my adult life. I think most readers are too young to appreciate this book.Stephen King's early works, assembelled in chronological order, are all symbolic stories of stages in his own life. \\"Carrie\\" is about high school, \\"Salem's Lot\\" about love and loss in early adulthood, \\"The Shining\\" about the anxieties of fatherhood. \\"It\\" is about the reworking of childhood issues in mid-life. All great fiction talks to us on a subconcious level.\\"Tommy Knockers\\" is about aging and death. Time possesses and mutates all of us, makes our teeth and hair fall out, truncates our dreams, makes us unrecognizable from our youthful selves. This is a sad book, and unlike King's earlier works the protagonists have no power to fight such an enemy. Affirming the value of love, however futile, in the face of death is the point of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read - but a few chinks in its armor","review":"This was my first Stephen King book and, overall, I really liked it. The plot was very interesting even given that, from an initial standpoint, it is sort of hackneyed. But I have always been a sucker for the \\"insidious invasion\\" type scenarios. What really made me like it was the characterization that was done, particularly for good ol' Gardner. When you realize that the protagonists of the novel are filled with more shortcomings, in some ways, than the antagonists, you have a good love-hate thing going with the characters.The \\"chinks in the armor\\" of this good story, however, start to show up for me near the end of the book where what is basically meant to be scary (or at least threatening in a sci-fi sort of way) almost turns into a bad B-movie set of props. However, by that time I was so hooked into the story that I pretty much took it all in stride. Overall, a very entertaining book with great characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another Stephen King novel... or is it?","review":"The Tommyknockers is not your typical horror novel. Stephen King goes above and beyond our expectations, bringing us mystery, suspense, and an incredible twist at the end that leaves us begging for more. You'll never look at small towns the same after visiting the seemingly innocent community of Haven, Maine, where the story takes place. The superhuman powers and horror that follows after Bobbi Andersons shocking discovery on her property will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire novel. Though the length of the book may seem intimidating at first, do not be deterred; it's an easy read, a constant page turner, and worth every minute! Much like the outsiders around the town of Haven, once you get in to explore the Tommyknockers, there will be no turning back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every editor has an off day....","review":"Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and his Dark Tower series is some of the most amazing fiction I've ever read. But this book should have been about 200 pages shorter, and the concept needed a lot of work. I'm actually glad I read it, because now I'm sure that I don't just blindly like his work - this one I definitely didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Where has my King gone?","review":"I am such a huge fan of SK that it even bothers me to write this review. If I could give it 0 stars I would. How sad that SK had to write something so incredibly bad. I have been reading his books since High School, and I'm 34 now, I actually read this book when it was first published and I have shunned it ever since. If you are thinking of reading SK for the first time go to The Stand, IT or if you want something a little less in length go with Firestarter. Just stay away from this meaningless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"I know I will probably take some shots for this, but as a huge Stephen King fan I found this book to be the worst he ever wrote and the only one I didn't finish. The story was so unbelievable I questioned whether King really wrote it. If you read this then you read a classic like \\"The Green Mile\\" I think you will agree that this book is not up to the usual King standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst One King Ever Wrote","review":"Sorry Stephen but this is the worst book i ever read by King. I couldn't even finish it. I read several chapters and put it down never to pick it up again. I was very disappointed and bored. I am a big fan of King too. He is one of the only fiction writers i ever read. And i am glad the rest of his books are not like this one. Don't bother with this one. He has way too many that are incredibly good ,to waste reading time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tommyknockers-Stephen King","review":"While its not one of my favorites, The Tommyknockers is worthy reading. Nicknamed \\"The gadget novel\\", this book is rather long and not near as compelling as other lengthy King novels The Stand and IT. Still its an overall good book, with the usual interesting characters and their own share of problems prior to the crashed spaceship. The power given to the characters and their everyday appliances is totally original and makes it the one high tech King thrill ride. If youre looking for evil space creatures, dont go looking in Dreamcatcher, in my opinion King's failed attempt at ET's. Theyre all here and a note to King: one alien book is enough. This book is pretty much the epitamy of all things futuristic and dark in the area of aliens and theres no need to write a new one. Although not essential, its an excellent read for hardcore and casual fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tommyknockers RULE!","review":"This book has got to be on of the best books he has writen. Truley scary and horrorfying! The ryme \\"Late last night and the night befor, Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers, Knocking at my door. I want to go out, Dont no if i can, Because im so afraid of the tommyknocker man,\\" Made the book more interesting. The tommyknockers are the most scaries things that can ever be created, Whil the ship its self is alive, and sending out waved to people , makeing them become a tomyknocker. This book was great and i am thinking about reading it again. I think any one will love this book!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Bangor blood-master","review":"I read this book in the seventh grade...my first of Stephen's (a close neighbor of mine at the time). Since then I must have read a hundred of his other works, but this one is the best: fantasy, sci-fi, horror and genius imagination not woven, rather melted together. Yeah, it's long, yeah, they dig for a long time, but the drudgingness of the couple's labor just adds to the physical experience of the reading. It actually makes you exhausted (to be even more virtually worn out read \\"the long walk\\"). It's best read on a HOT summer day with nothing on your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attack of the Coke Machines","review":"This novel is so abstract it is amazing. I read it down at the beach a few summers ago, and have read it twice since then. King, as usual, creates a town and then abruptly destroys it, though before destroying it he develops a relationship between you and the town. A relationship between you and the characters. It has the struggling alcoholic poet, the struggling isolated author, and a mysterious \\"gem\\" that lurks in the forest. For some it may be too \\"Stephen Kingish\\" such as Pet Semetary (remember the baby?), but to anybody out there who enjoys an otherworldly horror/science fiction story, this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many books...wasted too many hours on this one","review":"If you're looking for a book to hook you in, keep you turning the pages, emotionally connecting to the characters, read \\"Harry Potter\\". A friend suggested I start reading King with this book. Oy...what the hell was he on? It wasn't awful, just so disappointing. I appreciated the writing, but I wasn't enjoying this book on any level. It's in bad need of editing, but that's too late. Should have been half the length. Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I thought perhaps all of the praise Stephen King receives would be for a reason. I guess not.

Further digging reveals what is at first believed to be an unexploded German bomb from World War II, but it is an alien space craft. Within it are dead locust-like aliens are found. The opening of the alien space craft, triggers alien mind-control of the local population.Plot sound familiar?

Compared to other alien books, written by writers who specialize in it, it's prety standard.But the aliens aren't the focus of the book - the relationships between the people, with the spaceship as an accelerator of issues that already exist under the surface. This is S. King's specialty, and he does it very well in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock knock on the door Tommy....Not","review":"I read this book long ago and i didn't like it too much mainly cuz it was boring for the first 150 pages or so.

The Tommyknockers, as said in many past reviews, is basically about a town molded into a colony of alien like beings. As good as the premise might seem, I feel that the book is an overall poor conception, mainly due to the \\"cast\\" of characters is really nothing but mindless annoyances that no reader would even want to become acquainted with. In any novel, one should be able to feel for the characters in the book and should naturally not feel hatred toward them. This, unfortunately, is something too common in most of King's works. I, for one, did not enjoy this novel, and it will probably be the last of King's I will ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T SEE THE MOVIE OR READ THE BOOK.","review":"This a very original book, but it just plain sucks.

This book had me glued to the couch.","review":"Even though the story is really far fetched, this book is by far one of Mister King's best novels ever! I mean, finding a space ship in your back yard isn't a very common occurance so I was shocked to discover how entertained I was by this book. I couldn't put it down! Another masterpiece by Mister King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Out -- Way Far Out","review":"The farther that Stephen King's books stray from plausible reality, the weaker they often are. In addition to being WAY too long, \\"The Tommyknockers\\" suffers from a second half that stretches believability to the breaking point. The setup is effective, of course at this point the reader has no idea what is causing the increasingly horrific events in the town. The answer, as it unfolds, is a bit of a disappointment. Also, few of the many characters engender any sympathy. This is not one of King's better novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long and detailed","review":"While this book started out good, it became really long and drawn out and I lost interest fast. I don't like to stop reading a book once I start, so I went ahead and finished it. I felt as though King got very caught up in the details, making this huge novel, then got bored with the writing and just ended it. Beginning and middle were VERY long compared to the climax and the end. I find myself feeling this with a lot of his books, but this one definitely takes the cake. Had this book been a couple hundred pages shorter, it would have been great... but the content wasn't enough to outweigh the HUGE amount of drawn out detail that, to me, was completely unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you love to read you'll love this book","review":"this book was long yet very interesting and very well written. But if you don't like to read 750 page books i don't recomend this one. only for the people who love to read will this be a joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More on \\"They\\"","review":"Great Book, but gets a bit slow in the middle, as some of Kings books do when he gets into too much character development. The ending was a bit, how do I say it?, uneventful!!! unfinished!!! anticlamatic!!!. I guess they all aply. I prefer The Stand, or the Green Mile. Of course my favorites are the Dark Tower series. Overall, a very good King book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage King, extremely well written!!","review":"My first and favourite King book, leaving me addicted and thirsty for more. An incredible plot and ingenious original concept. Although slightly slow to start off with, after 50 pages it sets alight.

I recommend this book to anyone in need of a scare that will leave you mentally unstable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It starts kind of slow, but when it picks up (around pg. 20) you can really get hooked on it.

It's very portable; can run off of batteries plus its very small in size. Perfect for small or medium size room where you don't need to blast music. Very happy with it so far with no complaints.

However you need to realize that it's a very small unit and it can only do so much with speakers that are only about one inch in diameter. It looks very nice and it comes with a nice carry case for storage and travel. The unit works really well with the Ipod Touch and also with the Ipod Nano 3rd Generation. It will charge either unit with no problems. Its remote is nice and is fully functional unlike some others. I would recommend this Docking station to anyone who is looking for a stylish and compact unit that has very good sound quality.SpecificationsDrivers: Two Odyssey Neodymium driversPower Output: 2 x 2 WattsFrequency Response: 70Hz - 20 KhzInput Impedance: > 10K ohmsSignal-to-Noise Ration: > 85dBVoltage Input: 100 - 230 Vac, 50 - 60 HzDimensions: Diameter 6\\" (150 mm) x Height 1 \\" (38mm)Remote Dimensions: 2-7/8\\" x 2-1/4\\" x 5/8\\" (73mm x 57mm x 15.8mm)Weight: 1lb (.5kg)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!","review":"When I first recieved the speakers, I was a bit dissapointed in the dinky sound it projected.

I pre-measured the height of the speaker and it fit, as expected. In fact, there was a 1.5\\" gap above the speaker. Makes me want to trim the stand, to lower the TV a bit. Still, we find the viewing angle comfortable, and we get a nice clear sound of the center-channel. We used to have the center speaker directly above our old Sony, resting on top. As a result, the dispersion of the sound was not optimum....now, it is and we notice the difference. The black finish is nice, and the build is VERY solid. We use the extra space under the TV to put the 3D glasses and the Apple TV units. It's like an additional shelf in our entertainment center. Great product.

When they arrived, my wariness increased. While the leather was high quality, and felt like the $200 pair I outgrew, the zippers and snaps were not. 50 miles into a 600 mile trip, the zipper on the right leg broke. I don't think it would have been too expensive to use good steel YKK zippers, instead of cheap aluminum.

I had to look back at the pictures to remember who was who 'cause the dialog could be swapped with anyone, and it would still make sense.2.) There really isn't a plot. There's barely any real action. It's really messed up. The evil guy isn't even that bad.and 3.) I didn't get what the whole point of putting the book into four bites was.

The Coleman worked fine for 10 days or so until my wife tried to slide the packed-full cooler to the back of our truck. The weight inside the cooler was too much for the cheap plastic handle and the handle broke right off!Next time, I'll spend more money and buy something that lasts.

It is a must have recording. The only thing I know of that matches the intensity of the playing is Holloway's recording of the Mystery Sonatas of Biber - but that is very much more mystical and religious, here you have a quite different, intense but wordless feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful color great red piping along edges, But:;","review":"The color was just what I was looking for and there was a snappy red piping along the edge.

The voicings are creative without being forced; the structures avoid tired formulas and provide freshness to familiar tunes while maintaining the respect the music deserves. Furthermore, the arrangements fully feature the talent and abilities of this group.But more importantly is the pure sincerity and heart in the music. As you listen to these brothers sing, you can't help but feel their deep respect and love for the subjects at hand.

The problem was that when it arrived the Leather did not match. One one shoe it was pristine and on the other it looked like it had been worn for a month or two. You get what you pay for and I did get a pretty good deal on them, I would have returned them if not for shipping costs, I can still tell that they are not the same ( I had hoped with wear you wouldnt be able to tell) someone that did not know probably could not tell so it all depends on how picky you are I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"These are absolutely the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.

If you follow the Church's teaching, live by it, love it and follow it, prepare to be terribly insulted. You will be called a \\"robotic Catholic\\" and one who is not \\"tolerant\\" of dissenting teaching. It is a Protestant book shrouded by Catholic terminology, but not Catholic understanding. The author misses a perfect opportunity to viably discuss Catholic theology. Instead, we are posed with immoral choices compared to even more immoral choices without true understanding of why or how they are immoral. The author has no concept of a true moral dilemma. Church teaching is presented as only one of many \\"opinions\\" equal, and even inferior to any number of other \\"individuals\\" opinions. Those looking for a moral compass should look for a more definitive teaching. I would suggest the Catechism of the Catholic Church for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a REALLY BAD TOY!","review":"I got this for my daughter for Xmas today.

All you can do with it is put the doll inside. To 'record' your song you use the microphone (that takes 3 oddball watch type batteries) and it only records TEN SECONDS. You can't save your song or anything, it just records over. The sound is not great and is fuzzy. I read the box and did not see anything about the 10 seconds on it. I thought my daughter would be able to record herself singing a whole song and be able to play it back. Nope! She can record 10 secs, listen to a fuzzy playback, and then record over it.

Lo and behold, at around 9 months old, he started doing the signs! We had the same experience with our daughter, who is now 12 months old. We have Volumes 1-3. She really enjoys watching the children signing to fun music that she can also dance to. It's amazing that over the last month, her signing vocabulary has increased significantly.

My son loves them but he is growing bored of the same videos and isn't interested in any other movies or TV shows. We bought 3 (and 4) and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE vol. 3. The songs are super catchy.

By contrast the stories collected in \\"The Life to Come,\\" especially \\"The Other Boat,\\" \\"Arthur Snatchfold\\" and the title piece, reflect the author's own obsession with the negative consequences of exposure and perfectly illustrate his reticence to coming out either personally or professionally.

She was allowed no visitors. Her beloved aunt had become morose and silent. Riding was her only pastime, but Sir Edward Devereux, her handsome, brooding guardian had forbidden it.

I was a little bit disappointed, but not much. I treasure this CD of the first great polyphonic mass in the history of music. It's just that the virtuosic angular ornamentation in the CD was even more angular and virtuosic in the live performance.

Some of his best during that time are included in this album, from \\"Lapiz de Carmin\\" to Tricoche's \\"Lobo Domesticado, and my personal favorite \\"No me Tires la Primera Piedra.\\" This is salsa romantica, don't get me wrong, but it still shows some signs of salsa dura, and Olivencia pays tribute to his past hit in a Medley on the final track, with some of the hits that helped put him on the map.

Jim Lee has been arguably the most important comic artist of the last 20 years, and this TV show demonstrates why: an amazing ability to craft fun, inventive story lines with cool, original characters. Yes, there are resemblences to Jim's early work on the X-Men, but that similarity is largely due to the fact that almost every modern superhero team owes some due to the X-Men.This cartoon is a load of fun as are the comics and I'm so excited that they are releasing it on DVD.

I suppose fiercely pro-war advocates might choose to be offended by some of her views, but Kingsolver is not so much anti-war as pro-humanity. Yes, she does make an argument for peace, because, as a person of faith, she does not believe that hatred can be dispelled by more hatred.She writes beautifully about the role of nature and the ways that we need to re-embrace it. She writes about loving others and finding wonderful blessings in the midst of darkness. This is a book for anyone who feels despair over the increasing violence in the world, for anyone with a pure faith, for anyone who loves nature.If you love this book, also check out books by Annie Dillard and Wendell Berry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra left wing socalist.....................","review":"I wish Barbara would stick to being an author, as I enjoy her novels.

It has taken me 2 months to read this book. It is not only boring, but often times repetetive. Barbara Kingsolver relates everything to September 11th. Granted, this was a tragic day for our country and should always be remembered. But I dont see why Ms. Kingsolver found it necessary to write a whole novel about it. I find even less necessary for this to be required reading. Every once in a while Ms. Kingsolver finds the need to express herself with words that are a little more complicated than need be.

Just write and reflect on the things you know. There are many experts who dedicate their lives to other issues; world politics, economics, the environment, etc. When we want to learn about those issues, those are the books to read.

The various artist disc of famous stars who have starred in the production in the last 10-years did not offer anything exciting or interesting in their rendition other than their famous names. Worse, the documentary was not well presented and the clip from the show was actually just a teaser. It is so sad because Chicago is now the longest running revival in Broadway history and they have decided to put up a forgettable memorabilia that \\"Chicago\\" lovers will not treasure in the years to come.

Warehouse Deals did not do a good job on repackaging these used books."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Home in Mitford","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. The author jumps from location to location without giving any indication of the change. A conversation between two people in a specific location suddenly ends, and the reader finds--sometimes several paragraphs later--that two entirely different people are now conversing in an entirely different location. This is very hard to follow and quite confusing. Also, the use of pronouns such as \\"he\\", \\"she\\", \\"him\\", and \\"her\\" leaves the reader wondering to whom the pronouns refer. e.g., \\"...as he was running on Church Hill Drive, Barnabas came to a sudden halt, which caused him to crash headlong into a ditch....\\" It turns out that the pronouns \\"he\\" and \\"him\\" do not refer to Barnabas. I do not recommend this book to anyone who has had a good English education and expects to read a well-written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Delightful!","review":"This set of books set in Mitford are such a pleasure to read.

His content and organization of the information flows together in way that keeps the reader interested. His ideas are not only logical, but persuasive. He seems passionate about each aspect of his ideas, and he uses the universal language of humor to keep his ideas easy to understand. Comments like, \\"I don't think it should bother us that he[God] is no Hallmark greeting card\\", and introductory titles such as \\"The Jews Are It\\" give a lighter note to the tone of war, persecution and struggle. It is well written, well thought out, and focuses on the positive side of Jewish history. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good general history","review":"Cahill's history of the Jewish people and their overridingcontributions to the world is well written and easy to understand.The book is a good and fast read and interesting. Reads like a novel, but also brings one to deeper contemplation . It allows one to question the way the human race views the world we live in. Quite existential. I liked it very much. The only fault with the book is the way Cahill sets Jewish and other history on a linear plane. History is not so easily \\"boxed up\\", rather it is more flowing, complex and interwoven. I felt this perspective filtered the history that he told - even through it was indeed told well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a dispicable book that should not be in print.","review":"Ever since Bill Moyers show on Genesis there seems to be a group of people who take delight in using their reasoning such as it is to bash Torah and our patriarchs and matriarchs.If anyone really wants to know about Torah and the Jews they will read a book by any orthodox rabbi who has studied Torah, knows the traditions, all the writings, and has had worthwhile teachers. This book does not enlighten or create any responsible thinking. It is exploitation of our sacred texts and leaders. It is monumentally offensive. Do not buy this book. One star is the lowest possible rating in this program. It should be a negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Educational, AND Entertaining","review":"I found this to be a very worthwhile book to purchase and read. I converted to Catholicism a few years ago and feel that this book definitely helps me understand the roots that Christianity grew from. Unlike Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Old Testament which focuses more on the physical placement and names of tribes, lands, and battles, Mr. Cahill explores the psychological development of a people and their view of the universe and their lives. Humorus descriptions (Sodom and the Night of the Living Dead for example)are enjoyable and don't detract from his narrative. At the end, one realizes that the gifts that were given us were indeed immense and affect us every day. I highly recommend this book, no matter what your beliefs are, it can be enjoyed by all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"I won't need all thousand words for this. Quite simply this is a shocker - possibly the worst book I've ever read. I have seldom seen worse writing paired with such an interesting topic. Think I'm being nasty? Read the section on the early sexual-religious rites. Quite unlike old Tom's colleagues who he mentions in the forward as being 'shocked' (it's actually very mild, but very out of place in the book) I was just plan sad that so many trees had to die for this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent, informative, a little over my head","review":"I am a 15 year old sophomore in high school and I read this book as a project for my religion class. I must admit, I thought this book was going to be boring and just a repeat of all the Jewish history I have learned in my 11 years of attending Catholic schools. I was wrong- this book was informative and interesting; I enjoyed it and finished the book in about a week. Cahill does an excellent job of condensing all the Jewish history into a readable and interesting novel; he touched upon the important facts, sticking to the original translations of the names and places. The section concering the Epic of Gilgamesh was confusing but I managed to get through it. I had a dictionary next to me the entire time, he writes for an older and more verbal audience. I didn't feel he was being condescending, as some suggested. I definitely recommend this for anyone interested in Jewish history- it's a nice overview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but incomplete","review":"Cahill does a good job of establishing that people's myths changed from Sumeria to Israel. However, he fails in two major points. First, he does not establish that the change in myths is an actual change in world-view, as opposed to simply a shift in literary styles. Second, and more importantly, he does not even attempt to document any connection between the world-view of the Israelites and that of the Greeks, from which much of Western civilization descends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but Largely Fluff","review":"This book was an entertaining summary of Judaism from Abraham to Babylon, but intellectually it was mostly fluff. I found myself reading on and on through the summaries of the scriptures to get to his new insights and theses, but nothing really substantial developed. A bit disappointing, but I did enjoy the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful introduction into western religion","review":"I disagree with many of the other reviewers of this book in that it should be recognized that this is not an authoritative history of the world. The author tries to make a point of the importance of Judaism in western culture. It's also an excellent introduction to the study of Judaism/Christianity/Islam. It's beautifully written and kept simple. If you are already well-educated about the subject matter, this book is a waste of time for you. Some of the other reviewers seem to have missed the fact that Cahill tries to make it clear that his book is not an all-inclusive or authoritative history and frequently gives references to other academic publications which would give you those qualities.This book is essentially like a 101 class for studying the heirs to Abraham. It was written to be an introduction and it fulfills this goal superbly."},{"rating":"1","title":"HSIRI PRAC!","review":"This is the second worst book I have ever read! The first, being the authors revisionist barf about the featherweight irish! He writes with the dexterity of a blind bull elephant in a China shop.

And even then they were seriously backsliding. Just waiting for a saviour I guess.I would have liked to see at least a brief section on how Jews have continued to influence civilization in the past 2000 years . . . eg. providing some of the leading thinkers of Modern times and playing an important role in defining American (thus world) popular culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I found this book to be so biased as to be virtually a tract of propoganda. As someone who is not Jewish or Christian, although familiar with both faith traditions, I found the boundless admiration expressed by Cahill to be shallow, uncritical and unexpected. I have read three of his other books, and enjoyed their mulit-faceted summaries of the cultures involved; in this one, I think Cahill's theological background took precendence over his academic analysis, resulting in a much weaker book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Jews changed the world","review":"I suppose this book adds some amunition to the notion of \\"choseness,\\" which has antagonized the rest of the religious community. The Jews have changed the way we look and feel about the world, and one has to consider the choseness label.The rules in which we play this game of life are based off the laws developed by the rabbinical sages thousands of years ago.An amazing and insightful book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Historical Book on Religion that Holds Your Attention","review":"As a 10th grader asked to read a historical book on the Jews for a school project, I was not anticipating a fascinating tale of past cultures that would keep my attention for about 300 pages, but it sure was what I got. Thomas Cahill does a wonderful job of bringing the influence of the ancient and modern Jewish culture to life. He keeps the reader interested by using his thoughts and humor to describe the past cultures and practices. He relates them to modern times, but his writing style unfortunately can make the reader forget what the story is really about, the influence of the Jewish culture on society. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lightweight account of biblical Judaism -- Torah Lite","review":"The author tries to give an account of the Jews' contributions to civilization -- surely an ambitious task, walking in the footsteps of such giants as Heinrich Graetz or the modern Robert M. Seltzer. What Cahill ends up producing is a collection of Cliff Notes to the Hebrew Bible. He seems to inject some \\"authenticity\\" to his personal commentary by using the Hebrew names of most of his biblical heros -- although not all. His unfamiliarity with biblical Hebrew leads to some odd etymological speculation -- a delightful diversion for cognescenti, but misleading for everyone else. The reader should beware of any writer who claims to discuss the Hebrew Bible but relies -- like Cahill does -- entirely on a secondary reference work (The Anchor Bible Lexicon) to source his comments. This is a truly annoying book. Two stars are granted strictly for the entertainment value of this otherwise insipid puree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Insights","review":"Cahill gives a dispationate and insightful view of our early history.

The premise of how Abraham changed his ways to believe in the one true and living God was interesting. What I really enjoyed were Cahill's asides to the reader. I felt that the people he described weren't these lofty, holy people but everyday folks like you and me. This may be objectionable to some people.This book may not be for the fundamentalist. I think that it is probably more for people who are looking to find out the Who, the Why and the Wherefore of the ancient world. I will say that in reading this book, I feel ilke I should check out Everett Fox's translation of the first five books of the bible.I enjoyed this book, and will buy it later, in addition to the rest of his series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining & Exaggerating","review":"I have read this 2nd book by Thomas Cahill and like his first book, it's aim is solely to sell books, it cannot in any sense of the word be called scholarly. It's simplicity makes it very entertaining reading, however when he makes bold claims about the contribution (not influence) it is wholeheartedly exaggerated in order to appeal and sell more books.No doubt that his next books on the Greeks & Egyptians etc... will follow the same entertaining and exaggerating style in order to continue to be best sellers.The one star rating given is due to the simple fact that he tries to pass off what is clearly meant to entertain for enlightment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time.","review":"A small number of ideas at start and finish of book, but mostly a rehashing of Scripture.

However, reading Cahill's assertions their influence becomes incredibly large. The Jews invented everything from God and time to erotic love. Very little supporting evidence is given. When I finished the book I book would have made a good article if it had been edited to delete fantasy and assertions.I recently found that article in the chapter on Judaism in Huston Smith's book, \\"World Religions\\".END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This is my first review after buying hundreds of products on Amazon. I'm writing because by the time I finished the book I was angry. Cahill spends 90% of the book rehashing the bible from his own quasi-religious-semi-academic point of view. A lot of his \\"facts\\" are hogwash and just plain wrong. He spends 5% of the book actually discussing its title and another 5% telling the reader they're idiots if they believe the Bible/Torah is a divine work.I don't need Cahill to retell the bible in his own point of view for me. There are plenty of better versions out there. This book could have been a five page essay, and then we would have only wasted 10 minutes of time on a bad essay instead of several hours on an awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well It is a thesis after all....","review":"After having stuggled with the unusual style of the author, I finally managed to follow the thought process and read this book. I felt as if the author had decided on the title and then tried everything to justify it. Unfortunately, regardless of the value or lack thereof, there is not much in this book in to back up the title. But the good news is that it is entertaining (just following the obvious misconceptions on the Egyptian's religion is worth it).

A GREAT read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The history of the Jews is not mythology","review":"After ready Mr. Cahill's book on the Irish, I was very anxious for this book on the history of the Jews. What a dissappointment. Mr. Cahill routinely discounts the narrative history of the Jews presented in the Bible as mythology and he does so without good reason. It's clear that his understanding of Jewish history is limited to the interpretation given by such secular \\"scholars\\" (heavy sarcasm) as Joseph Campbell. In the preface Mr. Campbell says this is the 2nd of a six part series. Hopefully, he will refrain from tackling early Christian history from the mythological approach. So much good stuff missed due to a lack of understanding on the author's part. Dissappointment is the only adjective to describe this work. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for your Bible study.","review":"This is a fantastic book to give you a further insite on portions of the Old Testament in relation to the history of the Jews from Abraham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the point, deliberately","review":"Let&#65533;s face it, Jewish values wouldn't be part of the basis of Western civilization if it weren&#65533;t for the embracing of Christianity, notably by Constantine in the 4th century, i.e., Christianity was the conduit for certain Jewish values reaching Western civilization. Thus, as far as the latter is concerned, the true gift of the Jews was Jesus Christ - that's the point. At the end of the book, Cahill says \\"we must ever contemplate the awful Day of YHWH, the coming destruction of our wealth and security, the razing ......etc.\\" To Christians of course, this is the Day of the LORD - Judgement Day, the second coming. YHWH = Jesus Christ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there..","review":"For much of this book, Cahill seems to have merely paraphrased most of the Hebrew scriptures. If a reader already has a working knowledge of this text, they may find this book boring and not very informative. Since I came to this book with a good understanding of the Hebrew Bible, I was very disappointed. Perhaps a reader who is not familiar with the Hebrew text would find the large middle section informative and interesting. As for me, it was merely annoying, because I keep waiting for new information or a new insight.However, his commentary of the development of the beginning of Western thought was interesting. It was an angle that I did not consider before. We are so used to Western Civilization being around, that we forget that the thought had to develop at some point. To trace that development was interesting... but I just wish that that tracing did not have to include the paraphrase of much of the Hebrew Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee-Whiz!","review":"Much of this book is a rehash of Sumerian legend from Gilgamesh and biblical stories from Genesis and Exodus, without getting into the unique characteristics of the Jews that made them so important to present civilization. Eventually he does get into the subject, but in such a peripheral way that he seems to be straining to try to make his argument. He should have concentrated more on those aspects of Judaism that have truly shaped the west (and he says the undeveloped world also, but that seems to be a real stretch) rather than try to show us that he has read the Old Testament and various versions of Gilgamesh. There is much less to this book than would appear, and his gee-whiz style starts to grate on the reader, at least on this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"For \\"The Gifts of the Jews\\", look elsewhere","review":"How disappointing this book was! Mr. Cahill promised an inside perspective on the history and contributions of these desert nomads, but one soon realizes that the author is really at odds with his subject matter. We will cast aside all presuppositions about early history, he says, and then picks up an old line about humans mutating. No matter how many hours it took to prepare and write this book, what mostly comes across is that the author either never really got to know, or didn't like, the people and their God who he promised to tell us about. As important a theme as \\"promises kept\\" is to the history of God and Abram, I was fooled by the promises made on the bookjacket that the book came nowhere close to fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gifts of the Jews","review":"While the title held great promise, the book failed to deliver anything substantial. Attempting to cover his obvious religious roots, the author leaned heavily into a mixture of New Age, atheism and wholly fabricated scenarios not supported by any substantial historical facts. Playing fast and loose with history, he admits to these fabrications with the plea \\"It could have happened like that!\\"At the end of the book, realizing the author has failed to substantiate exactly which \\"gifts\\" the Jews have given us (not a difficult thing to do for our culture), he baldly asserts God is \\"unprovable&quot.; END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo boring","review":"Another crap pointless movie by charled band.

Like its immediate predecessor (1988's \\"De Aqui Pa'Lla\\"), this album was produced by TH-Rodven in-house producers Julio Cesar Delgado and Frank Torres (both of whom had been associated with the legendary label since the late 1970s) and includes the hits \\"Tan Solo Siempre Tu\\", \\"Amante Amiga\\", \\"Liuvia De Besos\\" and the poignant \\"Temo Decirselo Todo\\". While Oscar's distinctive vocals and formidable improvisational style are in fine form I can't help but feel that the Salsa Romantica style was NOT a genre meant for a world-class Salsa sonero like Mr. D'leon and that most of this CD's eight songs would have been more appropriate for singers like Frankie Ruiz, Paquito Guzman or Cheo Feliciano.

If you don't believe me, just do some quick net searches for \\"Backstreet Boys recouped Pearlman\\" and see what you find.

My logic is this: if all LCDs have a life to them, then why drop loads of money on something that you know will eventually die? Not a cent will be wasted on this TV - if you can stand a few minor inconveniences. For one thing, if you have the backlight set to anything below 100%, the TV makes a buzzing, humming sound (which is mostly drowned out by the fan on my HTPC :-P). The remote that I got likes to act up as well - sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. The contrast is excellent, although the blacks aren't really pure black, and you can have some wicked backlight patterns if you don't adjust your settings properly. If you don't know much about LCDs, you may want to purchase another TV, but if you're a geek (like me), this TV is for you. I hope this review helped!

The \\"sleep\\" feature on the tv is more complicated than it should be and requires the user to scroll through a couple of menus to get to (there is no button on the remote). The tv arrived packaged very well, and setup was a no-brainer. The only issue I've had so far is that the tv does not repsond to the remote for the first minute after it is turned on. Tech support was helpful and sent me a firmware upgrade but I havent had a chance to try it yet.Overall, I am thrilled with its sleek design, great picture quality and most of all, the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV!","review":"Review Update:July 18, 2008We have had this TV for a bit over three years and the picture is now non-existent. The sound is fine, but no picture! Only three years old? I called Syntax and spoke to a Customer Service person who quickly referred me to a \\"senior technician\\". That technician said \\"there is absolutely nothing I can do for you\\" and that to fix the TV will be as much as buying another one!? WHAT? Three years? It just seems like hardly anytime at all when I have another flat screen (different manufacturer) that works great and is much older. Will NOT buy from Syntax again.We love our new TV. The picture is wonderful. The sound could be a bit better, but overall everything we were hoping for and more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful LCD","review":"This is quite simply THE BEST LCD FOR YOUR MONEY. For $624 you are getting a sharp, colourful and solid screen (none of this weak, easily broken LCD rubbish. This television is STURDY!) with enough ports for whatever you can throw it; including an HDCP-DVI port - rare on many lcds, let alone one as cheap as this. I've personally used it with my oppo digital upconverting dvd player, and the picture is just amazing - colourful, crisp, and clean, with no bothersome interference.For the price, you can't beat this LCD. It gives you more than your money's worth - even the most hardened critic will find little to criticise for this bundle. Buy it. Buy it now. Why spend more for nothing? Syntax have created quite simply the cheapest and best LCD on the market. Rock on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky","review":"A little big and bulky for the location I was attempting to install plastic rivets.

It's easy to forget that making documentaries is not about the coolest new camera or the new version of FinalCut Pro. Making docs is about telling stories and that's what this book is about as well. It's simple: Read this book and you'll be a better story teller. I've always questioned the usefulness of books for teaching storytelling, but this one is so practical and straightforward that it proves that books can do the trick. It's surprisingly good - go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice spice","review":"I couldn't find this spice in regular stores, so it was nice to be able to order it online.

If you coach kids, have kids in sports, or are an adult involved in any way with organized youth sports, this is a MUST read. The author brings a deeper level of understanding and revelation about providing a healthy and positive experience for sports-minded kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very useful short history","review":"Since its founding around 25 centuries ago, Buddhism has spread widely and diversified into numerous schools of thought and practice. Summarizing this long history and describing succinctly the many schools of Buddhism is not easy. Yet Andrew Skilton has accomplished this feat with apparent ease. And making something look easy is the hardest task any scholar can face.I was astonished to see that one reviewer has claimed that this book is \\"Mahayana propaganda\\" based on a single reference. As I read it, I found Skilton's work to be very even-handed in discussing Mahayana and Theravada, without any proseletyzing or obvious mispresentation regarding either of these major schools of Buddhism. Skilton is disapassionate and fairminded, summing up history and doctrines with economy and precision. If there are errors in the book, I believe that they are minor and certainly unintentional.I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and clear exposition","review":"If you want to own one concise book covering the history of the Buddhist lineages, this is the one. It is as accurate as it gets, even where other authors get it all wrong (covering Tibetan Buddhism for example). Beautiful work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Tony Martin work","review":"This album features ex-Black Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin in his early years!!! He does a great job on vocals here, but the music isn't metal (yet even rock), and that's what killed it for me. It is pop music. The only GREAT track is \\"Black Night/Strange Kind Of Woman\\", but it's a Deep Purple cover. Better than the original, IMO. Otherwise, buy it only if you are a serious, big time Martin-era Sab fan. Otherwise, you will be totally dissapointed. Then again, this is out of print now, so it's rare! P.S. Forbidden is about 100 times better, but as I said, I'm a HUGE T.M. fan and I'll buy anything he makes! Check out \\"The Cage\\". It's available here, and it's a must have. Can't...stop...listening...to...it, must....play...it...again......buy....\\"The...Cage\\"...with..Martin....and Dario Mollo...now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely, wonderfully amazing!","review":"When I first acquired this book, I sneaked a peak at the contents quickly thumbing through the pages and radomly reading a portion of the print here and there. I knew immediately that I had stubbled on something special...and powerful. Ms. Dyer's work is amazingly insightful, beautifully articulate and wholly artistic. It is truly a journey of heart and soul. I for one am thankful to the author for choosing to share her amazing gift and journey with others. It will touch your heart...it really will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaret Mitchell Love Story","review":"I felt that Margaret Mitchell's family was part of my own, and hated to see the book end. Am reading it now for the second time. Would love to communicate with Marianne Walker, direct. Just finished reading Darden Asbury Pyron's SOUTHERN DAUGHTER and it has made me so MAD. There are so many contradictions in it with the Walker version and I choose to believe Marianne! As you can see, I am a devoted Margaret Mitchell fan and have tried to read every thing I could throughout the years. I look forward to learning if Marianne Walker is available to the \\"general\\" public, like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was just a great book! It's long, but it's worth it. The book tells the story of the love between Margaret Mitchell (who wrote Gone with the Wind) and John Marsh. It's well-written and easy-to-read. It is also very well-researched and provides and excellent narrative of their lives together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value/Great Tool","review":"I spent a lot of time driving around going to local tool stores and was surprised to find out that not many of them carried an inch/lb torque wrench. When I found one that did they wanted over $200 dollars for it. Then I went to Amazon and found this great tool for a lot less than any other place I looked at online and off. This is a great tool and a great value and I would recommend it to anybody looking for an inch/lb wrench."},{"rating":"2","title":"For simple torque wrench, this is a great little item","review":"For the low end torque settings, this is a great little wrench. When I hang weights off it at the 12'' point from the axis of the drive shaft, it matches up with the measurement on the torque scale so it seems accurate enough at this low end. I only wish it went a little higher (I have the smallest of these wrenches) like from 0 to 100 or 0 to 120. It is a big jump to the bigger one from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tool for the job","review":"If you're looking to torque smaller bolts you need a torque wrench that can measure in in-lbs and in newton-meters. This tool is sensitive and accurate. Not to mention you won't find a less expensive tool that can do this job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly consistent","review":"I've been using more and more carbon components and thought I should abide by the warning labels to avoid over torquing. Bought this, and it has served me well. I'm still not quite sure in the long term how accurate the deflection will be as over time, the properties of the metal from being repeatedly bent would likely change. But considering I'm not a full time mechanic and the use is intermittent, it would likely be years before that ever became a concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"TW-1 Torque Wrench","review":"I have tried repeatedly to return the wrench we purchased and your seller, Bikeparts USA has not returned my emails. I would not do business with them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, brings back \\"A-ha memories\\"","review":"I love this CD! My favorite is \\"Time and Again.\\" Also, the title, \\"Lifelines,\\" is also a pretty song. There are a couple that have to grow on you, but overall, this is a great CD to purchase. I also have \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\", and that, too, is an awesome CD.I just find it so disappointing, that they aren't able to make a comeback in the United States. They have so much talent, and the producers and recorders, don't seem to care.Go ahead and purchase this, you won't be disappointed. Morten's voice, as usual, is an angel's sent from up above - just breath taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued excellence from A-Ha","review":"Lifelines is in someways better than their comeback record \\"Minor Earth Major Sky due to some of the variety of this album. Highlights include \\"Lifelines\\" \\"Turn The Lights Down\\" \\"Forever Not Yours\\" \\"Did Anyone Approach You ?\\" \\"Cannot Hide\\" A excellent album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of fuel","review":"If you're hoping for a repeat of \\"Minor Earth|Major Sky\\" on this round, you're out of luck. It's not even \\"Stay On These Roads\\". What is happening here is that apparently, Pal Waaktaar is focusing more on his band SAVOY than on A-ha. His few contributions are staggering here (and so few as compared to nearly writing ALL of \\"Memorial Beach\\"). The music of this album is also a bit adrift and a bit too technological. It's almost a regression for this group who was turning out wonders of tunes from 1990-2000. To hear the first song 'Lifelines' you'd think it was a continuation of greatness, however 'You Wanted More' drags it down. 'Forever Not Yours' brings it back up, only to be dragged down by 'There's A Reason For It'. After the last down here, it never comes back up until 'White Canvas' which is the last high point. 3 highs out of 13 doesn't make for a great enjoyable listen. I'd advise this one to you only if you are a completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for two.....","review":"without going into a major review...this is A-ha's 2nd of two collectionsover the past two years and just wantedto say these guys aren't \\"boys\\" any more andthey are making great adult music thatshould be heard on radio, but here in the states,(with the shape of radio in America)their music would only embarrass most of whatgets played on radio.

The author shares a simple plan for dealing with the challenges of a chronic disease, without whitewashing the difficulties of daily life. He also shares a lot of personal examples, many of which I was able to identify with. My mother has Parkinson's and I've done quite a bit of research, reading, etc. This book fills a gap in the literature that's out there; most of the information is dry, \\"this is what's happening now, here's what the patient can expect in the future.\\" It was great to read something that really does give hope and is full of positive, realistic encouragement. I like the author's \\"take the bull by the horns\\" attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, Positive and Personal","review":"This is a book that offers very PRACTICAL suggestions (because they are tried and true) ways to approach life at a time and in a circumstance when you might want to give up. It is POSITIVE without overlooking the problems and hurdles to overcome. It is PERSONAL as it depicts the adventures of a very talented and vital personality coping with a life of change and uncertainty.Whether you have Parkinson's or not, whether you are a caregiver or not - this book will inspire you to approach life with a positive attitude and a practical application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Forward In Spite Of....","review":"One of the first recourses I used to acquire knowledge about Parkinson's Disease was reading Hal Newsom's book Hope.

I love Les Noces, but I remember how odd it sounded to me when I first heard it a couple of decades back. The first tracks on this disk are five Russian wedding songs. These provide a WONDERFUL education and context for Les Noces. Even if you are familiar with the piece, these are worth hearing for context.The other pieces are also not commonly had outside the big collections of Stravinsky works. They are worth hearing and knowing.These are very good performances done in interesting ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen??","review":"Kraco made some good matts, ordered 2 to match my front.

The book is fundamentally hard to read, hard to remember. It is totally not useful as a teaching tool. In the hands of an inexperienced professor its a nightmare!Gillers, don't suffer anyone else your bad text books again. You've taken an interesting subject, made it bland, confusing, and almost incomprehensible.

I thought this album was very good musically and his lyrics are exceptional and poetic. Some of his songs are funny and satirical, such as the song about dealing with TSA at the airport. We have all been through that experience. I will have to try another album by him in the immediate future since this was an enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"great roots music","review":"I really enjoy McMurtry's rootsy style.

Those who use this as a practice book are left to figure that out for themselves.Far more useful for a beginning student would be examples of how scale/patterns are musically applied to a tune/chord progression."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring, motivating","review":"Robyn Davidson has the courage that all woman (and men) covet. She has gotten to know herself more than most people ever dream. Her tenacity is incredible. I am inspired to finally take my own solo trips and look forward to reconnecting with myself and nature and not be so focused on the material, commercial, capitolistic society we get sucked into. It is a journey of simplicity and passion and finding peace within yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An refleshingly blunt adventure memoir","review":"Maybe this book is unique in that it came long before all the current Krakauer-esqe accounts of brave journeys that impose much soul searching sappiness upon us. Davidson reels you into her outragous Camel trek without wasting a single word on dear diary introspection. The result is an intensely memorable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psy-cho-babble","review":"Tracks is an exciting name and the fact that it is about Australia drew me to this book. The characters were facinating and the plot was good, but about halfway through the book it turned into psy-cho-babble about her inner self. I forced myself to keep reading but by page 210 of 254 I had to put it on the shelf. One of a very few books that I couldn't finish reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satire","review":"She spends most of the book abusing metaphors to describe the scenery.The satire comes in the juxposition of Aboriginals and camels.Intermixed with deploring the way Aboriginal people are treated, she beats her domesticated camels with a chain until she is exhausted.When she comes across a wild camel that has not be subjugated, the she must shoot it dead, for her own safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably more than you ever wanted to know about camels...","review":"The beginning third of this book, in which Ms. Davidson is preparing for her trip, really should have been cut in half. I thought she'd never get going.Once her journey begins, there are a few interesting adventures interspersed with many excruciatingly long passages of introspection and whining.But the main reason I gave this book a mere two stars is because I really disliked the author--she came across as aself-centered nutcase who survived through sheer luck and the help of others, rather than because of her intelligence or survival skills. She is definitely not in the same category of women as Jane Goodall or Diane Fossey."},{"rating":"1","title":"scatterbrained","review":"This could have been a fascinating book. The entire premise is so intriguing. However the total lack of planning and preparation on the part of the author in advance of her adventure is amazing. Her procrastination and introspective way of seeing the world is infuriating. I wish I could have finished the book. I kept waiting for her to get on with it but it just dragged on so. Perhaps it gets better when she actually leaves on her trek and starts managing things instead of being their victim, but I couldn't stick with it long enough. I got so discouraged with the character of the author and with Alice Springs. I couldn't even get myself to the point where she actually leaves on her expedition. Maybe someday I'll come back to the book to follow the journey and get a pleasant surprise in seeing her learning to change, but I just couldn't stand any more of her obsession with the inspection of her own navel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and boring","review":"Even though this book did have a powerful plot i thought it was flat out boring. The subject change confused me a lot. One minute she was talking about cammels and the next she was talking about something totaly opposite. It was very hard to finish this book. I give the author credit for acutally having the courage to do that and i think the book has a lot of girl power to it, but i didnt like the way she wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply, my favorite book of all time","review":"I first discovered Tracks during the boring period of my life, when I was a bank manager. Since then, my whole life has changed, and with Robyn Davidson as inspiration, I am much more of an adventuress. What I like best about this book is the soulful, brave way Robyn shares her inner journey...her attitudinal shifts, the way in which she sheds the trappings and conventions of society for something more real, a life lived closer to the bone. It's a must-read on a number of levels...I still re-read it once a year just to remind myself that there are places left to travel and inner realms to be explored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman should read this book","review":"Every woman should read this book because it is a model for what a woman is capable of doing. Often we do not realize what we are able to do until we are put (or subject ourselves) into a situation which tests us. Not only is this book interesting in the detailing stereotypes of Australian men, the wonder of the Outback and demystifying the aboriginies, it shows you an every day woman's spirit and instinct for survival. I read this book while in a 4 wheel drive truck going from Alice Springs to Perth in Australia. It was incredible to look up to rest my eyes from reading and see the landscape I was just reading about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of stock?","review":"Ordered the Guess Who, got U-2.

They give characters like Spiderman a hard edge that he doesn't have/need.I want to play as Venom but apparently you have to unlock that to all hell. Dissappointing if you ask me. And I heard after you unlock the characters you can't even save it.You have to hold R1 to use Wolverine's claws? Uh, those are like a default power and stuff!Spiderman going into a RAGE?Uh have these guys ever read the comics? Spiderman doesn't throw stingers. Ben Reilly did.If you're a comic fan.

Me being a Marvel fan believe this is an awesome game with really exciting moves and top notch graphics.

People don't know what they are missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Reason It Sucks","review":"Listen people, I know if you're looking for an adventure game, you've come to the wrong place. It is an arcade game. But I couldn't care less. If I want to put The Thing against Daredevil, I don't care if it is and arcade like style. But that's not why it sucks. This is why: Story Mode. It's a lot more frustrating than it should be, and every few seconds if you're not careful, you blow up. And the main villian isn't directly fought by a Marvel hero! And then, the some of the heroes are brainwashed into attacking each other, and the game doesn't tell you if they're put back to normal. And if that wasn't enough, 3 heroes have undetermined deaths in the cutscenes. This game is all over the place, and it's confusing enough that I don't even know who won.

Based on the reviews of this book, which call it magical, thought-provoking and WORDLESS, I believed I had found the book at last, and ordered an out-of-print library copy for my grandchildren. I arrived today and is NOT the book that the two reviewers describe! (I realize now that one of the reviewers is actually trying to review a DIFFERENT McPhail book, called \\"OH NO GO\\".)

We then called Delsey and were extremely disappointed. They do not have a repair center in Houston (the 4th largest city in the nation)!!! We would have to incur shipping charges to send it to one of Delsey's approved repair centers. If we had used the bag for more than one flight - or checked it underneath the aircraft - I might think some expense should be on our end. However, I fully expect a brand new bag to last more than a flight; and if it does not, Delsey should stand behind it.

They felt flimsy when extended, and to return them to the closed position, a button had to be pushed \\"just so\\" or they remained in the locked position. That was an irritation at the start.Small locks were included for security (I suppose), and they were a joke.While the bags look great, they suggest the quality of Chinese manufacture from about 1990.

Now, I'm sure a lot more happened in the 80's than the latest drama of your friend by three degrees.

This movie was a little different with the superb acting as well as the engaging plot. You really get pulled in to the stories. This movie was really done well. I wish I could've given it 4.5 stars.

'Scratch' is the real jewel of this set!","review":"While this volume of the Complete Wailers set offers a nice perspective of the original recordings of the Wailers, it is made much more impresive by the fine tracks of producer/studio legend Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. Scratch's versions show his true genius at the dials and the inevitable evolution of dub. This album should impress dub fans much more than it impresses reggae fans. It is far from the sleepy spacey dub of Tubby and his disciples (which is amazingly beautiful in its own way, don't get me wrong). Perry's versions show the up-beat dance-able potential of instrumental reggae. Of special note are the versions on disc 3 of Kaya and Small Axe (especially Axe Man which features some seriously killer nyabinghi drumming). Wailers fans, buy Vol. 1 of this series. Dub fans, buy Vol. 2. Music fans, buy both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Of The Best Wailers Matierial Ever","review":"This box set is amazing. It contains some of the most uplifting relaxing tracks the Wailers ever cut. Like the other box sets from this collection many of the songs are original versions of later famouse tunes. Kaya was later the name for Bob Marley & The Wailers 1978 album. Its a classic ganja homage. Keep On Moving is another great song. In fact i like the version on this CD more than the version from the late 70's. All 3 Wailers sing lead on it and it sounds magnificent. Every single song is good on this box set i recommend it to all early Wailers fans or any fan of older Jamaican Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Even though the packaging for this CD says that it was performed by the \\"Hollywood Studio Orchestra & Singers,\\" most of it was clearly done on a synthesizer.

Ultimately I found this release very disappointing, especially considering its high price and the terrible sound quality of the CBGB performance.On the first disc are two sets recorded at The Roxy in London, recorded some time before the release of their debut album, Pink Flag. They feature identical setlists and were performed to an almost empty room, so there is little audience interaction. The liner notes reveal that these recordings do have some historical value, however, as they were instrumental in getting the band signed to EMI.On the second disc there is a short set they performed at the legendary CBGB Theatre in New York, featuring material from their first two albums. This performance was recorded by a radio station, but very badly!

Helen Fitzgerald does a wonderful job explaining grief and the healing process to teens. I would suggest supplementing the book with some sort of journal like the book \\"Fire in My Heart, Ice in Veins\\" .. But this one is definitely worth purchasing for any grieving teen.

I myself am not great in math, but spending time with the problems in this book is well worth it. I spent 27 minutes on one problem, and I understood it afterwards, and the satisfaction is great!

But this book was quite useless. I purchased it as an aide to better understand the concepts in my precalculus text. However, I learned it was nothing more, whatsoever, than what its title states: an outline. The book is better suited for people who already have a strong grasp of the material but would like a quick reference, more than for those who need extra help in understanding concepts. If you need clarity from your current school text and more guidance, I suggest you find another book. If you need a quick, very brief reference that explains very little, than buy this book.

However, when I got the CD in the mail, I was disappointed to read on the back cover that all the songs except for \\"Party Lights\\" by Claudine Clark are NOT originals, but rather are later re-recordings with the lead singer and one or more of the original backup group. Who knows how many years later these were recorded? The sound quality and performances here are decent, but of the ones I've heard the originals of, most of these re-recordings are significantly inferior to the originals. So, this is a pretty enjoyable CD to listen to, but be aware that all but one are NOT the original recordings by these performers.

The playing of these guys sounds as if they've been together forever, and they only gained polish on their subsequent albums. The instrumental sets are flawless and well balanced, and there is never a hint of pop glitziness or anything but down-home foot-stomping authenticity. The only part that doesn't fit perfectly is the singing, which is not bad but somehow doesn't jive as well with the rest of the band's work (and only partly because of imperfect pitch). Their two subsequent singers haven't had this difficulty and have also been willing to sing along with instrumental arrangements, which isn't the case on this album - the only singing is in the form of unaccompanied solos.Even though more was to develop in subsequent albums, this one is still sterling and deserves to be cherished by every lover of real traditional Irish music."},{"rating":"2","title":"grandma","review":"My Granddaughter loves her doll however I was very disappointed that I spent so much for the doll and the pants will not stay up !!!!!

I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief review","review":"Satisfactory for gift for our (artistic) 11-year-old granddaughter; we expect it to help her in freehand drawing, especially of 3-D drawings on a 2-D surface.

I've always enjoyed art & drawing, but never had much confidence in myself because I was never really taught the basics in a way I could understand and/or enjoy. I've been out of college for quite a few years & I recently picked up this book & started drawing again. This book is definately one of the best purchases I've ever made. Terrific for young & old alike!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Got the book in a timely manner. Wonderful basic lessons in drawing. I am enjoying go through each lesson.

Good for both kids and adults of all ages. Lots of good easy to follow ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the CDs?!","review":"What Amazon and the other reviewers fail to explain is that you must have the CDs or cassette tapes to properly use \\"Japanese for Young People, I\\" -- and that Amazon does NOT include them with your purchase or the book. Indeed, you cannot even buy the audio recordings separately (Amazon lists them as \\"unavailable\\").Page after page of \\"Japanese for Young People\\" has exercises based on the recordings, which makes much of the book pretty useless. Wish we had known that before we ordered the book, as it would have saved us the trouble of shipping it back and asking for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful for beginners, but there's better..","review":"I'm currently using this book in my first year Japanese class in college. It is rather helpful, but comparing this book to Genki Vol. 1, Genki is much better. Genki does a much better way of explaining the particles, vocabulary, sentence structue, etc.If you're learning on your own, or learning in school, and are using this book I suggest you pick up Genki too. It'll be worth it in the end if you want to further your knowledge of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that great","review":"If you are looking for a book that helps you with Japanese grammar then this book is not for you. The book does not give in depth lessons and there are no english translations for sentences making it even more difficult to learn the language. The color pages is the only thing that is good about the book. I do not recommend this book for beginners, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Start To Learning Japanese","review":"I used this book to start to teach myself Japanese. It probably is a little basic but the success I had with it kept me motivated and gave me enough of a foundation to move on confidently to more complicated Japanese books.The use of key phrases throughout is ideal for users of SRS but also gives clear goals and the book allows for plenty of practice. It explained by example, which I find ideal. One bad point of the book is that it doesn't use Kanji at all. It's also very colorful. Adults might find it a little patronising but I would still recommend it as a first text book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I thought that this book was extraodinary!

For the price they charge they should actually make them better. I bought a boards, and after a few months the landing pads are broken. Halex just said o well. I babyed this dartboard, and to have this happen no it not right. The dartboards I use out at resturants hold up I throw hard onto thier plastic boards, but Halex onyl wants a quick buck.

It takes awhile to find all of those tiny screws when they're rolling around the box. Also, could just one of the pre-drilled holes be positioned correctly? Just one, please?As may be read in some of the other reviews, the darts are laughable. If the buyer is willing to do a little bit of repair work while putting it together; doing the work that a manufacturer generally does with even the most economical of merchandise, and the cabinet is not going to be the focal point of your rumpus room, knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsatisfied","review":"This didn't even come with English instructions so I had to try my best and look up on the Internet how to hang it up and ALL the darts broke within 48 hours! Had to buy more darts to even play! It's a good \\"dartboard\\", though. Everything else was crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken and missing pieces","review":"Arrived in its original box, not packaged well like Amazon normally does. Box had been dropped at least once causing the doors of the cabinet to come off as well as the scoreboards that should have been attached. Darts, markers and mounting materials were missing. A little disppointing and embarrassing for a gift that was given to someone.

That is definately not saying that this book is bad. Quite the opposite. Armin Panning gives a very good conservative view on these two brief books of the Bible. The greatest benefit for me is Panning's efforts to show that these books (especially Ephesians) fit into an established Pauline pattern--present a broad theological commands, then show how they can be practically put into practice. While I would recommend this book, especially for someone more interested in the Pauline epistles, I would first recommend other books from this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Storytelling, Haunting Characters","review":"Zilpha Keatley Snyder is one of the unsung great childrens' writers of the 20th c.

There is not a good index to find the anecdotes that might be of interest. The overall message seemed to be that no matter what you do with a gifted child, he or she will turn out all right.

I got all my tools in it, and it rolled up so tight, indeed it took less space. Win-win.As someone else mentioned, you will be challenged to carry a whole socket set in this. I don't see any way for tools to wiggle out while this is rolled up. I mention that, because reviewers of other brands have mentioned tools falling out of bags.

As for Dark Knight Strikes Again, well I should have read the other reviews first and saved my money.The artwork is wretched and the story is almost not there. Plot lines and characters are introduced then dropped with hopeless abandon.One wonders why Batman is the title character when this story tries (and that's all it does) to be a Justice League adventure.If you want a much superior story in this vein with VASTLY SUPERIOR artwork, spend your money on KINGDOM COME. That one will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once was enough....Please don't strike again!","review":"Absolute garbage. No one else could have published this junk it is that bad.

It is a pity they dont even bother protecting the memory of previous great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad beyond belief","review":"I loved year one, I thought Dark Knight Returns was a work of art, I felt Millers work really understood the conflicted soul of the Batman and gave him real depth. I have enjoyed most of Millers work and even when I didn't I could see the quality in it. This book is however a piece of rubbish, I ended up rushing through it desperate to get to the end. It feels like he had no idea what the story was about so just drew in every character he could think of. The artwork is terrible, the story is non existant, the characterisation is childish. Honestly please don't buy this, go back and read Dark Knight Returns again.

Some of the storylines were surprising...Superman & Wonder Woman did what???! Altogether, enjoyable if not as classic as the first. Batman as the rebel with a cause is always a powerful hero to cheer for even if he does most of his work, well into his 60s, behind the scenes. The contrast drawn between a hero without superpowers (Batman) turning the world right side up again while heroes with superpowers have sold out (especially Superman) or been driven underground is awesome. Like always, Miller's Batman is not for children but was Batman, with his darkness, ever really for children?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"You know, I had very hgh expectations, having thoroughly enjoyed the first book.

Hubris such as the passing off of DK2 as product, much less worthy successor, is better left to the maniacal machinations of Darkseid, or maybe Enron. We've been duped into buying a slap-dash fever dream on high quality paper. I don't even want this pap to sit next to or touch up against other comics in my collection. Don't fall victim to the hype, as I did. That way lies madness. Spend your money on something that makes more sense, like baby diapers, or a subscription to the racing forum, or crack.

Batman beats up Superman. Big deal, he did that in DKR.Overall, disappointing and rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy DISAPOINTMENT, Batman!","review":"This half-hearted effort by Miller and Varley leaves one with many questions.

He was Batman's partner for FIFTY YEARS!!!The answer, my friends, is that Miller is too LAZY to care about story and character consistancy, and is contempuous of those who liked his work in the first place.How much will your next comic be, Frank?

What fans got was a muddled, often inconsequential story that takes place some years after the original. Batman's still underground, and thought to be dead. Superman is still a lackey for the government. Not much has changed since Dark Knight Returns. Miller wastes the role of the ex-mutant gang that Batman trains: apear only shortly over the course of the series. Batman beats up Superman with the kroptonite gloves again. Big deal. Considering the space between issues (it took well over six months for this three-issue series to come out), and the overall inconsequentiality as a follow-up, I give it two stars only for the awesome coloring of Lynn Varley (even the art looks rushed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little BETTER...","review":"Frank Miller is at his best when he is choreographing violence. Because he had to wrap up this series, he delivers satisfying fight scenes.But, MAN, where is his story-sense? Between the \\"characatures\\" of well known television personalities, the unexplained Legion of Super-Heroes costumes, and the BIZARRE characterizations of well-established characters, I got the feeling that Miller was telling a bunch of in-jokes...that only HE was in on.The revelation of the identity of the \\"new\\" Joker made absolutely NO SENSE! Where is this great army that Batman has spent years training? Why aren't there more BATMAN villains?Varley's coloring is less intrusive than the other issues, but that's not saying much. To get a REAL sense of what Miller and Varley can accomplish together, seek out ELECTRA LIVES AGAIN.

Ain't gonna happen. There is nothing good to say about it.I just want to tell all the Dark Night fans out there that haven't read this last chapter to avoid it at all costs. I know you feel like you have to read it but trust me: YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF NOT EVEN LOOKING AT IT.I am a big fan. I consider the Dark Night Returns to be the greatest Batman story ever. I do this out of respect for other Miller fans. It will only hurt you to read DK3 - AVOID IT AT ALL COST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets hope this Dark Knight doesn't return","review":"After reading through this graphic novel you would honestly never believe that The Dark Knight Strikes again was written by the same Frank Miller/comic genius who brought us Batman:Year One & The Dark Knight Returns. This book is just plain amateur in both execution and art work. Giving us a story line revolving more around superman and his struggle to live in Lex Luthors dystopian society and very little of the dark knight that is supposedly striking back. Miller's art work's Neon coloring and sloppy at best pencil work, just hurts the eyes at times. Once you reach the end of this book you feel like a cheap prom date left at the end of the night feeling confused and taken advantage of by someone you thought you could trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Wow, this was complete crap. After I read the fantastic The Dark Knight Returns I read this, what a letdown! The artwork is simply terrible. I did not enjoy this at all. The story was stupid and to me the whole graphic novel was a mess. Nothing really made any sense. It seemed like Frank Miller hurried to get it done, it just doesn't look professinally done. I only recommend reading it because it's the sequel and just to see how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing would be an understatement","review":"The Dark Knight Returns was great. Truly great.This was, well, crap. The story makes no sense and the art is frankly (hah a pun) childish. The eventual villain totally ignores years of DC continuity and character development. Superman and Wonder Woman are caricatures of themselves.While reading it, I couldn't help but think that Miller was intentionally punking everyone who read and loved the original. that story actually had respect for the characters it portrayed. This just made fun of them for no logical reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Killing Joke","review":"In Dark Knight Returns, Frank Miller created a comic legend.In Dark Knight Strikes Again, he kills it. Twice over.Anyone who has reviewed this and given it five stars is kidding themselves. They are writing their reviews with the original in mind. They so desperately want this to be as good.It isn't.I have given this a one star rating because that is the lowest ranking you can give on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Clooney's \\"Batman and Robin\\" Look Good By Comparison","review":"Just about everyone else who gave it one star has already put it better than I ever could. This was the single most disappointing Batman story I have ever had to suffer through. And a warning for those seeking All-Star Batman and Robin out... the art may be tons better than what you find here, but Miller's writing is still just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the Low-Star ratings!","review":"Normally, you'd have to convince me this P.O.S had anything to do with Batman...let alone Frank Miller. This is bad. Real bad. Artwork is missing the detail and depth, storyline is real confusing as it introduces new (but old DC Justice League characters) at random and doesn't build their characters. Just altogether goofy and I can't see the relationship between DKR and this DKSA sequel. Seems like he went to the well one too many times on this one...If you want a good one, get \\"The Complete Frank Miller Batman\\" Leatherbound Hardcover with Batman: Year One, Santa Claus Wanted Dead or Alive and Dark Knight Returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done sequel","review":"This is possibly Millers worst comic book. The art is simply very poorly done. Its very hurried and its very obviously a complete hack job. It is very clear that he did this book simply to cash in and that he did not put forth any kind of effort. He made a terrible decision to ink his own work in this, its one of the worst inking jobs that I have ever seen. The story is good, plotwise, but the ending and the twists are really just plain silly. Batman simply comes off as a bad charicature of Millers previous version. His new Robin is boring. His Superman is a dope. Wonder Woman is goofy and way too over the top. This is quite possibly Millers worst work. It may be worth a read, but I dont think anyone who objectively reads this book is going to think that it was even decent. Im being generous by giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank Miller at his best","review":"Fantastic story. Certainly one of top contemporary graphic novels in the market today. While I'm not a big fan of Lynn Varley's artwork (the colors are just too bright for my liking), the story and the dialogue and the presentation made it easy for me to look past the art and appreciate the work . This is certainly a must-have for any fan of graphic novels, especially any fan of Frank Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too over the top","review":"The first Frank Miller Batman had it all: amazing characters, incredible pathos and drama, interesting situations and a showdown between rules right and rogue right. This book, not so much.Each character is a mere shape of an idea, not even a shadow. For example, Superman in the first book was dedicated to rules, liberty and the concept that all people should be protected by power. Even after a horrible nuclear attack, Superman still stands by the establishment. Batman is the personification of liberty, justice and responsibility on the individual level. When the entire city is burning, he forms a fire fighting brigade to combat the flames. In this book, you never see any character growth or development.Read the first book. Avoid this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment and damn near incomprehensible","review":"It's hard to believe this graphic novel was written by the same author who wrote the brilliant TDK REturns. The artwork is sloppy and disgusting, the writing is terrible, the dialogue is cheesy, Batman is completely out of character that you can't believe that such a comic was approved. And the structure of the writing and plot make the novel damn near incomprehensible to read, there were total sections where I literally had no idea what had happened or even who was talking. The biting political criticism and satire of TV commentary is gone now replaced by an imitation which attempts to evoke the same level of wit and brilliance but is sadly nothing more but a pale attempt.I don't know what happened to Frank but it seems he just doesnt care anymore and is banking on his name alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"I loved the the dark knight returns and this so called follow up was just a huge disappointment. This story is all over the place uneventful and uninspired. It's filled with crappy dialogue and stupid twists, I didn't care at all about any of the characters and sometimes the writing was just completely uncomfortable and the artwork is total crap and feels like some one did it in a day. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one read the dark knight returns an stop there this is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch.","review":"You would have never guessed that Frank Miller would have been a great writer if not for his previous works. This graphic novel lacks depth, lacks a good plot, lacks good artwork, and lacks spirit. In comparison to his other works, this is a piece of crap. Dont waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond a disappointment","review":"OKAY,I wasn't a big fan of the original 1986 \\"DK Returns\\": Miller's weirdo beardo, drug influenced art (enough vampired teeth already!!), a female Robin, Bats with a gun.Yet, I concur, that book changed comic books forever, even more that the brilliant Neil Adams in the 1970's. But I still liked the detective solving of Batman, used his mind instead of his fists.So, I was sort of interested when the long-awaited sequel of DKR came: DK Strikes Back. Whatta train wreck. Miller went overboard on distoted art, confusing and convoluted story-telling. It was really a piece of garbage. I wouldn't give the book to my pet rat for chewing fuel. Sorry, Miller, why don't you take more 'Shrooms!!!I was told the original concluding book was delayed for 4 months due to poor orders on the first and second issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as previous","review":"Comparied to Frank Millers Previous Batman Novel it really isn't that good. Not saying that it's awful, it's still worth a read! though I was really looking forward to reading this but did feel let down by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Work Miller's Done In Ages","review":"I've been disenchanted with Miller for years. The \\"300\\" series is the one exception to his increasingly ugly and sloppy output that, these days, I buy mostly out of habit, fondly recalling his glory days in the 80's. But this, this is the freshest, most vibrant, most fun read I've had in a long, long time. By turns mythic, hilarious, and heartbreaking, DK2 actually put a lump in my throat. Though it's definitely more rewarding for those with an understanding of the DC universe and it's history, Frank Miller manages to reinvent the genre twice in one career. Not too shabby. Easily his best and most radical work since \\"Ronin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"My expectations were rivaled only by my disappointment.","review":"After reading Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I couldn't wait to read B:tDKSA. As I said, my expectations could only be rivaled by my utter and complete disappointment. In this novel, it seems that Frank Miller enlisted the help of others, which was a collosal mistake. There are portions of the novel that are obviously done by Frank Miller (I say \\"obviously\\" because those parts of the novel are FREAKING AMAZING!) and other parts that look like they are done by some hobo Miller just took home with him one day. I could be wrong, but it seems like there is a vast portion of this novel that Frank Miller had nothing to do with, and those parts suck. The two stars were only given because there are some really great aspects of this novel, but they are generally buried by a mound of total and utterly annoying crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"Underrated masterpiece. Deeper than the first one. A must for batman fans. This one may not be for casual fans, but who really reads Batman comics and is a casual fan? if you're into reading comics about the dark knight, then you've already crossed over into supernerddom, and you'll dig this one. Critics focus on things like \\"there are too many weird characters I haven't heard of before\\" (come on, this is a comic book--there should be weird characters. I for one am glad he didn't just use the same old characters, but instead brought out many interesting but underused ones) while overlooking the punchy, intricate storyline and ingeniously subversive social commentary. Frank's last two remind me a bit of the movie Harry Brown, or Grand Torino."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photoshopped to Death","review":"I was interested in picking this up having enjoyed Dark Knight Returns back in the day, however I'm glad I took a look at this first. The art is almost destroyed by the garish photoshop colouring and effects. This was done around 2000 I think, but whatever the case it looks really dated in 2006. It reminds me of the kind of work someone who just learned enough of photoshop to go wild experimenting might do. I just found it really depressing because it ruined the otherwise great linework of Miller.As for the actual story let others who could make it through be the judge. I can't fairly say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Miller ruins Batman; Batman murders Boy Wonder","review":"What a horrible piece of [expletive deleted]. This is a lazy, poorly written, badly drawn, and inferior hack job from Miller. The story doesn't even feel like a follow-on to \\"Dark Knight Returns\\"; instead, it's just more of the same, only this time we've already read about how the superheroes are in their senior years and the world has changed for the much worse.This comic is poorly drawn. It's like a high school art student scribbled together some figures and decided to call it a day.Miller's writing is pathetic. What's the point of making fun of San Franciscans?And why does Miller have Batman murder Robin at the end of the story? Robin says he has always loved the Batman, and in return Batman says Robin never could do his job well and sends him hurtling to his death into a volcano? What the [expletive deleted] is that?Miller: you are a hack, and your best days are well behind you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading it...","review":"The story is really bad, I wanted to read about batman but instead I end up seeing a weird story about many superheroes... I doesn't really add up. Sad follow up of the great Dark Kight Returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroys the great work of its predecessor.","review":"After the Dark Knight Returns I looked forward to this book, had no idea the horrifying tale I exposed my eyes to. The plot is so convoluted I had to read the plot summary on Wikipedia to understand what I just read, the art style changes from amateurish to rushed drunken scribbles on a bar napkin. It seems as if Frank Miller was angry to have to write this book and set out to not ruin, but defile every DC character you know and loved with complete asinine, ridiculous and pointless character designs that only the rejected patients of mental institutes would find appealing. Its so bad it makes you feel worse for being exposed to it, it makes you feel dirty, wrong and defiled, avoid at all costs, if your options are reading this and gouging your eyes out with a pair of rusty salad tongs, go for the tongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever heard about the \\"Sons of Batman\\"?","review":"After The Dark Knight Rises a new threat has come to Gotham City and the planet.

That said, when compared as a sequel to The Dark Knight Returns, this comic is a huge letdown and disappointment. The artwork chosen for the story is horrible and looks like something I could have done. I don't mean to be rude but it is that bad.

Good luck figuring out what is going on in this comic. Was Frank high on meth when he wrote this book? I like when people try new things and it actually kept my attention through the middle of the second issue but this thing totally falls apart. If trying something new means not trying then bravo. This feels like 20 other comics Frank was working on, cut up into pieces, put into a hat and drawn out panel by panel. Yay, fun, right? No. Doesn't work. Awful.If you're like me, you've heard this was terrible but you'll read it anyway because you're curious. Well, go ahead, but nobody is lying to you. It is seriously horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Miller Flushes a Legend Down the Toliet","review":"Frank! What have you done to the legendary Dark Knight of myth? I read the original \\"Dark Knight\\" Returns in the 80's when it came out in its 4-book series, and whoa, it blew me away. It is hard to believe the same author wrote this piece of ... Instead of the classic and twisted Batman villians we get two Superman chumps and Robin. The original DK was a profound statement of justice vs. the law, government vs. vigilantism, pop psychology vs. common sense, and many other themes. There was no supervillians; the villians were more a symptom than a disease. This ham-handed cop out deserves nothing more that a funeral in my toliet, suitably adorned with some ... material. Oh for the days of \\"Sin City\\", Daredevil \\"Born Again\\". Frank, you let us down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable disappointment","review":"In what has to be the biggest disappointment this year (with Wolverine: Origin running a close second), Frank Miller has turned in 2/3 of his weakest story and art ever. Miller publicly expressed ambiguous feelings over the recognition he got for his work on Batman and other characters that he did not create. Given his notorious contrarian attitude, I could almost believe he was daring the comic-reading public to declare the emperor has no clothes. This book has a weak, uninspired story largely designed to depict as many DC characters in decaying senescence as possible. The art literally appears to have been faxed in. To add insult to injury, the last issue is late (not that I will be buying it). Miller's true talent is better showcased in his recent historical work \\"300,\\" which is everything that DK2 is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Knight Strikes Again review","review":"This sequel to the incredibly entertaining The Dark knight Returns has a lot of problems. For starters the title is all wrong, it should have been called The Dark Knight Strikes Again: Starring Superman. This alludes to the fact that Batman is hardly even in the book. There is no Batman doing detective work, no great fight scenes, and even when the dark one makes an appearance the reader gets the feeling that it is not Batman at all; in that Miller has changed key features in the Batman charactor. There is also a side story centered around Dick Grayson which seems tacked on. The only reason for buying this book is if you liked the artwork in The dark Knight Returns. Maybe someday Miller will do a remake of this book and spend a little more time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed experiment","review":"Herky-jerky plot. No real time spent on any characters. Inclusion of way too many silly characters (e.g. Plasticman). None of the supporting cast (e.g. Superchix, reporters, etc) ever get a personality. The world is some bizzare mix of the DKR world and the Marshal Law world.I had heard that this was bad, but didn't think it could be this bad. I wish I'd never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs, but buy Dark Knight Returns","review":"This is a follow on from Dark Knight Returns which in my opinion is the finest grapic novel of all time. But, this follow up is terrible, lousy grapics, lousy story (is there a story in there, I couldnt see it?).I wouldnt be interested in seeing this again if I was the last dung beatle on earth.Miller, you should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to anybody. Buy it and decide for yourself.","review":"I can't tell you whether or not you'll like DK2. I read it and I can say that no, it isn't as good as the original. But it's impossible to be better than the original. It was just flawless.My opinion of DK2 was that it was great. It was gritty and dark, like a sick, twisted cartoon. Alot of story is told in news broadcasts like in the first one. Miller does interesting things with the news by having all these bizzare character give it to show that the networks aren't really concerned about giving the news, but pulling in ratings by having seductive women and anime characters tell it. It has it's weak points, like introducing all these new things going on a new characters ALL THE TIME. None of it really adds up though, so don't get bogged down trying to understand it all.Don't listen to me though or any of the other reviews. Get yourself these books and decide for yourself. I think it was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh...","review":"the artwork is too sloppy to look at, the story is a meandering wad of lard... what the hell, Frank, did you whip all this out in a week for some desperate need for cash?

From the art to the mediocre story, this is a major let down; I feel that the only reason to purchase this book is because you wish to collect an abundant amount of Batman books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Miller farted this one out","review":"This is a disappointment. If you read the original , don't bother comparing it. Not that you should expect the same old thing since the original was a classic that cannot be repeated. This sequel seemed like a mere pretense of being a Dark Knight sequel. While reading it I got the feeling that Miller was just fooling arond and making up the story as he went along. Majority of the pages are filled of talking heads giving useless commentary about the world instead of dealing with the story. Borrow it from a friend or your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this . . .","review":"Dark Knight Returns = Best Graphic Novel EverDark Knight Strikes Again = Worst Graphic Novel EverNot sure what Miller was thinking here but this book is junk.

Batman's always been my favorite hero of all time, but this series just [was weak]. The first two weren't bad. Terribly confusing, but all the T&A superchicks stuff was a waste of ink and paper space that could have gone into telling the real story. This third and final - thankfully - made no sense at all. It was so much filler and [poor quality]. It was like trying to read a story where 3 out of 5 pages was missing. Read the first two, and make up your own ending. Don't bother to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had the option of ZERO STARS","review":"I like ironic detatchment as much as the next guy, but Miller went waaaaaay too far in this story.It is fine to exhibit contempt for one's characters and the medium in which one works, but it is too much to show hatred for one's audience as well.The message of Mr. Miller's superhero comic is: \\"superheroes comics are stupid, superheroes are stupid and, if you are reading this, you're stupid too.\\"Sometimes I agree, but I neither waste so many trees saying it nor charge so much for the privilege of being insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"absolutely horrid from start to finish. story. artwork. everything. horrid. meh. frank miller has zero understanding for batman, even less for superman. and captain marvel? miller should have been publically flogged for his utter misrepresentation of the character.the worst part of this? easy. the flash's bike pants. horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time ...","review":"(Rating 2.5 out of 5)You know, the sad part about this is that if I had never read anything by Frank Marshall I would probably have enjoyed this quite a bit.As it was, it was just a nice adventure.What made \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" and \\"Year One\\" so enjoyable for me was the deep, inner monologue of the main characters. Yes, sometimes it would go on for pages but at the end I was right along side the character emotionally.In \\"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\\" the story (and me along with it) was jumping around so much between the plethora of plot points and characters I never got the sense the story really knew where it was going nor what the characters were feeling.Afterwards, I felt as if the whole story could have been split into 3, each building on the other.Alas, my high hopes were not met."},{"rating":"1","title":"SWILL, AND MORE SWILL","review":"Please, just read my review of issue one of this mini-series. It applies to issue 2 as well. DK2 is completely a waste of anyone's time. I can't believe people out there are actually enjoying this swill. There are plenty of good comics out there--read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes... not that good.","review":"This book was painful. The art made me cringe on just about every page. There are some good panels, but some look like they were drawn by a 2nd grader. I know Frank Miller is capable of better.The story was Ok. It wasn't anything earth shattering, and a lot of it was predictable. I know the characters in this story are supposed to be separate from the characters in regular DC continuity, but some of the characterizations were bad (Superman and \\"Joker\\" were the worst). I won't go too much into this as it would require me to spoil certain parts of the story.I went in with an open mind and came out thoroughly disappointed. There are a lot of good Batman stories out there (Batman Year One, The Killing Joke, The Dark Knight Returns, and anything written by Paul Dini), this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable artwork.","review":"Having recently devoured Absolute Batman:Hush, I was excited when purchasing this title. Normally I never buy anything thats wrapped in plastic, unless flipping through it first. After getting Darkknight home, and openning it up, I nearly lost my mind. The art work is deplorable, it looks as if an eleven yro child produced this book. While I understand frank millers claims to have wanted to keep the images gritty, theres a fine line between grit and [...]. Skip this title, and purchase Absolute Hush instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Return to Gotham","review":"I was kind of expecting much more from this graphic novel. I thought that the long-awaited sequel to TDKR would be an amazing, earth-shattering epic that would stand tall as it's predecessor does. After turning the last page, I knew that wasn't going to happen.Now don't get me wrong, TDKSA is a good read, but it's not very fun to look at. Miller's art is more cartoonish than I'm used to, and doesn't fit very well with Batman. The art is too colorful and garish, which is what Miller was probably going for. But for me, it doesn't vibe; Batman is NOT colorful and garish. Example? The 60's TV show. Yikes...On top of that, Batman's character is completely unlike himself, which to me was a supreme turn-off. Other familiar DC faces turn up as well, and that's not a good thing, let me tell ya.In short, definitely read TDKR, but do yourself a huge favor and skip its \\"sequel.\\" You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Knight Strikes Out","review":"There's a Tony Millionaire quote on this book's small inner jacket flap: \\"This book looks like it was done by a guy with a pen and his girlfriend with an iMac.\\" That's about the best compliment this book deserves. If truth in advertising were the standard they'd mention that the pen was applied sparsely and quite sloppily, and that the girlfriend is probably new to computers and given to horrible, eye-straining experimentation with already-overused Photoshop filters.Come on, all you Frank Miller apologists, get real. There is simply no excuse. Sure, nobody expected this thing to be as innovative and influential as Dark Knight Returns, but when the preproduction sketches at the end of the book have more care put into them than any given page in the finished story, it's time to hold Frank Miller accountable.2 stars only because of the much-deserved scathing commentary on life under the illegitimate Bush regime. Then again, I question whether Miller even intended this."},{"rating":"1","title":"From brilliant to beyond mediocrity","review":"This book is on par with Joel Schumacher's last Batman film. That movie may well be better than this book. The artwork (incredibly gets worse as the story progresses such as no backgrounds) and story (plots go nowhere such as Dick Grayson/Robin as a would be killer, what happened to Nightwing?) comes across rush and lazy leaving the book impossible to read and just plain awful to look at. Lastly, this is more of a JLA book than a Batman book. It is hard to believe that the same person that was so brilliant with TDKR and Year One produced this same work. I miss the old Frank Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't leave well enough alone.","review":"Disappointing sequels are nothing new, but I have a hard time coming up with an example in any medium where the disparity between an original's quality and the follow-up's is so incredibly wide. Dark Knight Returns was Miller at his peak, Strikes Again is like a 13-year-old's idea of making fun of it. The dialogue is laughable, the drama is boring at best, the art gives no reason why it should stretch over expansive full pages the way it does. I'm an optimistic, forgiving person, but really there's almost no excusing such overindulgent, ill-advised trash as this.I'm a huge fan of the original, and even other work by Miller, but don't waste a nickel on this. His awful \\"All-Star Batman & Robin\\" run really shouldn't have been a surprise after this. Heck, if nothing else, Batman fans should stay away because he's hardly even a character in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly Real","review":"Many people say that the lighthearted nature of this book distracts from the realism of the story, but the way in which this world mirrors our own can be disturbing.

First of all it is by all means a lack of plot. Well there is a plot, but it is completely pointless. What I mean is that this anime has had the most annoying characters in the ever. There so annoying that all I could do is either return this DVD or maybe - just maybe skip a couple of episodes to see if something cool might happen. But it didn\`t work at all. This series was a waste of money. I only bought it because I heard it was really cool and original and so that made me want to buy it. I think I may have learned my lesson on listening to these propagandas, is that not every single word they say is true that if a series is said to be really good in characters, plots, story, etc. Because in the end you are the only critic to give your conclusions or reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Faisel","review":"I purchased the black faisel shoes for work.

Nice dining chairs are expensive. These protectors are not. They stay on all of the time. I wouldnt want to host a dinner without these on my chairs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do it yourself much cheaper","review":"After reading the reviews, I decided to look into doing this myself. I went to JoAnn Fabrics and bought thick clear vinyl by the yard for about $2 a yard. One and a half yards will cover 4-6 chairs. You can just take the chair cover off and staple the plastic to the bottom of the chair, which according to the reviews you would have to do anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Seat Savers....","review":"These clear vinyl chair protectors are great for keeping spills off my upholstered kitchen chairs. All three of my children have spilled at one time or another and there's no worries since it falls right onto these chair protectors. I purchased our current ones about 9 months ago and unfortunately these don't last very long b/c they slip and slide when they move around getting up and down from their chairs and the plastic straps eventually tear off. I do admit that they're not very attractive either but the upside is that my chairs have stayed looking brand new. Every household with small children should invest in several packages!

When it came we had family volunteers who wanted to put it up right away. Great for Movie night!! In our eagerness to put it together the directions were misplaced. This was so easy and intuitive to put together we really did not need the directions. It is a great screen, everyone agreed it was better than a wide screen TV.

Thanks for the fast Amazon delivery too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the AV Club","review":"This screen reminds me of AV club in HS. It is a classic design that still works. It is a little clunky, and I believe they have a more expensive version that might work more smoothly. It uses stop holes that a pin goes into to adjust the height. They could use a few more holes so you can get it to it's maximum height and keep in widescreen mode. The legs take a little manual pulling to expand.The screen surface is great. I called the company inquiring about glass beaded screen and they said they were phasing them out. This matte screen works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large Screen","review":"The screen fills an entire wall of our living room. My wife could not believe I would buy such a large screen.The screen does the job of showing the projected image well enough and we like it, however it is heavy and not suitable for many women to set up and take down. Also the tab that you push or pull to set up and take down the tripod supporting the screen easily bends.

The screen is easy to put up, and easy to take down. When stored, it sits discretely in the corner of the room. The picture is much brighter than on the wall and it is clearly an improvement. Sometimes I get a bit irritated when trying to make the image perfectly focused on the screen. On the one hand, since I'm taking the screen down after each movie, it is hard to get the screen truly perpendicular to the projector. On the other, there is some very gentle folding that comes from the very gentle curve on the top support beam. But, while these are irritating as long as I'm trying to make the image perfect, I forget all about it, and don't notice a thing, as soon as the movie starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"70INX70IN Versatol Tri-pod Screen Matte White Keystone Elim.It's easy to set up and well made.

Materials are all of good quality and it's made in the USA which I though was nice. I used it for movies, video games, slides. Great product and takes less than a minute to setup and take down. While not as cool or sleek as a pulldown screen it's still just as competent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Projector Screen","review":"Good value for this screen. It is lighter to pack around than other screens I've used in the past. The keystone rod at the top of the screen is a nice addition. Pretty good value for about $100. I'm sure there are better screens for more money but this one is a good screen for someone who wants/needs a screen but does not want to shell out big bucks.I've used it for some presentations in small groups and it does okay with indoor lighting. Quick easy setup. There is a locking tab on the bottom handle that takes a bit of getting used to but it allows the lower handle to hold in positions outside the locking tabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with Kindle version","review":"This book has very helpful content, but problems in the Kindle version.

The people at Hyperion have started a whole new category: Books about the making of a movie from a novel that are better than the movie and the novel themselves. \\"Journey to Beloved\\" is a fantastic insightful look (wonderful photos) at (I paraphase Zefferelli here) the transformation of one work of art into another work of art.

Any worry I had was needless. The table arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It took between 30 and 60 minutes to assemble, but I have lousy tools and I'm not very good at using them. Someone with better tools and more skill could assemble it in 15 minutes, I think. In any case, it was easy to assemble. And the table looks sharp!

Hate to think anyone still struggling with the end of that series would buy it on that basis. Yes, they both feature sailing ships but that's about all. The book is poorly plotted, has no believable characters, seems rife with anacronisms, and provides none of the period texture which is key to good historical fiction.

To my surprise, it ended up changing my paper and my life.There is no other book that captures the pain, misery, or humanity of the Chinese woman's experience. Yet, it is still hopeful and encouraging. Each chapter deals with a different woman's story. The topics range from love, sexual abuse, suicide, and acceptance. Some passages were so difficult to read that I cried, or flew into an angry rage. While other passages made me hopeful. This is a book where you are best to discover its contents for yourself, so I will leave this summary vague.I highly recommend this book. If your interests are in Chinese history, women's issues, or just great life stories that provoke strong reactions, this book will truly satisfy you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt and honest","review":"Although I was a little taken aback by the style, these stories are a great read and certainly speak to the heart in a way that only a person from China would know.

It seems made up like she is sharing a fairy tale. At one pioint I placed the book down on my lap and thought to myself that these stories are either not real or totally adorned for the sake of drama. I am really disappointed in the lack of genuiness and reality of the stories. It would have been better if told as if these were true stories. Sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"If you are not firmly knowlegeable about China's recent past, I recommend this book to be read after Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China by Jung Chang.

As I continued with assembly, I discovered that a piece of wood under the tabletop joining two legs together had been completely destroyed due to screws being inserted too tightly (during factory assembly). There were also multiple cracks around the corners of the table. I requested a replacement and sent back the set. I just received my replacement today and I didn't even have to take one piece out of the box to see that the corner of the table is badly cracked; it appears to have been dropped during shipment and there was not enough packaging material inside to cushion the wood.

One of the table legs couldn't be attached securely due to the leg not being able to accommodate the screw needed to hold the leg in place. The others stayed loose. We tried using brackets to secure all of the legs, but they still came loose, bent inward, and basically rendered the table useless. This was reported to Amazon and they sent a whole new replacement free of charge. The second set, however, was no better and the same issue with the legs not fitting properly continued. Also, one of the slats from one of the chairs from each set came off.

The table and chairs are very cute, but the product is NOT durable at all. Within a few months the slats on the chairs began to move apart and pinch little thighs. It wasn't long before they came off completely (with staples sticking straight up in their place). My husband fixed them numerous times, before we stopped using them all together. After that, the legs on the chairs and the table wiggled apart, constantly having to be tightened until screws seemed to be stripped out. We then glued, and put in extra screws for stability. My girls aren't overly rough either, just sliding it gently across carpet, and they loosen the legs. Just a year later this table is literally barely standing. The kids also eat at this table, and from wiping it with a regular non scratch kitchen sponge after each meal, the table top has started to deteriorate.

The beginning re-introduces you to the characters, and the end leaves you wanting to read the next book immediately. In between- there are disasters, secrets, and misunderstandings. Despite all of their hardships, the faith of the characters is deepened and strengthened.These books may be formulaic, but Ms. Peterson writes very well, so the formula isn't noticed as much.

He does an excellent job of describing DHTML for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but nearly excludes Netscape Navigator completely. That is fine if you are publishing web sites design strictly for IE, however in the real web designers have to accommodate as many browsers as possible. The scope of Mudry's book is too narrowly focused to be useful. Perhaps if he defined what was compatible with the different browsers certain portions of the book would be of use. Finding out that Mudry's scripts don't work in Netscape through errors and crashed browsers is not acceptable.

It doesn't cover data binding (only a passing reference section) which is a little disappointing. It was obviously written with a Preview Release of IE4, but surprisingly this doesn't detract from it very much at all. One of the best things about this book is it is simply quite readable, some of these books are so dry you have to drag yourself through. It already assumes you are a competent HTML coder and reasonable Javascripter, and in keeping with a target audience like that doesn't insult you with the rubbish \\"what is the Internet?\\" sections so many publishers insist in including in every book. Virtually everything is backed up by an example, and despite this it manages to go at a reasonable pace. The Netscape 4 coverage isn't as comprehensive as I'd like it to be, but is ok.

Yes, there is regret, there are growing pains, there are the travails of young love, but somehow they seem different in this light. These writers know themselves and they know the time in which they live.

I thought their love affair was unrealistic, there was no challenge and as I read on and on I felt myself saying that this is complete HOGWASH!!

There are also practical ideas suggested, and ways of making a difference, inside me and in my outer world. For example, I am able to change the way I think and it will change the way I feel - something I have known in my head, but never have I read so clearly how this can happen - I mean really! 'We can learn to be less afraid of fear' 'what would I do if I weren't afraid?'

The Empress of Ireland had a higher fatality of passengers (840) than either Titanic (832) in 1912 or Lusitania (791) in 1915. For some reason, this tragedy is almost unknown. Now, David Zeni brings it back to life in this absorbing, well-written book. Zeni covers the controversy surrounding the cause of the sinking in great detail. He also provides interesting word portraits of many of the passengers, and discusses the aftermath, including the investigation into the tragedy. The book includes numerous photographs, charts, and maps. Hard to put down and well worth the read.

The covers are phenomenal, and the majority of the interior art is balls-on. It's great, but...The story is a prelude - it takes place before any of the other stories we've seen to date (except for flashback stories, of course.)

It also includes a significant amount of biographical information on sailors of historical renown and those of more recent times. It is written in such a way as to be captivating on its own - I often find myself looking up a nautical reference and then spending many more minutes or even hours engrossed in the book because of the other items I see when looking up the first. In each entry, the terms used to describe the entry are asterisked if those terms are further defined elsewhere in the book.

And by the way, the sound quality is equally lame. I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected a decent level of quality from a unit with Denon's name on it.

At that price it did the job but I would not let it touch a quality Lp or it will be damaged upon being played. I am surprised Denon would put there name on this turntable it's a good way to lessen there reputation. The one difference between this one and mine is the platter on mine is plastic and this one is alloy. Other than that they are identical.

The author, Elena Zamora O'Shea, writes the novel from the viewpoint of a mesquite tree. The tree, \\"Posta del Palo Alto\\", is a marker on one of the old Spanish trails common in Texas. The story details the settlement of the area around the tree, working its way from the earliest settlement of the area to around 1905.Being a native of this area of Texas and being intimately knowledgeable of Nueces County, it was a fascinating story for me.I suggest that you read the novel first, then read the introduction. Leticia M. Garza-Falcon writes a very interesting, but very long winded introduction to the novel that essentially tells the whole story, leaving little for the reader to discover in the novel.I recommend it for anyone that has an interest in South Texas history, or Hispanic based novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely tale about the area between the two rivers","review":"A beautiful tale recounting the history of an area inTexas which has long been overlooked.

Jane never happened--read this instead","review":"This book was an Amazon \\"suggestion\\" (but so was \\"Animal Husbandry\\", and I don't know what that is). I read a few pages of preview and was absolutely hooked on this story!Of course, it's really a horror story, except the participants can RING THAT BELL to get out. The main protagonist, Grey, is a likeable character. He is a driven, incredible athlete and military officer. He also has integrity, loyalty, and character--and it would be so much better if he didn't. Over and over, he sacrifices himself for others, in different ways. So you know, this can't have a happy ending.One of the characters, Roger, is quite the poet, and often quotes from the Iliad. I think there is a moral there--honor vs. the tide of circumstance--and I hope this writer does publish more books.

After it got here and I read the back, I found out it's a FICTION book. Which made me feel like a complete moron because I had assumed it was just a true account of the process of BUD/S training. The author DID, however go through BUD/S phase 1, so theres that. BUT, if you're a compulsive moron like me and think this is a work of non-fiction and you happen to be reading reviews instead of the actual entire product desription, then here you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fictional read","review":"This is a great read!

Although labeled as fiction, the content and realism in describing the BUD/S experience is as accurate a portrayal as you'll find without actually going through it. The author did an excellent job of painting a very accurate picture of the raw experience. If you are considering going for it, this is a \\"must\\" read. It also may be helpful to any youngster considering entering one of the service academies as it explains the funk that settles in a persons mind when taking rounds from multiple directions with no end in sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I liked this book. It really takes you to a place in which you most likely would never be at. I have never done SEAL training, but it seems like he really describes it vividly and accurately.The only drawback on this book is that the main character, Grey, is a complete goody-goody. It gets very aggravating as to how much this character is always seems to be thinking and doing the exact \\"good\\" thing all the time. It's like he has no bad side, which is what makes fiction interesting.On the plus side, the book did have a really good ending. It really saved the book from the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but how accurate?","review":"Although I've read a lot of books (both fiction and non-fiction) on Navy SEALS, their training, etc. - \\"Suffer in Silence\\" sort of brought it to a new level.

Since it's written by David Reid, a man who tried out but didn't make it through BUD/S, I'm sure a lot was based on reality. But how much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"fictious\\" for a real Seal fan.","review":"As someone who has read every Navy Seal book written - a \\"novel\\" just isn't fair to the brotherhood.

After all the garbage that has been printed about Mario, it's refreshing to have a book stating the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!

In and of themselves they are fine performances, but once you have heard Michael Ponti's Moszkowski on Vox and Earl Wild's Paderewski on Elan, there is no comparison whatsoever. In light of Ponti and Wild, Lane lacks luster, vitality, and the powerful moving delivery of the Ponti and Wild recordings. The orchestra in the Lane recording is likewise less than satisfactory.

There's probably a plug around back (if you bought your computer in the last 2 years) that looks like a really big phone cord plugin - that's for a cat-5 (RJ-45) ethernet cable to plug into and that should be all that you need to connect to your router/hub/cable modem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad NIC","review":"My friend recently purchased the card and ended up returning it due to the low transfer rate.

This book really hits every aspect of the program, and tells not only what's there, but how and why to use it. Examples are concise and relevant. This book is a good book for an advanced iPhoto user, and a must have for the beginner. Apple should include a copy of this book with every Mac.I only found two points to comment on in the book:1) You don't need to rename the iPhoto Library folder or use any third party tools to maintain multiple iPhoto Libraries. You can simply hold down the Option key when launching iPhoto and iPhoto will ask if you want to create a new library or find an existing one. This worked with iPhoto 4.2) One thing users can do to improve the performance of iPhoto is to turn off the Drop shadow option in the Appearance preference. I don't think he mentioned that.Otherwise he hit everything a person using iPhoto needs to know about.

It has a good bit worthwhile about it--a girls-bonding theme presented in the context of solving a mystery. The movie has some comic moments, generally fine acting, and, if rated, would fall somewhere between a \\"hard\\" G rating and a \\"very soft\\" PG rating.If you feel that your kids missed out on the \\"small theme\\" films which seemed to be present for kids in abundance in the 1960s, and seem to have wholly given way to big-budget, big special effects films in the 00s, then you might check out Frog and Wombat, a quirky little modern indy film that reminds me of those low-budget 60s family comedies.

At any rate, the movie is OK, not great, but lemme just say that I would NOT waste my money on buying it or renting it for that matter.

He also gives advice on why writers write, agents and working within the industry. And a look into the process of rewriting a scene of a screenplay (very useful). I would describe it as Adventure's in the Screen Trade without the bitterness of Goldman.My only criticism being that it makes you so hungry and ravaneous for more advice.

My curriculum has very detailed reading assignments based on the seventh edition, and I was not able/willing to keep up with all of the changes through more than a couple of weeks.

Don't even bother purchasing the workbook that goes along with this text because it doesn't help, it doesn't match up with the book either. What this book needs is more editing and a completely different layout that is user friendly for 1st year nursing students.

Our nursing program doesn't go in the order of their chapters, so we just go to the chapter that applies. I use it for every class I have, whether or not it's an \\"assigned\\" text book.

It's filled with detail that is not compelling nor germaine to the issue at hand. It may be the issue at hand is really not that interesting. Hence the need to pad it with redundant details.The best thing that could have happened to this book is a good edit. It's worth about half to two thirds the pages used to present a relatively simple tale of two radically dissimilar spirits and intellects. Perhaps if it had focused on these elements in more depth it may have produced the substance the authors try to conjure. As it is there really isn't the stuff of drama and the information packed into the book is only mildly interesting. It reads much more like gossip than their previous effort.

We bought the pecan, but it is more like a very light cherry rather than pecan. We didn't want painted wood...Pretty though. Also the legs holes were poorly drilled and the screws kind of cheap.

Only three of the corners were drilled to receive the table legs. So I had to drill that hole myself.The supplied screws and metal parts are made of the cheapest available metal. They strip instantly, and the pre-drilled holes in the wood parts for those screws were so far out of line that when you screwed them in they had so much stress on them that the cheap screws stripped the cheap wood and popped out. All this before my 2 year old ever even sat on them.This is shameless, shoddy junk and the only reason I am not returning it is because we waited to put it together until some other work was done. By that time it was too late to return it. So it will go in the garbage where it belongs. $105 mistake.

In summary, there are ten clones, all scattered throughout the West Coast, one of which is trying to kill the other nine.

Only one of the ten 28-year old clones has a real job (the others live in the woods as hermits or have joined various religious sects). It was difficult to relate to any of them. Even Artie, the main character, works in a virtual reality-type game shop with a Bozo-the-clown looking girlfriend (at least that's the way she was described in the book). Again, not very believable.File this book under science fiction.

It is not perfect of course, but as good as you can get for the genre. For an American book, it does concentrate on American quotations, but the quality is so good, it doesn't matter.The quotations are grouped into logical chapters and a chapter right at the end for the miscellaneous including the funnies.I expected a lot of Vince Lombardi quotes amongst basketball and baseball coaches etc but the author has spent time to distill the best examples from all sources so we get a concentrated delivery of the best motivational quotations available.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This cable works great with all of my firewire products such as my external hard drives.

Price was good but labor to install a part that will fail in a few years made it a poor buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, cheezy ending","review":"Kushner's world in \\"Privilege\\" is interesting and complex, and she writes well. I wanted to be interested in a young woman, forced to learn to sword fight by her crazy, malicious uncle. I wanted to like and admire her. However like \\"Swordspoint\\", I didn't like Our Heroine or most of the other characters.I loathed the too easy, unbelievably cheerful ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"tasteless","review":"The 'Privilege of the Sword' was a novel that had a truly exciting premise, but ended up being quite flavorless. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen, and was sadly dissapointed. Not only was the plot some what bland, the characters (save for the mad duke, who was done really well) were weak and underdeveloped. I never really got to know the main character. On the whole, I felt cheated out of what could have been a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"After struggling through 1/3 of the book I gave up. It is not interesting, not well written, and is boring. After a very good \\"Swordpoint\\", and a mediocre \\"The Fall of the Kings\\" the quality keeps on plunging. I will not be buying anymore Kushner's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enormously Satisfying Sequel!","review":"Just finished the book this morning. What a wonderful sequel to Swordspoint! I've missed the deliciously wicked, biting dialogue and impossibly twisted situations. The repartee and swordsplay make this book indulgent fun! Young Katherine Talbert is swept into the worlds of the Hill and Riverside by her uncle, the mad Duke Tremontaine. Lover and swordsman St. Vier is back too but not as you would expect! It is wonderful to see these familiar settings through Katherine's wide eyes. Ellen Kushner writes like a dream and the book is very very hard to put down for any length of time. Her \\"The Fall of the Kings\\" was great too... but this is the true sequel - the one we've been waiting for- for too long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow but satisfying read","review":"This is rather slow reading, a baroque armchair rather than a Porsche seat, so to speak. In fact, it took me almost two months to finish, escaping from time to time into this richly painted, unnamed fantasy world, the hero a young girl educated in violation of all manners by her uncle, the Mad Duke. Which is of course Alec, whom we met in Swordspoint as not so young student. Like \\"Swordspoint\\", this novel is more about atmosphere and characters than storyline, and even the intrigues are not all too subtle this time -- it does not matter. So prepare a cup of tea, fill your bath tub, or whatever you do to relax, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Privilege of the Reader","review":"This book is a more-than-worthy sequel to its predecessor. I would STRONGLY recommend reading the predecessor (titled Swordspoint) first, if the reviews of this book pique your interest: the story does lean a bit on the assumption you're already somewhat familiar with the setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Quite simply the most purely enjoyable book I have read in years. Reading it is like opening a box of the most expensive and delicious bonbons -- the kind that are each individual and gorgeous, and come with a little map. This is going on the select shelf of \\"comfort reading.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Take on Fantasy and The Sword","review":"I really enjoyed the sequel to Swordspoint. Kushner's characters are compelling and interesting. The whole world she creates is so different to our own time period. It's fantasy, but could be very similar to what happened in the city-states of Renaissance times. I kept imagining much of the setting looking something like Italy.I'd highly recommend this for those who like different, cutting edge fantasies. It is definitely not your average book. The swashbuckling is done by the main character's niece from Swordspoint. It continues the story in the first book showing how time has affected the characters. I'm already ordering the third book. Looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun; a real relief from cookie-cutter fantasy!","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I've not read Kushner's previous works, and had not even heard of them until I read this.This book was a wonderfully enjoyable read, and the story was fun and moved quickly. The characters were interesting, and while I never developed a strong dislike for any of the characters (and really only liked a very few), their interactions were fascinating and kept me reading.Compared to many of the books I read, this story was like candy: an easy read that didn't demand much of me, but engaged be effectively by being different from all the other books I've read over the last several years. This was quite a refresher after the moderate-to-heavy fare I've been reading these last few months.Well written, Ms. Kushner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This deserves five stars. It really does.","review":"I have to admit to writing this just to up the author's rating: I find her writing compelling in a way that few other authors are.

With all due respect to the other reviewers, avoid reading some of their reviews if you don't want the plot spoiled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I bought this book for my Mom as a guide. After looking through it I returned it the next day. It was published in 2006 but you wouldn't know that by the information it gives. It tells the mother that she is the one dealing with the vendors. In my personal situation, mom is having nothing to do with vendors, my fiance and I will be the ones meeting and choosing. The book leaves the groom out a lot, leaving decisions up to mom and bride and to take groom into consideration. Towards the end of the book there is a day of schedule, telling the mother to \\"gently wake your daughter.\\" Other information about what to wear was useful, but could be found online. I found this book really outdated and returned it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"Bought this book for my mother when I got engaged. She's stuck in the olden-days, so needed to bring her up-to-date on the times now.

You need ample space because it is quite large but other than that, it was a very good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge, flimsy and impossible to store","review":"I got this playhut for my daughter last xmas. It now sits, hopefully forgotten, in the garage. Here were my concerns: First of all, it's huge--way bigger (taller) than a Dora fan (i.e. a 3 or 4 yo) will need. Secondly, it's absolutely impossible to fold small enough to put away. Folding it that small also destroys the rods that support the \\"structure\\" so instead, it leaned against the wall, huge and ugly. I dreaded getting the thing out because it took up half the living room. Third, it's really flimsy--just a shell, really -- and would collapse after a few minutes of exhuberant play. After a month or so, it started ripping and falling apart at the seams. Not worth the money in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, keeps collapsing","review":"This is a really terrible product. It will not stay up and stable and keeps collapsing on itself. I read the instructions to see if I was missing something and it said that some versions of this product come with a support pole and some do not. Mine didn't and the thing won't stand up. It's also nearly impossible to fold it back into the size of the box it came in.I have fiddled and fiddled with trying (following the directions) to twist some of the wires in a certain way to try to get it to be a little more stable, to no avail.I really wish I still had the receipt for this thing so I could return it, but unfortunately I didn't keep it, so the next destination is...the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this tent for my great granddaughter's 4th birthday. After setting it up for her to see, we could not get it to fold correctly. The directions are impossible to follow. As a result, the tent now does not stand upright after being folded. There is no way to contact the manufacturer or get any other help with folding the tent. I feel quite foolish for having bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge, Fun, Pain in the butt to fold!","review":"This thing is a monster! So much fun with the characters, the windows, the swinging door, and the \\"doggy\\" door. ;) The colors are bright and the set up simple!ONLY problem is the fold up... Grrrrrr! It took me 3 days to finally get it! I went to the website and found some videos on set up, only I dragged the mouse and watched them backwards because the written directions are useless. It still is not easy, in fact I would only recommend this tent if you can leave it set up full time or if you have some where to store it flat.Playhut [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fun, but be aware!!!!!","review":"When my three year old daughter came home and saw this set up, she was so excited!!! We spend a lot of time in this tent, and it is great for developing imaginations. I also like the fact that it is so easy to put up (took about 5 minutes the first time), and can also be easily folded up and put in the small duffle bag, which is included. However, there are a couple of issues with the way this tent is made. First, the hinged door doesn't fasten to the other side of the tent perfectly; I don't think it was sized correctly to do so. Secondly, after a week of play, some of the stiching is starting to come out of the tent, exposing the plastic \\"foundation\\" of the tent. Still, it is a great buy, especially considering plastic playhouses are upwards of $200 and more. An overall good buy, as long as the buyer is aware that it will probably only last six months to a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dora Explore Mega Tree House - I am returning it","review":"My kids absolutely love it, but my 4 year old daughter was heartbroken when I told we have to take it back. The folding is impossible. I have a nanny who worked with many playhut products and said they are really easy to fold once you know how. Well, we spent 45 minutes (not to mention the time I already wasted) trying to fold it and failed.As I have seen on another review. If you can leave this up the entire time, it is great. If you plan to store it, it is impossible.

It's hard to not interpret a positive HIV screen, followed by a positive Western blot, along with a low CD-4 and high viral load as anything but what it is.

There are millions of people who think HIV isn't a big problem in itself. The problem is that this opinion, and spreading it as 'scientific' has the potential to undercut teachings of safer sex. HIV causes AIDS, and AIDS kills people. Are there drugs out there that are dangerous, of course. Are some AIDS drugs dangerous, possibly. But is HIV/AIDS itself deadly, definently. So while anyone can give there opinion, it is irresponsible for this author to pass her's off as 'scientific'.

You present a meaningless bunch of theories that don't withstand scientific testing or even the mildest level of scrutiny.Christine Maggiore should be criminally charged for negligent homicide in the death of her daughter - a 3 year old toddler who needed her mother's love to rate higher than her mother's denial. Even in death, Eliza Jane's mother remains steadfastly convinced that HIV does not cause AIDS - yet the child was HIV positive and died from AIDS-related pneumonia. Thankfully, Ms. Maggiore has reached the age where she cannot produce more human beings whose only purpose will be to die horrible deaths over their mother's ignorance.Christine Maggiore is incapable of acknowledging that this book is a farce - even after the death of her own daughter. How many more innocent children have to die at the hands of obstinate parents too full of pride to save them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mother of HIV/AIDS Denialism","review":"If you really want to challenge the HIV/AIDS establishment, challenge the idea that it is cost prohibitive to provide care to people in the world that can't afford treatment. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation has a very high rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy. Here is their site: [...]What offends me so much about the denialists is their seeming belief that the rules that apply to the millions dying of HIV infection will not apply to them. Even Maggiore, with her very health lifestyle, succumbed to disease in about 15 years. A long time for an untreated HIV-positive person to live, but 52 years old is still too young to die. And 3-years-old, like her poor baby girl, is heartbreakingly too young."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author herself died of AIDS","review":"It needs to be recorded that the author died in December 2008. Her death certificate, available on the AIDS Truth website, records that she died of bilateral pneumonia, disseminated herpes virus infection and oral candidiasis. In an HIV-infected person such as the late author, these are AIDS-defining conditions. Moreover, her daughter died of AIDS at age 3. Hence after writing a book claiming that HIV is harmless, the author was killed by this deadly virus. That message needs to be understood by anyone thinking of believing any of the nonsense the book promotes. In life, the author was responsible for influencing the South African government to stop distributing life saving anti-retroviral drugs to HIV-infected pregnant women, thereby condemning thousands of unborn children to death. In death, she is the poster child for the lethal folly of the AIDS denialist movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Wrong","review":"The LA County Coroner reported the writer's daughter died of AIDS-related pneumonia a few months ago.

She makes me think of those people who still think the world is flat even or the Holocaust didn't happen. She'll learn her lesson soon when her husband gets HIV or her kids do.

So, if you have already finished Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire (I have and it's fantastic) and you haven't a clue as to what you will read to tide you over until Ms. Rowling publishes book number 5, read The Curse of the Blue Figurine...and all of the other wonderful books by John Bellairs.

It's not a matter of technical difficulties of course, but more \\"artistic\\" one. Howard simply doesn't know to sink in the deep darkness of Liszt late, gloomy masterpieces.

My only complaint is that the holes for the shelf supports aren't continuous from top to bottom, but instead there are gaps where the wood is solid.

With elements of jazz, Western swing, Latin rhythms and Parisian influences, the melodies have a sophisticated worldly appeal with emotional content. The various styles are connected by superb fiddling. A great mail order bargain, not generally available in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read, Full of Content","review":"This is a quick read with plenty of information. So many people misunderstand Nietzsche, probably because he set out to be misunderstood by people who would not read him in context. Nearly any sentence of his, when read in isolation, means something entirely different from what it means in context. Solomon sets out to correct some of the vast misconceptions readers have about Nietzsche."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time for serious philosophers","review":"This book is yet another work that is aimed at laymen with little or no philosophic knowledge. It comprimises Nietzsche's intensity, intent, and true form in every way possible. It tries to present a Nietzsche that is politically correct and fashionable that fits in with our current values and ideals. Unfortunately anybody who has really ever read Nietzsche knows that he was far from the kind of idea human being that our age likes to glorify. Nietzsche diagnosed his age as weak and decadent and probably would be even more harsh on our times. You can't make Nietzsche to be anything you want him to. He had definite ideas and was opposed to the current trend of anti-war, pro-democracy, and egalitarian ideals of this age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understand Nietzsche","review":"My first encounter with Friedrich was reading \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Being from a religious background, I had somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction to what I thought was a destructive and hateful philosophy. Nevertheless, something about Nietzsche fascinated me and I proceeded to investigate further. An avid Nietzsche fan recommended this book. My first reaction to any book that claims to know what someone else was really saying is skepticism. But, I bought the book anyway, and I came away from it with a much different opinion of Herr Nietzsche. While I don't agree with all his views, I can now see this man's brilliance and insight into the human condition. They say that Nietzsche is the most misunderstood of all philosophers. For me at least, this book helped diminish that misunderstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"A proof of the ignorance of modern man..","review":"This book is yet another proof that modern human beings may have gained great technological advancements but have lost a great deal of philosophical depth or even commonsense. It's such a shame to see a brilliant artistic philosophy such as that of Nietzsche completely butchered my people who are either ignorant to not read of all of this works, or perhaps they have a interest in defaming Nietzsche. Even a child could read Nietzsche and come to a better of understanding of his philosophy than what this book presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Nietzsche has been one of the most, if not the most, debated philosopher of the post modern era. He has been blamed for more than his share of social unrest and dismissed for more than his share of insight. He is a complex mind with an even more complex body of work. \\"What Nietzsche Really Said,\\" is a glossed over, overly sympathetic and simplistic understanding of Nietzsche's complex social, metaphysical and political critiques. I would only recomend this book for a young teenager who has never heard of Nietzsche or philosophy. The book is an easy read, which is fortunate because one is able to read roughly two to three pages per minute (any longer would simply cause frustration). The book lacks real critical insight into some of Nietzsche's major points, which is most problematic considering his aphoristic style. This is not an achademic text and at the very best, could be put into \\"Idiot's Guide to Nietzsche\\" or \\"Nietzsche for Dummies\\" format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"This book nicely tries to convince you that the authors have indeed found out what Nietzsche really thinks and they can present these ideas to you without the kind of bias that characterizes other works. How ironic! The fact is that they seem to not only present a more biased view, than even the nazis, they totally misrepresent his ideas. perhaps misrepresent is not an adequate word, I think they just totally misinterpret him. I could go into a lengthy discourse piece by piece about points they make that fail to capture Nietzsche's intentions. However that would be an obvious waste of time. There seem to be a number of people who have wrote reviews here who think this is a far less than adequate book of Nietzsche's philosophy. All I can ask you to do is don't make the mistake of assuming that just because someone can write a book on something that they understand the subject even in the slightest. It is an unfortunate truth but alas it is all too true."},{"rating":"1","title":"what professors of philosophy do to philosophy","review":"This book aims to help readers understand Nietzsche but what it does is to make you hate philosophy, or at least philosophy professors. They kill the spirit with the arid letter of the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic and energetic","review":"Though I think it's too early to coronate \\"Grand National\\" as the best effort by the John Butler Trio, I think one could argue that it is their most consistently musical effort to date. Augmenting John Butler's whiplash playing of his acoustic guitars with a fuller array of instruments layers the band's sound, and his trio mates really step up as well.Sometimes the marriage of rock \`n roll and social and environmental injustices either smacks of self-righteousness or ceases to be graceful and fluid. For the most part, Mr. Butler sidesteps those hindrances yet he does stumble a bit on the awkward, even embarrassing second track Daniella.But it's pretty easy to put those sorts of moments in the rearview mirror when the JBT hits full throttle on Funky Tonight, the kind of song that energizes the inner whirling dervish in us all.If I were to sum it up in two words, I would offer eclectic and energetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Outstanding","review":"I haven't heard an album this well done in a long long long time. I agree with the previous poster that it is eclectic, but at the same time very tastefully done. My only conclusion as to why this trio is not huge in the US is only because they're about to be. The music talent in this band is in the top 95th percentile of all living music artists, in my opinion. Buy the album, you're gonna love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Butler Trio's Grand National is wonderful","review":"I love JBT's sound and their lyrics are creative and evocative.

Wait, I meant really extremly salty Jerky. My biggest disappointment was that the author didn't make that clear, she only included a small note in the front like \\"some people choose to use low sodium soy sauce\\".

It's just a straight reprint of the overpriced TPBs.The best of the three stories was Grinning Man, and only because it offended me the least.

The stories held none of the psychological depth and sinister subtlety fans expect from the SH series. All three tales contained no real connection to SH, though they obviously tried. Familiar denizens gave cameo appearances, however, one of the recurring monsters looked more like a creature from \\"The Suffering.\\"I originally bought Volume 2 because of its price compared to the three stand alone novels, in addition to my being a fan of the games. I'm glad I didn't waste any more money than necessary. If I knew then what a disappointment these stories were, I would've saved my cash.I strongly recommend SH fans to pass on this book.

This game wasn't what I expected at all. The controls are extremely clunky. You have to be in a particular spot to pick up an object, and it's way too easy to stand on top of it instead. Trying to pull off moves seems random at times, with the game favoring the enemy as far as timing goes.The story is nearly nonexistent. \\"So-and-so is at the bridge, go stop him from damaging it.\\" Why even bother? And what's the point of unlocking characters if you don't get to choose who you can play as?

It struck me as I read them that everyone who is deeply serious about the spiritual life needs a Baron Von Hugel! I thought it would be difficult to find out more about him, but this fantastic book (really a complete life-and-work study) fits the bill. It covers Von Hugel's biography and how his life as a lay scholar, a husband, and a father affected his Catholic theology. It covers his famous three elements of religion: \\"the authoritative, historical, institutional; the critical, speculative, philosophical; the intuitive, vocational, mystical\\" and how every mature spiritual life requires all three elements. This book definitely proves how his spirituality and leadership remain highly relevant for us today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but too Delitcate","review":"I bought this item as a holiday gift.

Just don't rush it.I really like the handle on the decanter - makes pouring particularly easy. And the price is great. The biggest problem I have is that after pouring, 1 drop of wine always dribbles down the outside of the decanter. Don't know if other decanters have this problem. Also, you should try to find a way to invert it after washing to dry out so it doesn't leave any minerals in the bottom.OK, back to a deliciously jammy Zin breathing away in my duck."},{"rating":"2","title":"test engine very helpful","review":"This book explains all the objectives Prosoft has on their web site for the Foundations exam, plus a few others that are on the test but not specifically listed. It's very easy to understand and does a great job at detailing all the important concepts on the exam. The thing I like most is the test engine that comes on the CD. I took at least 4 sample tests and got new questions each time. I think the best way to get yourself ready for the test is to take practice exams and this one must have a lot of questions on the CD so you can take it over and over. It also lists a lot of good exam preparation sites that have good sample tests.Since I was on a really tight budget when I decided to take this test (and the test costs 125 dollars!) I got this book because it was one of the cheapest ones. Even at this price, it did the trick.

I will add that you may want to find supplemental information off the Internet. The author offers a broad overview of network architecture, security, HTML authoring and Internet fundamentals with occasional detailed looks on certain topics. By books end, you should be ready (or close to it) to pass the Foundations exam.

He tells his story with both toughness and compassion, the same traits that saved him during his neglected childhood and rocky adulthood. By the end of the book (before the epilogue, which relates his perspective of the events of September 11 in harrowing detail), I felt happy for him that he had learned to reconcile his troubled emotions over his past with maturity, dignity, and bravery.If this book has a weak point (other than at-times inconsistently-toned writing), it is that he sometimes indulges in tooting his own horn a little too often.

Minus the models, the book isn't much good. The so-called easy exotic recipes are not easy to make. The recipes are somewhat complicated to follow, take a long time to make and require many different ingrediants. When you're all done, you can count colories and find out they aren't very low-fat afterall.Even the Provencale Tomato Potato Stew is very time consuming. The final results are good tasting dishes, but they're not fat free. And the mojority of them are not done in 30 minutes the this book claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Padma's Kitchen","review":"Padma herself had given this book to an ex boyfriend of mine (who kept it)and I have been dying to find it ever since.

The recipes aren't that difficult and the Indian ones which are her specialty are the best in the book. For people who aren't the best cooks but want to make some decent Indian dishes, Padma's book is pretty good for that. If I had a dollar for every time she mentions Daniel and her mom, I would be a millionaire...and I could have done without the narratives that are so shallow that you know that they came from the mind of a model. For example, \\"there I was in a beautiful Chanel gown eating a tuna fish sandwich.\\" Someone please tell Padma her village called, apparently their model is missing. One more thing, all her recipes are available on the food network website FOR FREE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy to use and delicious recipes!","review":"Thank Padma for this book - if you are dieting and looking for delicious recipes that aren't bland \\"diet foods\\" then this book is exactly what you are looking for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the pictures were great, the low-fat recipes were not","review":"The recipes in this book are somewhat of a task.

My first comment when I made a call was that this was the worst sounding phone I'd ever picked up. It's got a tiny little speaker, and although the audio is crystal clear, the tonal quality is very poor in my opinion.The phone has got \\"Voice Enhancer.\\" I've never had a phone that needed voice enhancement. The engineers knew this phone needed it. Only if they were competant enough to design in decent audio, they would have done that in the first place. They screwed up the audio and turned it over to marketing.

The message indicator light works randomly - replaced system once; appears that the phone has to hear the dial tone to understand the message has been retrieved (each individual hand set); Sound quality is poor on handset - often told people can't hear me and volume is at max.Ergonomics of it - love it; Do note that there is no information screen on the base unit - you can't see caller ID nor the number you are dialing - there jsut isnt' a screen - room for one? but they didn't put it in?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Worked ok at first...The range was disappointing but they worked ok until the caller ID quit working just after the warantee expired.

However, slowly over the course of 2 months the signal began to degrade and the ability to speak and listen clearly through all of the handsets degraded to an almost inaudible level.We tried to analyze this signal problem against the bandwidths of any other cordless devices in the house, but couldn't find another culprit.We have a great 900Mhz Panasonic that will probably never die, but from my persepctive and other frustrated owners that I know, the new generation seems less robust and prone to technical issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient set up, overall a great product","review":"First time using a multi-handset system, I was a little skeptical of sound quality at first. Having used this product for quite some time now, I must say I am very happy with the overall quality of this item. Perhaps the only thing I would change in the device is the \\"Missed Call\\" message appearing on each handset that is not used to answer a call (even though the call was answered on another handset). Minor issue, other than that a fantastic product. Would certainly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice phone set!!!","review":"I can highly recommend this phone set! The sound quality is excellent. Battery life is excellent. Also there are some neat features like custom ringtones for family/friend callers and phone book copying between the handsets.

I have never had one reception problem. And it's great for when the kids are down there with their friends, because when I need to call for them upstairs,or tell them turn the noise down, I just use the intercom on the phone which works everytime!

I can't wait to get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"We now have a phone in every room!Sounds clear, feels good against the face and each handset is numbered so you don't mix them up. The range is good. I can walk atleast 200' away from my house and still have a signal! Could be more, never went any further.Only \\"peeve\\" is it keeps ALL phone calls listed on each handset and needs to be erased on each one as well. If you don't, one or all of your handsets will have 147 calls on it! Luckally, you can erase ALL calls with just 2 buttons pushed but you have to go around to each phone to do it.My favorite feature is being able to call any one of the handsets in the house. Really comes in handy with kids! I just press in the Handset # belonging to the phone I want to call and I can get the kids attention without yelling! :-) (Much!)All in all, a good purchase and would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Six Months: Persistent Complaint","review":"I have had this phone for over six months and I agree with much positive that has been said. The sound that I hear when others speak if very strong, but over time I have had to change phones (to a non-cordless) countless times when people have said they could not hear me or that I should \\"speak up.\\" When I do change phones, the response is that it is \\"much better!\\" I know that cordless and corded have different technologies, but one should not need to shout into a phone, ever. There are several settings on this Panasonic that make what I hear crisp, boosted, \\"improved,\\" but nothing to help others hear me (I speak to groups every day for my work and my voice is good).

The one's we liked were so expensive and we did not want to settle for a cheap phone with limited features. We are very satisfied with this phone. More than anything, we have a phone in almost every room. When I was reading the reviews for this phone before I made my buying decision, I really thought that whatever people said about the voice quality may be true. Most people had complaints about the voice quality, but I think it is awesome.

Absolutely Wonderful","review":"I started using Panasonic phones when I purchased my 2.4ghz phone from a local store. I recently moved to a new house and decided to upgrade my phone system. So, I bought this phone set. It has crystal clear quality. I agree with everything that elviswoman from Dallas, TX wrote about these phones. My biggest fear with these phones compared to the 2.4ghz phones is their durability. The 2.4ghz were rock solid phones and you could feel how sturdy they are. With the newer 5.8ghz phones, I can tell that Panasonic is either using a new high-quality light weight plastic or they decided not to put as much protection around the casing of the phone. It is much lighter than my old phone, but definately not as light as one of the $20 5.8ghz phones.I love Panasonic phones and would by several more of this model of phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume Loss","review":"Have owned this unit for over a year.

On the product description it clearly stated that you had to have the phone service for this (which I do) and it would show on each phone that a message was waiting. I even contaced Panasonic and all I ever got from them was that the phone did not show a voice mail message. They were missing the point, I found out that it did not show a voice mail, but they advertised that it did. They would never admit that their description was in error. I don't like to deal with companies that will not admit that they made an error. I would not recommend Panasonic products for that reason. I would say if you ever had a problem with the product they probably wouldn't admit it was a product fault.

This phone is missing two important features that most phones in this price range have: Speaker phone on the base-unit, and beltclips for the handsets.Because I am not diligent about putting the phone back on the base, I ocassionally stumble over myself to find a handset when the phone rings. I loved the base-unit speaker phone feature on my former phones, and bought this because I thought it had it, but it doesn't. Additionally, I bought the headset, but there are no beltclips to clip the phone to yourself. Blah. Not a good phone unless you always wear shirts with front pockets (who does that?). I thought I did good research before my purchase, but I may have overlooked these two important features.

You can call one handset from another which is nice.

Phone book has nothing in common with those of the cell phones, which makes it a bit difficult to get used to navigation techniques3.

There is a light on the antenna that lights up when it rings and you can change the color from clear to red to green. Also, it comes with several rings to choose from, in a variety of tones.

It's obvious that Lusk has spent time in the military, as he actually has clue one what combat is really like, and what it takes in the way of both people and machines to fight a war. A must read book for anyone who enjoys military sci-fi, or just a good war story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"You say: a profound examination of gender politics deftly woven into a farce of German society, with interesting use of food politics as a metaphor.I say: an unnecessarily abstruse novel about one man's obsession with potatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movies for ANYONE","review":"The Hulk as a gay movie? Hmmmm...wait until those Greek lawyers get a whiff of that. Maybe The Hulk isn't gay per se, but the transformation he undergoes (personally I think Howard Dean is The Hulk in disguise) is something everyone can relate to, gay or straight. I love the way each of these movies, from Mommie Dearest to Norma Rae to All About Eve, can reflect pivotal points in our lives. I also appreciate that Jason Bergund, one-half of the real-life \\"Will & Grace\\" team that wrote this book, comes out in favor of social responsibility attacking \\"Queer as Folk\\" for only portraying the seamy underbelly of gay life (anonymous sex, drug abuse and endless clubbing aren't something to aspire to in any group).

The folder is well made but poorly designed. It's fine for carrying music around, but very clumsy as a performance folder. The worst problem is that there's no way to secure music while singing-- no binder rings, clips, or elastic bands. There are 2 large pockets, but the bulky flaps keep music from lying flat while you're reading it from the folder. The folder is large, maybe too large for people with small hands who need one hand to hold the music in the folder.On the plus side, the customer service from Musician's Friend was outstanding. The package was shipped securely and arrived quickly. The company was very responsive to my issues with the design and offered a prompt refund.

Each picture shows enough detail to easily follow and the carving steps are frequent enough so there isn't any wondering how he moved from the previous step. Pete emphasizes the importance of carving the head, since the most engaging feature of a caricature is the face. I have most of Pete's books and would recommend them all. If you are a beginning carver (as I am) or an experienced carver looking to try something different, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Offering from Mr. LeClair","review":"Mr. Leclair again delivers an instructional book that is among the best I have ever purchased. The photographs are clear and detail each step in the carving process. The only critisism I have for this book is that he devotes most of the book to carving the head, and not so much to carving the body of the figure. Having already written the definitive work on carving heads (Carving Caricature Heads and Faces), I would have liked to see more attention given to the rest of the figure. There is a gallery of finished figures included, but no patterns are included i this volume. Highly reccomended to the novice carver, and I know that the experienced craftsman will also benefit from this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I am duplicating this review and the other Pete LeClair book I purchased (Carving Caricature Head and Faces) as they are both excellent.The books stand out from a lot of carving books by the quality of the photography and the care and attention to the step by step instruction.

It was painstaking to read and I could not wait to finally finish it; the only reason I read the entire book was that it was required. The one assertion made by Harris that I found inspirational can be found in the introduction, it is the quote from Acts 2:42, 44-47 which she labels as \\"the first portrait of church curriculum we have\\" (17). From that point on the book was a major let-down; it was nothing new under the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is *awesome*!!!","review":"The only reason this DVD set didn't get 5 stars is because the extras weren't as good as other Starburst sets.

Folky in part, jazzy in part, with lots of woodwind from recorder to saxophone, but NO Hammond organ or mellotron, the overall sound is of a quirky, intelligent, blackly humorous denizen of the abyss that lies between Steeleye Span or Jethro Tull and King Crimson or Van Der Graaf Generator. The opener, \\"Soldier\\", oscillates between prettily lyrical and rampagingly angry, and is a great anti-war anthem. The rest of the album ranges from almost poppy (\\"Same Dreams\\") to spooky (\\"Lady Lake\\") to elegiac (\\"Dog\\") to the boisterous \\"Social Embarrassment\\". Due to the Goldring twins' discovering continued interest in the band on the WWW, they reformed in 1999 and recorded a new album \\"Gnosis\\", as well as re-releasing the back catalogue including 'Lady Lake\\".

The slightly less good news is that the tenth symphony of 1988 is undoubtedly more difficult than his earlier ones. Having said that, it is well worth the effort to get to know, and with familiarity will come a deep admiration for an amazing and thrilling work.It is a huge piece of almost an hour in traditional four movement form. The notes in the Hyperion CD are very helpful with a full musical analysis (increasingly rare these days). Or you can sit back and be swept along by the forces that are typical of Simpson's symphonies - exciting and powerful.As with the other recordings in the Hyperion cycle of Simpson symphonies, Vernon Handley and the Royal Liverpool Symphony Orchestra play together brilliantly and the recording quality is second to none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Climbing High","review":"Simmons has long been a defender of a concept that has recently been left by the wayside; education.

Most of them received an education in the classics and look what they produced. How many politicians today could accomplish the same thing? Perhaps, just perhaps, study of the classics has more merit than previously thought.

It's extremely tedious.Also -- with regard to story and characters -- I found them uninteresting and kind of lame. If you want a great game with lots of humor, sick and twisted characters, fun action play and great animation then get MEDIEVIL RESURECTION -- if only they would make more like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title","review":"It's a little too hard and what's worse is that you can't save your progress during levels. You get 4 continues and you need to pass the whole level from start to finish with those 4 or it's game over and you start the level from the begining. Of course this gets frustrating. The biggest fault in the gameplay is the camera. Sometimes you need to be messing with the camera to get the right angle so you can jump onto a platform without falling into lava, but it's impossible to get a good camera view. Using your Grim Reaper knife to jump from hook to hook is also a nightmare.The best way I found to attack most levels was to move foward slowly and shoot at enemies from a far. Overall it's not a bad game and some could actually find it more challanging than frustrating. Nothing like the thrill of old days when you came down to your final life and you had to come through or all your work was for nothing. I recommend you try it but it could of been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Danny Thomas & Peggy Lee Movie","review":"This is an excellent movie with great singing and acting.

Ride The Ride is cool and probably my favorite song on this CD. But the rest??? The girls harmonize as great as ever, but almost all of these songs are lackluster and lifeless. Where's the rock??? I optimistically bought this back in 2003 and listened to it many times trying to like it, hoping it would grow on me, but it didn't happen. I find most of these songs almost painful to listen to, especially Single By Choice, which gets my vote for the worst Bangles song ever. It wasn't worth the 15 year wait since Everything, their last album before breaking up in 1989. Hopefully if the ladies try it again they will rock a little harder. Check out Susanna's 1996 solo CD - it rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturity Brings Perfection","review":"Out of all the 80's groups, I always felt The Bangles were a genuinely talented REAL band. This new album demonstrates how with time a good band has evolved to a great band. Being a Beatles and Beach Boys fan, I deeply appreciate the complex harmonies these ladies have. Their songwriting is top notch.And they actually play their own instruments, with real craftmanship.I just hope this album doe well enough, so we can here more from them in the near future and hopefully see them tour in Upstate NY."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a WOW Revolution!!!","review":"Saw this CD quite by accident, and purchased the enhanced version with the extra DVD. Wow- I was blown away by the first song, and couldn't get past it for 30 minutes. The girls are back, and in full force and form. Nice they reached out to other songwriters, including Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go's for \\"Something That You Said,\\" while \\"Ride the Ride\\" is the quintessential summer cruise-along-song."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Opposite of Interesting","review":"I'll go against the grain here: In my opinion \\"Everything\\" is the band's best album to date. It pushed their musicianship, writing, and arranging to a new place. It was interesting in that it WASN'T the same sound.That same sound, unfortunately, IS what we have with \\"Doll Revolution\\". Most of the album is mid-tempo, and probably could easily be done live as a medley. The vocals and harmonies are EXACTLY what one would expect (with some small exceptions) and are so predicable, and uninspired that it made me sad.As talented artists, with a lot of time on their hands between Bangle releases, I would really have liked to have heard some interesting music that reflected some growth during their absence. Yes, I agree that the lyrical themes are more mature (in some, but not all cases), but musically, this is not anything interesting, in fact, the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Susanna Hoffs","review":"Doll Revolution has one major flaw. Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals. (I love to hear her sing.) If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more. While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here. The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals. It's just that simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"just kinda there","review":"when the Bangles first came out in the 80's that had a cool vibe about them.they were if you will a Poor Maid's version of the Go-Go Girls.and over time they never quite shook that tag.the Bangles never wrote songs that took off was the big knock against them then&still.some of the Instrumentation is alright in spots but Vocally not much has changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Revolution","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD. I was looking so forward to its release. I love female singers and female groups, not the fluff of that Spears girl and such. I like real artists. I loved the Bangles earlier releases. What happened here and where is the revolution? So goes another year in music without a standout CD for me to savor. I was counting on the Bangles to save this year in music for me as the Go-Go's did in 2001 with the release of their CD. Please female artists out there give me something to sink my teeth in to. I am in need of good new music. I am so tired of having to listen to the same CDs over and over because of the lack of good music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Bangles album ever!!!!","review":"This is by far the best Bangles album to date and will be my personal favorite for years to come. There's not a single song I don't like. The girls are very talented and harmonize better than almost any group. One minor criticism is that a couple songs are a little long but that's OK. It has just enough songs and style to satisfy any musical taste. Get it while you can!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the BANGLES are back!!!!","review":"the songs in this new album are really good specially \\"something that you said\\" and \\"ask me know questions\\". after almost a decade of being separated they still can really make good music. it is woth buying it take it from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!!!","review":"These women HAVE IT!! It's as plain and simple as that. I've liked a few things that The Bangles have done in the past -- \\"Manic Monday,\\" of course, and \\"If She Knew What She Wants\\" -- so when I'd read that this new album was coming out by Susannah and Co., I immediately thought, \\"Okay, cool! More of those groovy harmonies and also some killer riffs from Ms. Peterson!\\" Man, was I ever surprised at the *emotional professionalism* of this new release!!Each song reaches right out and grabs you with a certain \\"Listen to this!\\" feel to them. You can't help but obey.Susannah, you and the rest of The Bangles have done it again!! I'm so proud to be hooked into your songwriting talents as a longtime fan and can only end this review with a simple --Job well done, indeed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bangling Now","review":"The Bangles are back with some great music! I don't think they ever wanted to be more than they are on this CD, just rocking and ballading the way most of their non-hit songs did, so there is nothing novel here. They look and sound great on their sincere Elvis Costello cover (Doll Revolution) and on their own material. The bad thing is they waited and waited to release this CD in the U.S. although it was completely ready by May 2002, and their handling is awful, both distribution and touring. Where are they? They only do a handful of appearances in little places, and other countries. Further, this Australian version of the CD does NOT have the two bonus tracks at the end. They are on the Japanese version. The U.S. version to be released in Sept. 2003 also will not have the bonus tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banglefans can rejoice...","review":"You can relax. This is the \\"real deal\\" if you're a fan of the Banglesfrom the 80's. The album is similar in flavor to \\"Everything\\" andsort of picks up where that album left off, but also takes it to thenext level, so to speak. The quality of the songwriting andproduction is top-notch. The Gurls' vocal harmonizing andmusicianship have never been better.The only real criticism I have is that I'm not sure how much of anaudience this CD will attract. How many people have a burning desireto hear music tinged with 60's nostalgia and minor-chord melancholy,yet at the same time focused through the lens of the 80's? Nomatter, it's still an excellent CD and fans will be pleased, myselfincluded. The only other question is why is this only available as animport?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A melodramatic waste of time....","review":"I don't necessarily feel compelled to write reviews of books, b/c I feel to each his own. But in exceptional circumstances, I don't want people to suffer like I did while reading this book. Usually I steer clear of the stereotypical 'chick lit' movement, mostly because I think these books completely belittle the female intellect. However, I decided to test out this book b/c a friend suggested it. (This friend has a lot of explaining to do.) The premise and plot are extremely implausible and filled w/ trite prose on lessons of love and life. The main character mistakenly is told she only has 1 year to live so she steals 2 million dollars, moves to Hollywood, loses a mass amount of weight and falls in love with the pool man.

Skip was a wonderful character and a man I wish I had! The maturity that Charlotte \\"Blossom\\" shows is immense and allows you to possibly see a little bit of yourself in her. She broke away from the pack as a character allbeit a bit unrealistic but none the less a good read. Some chapters I thought could probably have been taken out.

This was not a good book.","review":"I expected, from its description and some of the reviews, something light and fun - a beach-read. And while the plot was certainly ridiculous enough to qualify and there were a few parts that sort of made me chuckle, there was something inherently alienating, off-putting about the whole book. The way the book was written, its \\"style\\" (if you could really call it that), made it seem like watching fish act out a story through thick aquarium glass that had never been cleaned. You could snatch glimpses of something real, but you could never actually connect with any of the characters through the dirty glass of her words. Her most realistic creations were the dogs...

She takes advantage of living by a pool and begins swimming every night. She meets the handsome pool man and falls in love. From then on it's a wild ride with Charlotte living her dream life while the officials in New Hampshire are in hot pursuit.

I had a weak cable signal from the wall (some of the channels were fuzzy) and solved that with a $20 in-line cable booster. This system integrates very will with a Mac and Mac applications (e.g., Toast 6.0, Quicktime, etc.); it's operation is intuitive.

The terminology is precisely defined (a big plus for books of this type, where the authors often irrationally assume the reader is an expert). My only complaint is that the \`how to' sections are sketchy at best. There is an emphasis on joinery \`by hand', but in the real world everybody does these things with a router or table saw and an assortment of jigs. So, don't expect that this book will be the definitive story on the \`how to' side of joinery, but it most definitely will open your eyes as to what is possible.

Not just another \\"insert conventional wisdom here\\" carbon copy quote. It briefly covers tools, layout and marking and wood movement. Then it talks about the joints themselves, the stresses on the joints and how to make them.Unlike some books, it gives you more then one way to make a joint. There are guidelines for hand work, power tools and machinery. But you never find yourself having to buy a new tool just to make a joint that's been around a few hundred years.Lastly the book has a section for choosing joints.The down side is some instructions are not as clear as they should be.

Set in a near-future where full-scale motion holography is not only possible, but indistinguishable from reality, Dream Park engages you in the characters within the fantasy game and who they are in their normal lives. It's fantasy, thriller, and murder mystery all in one.Read it when it first came out. Liked it then, like it now. A good, fast-paced read, as Niven's work usually is, and the collaboration of Niven and Barnes makes this a truly enthralling novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a very complex book, and fun to read!","review":"I thought that it was interesting the way the book was a mystery and sci-fi novel in one. Most authors have one or the other, but this book works out quite well.Many unexpected things pop up in this book, which makes it hard to put down.

I even own (and like) the Dreampark RPG.In fact, I was eager to find this in paperback, because a lot of people seem to rate it highly both as adventure fiction and for its portrayal of role playing and roleplayers.I was severely disappointed. The characters are pretty wooden, and the world itself is pretty unconvincing. The authors try to convince us that the \\"Game\\" is a big thing, carrying huge monetary gains for TV rights and novelization, but I really fail to see how public could really be interested in this.The attempts to make us sympathize with the players and seeing how they are so engrossed in it to actually care more for the game itself than the rest of the world are pretty unconvincing, too, and the story seems flat and forced in more than a place.Characters' psychology is probably not a forte for Niven, but unfortunately all the SFX razzle dazzle fail to carry the story... just like an Hollywood action film, in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK","review":"I believe it speeds up connection.

As the MicroCell is a new product & the HBB1 is a few years old (2006?), it's not surprising that it does not accommodate the MicroCell kindly... In short, while everything else on my network seemed to run well, the MicroCell would not & since that's my business line, it is useless to me.

Each album is different from the last with no 2 being alike. Mold is no exception. Gone are the classic members Bootsy, Bernie, Brain Yamatsuka, and Buckethead(the reason I like Praxis). Instead what we have here is Bil Laswell and a team of people Ive never heard of, playing techno music. Not the dance techno, electronic is a better description. Fans of Transmutation and Metatron may want to leave this one off their lists. This one is more like 1984 completed and a little bit of Warsazwa. NO SHRED HERE! NO PHAT BRAIN BEATS OR BOOTSY LICKS! The two stars are for the tracks Electric Soil and Sqlxzm which are the only standouts from the 2 times Ive listened to this cd since i bought it Friday (its monday now). Electric Soil is part of a qoute from Beethoven so it has a beethoven feel. With my Prtaxisw collection almost complete I am glad to have this but money could be much better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant weird electronics","review":"Those hoping for Buckethead will be disappointed, but this one is gem.

This self-titled album by an entirely forgotten one-album band contains the original version of the beautiful ballad 'No More \\"I Love You's\\"', which was covered wonderfully and to great success by Annie Lennox in 1995 and released as a single, as well as part of her covers-only second album, Medusa, immediately becoming her biggest hit as a solo artist. The original version is quite similar to Annie's version, but not quite as emotionally poignant, and sung by a man. Since I've never heard anything else by The Lover Speaks I'm not able to recommend it or not, but to the best of my knowledge, this track is the only thing worth remembering about them. If you're a huge Annie Lennox fan and would like to hear the original song, you might want to seek this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick-up_rake","review":"First the rake came incomplete.

Mitsuko Ichida has written the liner-notes and they are very informative and well-written indeed.

I would highly recommend this book as an introduction to the very interesting story of US involvement in Bolivia.

But enough of her; Of course, seeing Richard and Nina finally get married made me glad; Of course, they were some twists to the story with Gracie's divorce and downfall, as well as Nathan trying to adjust from his mother's passing; Estelle and Justine was only mentioned in passing and that was only because of Nathan's as well as another surprising twist; Won't spoil it for those who didn't read it; But a worthwhile read; Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent service/product","review":"Received the unit much sooner than promised.

I plan to go to Kohls and buy a Black & Decker toaster oven for $20, the fact that this company is charging $70 for this P.O.S. is a joke. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this product! Trust me, you will be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd buy it again","review":"Better design than most other toaster ovens I've had, but the beep at the end of cooking is too loud and annoying.

To make toast, you will need to press 3 buttons at least (mode twice, then start) that will each cause a beep, and then multiple beeps when it is done. Plus additional beeps for each time you want to change the toast color. Setting something to cook for X minutes at X degrees is likely a dozen plus beeps.The beep would be annoying to me, but it scares my dog who runs upstairs and hides in a shower stall (I am not kidding). So for Christmas he will be getting a new quiet toaster oven, probably a Krupps..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How misleading!","review":"I read all of the customer reviews before purchasing this toaster oven-by the way- why should \\"elderly\\" people have a problem with this oven? I felt satisfied that I would be getting a quality product. Much to my surprise, after unpacking all the stuff, I found that 1) the broiler pan/rack cannot be washed in the dishwasher; 2) oven temps can only be regulated in 50-degree increments: a real problem if you want to cook at other temps not supported. And the end-of-cycle beep is awful! I kept the oven overnight and returned it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious","review":"We love Toaster Ovens, but NOT this one. It looks great in our kitchen, and the digital part of it is cool, but it's going back to the store immediately. I was upstairs when my husband plugged it in the night we bought it, and I heard it. He stopped \\"playing\\" with it in fear it would wake up the babies. Everytime you push a button (or plug it in for that matter) it beeps, not just when it's done toasting. The high pitch tone may not be fun for those with hearing aids. I cannot tell you how well it performs, because the noise irritates us so much, we have not used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Toaster but one of the elements is already broken","review":"We got this about a year ago and it was okay. Better than most Black and Deckers but not great. The interface is a bit confusing and the toasting and broiling is not good (but not bad either) and has been getting progressively worse. Tater Tots should not take 40 minutes! Well last night it happened, the upper (back) element has failed to light and it appears that it is broken. We had this for less than a year and this is a big disappointment. Save your money and try to find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated and slow to toast, yet burns things!","review":"This oven stinks. The controls are too complicated. I shouldn't have to remind my mom every time she visits how to use it! It's not logical at all.TOASTING: It takes an eternity to toast anything, esp. frozen waffles. It does not automatically shut off when toasting is done.BAKING: The oven only sets in 50 degree increments (350, 400, 450, etc.) I think the temp must run high because I burn things on a regular basis. Plus, you cannot turn the oven on without setting the timer first. So to pre-heat, you have to set the timer to some random number.I essentially have given up using the oven function and only use it to toast.I cannot begin to decribe I how much I hate this expensive piece of junk.

Side note: I also did this a couple of years ago for my niece's guitar; which made it sound great. Thus my decision to try them again on my guitar....glad I did. These strings sound fantasic; more of a bright sound than warm. They seem to provide longer sustain vs. D'Addarrio (which I ususally prefer). It has been about 3 weeks now since installing them & these strings are holding good tune, no wear or oxidization. Not quite as warm like a folk string, or loud like some phosphor bronze strings...but they sound & feel great just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent but lasts only a week","review":"bright sounding, clear and aggressive tone. too bad it only stays bright for a week.

In addition, the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends - the middle disks, since they are inset from the top, never reach the hair. I had to return this item, and I would not trust or recommend ANY item by Emjoi. Extremely poor quality, and does not work as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"why did I wait soooo long?!?","review":"It is a torture when you first begin but the end effects are well worth it. I took lots of breaks which helped, but they were small breaks. After awhile your body doesn't react to the pain the same way so it does go faster. For me it's well worth it. Good Luck to other newbies :DOh and don't forget to keep the skin tight or it will hurt more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"I have used epilators for a long time and bought this when mine broke down after 10years. Thought i tried this since its cheap. My first comment is that it does the job but it takes a long time. Maybe its due to the number of tweezers on the head / the tweezers are quite far apart. I would have to run through the section a couple of times to get the hair out. I also have to do it very slowly so that i dont miss the hair. I have also tried moving it from left to right to increase the chances of the hair being grabbed. Overall, its quite inefficient, but i only do this every 3 weeks, so i can live with it. Not something i would recommend for regular users."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Purchase","review":"This is the first epilator I have purchased. I went with this one because it is reasonably priced and I didn't want to invest too much in a product I might not like. In the future, I will likely purchase one with more tweezers to speed things up, this one takes a long time to do my legs. And the battery doesn't last very long, so it really has to be used with the cord. But overall I'm quite pleased with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time consuming","review":"I bought this for my daughter, but having never used an epilator, I wanted to see what it's about. At first it does hurt a little, but you get over it pretty fast, depending on your tolerance. Make sure you read all the directions so that you use it correctly for best performance. It takes forever and no matter how long you're at it, it seems you can never get it all. By the time I got all the hair (over a several day period) it was growing back. To me, it seems a lot simpler and less time consuming to just shave your legs. Maybe a more expensive epilator would work better, maybe not, but I don't forsee myself using this for long..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"Never having used an epilator before, I wasn't sure quite what to expect.

That's probably the only good thing I can say about it. It pulls one hair in 20 and that's after going over it for 5 times. It doesn't hurt, I'm used to them, but it simply doesn't work like it's supposed to. I have one bought in Europe which does miracles, but it doesn't work on 110V.

I bought this one to replace it after the last one stopped working as well and this one is terrible. I guess you get what you pay for...This epilator is extremely weak, tugs at your skin and the top of it (the part with the tweezers) falls off easily. I would not recommend to buy this.

I used my mother's rmodel EO1200B oven and was very disappointed. Interior oven walls are made of aluminum not durastone enamel like other delonghi ovens. Aluminum inside oven impossible to clean. The wire rack can only be used one way. Other delonghi oven racks have 2 positions. Inside oven there are 2 positions/slots to put rack but bottom rack slot is too low to coils & will burn food. Pizza will fit in oven only if pizza is made \\"perfectly\\" to align with shape of back wall. Do not recommend this oven. Buy an older Delonghi ovens which are made much better.

I decided it was possible to remove the toast when the bell rang, shut the door, and not notice that the elements were heating up again. A DEFINITE FIRE HAZARD. I knew I could unplug the toaster immediately after every use, but I was afraid I or house guests might forget to take that precautionary, essential step.

This time the timer kept going and turned the knob to the right, which is the continuous cook option. It will burn everything if you don't stay right there with it.

If you like fast-paced games where running in with guns blazing (Belt-fed M249 - 150 rounds in a belt - oh yes) works just as well as standing back and sniping, this is the game for you.

It's extremely realistic, and your team (when you have one) actually makes intelligent chatter. The levels are easy enough so you don't get stuck forever, but hard enough so that it takes a couple of tries. I like how the enemies have almost as much health as you. I also like how you need to use some strategy instead of just running around shooting. Finally, being able to shoot anything and have a affect is really cool. There are only two small drawbacks. 1) The enemy is either deaf and blind, or really stupid. You can kill a person right next to another person, and if you have a silencer they won't even notice. 2) The game is very short and has no multiplayer, so rent it.

The guns are impressively rendered, but don't even kill the enemies 60% of the time - you have to unload an unreal amount of bullets into an enemy just to make them hop around on their foot. And the enemy spawn points are so ill-designed - you destroy a room completely with bullets and explosions and then an enemy comes from behind a box that survived the mayhem.

Well, sometimes its a one shot kill and other times it takes about five bullets.Don't bother trying to employ any sort of stealth or strategy as you move through each mission. Yeah you'll have a silenced weapon, but after having to shoot the same guy twelve times to kill him things usually turn into a massive firefight.The game can probably best be described as an A-Team style over-the-top ridiculous Vin Diesel action movie.

However, I really enjoyed this, as it was greatly detailed. The environments are amazing, the weapons do real damage, however some of the AI is nuts. You go from a sharpshooter, to someone who misses everything, by shooting the wrong way. I can forgive that, because its better then them all being sharpshooters, and them all being nuts and just shooting in some direction. They take cover, and know when to duck.

Visually, this game is fantastic, aurally, when piped through a surround set-up, this game is brilliant. You can actually place enemies by where the sound comes from over your home theater setup. The controls are respectable, and mostly intuitive, which is good, since the manual is so thin it might as well not have been included.The only thing I don't like are the cut-scenes at the beginning of each level - although the look and sound decent, they take way too long - keeping me from firing off hundreds of rounds against some semi-smart enemies in yet another smoothly rendered setting.Definitely, this game is a must-have for fans of the shoot 'em up genre, despite it being single-player only, and no online capability.

It's fun as far as blasting everything and everyone in sight for stress relief. The graphics are very well designed. However, I found the autosave feature to be crap. No matter how far you go in a level or how many check points you hit if you don't finish that level you MUST start the whole level over again later. I also wish they had allowed the ability to skip the live action interigation series that preceedes each level. Each time you play you are forced to sit through several minutes of talk that you've heard before and don't need to hear again.

I learned many things about any books of Jack and Annie Magic Tree House. I would have to say Jack and Annie are one of the best books I have read. Like the part when Annie got stuck in sticky mud.

It has helped me now and I am sure I will use it as a vital reference in a future pregnancy.It has shown me that there is always hope.In addition, the author suffered her own loss giving birth to her stillborn son on his due date so I think this book is a good read for anyone who has suffered a loss late in their pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and Comforting","review":"With the grace of God, we are healing from the loss of our daughter, Samantha.

She does a great job to give an objective view, giving several options you could address for different issues.

Regardless, they are all excellently played. The arrangements are imaginative, and the players are outstanding.

Lastly, when I went to power on the camera yesterday, it makes an awful noise, and then the screen blinks the canon logo, then goes black with an E18 error. I contacted Canon, and its not covered by warranty, and the repair will cost more than the camera did new. They claim that it was due improper use or mishandling.

While it promised to have far greater capabilities than my earlier AutoCad it is far too complicated to use without extensive training, but my main complaint is the fact that it is unstable.

This was the last time RCA Records managed to drag Elvis into a recording studio. Any albums released after this were either live albums, or they were recorded in a makeshift studio in Elvis' own house. Elvis had lost his love for recording at this point. He recorded the bare minimum number of songs required for this album, and did far less takes than he usually did. He used to be a perfectionist who would perform a song over and over until it was pefect, but by this point he would just perform a song a few times until it was \\"close enough\\". Despite that, the album is still pretty good. There isn't a bad song here, especially compared to some of the junk Elvis recorded for his film soundtracks. \\"T-R-O-U-B-L-E\\" is my personal favorite here, but all the songs have something to offer.

But through it all priscilla kept her cool in a way I never would have been able to in my day, and basically knowing that two wrongs don't make a right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sir Kay, High Seneschal of Britain...","review":"Kay is the focus of this marvelous book. \\"Exiled from Camelot\\" offers a fresh view of Sir Kay, Gawaine, and many other characters surrounding the round table. In fact, this book pulls from a tradition that falls far from Malorian cannon.In \\"Exiled\\" Arthur's son is brought to the courts of Camelot, where he hopes to be made heir to Aurthur's throne. The events that follow show the High King who are his most loyal retainers.The bulk of this story takes place outside of Camelot, and explores the personality of Sir Kay, High Seneschal of Britain. Through Kay the author, Cherith Baldry, shows how honor extends beyond the reach of ones sword.\\"Exiled From Camelot\\" is a dynamic and colorful tale that absorbs the reader, making them party to the hopes and fears of the stories characters.I will read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent adventure with some excellent highlights","review":"A decent, well-plotted adventure. I could have done without the overly emotional, inexplicably non-martial, and excessively abused Kay, but the story was good overall. The parts with Kay and the tenants of Meliant's manor were my favorites, and seemed to belong in a much better book. The verdict: While I much prefer Phyllis Ann Karr's bluff, sarcastic Kay, I'd still recommend Exiled from Camelot as a good adventure story with some truly moving chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Band of all time","review":"I've been a big fan of all types of music, and can list AC/DC, Depeche Mode, Alphaville, The Scorpions, Boston, Styx, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails as some of my favorites. I was gaining more interest in the underground synthpop scene a few years ago and bought a sampler CD that contained a single by Mesh. I was so stunned by one of their songs, that I was convinced to buy one of their albums immediately (which I NEVER DO). It turns out that I thought all of the songs were awesome... yet very different on each track. I wanted more, so I bought 2 more CD's within a couple of weeks. Now I have every album they have recorded, and I must say that this band has a great blend of what I like most... powerful vocals and lyrics, strong guitars and drums, with a bit of keyboards and melody to make it interesting. Try the song samples, and if you like what you hear you'll love the album. Once you've tried one, you'll want them ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great release by one of Britain's foremost electronic bands.","review":"In this place forever is bursting with elements of strength, emotion, and truth centered around the realities of life. Mesh achieves a sound very reminescent of its early synth rock heroes, yet revives the the music with a very modern approach. Harsh beats, haunting melodies, atmospheric synths, and melodic vocals make up the post rock sound of mesh. In this place forever sparkles with gems such as \\"Shatters, \\"You didn't want me\\", and \\"I don't think they know\\". Mesh recieves a four star rating for their pledge to keeping the synth scene happening and fresh. Also check out Mesh's single \\"Trust You\\" for a good reminder of what making great electronic music is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"mans battle with his inner self","review":"This was a very interesting read. Quite longer then I first anticipated but well worth it. You can sense the underlying physiology in this book that makes it the classic that it has become. The story is about a young student named Raskolnikov, who believes that sometimes murder needs to be accepted in order for the intellectual superiors to advance. He later learns the haunting reality of the inner conscience. The book tends to get confusing sometimes due to the many names the characters are referred to. Probably a book better enjoyed with multiple readings - but who has that much time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of a philosophical bent...","review":"From all the reviews, there is very little I can add to describe this masterpiece. This is just a suggestion. I have heard (though I have no idea if it's true, but it practically works all the same) that this novel was Dostoyevsky's response to Nietzche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" If so, he did a wonderful job. So, if one wishes to read Nietzche at some point, read \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" then directly follow it with this novel. It will be well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"A man kills two women with a hatchet. That's the center story of this book whose character's names are very easy to remember (take Rodion Romanovitch Raskolkinoff, for example, also known as Rodia, or Peter Petrovitch Looshin who is not the same person as Porphyrius Petrovitch). The author reflects the psychological implications of this murder in a very detailed way, although he could have done it in 200 pages less, with the same effect. In my opinion, the novel is too dull and too predictable and you get lost in names."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANK GOD IT'S FINISHED","review":"I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO KEEP READING THIS NOVEL. I ASSUMED THAT A NOVEL THAT HAD GOTTEN TO THE STATUS OF \\"CLASSIC\\" WOULD BE A TERRIFIC NOVEL. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. EVERY EXCITING PAGE IN THE BOOK WAS FOLLOWED BY 50 PAGES OF TEDIOUS NOTHING.

It takes a while to get through but the story of Raskolnikov stays with one.

What filthy things my heart is capable of.'\\" Indeed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime and Punishment (David McDuff translation)","review":"I purchased this e-book edition recently and am really enjoying it so far. I did a lot of research on the various translations of this book before I decided on this particular translation To me, it seems much more readable than the Constance Garnett translation, which is what you get if you get the free e-book version. It definitely seems to be worth the $8.65 purchase price, as the readability really improves the Dostoyevsky experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"My brother-in-law introduced us to Chuck Brodsky with this album. Since then we've purchased his two other albums and we were so excited about this young folksinger, that we travelled 300 miles for a moving coffeehouse performance. \\"Radio\\" (and for that matter the earlier \\"Letters in the Dirt\\") is a charming \\"first time listen\\", but we found ourselves replaying each song in order to understand each word and fully appreciate his wonderful poety.

It was excellent! From the insightful and slightly sentimental (Radio, Come Heres and Been Heres) to the humorous (On Christmas I Got Nothin') to the outrageous (Blow 'Em Away) to the athletic (Hockey Fight Song)--wait, did I say athletic?

Then it started to have problems. Firstly, it will not play half of the songs i copy on to it (this is without dropping it and using its piece of crap software). Secondly its friggin huge for a 1.5 Gig mp3 player. Thirdly nearly all the songs i copy onto it are not tagged right. fourthly the stupid thing uses playlists to copy. The list goes on and on and on. Oh and the customer support is also a piece of crap. The only reason I still have it is because it was a gift to me.

The humor is wonderful - very dry and surprising, the kind that makes you laugh out loud even if you're alone. The characters are well-developed, the puzzles are fairly open-ended, and the main Guy (his name is Guybrush, Guy for short) is dopey and exceedingly likeable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I've had to go online for a few hints when the puzzle got a little too obscure but real die-hards should be able to figure them out without the help. Not for kids, though, some of the humor would go right over their heads (or so you would hope)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the bunch","review":"\\"Escape From Monkey Island\\" has the distinction of being the very first PC game i ever played, and finished. From the very beginning, it draws you into it's wacky world of pirates (living and undead), and it keeps you glued to the PC until you've unlocked all the mysteries to be found. It's not the hardest game to master, but in all honesty...you stick with it because it's always entertaining and different. I've since played the other MI games, and this is by far the best one....it has just the right mixture of sarcastic humor, and unique puzzle solving. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful fun","review":"There's not much left to say about this one that hasn't been said before, but I'll add my vote to those who think this is a real treat. It's fun, not too difficult (and except for a few exceptions, the puzzles make at least a bit of sense), great graphics and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advancement to last \\"Monkey Island\\"","review":"This is a great game. To start, if you liked the last monkey island, you have to love this one. The diffirence between this and the last game, \\"The Cuse of Monkey Island, is, it's mainly in 3D with 2D backrounds, better story (plenty of laughs), and it's a great wrap up to it's preccedors. Yet it's worst downfall, is that the puzzles are almost impossible to solve alone. (I needed complete online assistance to beat it) And if you have a slow computer, you can't view the cinematic clips (it skips through the images) Also, make sure that you have a 3D acceleration card, or else the game won't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Record is a Classic","review":"I recently moved from NJ to VA so I gave away all my old \\"33's Long Play Albums\\" which included this one: \\"Comedia\\".

It has lots of good info, although it is a bit confusing at some points. I have gotten TONS of black hole stuff, but I think this is the best book on black holes for my age level. Black holes are an interesting subject, and I love studying them. They are a huge mystery, one of many in the universe. I think the most interesting fact I have found about Black Holes is that they can warp you to another universe. One of the reasons that I like to study them is because me and my partner, Cody, can make many predictions, such as if they actually DO warp you. This book basiclly has most of the info you need on Black Holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard as a rock! definitely not khol or crayon","review":"very disappointed in this product! Especially since the Mavala brand has a good reputation based on what I read before buying this product from Amazon.I use khol liners all the time on my inner lids. They are supposed to be somewhat soft, and easy to use for lining, both on your inner eyelid and around your eyes. I was looking for a green in addition to the black that I normally use. Most khol (kajal) products are black, so I was happy to find this green khol liner on amazon. But when I got it, it was very hard, and hard to use even as a regular pencil liner. I have to press hard to even draw a line on the back of my hand. Too bad - the green color is pretty. I am going to end up tossing it. I will not bother wasting money on the Mavala brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Don't waste your money. It is too small and the quality is lacking. I'm very disappointed.

I was skeptical that Texas could be as good, but I've gotten over it now. Audrey Auld pulls another incredible album out of her hat.

As a teenager, I read this book for school and fell in love with it. My parents and family were all union backers (teachers, firefighters, etc.), but I did not understand why we had unions. Then I read this book and ever since I have paid my union dues. Sinclair is an outstanding writer and I think everyone should read this book to understand where we have been and where we are now in labor. So read this book and cherish the life we have today."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless old edition with false advertising","review":"This \\"original\\" edition is not \\"better,\\" and \\"uncensored.\\" Sinclair made a number of changes of his own accord in the second, shorter publication. It does not mean this book was \\"censored.\\" It was never \\"censored\\" in the first place, as the publishers here claim it to be. It means that the original edition was changed so that it may better fit the format of a book. Buy the original edition if you must, because this edition is less focused, packed with more socialist propaganda and a few extra scenes that do not contribute to the novel or its message in anyway. Some character names are completely different, as well, leading to confusion when comparing the two editions. If you want a novel, don't buy this edition. Get this one only if you're interested in the original serial that was published before the novel came out, complete with typographical errors that were \\"purposely unedited\\" so that it may reflect the typos in the \\"uncensored\\" rough-draft."},{"rating":"2","title":"the anti-nostalgia pill","review":"This book is the perfect antidote to nostalgia for the \\"Good Old Days\\", portraying early 20th-century America as a hellhole of dirty food, infectious diseases, mean bosses, corrupt politics, poverty, and homelessness. Is it exaggerated? I'm sure it is (though probably less so than the suffocating cloud of nostalgia that other books and movies give us). Is it melodramatic? Heck yes. Are the last few chapters dull and propagandistic? Absolutely. Are the characters particularly memorable? Probably not. But despite its flaws, this book packs quite a punch (and its popularity suggests that readers of the time agreed!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but Flawed","review":"I appreciated the effort by Mr. Sinclair, but I was puzzled by the serious lack of judgment exhibited by \\"our hero\\" Jurgis. He had left Chicago having hardly any ties remaining there, and subsequently returned (for reasons unclear to me) right before winter. Jurgis was a victim of his own emotions, and ended up getting himself thrown into jail. Certainly, this \\"hero\\" was not perfect for engendering sympathy for the masses.However, the descriptions of conditions at the meat packers and the treatment of the workers was very effective, as reflected by regulations later instituted by government. I think we're probably still working on the treachery of the politicians.One of the prologues told me that I would be told that capitalism could never prevail. I don't remember reading that explanation. Perhaps I missed it.One hundred years later we are struggling with many of the same problems of the jungle. Kudos to Mr. Sinclair for his attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Font Far Too Small","review":"This book in over-sized, but the pages have 3-inch margins on all sides and the text is eight-point-font or smaller.

Unfortunatly, a series of events leaves him poor and in jail. He witnesses many disgusting and unfair things that sadly, many times really happened. He ends becoming a hobo and living in the country. His family is torn apart and seperates, leaving him alone in the world.I would recommend this book to people who like history and government because much of this book is based on things that happened in the government and history of Packingtown in the 19th century.I thought this book was boring. I felt that the plot of the story had no point and that it dragged on through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a waste of time...","review":"I certainly understand why this book made such a wave in the early 1900s, and I further understand its importance. However, if you are a reader (or like myself a writer/reader) who enjoys good writing, a good narrative voice, and a lack of ridiculous propaganda, then this book is not for you.Some say Sinclair wrote this book in order to show the horrific conditions in the meatpacking business, however, most scholars admit that this book was written merely to promote Socialism in the United States. This is obvious because Sinclair is completely unable to let the reader interpret, but just tells.The writing is similar to that of a child's, incorrect and often times completely and totally unreadable.I did not enjoy this book and I don't see why so many people believe it should be taught in schools. I nearly burned it after the second chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"one dimensional socialist propaganda","review":"I actually like a couple of sinclair lewis novels but this is unabashed socialist propaganda. Instead of focusing on sanitary conditions in meatpacking industry which is the real utility of this book, it's the evil capitalists against the hardworking devoted working man.

In trilogy of terror, all it shows is the doll chasing amelia around the apartment trying to kill her and stabbing her a few times. The end of the movie is the best part of the movie. after the doll burns in the oven, amelia opens it to see if it's dead and she gets possessed. she then calls her mom and tells her to come over and amelia waits in front of the door pounding a knife on the ground with a creepy look and CREEP-AY teeth.

The bond between Jodi and Neil was extraordinary. I was overjoyed to see a lot of great topics in this book; it had romance, friendship and fighting all at once. The way the author put every sentence, every word was amazing. It is a wonderful fantasy for ages 12 and up. Even those who don't usually read fantasy, will not be able to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"You like fantasy? You'll love Aten!","review":"Fantasy, romance, adventure--Key to Aten features all three. This well-balanced book will appeal to boys and girls alike. If you're looking for a great read with believable characters, a solid storyline and a generous sprinkling of evil villains, you need look no further than Key to Aten.Key to Aten is the first in a series, and this reader anxiously awaits the second chronicle. And the third.Read the book. You'll love it. Have I ever lied to you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for romance and fantasy lovers","review":"Key to Aten is a wonderfully entertaining book that takes the reader to a far off world filled with mystery, intrigue, romance and fantasy. It is a place in which the imagined becomes real and the real becomes ever so dangerous for a lost teenaged girl. Forests that grow or diminish at the command of a powerful, handsome leader, unavoidable flying mazes, prisons and slave auctions all contribute seamlessly to this fast paced novel richly spiced with a blossoming romance. Key to Aten is a great read, leaving this reader anxiously awaiting the second book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Experimental Music","review":"This are only a sketches for the album 'This Sentence Is True(the previous sentence is false)'.

All in all, a terrible book that belongs in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Love Battery,,Can You Feel the Love Buzz??","review":"Greetings to all alternative grunge listeners out there..Grunge is not Dead..The seattle sound has left its mark on music..Bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney , Soundgarden have always topped the charts,,but here comes the Best Underground Band I've heard in a while,,Its Love Battery, and the album Confusion AU gogo..It's Sweet,,with good lyrics and melodic tunes..Grunge BABY..Colorblind is the best ever..This band reminds me of Nirvana and KUrt Cobain,,simply pure and Vigorous in Sound,,I give this CD a four star,, YOU\\"VE GOT TO GET IT...IT ROCKS.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Battery continues with its incredible psychedelic rock","review":"Love Battery, a band that slipped through the cracks of the hype of the Pacific Northwest earlier this decade still survive. Perhaps causing them to continue to develop without ever collapsing under the weight of other bands and their overwhelming successes. Confusion Au Go Go, their fifth disc, is extremely solid all the way through. Like their previous, and best disc, Straight Freak Ticket, Love Battery musically blend psychodelic twisting slide guitar, with off-kilter rock beats. There is always something interesting and unusual about Ron Nine's lyrics and voice. The best songs are the title track, Monkey Brain and Hollow Body. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Beethoven","review":"These are my personal favorites in the Simpson symphonic oeuvre. And if you are just getting acquainted with this British composer, this is a great place to begin. Here in these two symphonies Simpson tips his hat off to Beethoven.The opening of the Second Symphony is breathtaking. The slow movement has a gentle meditative quality, probing remote areas of the mind. The finale has the grittiness and energy of Beethoven's Seventh.The Fourth Symphony contains some of the most remarkable and the most communicative of Simpson's Beethoven paraphrases. The archetype here is the scherzo of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with a Haydn quotation thrown in for good measure in the Trio section. Simpson remains close to the structure of the original, but creates a completely new experience.What words can describe this music? Transparent. Rhythmic. Energizing. Polytonal. Vernon Handley and his band do a masterful job in bringing forth the luscious details in these two incredible works."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 is Amazing","review":"Like Sir Malcolm Arnold, Robert Simpson (1921-1997) was a modern British symphonist. Simpson's music sounds more deliberate and focused than Arnold's, but never dull or academic. This is music that you can really sink your teeth into, wonderful symphonic music that deserves much wider hearing. Symphony No. 2, which clocks in at a bit less that half an hour, is energetic without being overbearing, while No. 4, a larger work both in terms of length (more than 45 minutes) and orchestral scope, covers a wide range of emotional and musical expression with confidence and power, and is truly a modern symphonic masterwork. It suddenly strikes me how many powerfully expressive fourth symphonies there have been in the 20th century: Sibelius, Vaughan Williams, Shostakovitch, Arnold, Nielsen; masterpieces all, and Simpson's 4th is worthy to stand proudly among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROBERT SIMPSON, UN SUPER GENIO!","review":"Los británicos durante el siglo XX han sido una de las naciones que mejores sinfonistas han producido sino los mejores, solo piense en: Vaughan Williams, Tippet, Elgar y por supuesto Robert Simpson. Mi amor a la música de Simpson fue algo a primera vista, la primera obra que escuche de este genio fue la Tercera Sinfonía y me fascinó. Las dos Sinfonías que trae este disco son sencillamente EXTRAORDINARIAS, en especial la Cuarta, es una música llena de energía positiva. Animase a entrar al mundo de Robert Simpson, le aseguro que no se arrepentirá.300% RECOMENDADO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare bit of good cheer from Simpson","review":"This disc is worth it for the Fourth Symphony alone, one of the most joyous Symphonies of the entire 20th Century. The Second Symphony is more representative of Simpson's symphonic oeuvre as a whole: energetic, objective, disciplined, takes more than one hearing to appreciate but is never boring. It is no surprise that the musicologist who writes so insightfully about Bruckner, Nielsen and Sibelius should himself be a very good composer.Also, Simpson's Fourth is the reason I have Haydn's Symphony No. 76 in my collection (here's one recording:Joseph Haydn: Concerto in D major for Piano; Concerto in C major for Oboe; Symphony No. 76)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Addition to Oriental Monsters","review":"Green Ronin hasn't disappointed me yet. This is a collection of creatures that haven't been done to death, and that are fun to play. I like the dragons (there's only two, and one is very different from the traditional, European dragon). I like the mechanics (new twists on the undead, on spirits, and on \\"friendly\\" monsters), and the good/bad ratio of the art is about 75% good to 25% bad. Better than a lot of d20 game stuff.It's a decent mix of aggressive, friendly, city and wilderness creatures. It includes two gods (the Monkey King, and the Ryushin, the Dragon God), both of them usable as patrons or sponsors for expeditions. Finally, it presents one new PC race (the tanuki, sort of a Drunken Monkey type, but it's more like Drunken Badger)."},{"rating":"1","title":"breathe","review":"yeah breathe is a great song tooooooooooooooooooooooo bad its not melissas song its greenwheel who made the original version and its on soma holliday. great song but she doesnt deserve all the credit for it...greenwheel is a little known band and it tells you soemthing if THEIR song is covered by a much more famous musician...either way great song"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received this item- poor business.","review":"It is not that I rate the CD 1 star- it is that I still have never received the CD or a response to my inquiry about the status of my order.

I was angered by the fact that every time I have heard Melissa Etheridge's \\"cover\\" they are never given credit, in fact, most of the time the DJs say it's her song.I've never liked Etheridge's music to begin with, but she just any amount of credibility I may have had for her. Do yourself a favor and pick up \\"Soma Holiday\\" by Greenwheel. Their original version of \\"Breathe\\" is so much better than the manufactured piece of pop crap that's on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"she's a thief","review":"when i heard her song breathe on the radio, i almost had a heart attack. her \\"big\\" single breathe was stolen from a favorite band of mine called greenwheel. i hope ppl come to realize that just because an artist is a big headliner, she can steal a song from an indie band[greenwheel was just recently signed] and commercialize it and make money off of it. this is unexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I believe that this album is her best ever. I do not see how some of these people reviewing this see different. I have been a fan from her first Grammy appearance. Granted I was young like 9 but it was something I will always remember. This album reminds me of that time because I believe this may just be the album that could hit it really bit on the charts. She is a great singer/songwriter/guitarist. This is her greatest album yet and most of her friends and real fans believe this. Rock on Melissa FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - I have almost worn it out already!","review":"When I buy a new CD I do the \\"will I listen to this again?\\" test...this one was \\"I HAVE to listen to this again...and again...and again...\\"I can't believe the negative reviews I am reading here. I think this is one of her strongest efforts - lots of variety, catchy lyrics and it rocks out more than many of her other efforts.If you are a fan of Melissa, you WILL NOT be disappointed in this CD...based on this CD, can't wait for her concert in March - she's going to rock the house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the secret agent?","review":"The anticipation was great but the album was a breakdown. When will the rock and roll days of old return to her music? I feel like I'm listening to her sessions with her shrink. The last two albums have the same tired themes...a broken heart, the pain of the old relationship, the dance of starting a new relationship and the heart that has been healed by the new relationship. Where is the tension in this album? The only song that reminds me of her earlier days is Secret Agent..but it's Melissa Etheridge who is playing the secret agent...pretending to produce a rock and roll album. Joplin would be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Not great","review":"I would describe this record as a \\"good effort\\" However, it lacks the fire and passion of her previous releases. It sounds like Melissa has gone \\"easy listening\\" with this one. The songs seem unfocused, and lack direction. I don't care for all the computerized, sampled drum beats. The lyrics are well written, but are worthless without strong melodies to go with them. I've been a fan since I was 17 years old.....This release to me was a big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Don't Get It","review":"I should start out by saying I have all of Melissa Etheridge's previous CD's and I love all of them for different reasons! However, \\"Lucky\\" was the worst disappointment in music I had in years!! Everyone I guess deserves one melt down CD in their career this would be hers. Out of 13 tracks there was not one I would play again! It is not rock, it's not blues, I don't think it's even \\"new country\\" I can't say though I don't listen to country much. I don't know what it is the lyrics are too repetitive, and they rhyme all over the place. If this is your FIRST CD by Melissa Eheridge don't let it be your LAST! Listen to her other releases! I'm very sorry I wasted my money on \\"LUCKY\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I was not impressed with the songs, lyrics or Melissa on this album.

This is love unabashed; a great release to hear; strong, powerful, and well-developed emotionally. I reserve my 5 star ratings for products that actually effect me with permanence. The 4 stars are albums I just enjoy enough to hear over and over and even still after a year has passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Lucky","review":"I love this cd. It's happy, it's upbeat, and it has some songs that make your skin grow with enjoyment.It begins with \\"Lucky\\" to warm you up, then it blasts you into \\"This Moment\\" which stopped me in my tracks. The intro reminds me of the Goo Goo Dolls, but then the power of Melissa Etheridge takes over. I listened to this song several times before reluctantly moving on.All the songs are excellent, but \\"Breathe\\", \\"Meet Me In The Dark\\", \\"Tuesday Morning\\" (my second favorite), and \\"When You Find the One\\" stand out.The only way this could have been improved is if it had been a double album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NEWFOUND RAW ENERGY","review":"WOW... first listen and I was hooked.

I will not get into the themes of each song....however, I will point out the stellar and somber tribute to Mark Bingham from flight 93 \\"LET'S ROLL\\" on the touching TUESDAY MORNING....it gave me chills.

I bought this album originaly for one song, \\"Breath\\" but I found myself being drawn into all of 13 tracks. This is one of those sleeper CD's that you want to recomened to everyone but, the lyrics are so personal you still want to keep it to yourself. All the songs on \\"Lucky\\" are a moving tribute to life, liberty, and the pursute of it all. THANKS MELISSA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa's best work yet!","review":"This cd suprised me in a way like no other. You can tell how happy Melissa is by the songs that she wrote and the way that she composed them. She takes powerful lyrics mixed with some kicking beats and different sounds to create, I think, one of her best cd's yet!! She uses two different background vocals on this cd and they give it the best sound you could possibly imagine. My favorite song would have to be \\"Tuesday Morning\\". It was written in rememberance of a man that many have not heard about, I personally did not know that he was a part of 9/11. This well written powerful ballad will get you going, especially if you're gay or lesbian, this song makes me feel proud and strong to be who I am. Rock on Melissa, Rock on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quel retour","review":"Après Skin qui était un album plutt noir et douloureux, Melissa nous reviens avec un album rempli d'espoir avec de très bonne ballades et du rock qui rappelle Your Little Secret.

This is probably the last time I will buy a Melissa Etheridge album. It seems I've grown up, but Melissa is still a teen, with lyrics like 'I'm alright...it only hurts when I breathe'. A great first love, but one which is best remembered fondly, and not pursued. This album was not for me - as a Melissa Etheridge fan, I'm dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dudd","review":"I was so in love with Moss's previous books that I scooped this book up without even looking at the contents, wanting a quite place to savor the work of a master. Silly me. These are not the timeless classics of her previous books. Instead of her trademark texture with subtle motif coupled with wonderfully detailed styling, we have ugly overbearing designs against mostly ho-hom sweaters. Did I mention the socks and afgans? Yuck. There are a couple of nice sweaters, but nothing to motivate me to pluck down $150 in yarn and spend months knitting. Ironically, Vogue featured an original pattern that was based on one of the sweaters in the book and it is far better then the one it is based on and much nicer then anything in this book. Save your money and hunt down one of her earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not patterns you want to knit","review":"A disapointment after her previous \\"classics\\" book and her published patterns. Maybe Ms. Moss wanted a write-off for her trip through Africa and the Middle East, but I'm not inclined to help fund it. The designs in this book are (with the exception of one sweater vest) not the kind of thing you would actually WEAR anyplace (including Casual Fridays), regardless of how interesting they may be to craft as a technical exercise. Frankly, as a working mom I just don't have time for knitting \\"exercises,\\" which may explain my frustration with the book. Most of the designs suffered from some very unfortunate choices with regard to the colorways. There are some interesting \\"bits\\" of designs and constructions that you might be able to use in another sweater project, but on the whole I found it to be very derivative of what Fassett was doing 10 years ago without adding much of additional value."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty nice attempt at unusual designs","review":"Moss has some nice sweaters here, although I can't help thinking that the inspiration for the designs should have produced more thought over the designs themselves. Something about them shouted that they could have been improved. They don't look like \\"world\\" knits either but only a select portion of the world. The colors are often too bright for my taste, although two of the sweaters are fairly nice. Somehow it all seems awkward, but it is a nice attempt at doing something different. However, none of the sweaters is so appealing that I'm willing to put in the time to handle their intricacies. I'm looking forward to her new book, Sculptured Knits, which I've seen previewed -- and one of the sweaters in the collection can be found in the Fall 1999 Knitter's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"The quality was quite nice and the shape was perfect, but the balance was way off.I didn't realize that the training knife would have a light alloy blade, my others have heavy rubber or drilled steel,and the balance when going through drills wasn't even close to the real knife...which I purchased at the same time.The grip and sheath are identical to the non-trainer, except in blue, and you can see the quality of the workmanship.I returned the trainer and was very pleased with Amazon's prompt response to my concerns, arranging to have UPS pickup the package and credit to my CC"},{"rating":"2","title":"a horse-lover's review of a four star book","review":"This was a pretty good book.

Half the time the characters don't even look human - nor anotomicly proportioned nor drawn with any consistancy.There is no interest in any more volumes, overpriced for the thin book that showed up, and I'd advise others to spend your money on something that is a better value and is a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"Don't waste your money on this junk.

As the third album, it's not quite as good as the previous two, but it does feature some strong material. Okay, \\"This is Our Dance\\" stinks, but the rest of the album is good. Strangely, the album opens with \\"Love Letters\\", which Elvis had already recorded back in 1966. The story goes that pianist David Briggs was never satisfied with his playing on the original version, so he talked Elvis into rerecording the song. The original version is better, to my taste.

This way, I can hook the scanner to my laptop and have my own copy of the photo instantly. The scanner is small, easy to use and scans very quickly...better than my home flatbed scanner! The software included edits photos easily. I also recently purchased a portable photo printer, also by HP. If you're in need of mobile scanning, this is the scanner to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!","review":"This is the perfect scanner togo. it doesn't have a power cord so it's portable. you can pretty much scan 4x6 photo to business cards and you can take it anywhere. very easy to use and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, So Good!","review":"I have had this album many years but I still listen to it once a week, no joke.

I wasn't ready to let them go! However this story was really good and I'm thankful that Christine got it in the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot","review":"I really liked the way the book went back and forth between chapters about Henry and ones about Christine; you are never bored. I would recommend it! Janette Oke is my favorite author and this is one of her better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story","review":"This book was great! Reminds you to make sure when you seek guidance from God, that you listen carefully and not let your own wants blind you from seeing His will. Wonderful love story too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"Another good book by Janette One. I read them way to quickly because I can't put them down. Her books always pull me into the story and brings her characters to life so that I care about them and don't want the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYOND THE GATHERING STORM","review":"I was so glad Janette Oke wrote another story about the Delaney family. Her stories are so fabulous that you feel like you are really there. I was glad to finally find out how Henry's life turned out after being abandoned by his family. This new book was hard to put down. Jannette did it again. This book as in all of her books was so moving and I can't wait until her next book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the orginal four.","review":"I was excited to see that Janette Oke had written two more books for her Canadian West series (my favorite of all her books)about Wynn and Beth's kids, but I was very disappointed after I read them. Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured, maybe both; either way, these two books were not that great. This book is better than #6 (When Tomorrow Comes), but not much. The development of Henry's character is consistent with what you'd expect from Wynn & Elizabeth's son, but Christine's character in this book is inconsistent with her upbringing and inconsistent from one page to the next. The story is choppy, and you never feel like you're really connecting with the characters. It was lacking in numerous areas. Stick with the original four, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M STILL WAITING ???","review":"I have not received this videotape yet. I was just about to contact you.

Ms. Rinzler has done her homework. She makes a sound case for the idea that the exponential increase in Breast Cancer is mostly the result of the massive introduction of estrogen into women's lives. Birth Control Pills, Hormone Replacement Therapy, DES and more, are all clearly implicated. Why then do they continue to be sold, with ever increasing favor? Why is this being denied/ignored? Why is this just shuffled off as a factor to consider? Why has this book received so little attention? Women should read, study and meditate on this book. Take it to heart. Ask yourself these questions. A fine example of excellent journalism, well written, staight foward and easy to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs but they aren't mixed","review":"I primarily bought this CD for one song \\"Launch\\" but found out that there were other good songs here. Personally, out of the three CDs that were included I listen to the techno the most.

When I first heard it, it was like, \\"oh, that's it?\\" For me personally, it was a song that I would not generally pay any attention to. After I first heard it, it got stuck in my head and I found myself humming parts of it. Not to say that I like it, but I'm not saying I don't. The song is just there. It's more like something you have to get use to. He still has a great voice and can still dance, but the song is not the kind that would impact you, or at least it didn't to me, the first time you hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knight Is trying to cash in on a trend, and he's going broke","review":"I absolutely hate this song. It sounds like a bad Timbaland song (He probably woke up at 3 in the morning, and realized he had to do produce this song.) and a bad 69 boys Booty song mix.Everytime I hear this song, I have to turn it off, because it makes my nerves bad. Don't waste your money and buy this hideous song. WHen will Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis stop doing this to us??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very upbeat and fun to listen","review":"I was skeptical at first since I was never a NKOTB fan, but this is a very catchy song. I really like the way the beat starts slow and then picks up, then slows again. To the person who wants to know why anyone would want to buy a maxi single of this song, isn't it obvious? If you like it, then of course different versions that are available only on a maxi single would be interesting too. If you didn't like this song, why would you buy the maxi single in the first place? Anyways, this is an awesome single and I recommend it to anyone who wants something fun and catchy to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it....","review":"I don't understand what the point of releasing this maxi single was. What difference in sales would this make? If people didn't like the single in the first place, why would people pay six bucks for five versions of the same horrid song? This guy needs to go back to school and get an IQ before he does anything else. How long's it gonna take him to figure out he's flopped? The process, however excruciating, should be fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book!","review":"The fact that there are entire chapters that are completely lifted word for word from Night Of The Living Dead doesn't bother me...much... but the fact that this book is poorly written as a Whole does. The characters we are given are not even developed enough to be called cardboard and the story jumps around aimlessly. The bus wreck in the begining is the only really well thought out part and even that is put on the very back burner. Skip this one if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This book was born from a screenplay written over 20 years ago and it shows. It reads like a screenplay. This was the originally intended sequel to the cult classic \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\". 10 years after the so-called \\"plague\\" was vanquished, a bus topples over in middle america. A Baptist congregation rushes to the scene of the accident(they drive metal spikes through the dead to prevent the plague from reoccuring). Needless to say the plague returns and all hell breaks loose. The last few chapters are a rehash of \\"Night\\", with our heroes running from house to house. Although the book is never boring it suffers from sequelitis. A far cry from the brillance of Romero's cinematic sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy follow up to a classic movie.","review":"This book is a worthy follow up to the classic horror movie \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" It occurs ten years after the movie, and the cinematic sequels, \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"Day of the Dead,\\" are not part of the story. In this version of the \\"Dead\\" universe, the first \\"outbreak\\" has been squelched and life has returned to normal, or as close to normal as it can be in a world where the dead walk and feed on the living, as is exemplified by the first chapter, which by the way will chill you to the bone. It concerns a simple family funeral but with a ghoulish twist.Plot twists are many as characters come and go (often consumed) and the book comes to a satisfying conclusion. One finds oneself wishing that Mr. Russo might return to this well someday.One caveat: The book could have greatly benefitted from a good proof reader. Typos, missing words, and other errors are frequent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great zombie story","review":"This book was great to read. At times when I was reading it, I actually got scared. It kinda pulls you into the horrfing world that the characters are in. It was a great zombie story, that in my opinon should be adaped to film the way this story is written!! I highly recommend this book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"MST3K!","review":"Keep them coming, they are all good in my opinion just silly fun and some wonderfully awful films."},{"rating":"2","title":"I beg to differ...","review":"...With most of the reviews. The Dead Talk Back is may favorite of the four, far better than Hobgoblin and Phantom Planet. Because of those two I'm not going to bother with this set unless the price comes way down. I have TDTB and MAGG recorded and the quality is sufficient that I don't yearn for the official copies. Phantom Planet is relentlessly banal and Hobgoblins is just too stupid to deprive any joy from. I don't know why I'm not as bored with TDTB as most people seem to be, it just has a certain incompetent charm that I can appreciate. Monster-A-Go-Go is certainly tedious but the riffing is good enough to make it reasonably fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I was excited to order the next volume of MST3000 for my son and I to enjoy....it was not to be.

So far I've really only played around with this for an hour or two through my head phones but love the sound reproduction. It seems to lack a wide range of patterns, but that may be something I need to look for more deeply in the manual. I have no doubt I'll be updating this review when I get time to sit down and seriously use this, but it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sound generator - a pain to program","review":"I use my Zoom RT223 strictly for practicing, although it sounds good enough to make a passable recording. I especially like this because it has both drums AND bass which makes practicing a lot more fun and realistic.I've given up trying to program the thing and I just use a notebook computer (Acer,) a midi cable, a simple midi sequencer program, and midi files to drive it. Good, free midi drum and bass tracks are readily available on the net. So essentially I'm just using this device as a sound synth and using midi to do the sequencing.I would highly recommend this to anybody who wants to make practice more fun and realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Ch-inky', definitely not \\"road rugged\\".

Got mine at REI and now need to find one for my wife. She tried out my bag last weekend in Bend, Oregon where it was cold for the night. She is usually cold but stayed very warm in the bag.The only reason for not getting a 5 is because it is a bit more bulky than a mummy bag. If you are car camping or have a waterproof stuff sack to put the sleeping bag on the outside of your pack, you'll be just fine and you'll give it a 5-star.I'm tall with broad shoulders and don't like the mummy bags as they are tight on me. I wanted to find a rectangle bag that I could use in cold weather. I have found it in this bag. I have my room to turn in the bag and still stay warm.I bought mine at $39.99 as a close out, not sure if I would have done it at a higher price as I'd have been worried that it was a rip off.

An excellent guide with clear black-and-white botanical drawings and a terrific common and latin name index. Would be helpful in many wildflower walks in the area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Come On Now!","review":"This is simply the worst album by a big name artist that I can think of, in any genre of music. It contains many embarassing moments. I have just read the favorable reviews by other listeners and am scratching my head--did I get a secret pressing of this album that no one else has heard? I just don't see how one could praise this album. It was widely seen as a fiasco when released and if anything, it sounds worse with the passage of time. None of the songs would have been even considered for the albums Paul was working on only three years before. The material is simply weak and the performances subpar."},{"rating":"1","title":"three great tracks","review":"The album as a whole is obviously ungood. But a few tracks deserve to be remembered, and have to be possessed by any pop music fan. 'Wild life' is fun (though I doubt sometimes I would feel the same if English was my native language...), with great vocals; 'Dear friend' is rather touching (I suppose Lennon and McCartney felt obliged to compete with musical quality when recording songs about their relationship, though of course the words are always ridiculous); finally, 'Tomorrow' is one of my McCartney favourite, which would have been a hit any time but in this ungrateful early post-beatles era. By the way, please notice that, for at least the first three or four bars, and regardless of the key, which I didn't check, 'Tomorrow' follows the same chord structure as 'yesterday'... by no means a coincidence, it isn't such a common structure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild life","review":"A rare misfire. McCartney was inspired by Bob Dylan to make his new record a spontaneous, one-take, semi-improvised affair. Which might have worked for Bob Dylan, but does Paul McCartney -- whose gifts are for rich melodies and catchy hooks, and careful, painstaking craftsmanship -- no favours, particularly when he was fresh out of good new songs. Dear Friend is interesting from the Beatles-fan point of view (it's another open letter to John, replying to recent criticism); and I've always liked the cover of Love Is Strange, where Paul and Linda do a rare duet. The rest is either stick-in-the-mud heavy rock (Wild Life) or throwaways (pretty much everything else). The bonus tracks added to this release do add some much-needed melodic sense to the record. Mary Had A Little Lamb, much reviled on release, now brings a smile to this new father's face. On the whole, there's a lot better Paul McCartney records to go after than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCartney's Worst Album","review":"\\"Painfully inauspicious\\" doesn't begin to describe this sloppy debut album by Paul McCartney and Wings. Except for a reggaefied \\"Love Is Strange,\\" the jaw-dropping banality of \\"Wild Life\\" (1971) makes \\"Ram\\" sound like a masterwork. Paul's strangely unfinished \\"Dear Friend\\" (his conciliatory response to John Lennon's \\"How Do You Sleep?\\") needed a rewrite . . . and a few extra takes. \\"Bip Bop,\\" on the other hand, may be the most irritating song McCartney ever recorded. Sorry, but the revisionist praise for \\"Wild Life\\" rings hollow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renewable","review":"I grew up inhaling the Beatles, then all of their repective solo careers, except for Ringo's. Used to listen to this one all the time. Then went through a long phase where I probably considered it light-weight garbage. Now, so many years later, I once again like it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad","review":"This is by far and away McCartney's worst album. Bip Bop might be the worst song ever written. The ONLY redeeming song is the remake of the old Love is Strange song. Mumbo has a catchy melody, but I have no idea what the words are that Paul is singing.Quite frankly, these songs sound as if McCartney penned them quickly while sitting on the toilet. The quality of the songs is very poor. I do not recommend buying this album, even if you're a Beatles or McCartney fanatic. I wouldn't spend $.50 cents on this album even if I saw it at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad....This is Paul at his Worst","review":"I bought this album in the discount rack around 1981 and gave it away to someone who would take it. I love the Beatle's music and their solo efforts, but not this one.IT STINKS. It really makes you appreciate Ringo's talent.The added bonus tracks may make it worth buying on CD when it hits the discount racks. Not before.Do you self a favor and choose another album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is generous.","review":"First of all, I am a big McCartney fan. However, no pair of rose colored glasses can make me see this as anything but pure drivel. This is an embarrassing recording from an artist who has written and performed on some of pop music's best records. I am the first to admit that McCartney has made several bad albums, but none so entirely unlistenable.There is one good thing about the CD though: it includes the B-side \\"Oh Woman Oh Why\\" which is a good track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!","review":"I don'yt know how this album got an average of three stars...actually one star is too much for this..the only good track is a bonus track b-side not from the original album called \\"Little Woman Love\\"....Paul, if you ever read this, please don't put out an Anthology!

Heather King's Parched is one of the latter. I first became familiar with King's writing through her commentary on NPR's All Things Considered, where she profiled her brothers punk rock band The Queers.

But if one does not enjoy learning of the distructivness and blindness of our economy (and people themselves), I don't recoment it to them. This book is not for the weak of heart, but the strong in ambition and care. For a teacher, I recomend this book to be read a longside any Envoronmental textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"a politician who thinks he's a scientist","review":"One thing my father, a physicist, believed strongly was that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

I could not have been more disappointed. His cited research is vauge and in some cases, incorrect or taken so out of context as to be irrelevant. His conclusions are not supported by the \\"facts\\" he claims to base his arguments on. The entire last half of this book reads like a somewhat frightening rant of a neo-communist expounding on the evils of freedom and capitalism. He directly argues for eliminating automobiles and many other modern technologies and obliquely makes a case against the private ownership of land and property as it is a non renewable resource and should belong to all. I am very thankful this man did not become president and if you read this book, and read not just what he says but between the lines at his intent, I believe you will be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicken-Little","review":"I picked this book up because I was curious. I read it from cover to cover. I then went to the Internet and researched all of his predictions. The United Nation's own Global Warming website completely contradicts his prediction of atmospheric C02 and methane concentrations for the ten years following the publication date of his book.He completely misses the mark on transpiration and cellular-respiration and the role plants take part in both of these cycles.He also has a very serious lack of knowledge in basic organic chemistry. He attributes many increases in global warming gasses (mainly C02 and methane) to man, but fails to mention that these gasses are a natural product of carbon-based life-cycle (from: birth --> death --> break-down into molecular components).

He uses excessive details and extreme data to support a couple of theoretical, unproven ideas. He has good intentions, fully aware of the need to both inform and change public opinion concerning the environment, but he portrays his views in a dark, negative, and pesimistic way.

His book is rife with Green Party politics, and it should be no surprise that he lost the recent election. As a compassionatel liberal, I am usually inclined to agree with Mr. Gore's policies, but as an avid reader of political literature, I am disgusted. The book lacks any sort of emotion, much like the ex-vice president himself. The book concentrates less on liberal environmental politics and more on Bolshevistic Communist propaganda.

In this sense it is invaluable.But in another it seems to me to miss the mark.For to break up ' War and Peace' and provide even some of the great passages is to miss the whole sense of the work which is in the presentation of a vast world, a flowing and moving world.It is in this sense seems to me that Tolstoy is not quite suited for an anthology of this type, and that the reader who would give his attention to close to nine- hundred pages should do this to either one of the two great novels, 'War and Peace' or 'Anna Karenina'."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inspirationless album","review":"This album was a real disappointment for me.

It takes a short while, but better that than constantly burning things like our old toaster (or waiting an eternity like our toaster-oven) it seems well regulated in the levels of toasting if you follow what I mean.

When I called the company to see about the warranty, which is one year, they told me that they would replace the product for $14.99 shipping and handling expense.

The toaster would not toast both sides of bread. The outside coils on both sides of the toaster would not heat. The only way to toast bread was to run 2 cycles, turning the bread after the first cycle. I can't believe that Haier doesn't check to see if coils are heating before shipping from the factory. However, Amazon's return policy is good and those with a computer, internet and printer can print a prepaid mailing label. I should not lose any money on the toaster or return postage. Return instructions are easy to follow. Just the headache of repackaging the toaster and taking it to the post office."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down for that price!","review":"The reason I gave this toaster such a low rating is because while it is an OK toaster, it isn't worth the money. First of all, the sides of the toaster are not die cast-- they are some kind of plastic. Only the center part of the toaster is metal.Second, the heat settings are way off. The toast has seven settings, but above level 4, it burns the toast black. Even on level 3 (where I keep it set most of the time) the corners of the bread get burned.Finally, when I wrote to the manufacturer with a question about operating the toaster, they failed to respond.We were hoping to get something of better quality by paying a higher price, but we would have been better served by the $8 Walmart toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toastie toast","review":"This Haier retro-look toaster is one of the best we have had.

The Amazon packaging was twice the size of the original box with all the paper packing in one end of the box. The toaster itself looked okay, but, I don't buy a toaster for looks.

Instead, the literature said, \\"in home use only\\" and the toaster was very light, thim metal. One third of the elements didn't glow which is necessary for toasting.

I immediately returned it to Amazon and asked for replacement but was told they do not have any more. Today a safety person from Haier called me to ask a lot of questions about this toaster and the issues...he told me this model has been discontinued....buy at your own risk....there is a reason it was discontinued...now the market is flooded with them at really low prices compared to the original price.

I hooked these cables up and my computer would not output a resolution greater than 1024x768 no matter what I did. Thinking perhaps it was an issue with a driver update or Linux update (I've had plenty of Linux machines where something will mysteriously stop working after an update), I checked forums and the nVidia page. After that I went ahead and ran all the updates and made sure all my drivers were up to date, just in case. Still, nothing. Fiddled with all the menu options on the TV. Nope. To test if it was the cable itself, I snaked the old cable back, plugged it in, and got my actual, widescreen resolution back at 1366x768.

It seems 6-feet isn't that long nowadays, I have seen this with the other cables I have purchased with this from Amazon. Next time I buy any kind of cables I am going to go with 10-ft but 6-ft isn't too bad unless you have things at a distance like I do. I could still connect it to my monitor so that is nice.

There was a slight flickering to the images, and yes I double-checked to make sure the connections were secure.Also, in the image it shows that there is a ferrite core at each end of the cable. But there is only one ferrite core on one end of the cable that I received.

I purchased it to connect my Gateway Lamptop to my 52\\" Toshiba Flat Television. It it crystal clear. and provides the highest video quality possible. StarTech.com coaxial VGA cables eliminate picture \\"ghosting\\" and fuzzy images inherent to non-coaxial cables, and provide superior EMI interference protection by using ferrite cores near the connector ends. The only thing that I don't like is you need another cable for sound.Ideal for high resolution monitors (1024x768 and above)Overall it does a FANTASTIC JOB as far as the video is concerned and is a GREAT Price on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for mac mini","review":"This cable is missing connectivity for Pin 11 ID0/RES Monitor ID bit 0, and Pin 12 ID1/SDA Monitor ID bit 1.

The reason I needed this length was because my computer is set in the closet for noise reduction (the thing is loud!) so I needed more than the standard 6 foot length. Other cables failed miserably and gave me really blurry images which were completely unusable. I was worried that these cables will do the same thing but there was virtually no signal degradation.

The one that I got from the seller is of light gray color (instead of black) and looked to be of a lower quality model. Since it worked well enough for my purpose and is relatively cheap, I did not ask for a return, but I was disappointed. It feels like being cheated on a cheap basis. I would not recommend this seller. Unfortunately, this was the only seller, ABACUS24-7, listed by amazon.com for a 6 ft cable, so even I had suspicions about it, I had no choice, but to risk it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rating is Not for the Item Advertised","review":"The rating is not for the item advertised: the item advertised was a StarTech 6-Feet Coax High Resolution VGA Monitor Cable - HD15 M/M (MXT101MMHQ) but what I got was a 6-ft M/M VGA cable manufactured by 3C Cable City Corp. So the rating is for the cable received, with one star deducted for it not being the one ordered -- for the cable received does work and work well between the VGA port on my netbook and the VGA port on the VGA to S-Video/Composite Video adapter I bought it for.This, of course, would explain why some reviews are so negative: those unfortunates presumably were also not sent the cable ordered, and the one sent in those cases was not very good.

I think some of these vendors are sending knock-off clones of this cable. I recommend steering clear of these, and make sure you buy directly from Amazon. It's a bit more expensive, but you're guaranteed to get the real name-brand cable.This is an excellent heavy-duty cable. I had terrible ghosting with my old VGA cable, which no amount of adjusting could fix.When this cable arrived, I immediately noticed how much thicker it was than the old cable. I estimate about twice the diameter of the old. Using this cable, my ghosting problems are completely fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Cable","review":"Heavy cable that I use to hook up my laptop to a HDTV. No interferance with other electronics, picture was clear for 6 months. Then picture turned yellow. That's right, picture had a yellow tint that would not go away.

That's a Mac thing though, not anything to do with the cord. Just wanted to give a heads up to anybody with a Mac, because it took me a while to figure out!

I tried the cable with three monitors and it caused severe ghosting on all of them, I also checked the monitors with other cables and they all work great. When I tried contacting them for a refund for a defective product they told me that VGA cables are not for High Resolution displays like LCDs but only for CRTs (not true and contradicts the product description).

You may have to update some various things (go to the Sony website to get those upgrades that are specific to your type of laptop. I did this and still couldn't get it to work, but it at least saw that there was input, it just said something about not being able to use the data or something along those lines. After some fiddling, I changed one of the settings to 60Hz (sorry I can't remember exactly where it was, somewhere under Control Panel and then Other... it's the same place where you tell it to use two screens).

I have had no problems with it and the picture quality is great. I was a little skeptical about it since it was so inexpensive but I am very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Why this package was released is beyond me. Other than for nostalgia's sake, I suggest the hard-core fans pass on this one. Disc 1, featuring James Dewar is worthwhile even though the sound quality borders on 'bootleg' quality. Disc 2 featuring the 'trio' is a frisbee, you can't really understand the vocalist, he sort of mumbles his way through. Blank booklet is a shocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this for disc one and zone out!!","review":"I just found this in a pile of discs from days gone by. I was at the 74 show in Pittsburgh, and I must say, re-visiting this tonight makes me thrilled I was there to see this line-up... Jimmy Dewar on bass and vocals = doesn't get any better! Reg Isidore was on fire, and Robin was burning up the frets.. As far as sound quality, except for the first verse of BRIDGE OF SIGHS, this recording is raw and real... I can't find ANY fault in this.. It is full of passion, and the audience was over the top! The second disc = DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.... REST IN PEACE JIMMY - YOU ARE MISSED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting score of life's realities by Thomson","review":"This absolutely brilliant score by Thomson brings to us a wonderful re-creation of life's realities in the early 1940's Louisiana during the great depression. This movie score is subtle, tender and reflects Thomson's virtuosity that makes us identify ourselves with that period. Especially the score for \\"Louisiana Suite\\" is captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"My order arrived earlier than expected so I was very excited. I bought this as a Christmas present for my pilot friend and I hope he won't be too disappointed. The body looks like metal but everything else is plastic. The body's colors are painted but the logos and windows are cheaply adhered stickers. Given the chance, I wouldn't buy this again. This is probably alright for a children's toy, but not so great for someone older in aviation."},{"rating":"2","title":"fan since blue lines.","review":"I have been an fan of Shara Nelson since the release of the \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" track from the Massive Attack 'Blue Lines' album in 1991. I was eagerly awaiting and pleasantly surprised when she released \\"What Silence Knows\\" back in 1994. That first solo outing solidified her as more that just a vocalist for Massive Attack, earining her awards and accolades for her writing ability. This follow up didn't recieve the attention that \\"Silence\\" did. It's a shame because it is just as promising, if not more-so than it's predecessor, continuing with the fluid string arrangements, bits of mowtown, urban beats, jazz inflections, abstract, and better production from the likes of Jah Wobble, Tim Simenon(Bomb the Bass), St. Etienne, Pressure Drop and Lucas to name a few. Check her out on the sublime Presence(1999) album along along with another Massive Attack vocalist Sara Jay(Mezzanine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disapointed.","review":"I was looking for a straight up dictionary for the theological terms that eluded me.

The children were riveted by the pictures and we had lots of fun discussing things like in what ways giraffes are like cranes. My children loved the pictures--especially the butterfly on the bike. It was a charming, memorable read and we'll enjoy revisiting this book often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kunoichi","review":"I am a big fan of Rina Takeda,and this was a fun film, though too short, and needed more action. But my friends and I did enjoy the film and hope Rina will get better film roles,she is very talented. So if you are a fan of her, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $10","review":"This movie was not worth the ten dollars paid.Story was non-existent as the description is NOT the movie but rather the backstory.Acting is cardboard and *ahem* \\"action\\" scenes were mediocre at best.The only time a swordfight ensues is near the end and is over in a few minutes.Rina Takeda is the only thing making this two stars instead of one.Her acting and karate is the only time to pay attention to the movie.Also,the film is only an hour long yet ends abruptly like this was a pilot for a tv series.The film can be watched with subtitles (recommended) or english dubbing which is horrendous.Extra features ok to view but final verdict on movie:NOT a purchase OR rental.Go find someone elses copy and offer them a dollar or two for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She really skilled, movie sux, but DO watch her other movies","review":"The only reason why I bought this movie was the action fighting. Esp. If you love Japanese Ninja women kick guys heads is sexy legs. But she really is almost a black degree and can really kick a man's ass in real life. Wish I had a wife like her in 25s.Story sux BUT Give her another chance. I'm sure they'll make a good movie like Zatoichi one day and starring Rina Takeda. She woulda made a good Blood+ actress instead of that other girl. She has other worthy movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I thought it was an interesting concept but the story did not do anything for me.

I TOTALLY agree with the reviewer from LA. It's interesting that the subsequent edition(s) apparently corrected and improved nothing. JJ Brophy should go to jail for this, or be tarred and feathered at a minimum. Way to go Brophy, you're a real pro aren't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of paper is better than this.","review":"I don't know what is the purpose of this book. There are letters, but no informations.You'll know something. But you'll never find why. There are some informations about something, but no examples. You can't check you are well understood or not.There are no formulae, but you are forced to solve exercise at the end of the chapter. Surely no solution. Some problem has wrong answer.And there are so many wrong signs of formulae. You'll be an editor rather than a student.... Anyway I'm finding a book to replace it. Horowitz's book - The art of electronics - is on my list. I'll get it next week.I can't understand why my professor have chosen this book, and why Brophy wrote this book...

I am originally from Minnesota and currently live in Phoenix. The only way I know that it is Christmas time here is because my neighbors have lit up the cactus in their front yard. I was pleasantly surprised when I received my box of winter wonderland and even more so when I actually watched it. It is beautiful! I absolutly recommend this video to anyone that misses winter and that holiday feeling. I have watched it over and over and ordered more for my friends and family. Finally there will be a little snow in Phoenix this Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"After reading the reviews and watching the clips for this dvd I anxiously ordered it. Boy were we disappointed. We love nature/relaxation type dvds and have several of them, so can compare new ones with those we own and like. I expected falling snow, there was very little of it. It seemed many of the scenes were clips or freeze framed. Very rarely does a tree move or snow blow , even a tiny bit. Being from the praries and mountains of the midwest I can say nature is hardly ever completely still.So that aspect made the pictures seem less real. There are a couple of beautiful shots of mountains with clouds moving across them and a gorgeous shot of snow falling on a lovely cabin. Other than that there was not much to keep our interest.I would definitely skip this one. A couple of favorite Christmas/winter DVD's we enjoy are: Christmas in New York and The Spirit of Christmas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Relaxing DVD for Winter-loving People","review":"This DVD is wonderful (probably deserves \\"******\\"). The quality of picture and sound is GREAT. It is a must buy for people who miss the winter scene.

It's full of beautifull and peacefull images of the snow with captivating mountain vistas and snow covered lakes and cabins.

This video is a great addition to any home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont get this book at all","review":"Im not sure if Hal Leonard is desperate or what is going on but this book is a joke. When you listen to the audio cd this clearly was not recorded live, it is samples. Why learn to play it when you can sequence it? But why would this book be published? What is the use of classical pieces, played on electric guitar, by someone who clearly cant play them? After seeing other reviews on this author Im somehow not suprised at all. Useless, this book is a disgrace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast From The Past","review":"Listening to this CD is like finding the missing link between the minstrel music and modern bluegrass. Snuffy places the banjo into the context of a lighthearted and entertaining skit for several of the songs. It takes the listener on a time warp back to the late 40's and early 50's era when country music had an all together different vibe. If you're interested in the roots of bluegrass/country music or are just tired of the over-processed, over-mixed, squeeky clean perfect digital recordings of today, you'll probably get a kick out of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend","review":"Snuffy Jenkins was my grandfather and this album is very precious to me.

He makes this somewhat cliched film come alive. The subject matter interests me and it is one more opportunity to see a Sharkey performance. He died much too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"Not a well known movie but very powerful and interesting look on the teen idols of the 50's Was supposedly modeled after the careers of Frankie Avalon ( Tommy ) and Fabian (Cesare) My daughters were obsessed with this movie after I introduced it to them. Peter Gallagher was very young here and Ray Sharkey was excellent. Highly recommend this film to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vincent, Make Us More Idols to Worship","review":"This movie was released in 1980, starring Ray Sharkey and Tovah Feldshuh. Ray is Vincent Vacarri, said character being loosely based on Bob Marucci, an idolmaker in his own right - Frankie Avalon, Fabian. Vincent is ever-seeking fame and fortune, but feels he can't cut it in the spotlight himself. Those who can't, teach (and capitalize from it). His drive to succeed is merciless, on himself, and others, but his character remains deep and thoroughly likeable. Tune in, Peter Gallagher fans, he is young and hot-hot-hot in this one, while Vincent molds him into idol material. As great looking as this guy is, physically it's not a far stretch but he benefits from instruction. Memories of Ed Sullivan rock and roll first viewings - Elvis, the Beatles, etc. - will hit strongly. Great music, interesting story line...Christine Taylor (Marsha in The Brady Bunch) is a reporter who wants to do more to our Idol than just interview him."},{"rating":"2","title":"siv123@pacbell.net - THE IDOLMAKER - AN OLD FAMILY FAVORITE","review":"I remember watching this movie with my sisters and brother.

I've read the reviews here and it looks like a few of you are looking for the soundtrack. I'm one of the lucky ones who bought the soundtrack (on vinyl LP) back when. It's in my closet.
