I'm normally a mystery, women's fiction reader, historical novels once in awhile, but I heard so much about Harry Potter that I decided to buy one of the books and satisfy my curiosity. We were on vacation and I read it off and on while I was spending time with my parents and friends. Once I got into the story I couldn't put it down. The author has an excellent way of bringing you into the story and before you know it you just want to find out what is going to happen next. Overall, it was a terrific book and I'm sure I'll be reading more about Harry Potter and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not half bad, pretty good really","review":"1) Not a good book for younger children. I'd recommend they stick to Books 1-3, maybe Book 4.2) Better than Book 5, but not as enjoyable as some of the earlier books to me.3) Definitely getting darker and more depressing as Harry and his compatriots grow older. Of course, the world seems darker and more depressing than it used to be too.4) The Half-Blood Prince is a very interesting character. I look forward to seeing how events tie up in Book 7.5) Book 6 seemed a little short. Some of the other books stood alone better.6) I missed the usual Hogwarts Express ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wasted brain power for THIS?!","review":"in all honesty, i don't think brain power was even INVOLVED in reading this.i was impressed with horcruxes, and the coming of age of harry, but...1) too predictable.2) overly lengthy-- what could have been saicd in a few words, she used a few pages.3) there isn't any magic or charm to the story. maybe its her style... its strangely dry and monotone compared to the first five books.4)people are saying that its more of an adult book.... they couldn't have been more wrong. after spending a summer reading so called \\"grown-up\\" books, the sixth installment doesn't verge deep enough into character development, deeper universal themes, or description of scenes/places/peoplesi appreciate it for preoparing the readers for book 7... but i dont think i wouldve missed anything had i read a CliffNotes version of this. cheaper and quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough story for the length","review":"I am a die-hard HP fan, but apart from Voldemort's history and the extremely heart-wrenching ending, there was not much to the story.... Too much \\"snogging\\" and too many pages devoted to teenage crushes....... I found this story extremely disappointing for the most part... Seems like a filler for the climax.... with nothing better to do, Jo Rowling turns to commercial means to fill the pages. Not a word more, else I'll give it all away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as the Last Two","review":"The last two installments of the Harry Potter series were excellent. This one is like a mediocre The Empire Strikes Back, a book that contains a lot background and hints of future events, but doesn't hold up well on it's on. At the end, there are too many unanswered questions. At the end of the previous installment in the series, I was sad, but in this installment I was just annoyed. The author seems to have been deceiving us (or maybe it's all just a rouse again) about the nature of key characters in the series. Also, what makes this one lacking is that the final showdown is a bit of a let-down.In general, I don't think the writing is as good in this book. And a lot of the repeated behaviors of certain characters are now starting to feel like the same old, same old stuff. I've really enjoyed previous installments in the series, especially The Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix. To me, the ending of this book was really a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"JK Rawling has let her readers down. After building up to the exciting and dramatic Order of the Phoenix, this book was flat. I kept waiting for something to happen. Eventually it did, but, that was at the end of the book. There was no suspense and very little action. This book was simply filler between book 5 and book 7.I can practically predict what will happen in book 7 following the conclusion of book 6. I sincerely hope I am wrong and Rawling surprises us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIVE WORDS.....","review":"I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!It is clear J. K. Rowling simply fulfilled her obligation in writing this book!! This series had the potential to be great for many many years to come and for a multitude of generations. Yes her original following has grown up - but they would followed Harry as long as she kept to the original integrity of her charactors or basic plot. I read and enjoyed books 1 thru 5 and I am 45, my daughter devoured them from the time she was ~ 7 till now and she still (or was) a devout fan!This but reads like J.K. Rowling was in a hurry, felt pressure to write, may be she has lost her interest, or may be her gift?!

Each preceding book had new interesting surprises (the Maurader's Map, for example). This book was exceedingly repetitive regarding Malfoy, relationships between boys and girls, and key scenes were just not that exciting. The book does pick up for the final 1/4, but it's as if J.K. Rowling knows how to end the book, but had to throw in one more before book 7. This is clearly the least inspired of them all, and I'm sure in due time more people will agree that the Half-Blood Prince was the most disappointing in this incredible series. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A placeholder","review":"While I am attached to the Harry Potter books and respect J.K. Rowling immensely, in the series Book 6 felt like a placeholder in which speculation replaced real conflict and danger. The lack of resolution made it seem more like a set-up for the final book than a story unto itself, a drawback to fitting one's creativity into a rigid seven-year structure. Still, Rowling can write, and when she is allowed to let it all out in the final installment, I will be sad to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halfway Through","review":"I didn't think that the Author could continue to think up new things for the protagonist.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was poorly written and low on action. The book was obviously written to organize plot lines for the finale. Unfortunatley this was done with little finesse. Tokien in his epic managed to weave plot lines without the forced feeling that a reader finds in HBP, so Rowling falls short of the comparisons made between the two. The dialougue between characters is often wooden or overly prentenious... apparently Rowling has forgotten how teenagers behave as well. The numerous romances seemed bland, with a few exceptions. A lot of the characters regressed and instead of gaining depth became more shallow and two dimensional. Overall the book seems to represent a decline in standards. Rowling failed to focus on book six and seemed to be focussed on book seven. This caused Half-Blood Prince to be a poor read and hardly exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"This was amazing I loved it so much the epilogue was fantastic I love the idea of how there was one another order it was just so fantastic"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Strengthens Marriage","review":"I didn't think I would read the latest installment of the Harry Potter series. However, at a recent wedding, one of my best friend's wife had a ringing endorsement for this story.

Could you ask for a more lovely use of literature than bringing man and wife together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowlings done it again","review":"Well after getting my two books for my husband and I on July 16th from Amazon.com (THANKS AMAZON) I started to read it immediately. I have to say that Rowlings gets better with each book. I couldn't put it down. It makes you feel as though you are at Hogwarts yourself. Absolutely amazing. I did have to simmer down although when I read the book as the deaths that occur within each book become more and more shocking. It definetly leaves you on the edge to want the next book tommorrow since so many questions are unanswered.

You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fantastic!","review":"Book 6 is everything I expected and more. I am more than a little irritated with the other reviewers who didn't think the book had substantial plot and devices- maybe you should read it again, and slower this time, because you folks obviously missed a lot. I really enjoyed the expansion on Malfoy's character, and Snape is just so much more deliciously evil. (What does Dumbledore know that we don't??)I felt a bit let down at the end of Book 5 due to the questions about Voldemort and the prophecy, but Book 6 offers much insight into Tom Riddle and the lead-up to his transformation, along with explanations for incidents that took place in all previous books. This is just a great book that keeps the reader enthralled until the very end. Thanks Joanne- I can't wait for the next book. I am going to read HBP again, just as soon as I wrestle it from my 11 year old son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best So Far","review":"Listen I know other reviewers bash this book i think it is the best book so far dumbledor dies that did suck but it was needed he draged out the book far to much also snape is a ddeath eater this will result in a great showdown in book 7"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I was surprised by the ending, saddened, and left totally amazed.

And there is too much teenage romance thrown in!! gimmi a break.A lot of things could have been covered in a lot less words. The book is just TOO-SLOW.I am truly amazed at all the positive reviews. I recommend you ask the basic outline of the story from someone who has read the book. I am sure you will go to everything in 2mins. And then you could read up the previous books, because the rest of the things such as Quidittch matches, lectures, romances, spells, professors can be found in the previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"This is now the third time I am reading this book because it is awesome read Harry Potter 6 you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"no time to sit and read","review":"i have a job where i am left to my own will and being able to listen to the book was awesome.

HP6 answers a lot of questions and raises a bunch of new ones. I give this book a four star rating instead of a five because, in my opinion, it isn't as good as the fifth.

Rowling has done it again! Only this time we are left with a cliffhanger of a story. This book had me enthralled from beginning to end and I could not read it fast enough.

A definite must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Concerns","review":"The Book was great to me, it explained alot of things that were happening or had happened. People who dislike the book are crazy, being that you have to remember this is a childerns story. I find That J.K. style has not change, the tone of the story is darker but that is expected, as the series is comeing to a close. I was glad not to hear about Harry until later on in the book, because it left room to learn and wonder and not jump fully in to Harry at the Dursley's. The reveals were suprizing as the murder... I had suspected it... I have deep concerns for book 7, as I still haven't learned about Lily and what is the true deal with aunt petunia. I think book 7 will be chock full of suprises as book 6 definately. Although it is not my favorite, It blends well with the series and is a great book, Gread job JK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About Snape...","review":"The biggest mystery of this series is the true character of Snape, the most fascinating character of the series. Rowling claims to find fans' fascination with Snape inexplicable, that she finds him straightforwardly horrible. But she keeps building in reasons to believe he may in fact be on the side of good. In this volume Rowling finally has Snape cross the line... or does she? There is still room for doubt, especially if you want to believe in Snape's redemption. We shall see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful job by Rowling!","review":"J.K. Rowling has done another wonderful job with the 6th installment of the Harry Potter series. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling continues to deliver","review":"Fabulous from the first page onward! Rowling has a gift in being able to create and portray an extraordinary alternative society of magic, which is compelling to read and is written in a manner which is appealing to adults as well as children. She includes and understands the angsts of being a teenager, conveying situations which transcend whether you're at Hogwarts or a Muggle school, and does so in a way that does not interfere with the larger issues at hand. Her use of humor ranges from subtle to satiric, and her characters' use of persuasive conversation is a joy to read. This book builds on the preceding ones, and it is highly recommended they be read first to appreciate and follow the current situations, motives, and references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxiously awaiting Book 7","review":"Just last night I finished Book 6. It was well-written with plenty of suspense and I had a very hard time putting it down! It is interesting to note the growth of the characters; the author has done a superb job in allowing them to mature over the years.I was shocked by the tragic occurrence toward the end of the book and it just leaves me looking forward to Book 7.

I do not mind cliff hangers, but, it appears this book was written just to cash in on the fame of the others.I think the book will be better, if you can start book seven when you put down book six.In all, if you want to feel cheated and like you just wasted time reading something that you will have re-read when the last book is released, then dive in.

It was engrossing. Rawlings has to review interlocking story lines from the previous books in this series and she does it flawlessly. I would actually have liked a little more review since I had forgotten some things. It's easy to pick out possible little defects in a great book but , without giving away the big secrets, I could not be sure that the death of _____ was really at the hands of ______, appearances to the contrary. After all, _____ was a hero in a previous book. But maybe the reader was meant to be mislead?

Its a good read for a child and an adult for just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Friendship, treachery, and death are three words which aptly encompass the spirit of the penultimate installment of J.K. Rowling riveting \\"Harry Potter\\" series. While not the most action packed of the series, a strong emphasis is given to the continuing friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as the three are tested in a world that is in the midst of a magical war. Readers will find that plot twists and some rather shocking revelations abound; friendships are solidified; and lines are drawn in the sand, as the stage is set for what is surely to be a climactic finale to an incredibly absorbing series.A must read for all Potter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Half-Blood Prince?!","review":"WHo is that? What happened inb this book. I'd like to say that almost happened but not really.. J.K. Rowling is a good writer. And this series has become very popular and it seems as though all the fans are waiting. What is happen next?! J.K Rowlings style of writing hasn't changed. She keeps the text fresh and real. This keeps us into the story and holds us till the end. She adds gossip and alittle drama to keep the book moving. I guess killing characters off seems to be a new addition to the books that changes the flow of the book and where it is headed."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Harry hit","review":"I gave this book a 4 and not a 5, because the time turner segment of Prisoner of Askaban was such perfect writing it earned that five. With this book we are out of the dark and depressing atmosphere of book 5 and back to lots of kid interaction at Hogwarts, which is what I've always loved about the series. The plot of this book was a bit simple, but the writing is still so good. I loved it. I enjoyed watching the kids become teens with all the associated hormones and love spats. Who will finally end up dating who? My 13 and 10 year old boys are not yet done with the book and can't wait to find out. Just like the other books, no such thing as \\"typical \\" Harry Potter fare.

Though it is slow in parts and had a rather unorthadox ending to it. If buying this for a child you should be warned that this book is a little more dramatic than the other books released. Also one of the main characters dies. I will not say who as to spoil the book for you. It took me 3 days to read it so the book does draw you into it with the desire to see how it ends. the book has some punch to it as well. It left me with the feeling of what will harry do next.

After the drama and trauma of Books 4 and 5, The Half Blood Prince provides a bit of welcome respite. There is time for Harry and Dumbledore to explore Voldemort's backstory, time for Harry to fall in love and enjoy one last (relatively) carefree year. But, like the calm in the hurricane's eye, the peace is short-lived and soon the fierce winds of evil and betrayal strike at the very heart of Hogwarts.I found this to be, without question, the best book in the series so far. Despite its 650+ pages, it is a fast read, and it does an excellent job in setting the stage for the final showdown between Voldemort and Harry. The first chapter of the book, which shows the intersection of the Wizard and Muggle worlds at the political level, is sheer brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter and the half blood prince","review":"another exelent book in the harry potter series cant wait till the next book comes out but i have it allready ordered through amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, saddening, but resilient","review":"Well, I must say that I waited on pins and needles for my copy of HBP to arrive on the afternoon of July 16th. I have only just finished it (it is 2:15 in the morning in my time zone). I found this installation of the series particularly moving. JKR goes into much more detail about the pasts of several of her beloved characters and some of the more hated of the bunch. I'll try not to say much on that note because I hate spoilers. Rest assured that this adventure lives up to the name and will wisk you away to Harry's world most convincingly. This is definately worth your time. It is no longer a \\"children's\\" book (as the characters are no longer children) and anyone who says otherwise has not properly read it. The story is moving, heartbreakingly sad, spirit-lifting, and humourous. This is everything a novel should be, regardless of genre. I raise my glass to JK Rowling and her beautifully spun characters and say, \\"Well done!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a prince of a story","review":"The movie based on the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, is coming out this year. Start with this book if you've already seen the other movies and don't want to read the first five. This is the penultimate in J. K. Rowling's series, and it continues with some of the same themes as the previous volumes as it builds to the conclusion in the seventh book. As she says, seven is a magical number, and it also figures into the plot of Half-Blood Prince, named for the unknown former owner of Harry's Potions textbook. The Prince's handwritten margin notes help Harry out on more than one occasion and not just in his school work. Half-Blood Prince answers a few nagging questions, such as why Voldemort thinks he's immortal and why the Defense Against the Dark Arts teaching position is a revolving door. It also seems to settle the matter of Snape's allegiance, but I'm reserving judgment until I've completed the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared the bejeebers out of me!!!!","review":"This must be the scariest book ever written!

If forced to single out my favourite passage, I would say that it would have to be when Harry and his fellow wizards liberate Ireland and Scotland from the the evil force which is the decadent crown of the \`United' kingdumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry and Ginny Forever!!","review":"I just re-read this book for the 2nd time and am just blown away with the attention to details and past story line connections. As a middle aged person, I can't believe how I am so caught up in this world; well, yes, I can. It is because J.K. Rowling manages to bring children from pre-teens into almost young adults with such universal emotional development that we call can relate to. Harry Potter is no saint; he breaks rules and dismisses authority, but he is someone who learns and never gives up. He went from having no one, to having friends who are loyal and true. And he got his first real girlfriend, a girl who watched him grow into the man who must sacrifice her for his ultimate mission in life. Once book seven is written, what will I do without the continuing adventures of this group...supposing they all live after the final confrontation with You Know Who."},{"rating":"2","title":"The - Blood Prince: Whos your patronas?!","review":"Hello, Gandolf here, just returned from Azkaban prison where I was falsely accused by Voldemort.

Sincerely,Gandolf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but...","review":"This book is very good. I could not stop reading it. However, at the end, I was disappointed by the fact that the end was... abrupt. I think that too many things were left to the next book.Honestly, considering the task left to H. Potter, one book may not be enough. May be we will have eight, nine books.It may be good for the writer, but, for a reader... it is frustating to wait too long for the end of the history. And this creates great expectations, so, at the end the author risks some disappointed fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to the next one","review":"As always, I enjoyed reading about Harry and his friends - and enemies - but I felt this was more of a build up to book seven than a complete story. What it has done is set in place a great foundation for the final book, which I can't wait to read - even though I'm old enough to know better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR 9-12 YEAR OLDS","review":"As a mother, I wanted to read this book before handing it over to my 9 year old (who has read the first 5, as well as myself). I can honestly say that she won't be allowed to read it any time soon. I will tell her basically what happens and who the Half-Blood Prince is and such to save her the agony of longing to know what happens next, but it is too dark for her to read at this tender age. It is VERY dark (more so than #4 and #5), and also talks about teenage urges that I'd rather not have my 9 year old worrying about just yet. The werewolf stuff is really savage, as well as the Inferie (sp?). The betrayal and then death is also very devastating. I just don't think that 9 - 12 year olds should go through that emotional roller coaster, and be exposed to such darkness in Harry Potter's world at this point. This book would be OK for about ages 15 and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"Just finished reading this book and only if you (like millions other people) continue to read the series - read it, otherwise it's waste of time. It's clearly miidle-of-the series book (well almost-the-end-book may be if rumors are right). Not too much action, very much water, most characters are two-dimentional. I've read this book in two evenings - much less than other five...Half-Blood Prince mistery is not mistery at all - you read and see...Still, Rowlings writes quite well - so two stars are only for that, but she really needs improvement for a finale..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is junk.","review":"The characters that she developed so well in the previous books were simply not themselves. There really did not seem to be a plot until about 500 pages into the book...until then it was just some kids I hadn't read about in the previous books going to school and having relationship problems. After that the storyline was unbelievably forced. If book 7 is this bad, children and adults everywhere might just give up on reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"illeagal?","review":"No way this is a Legal Version of the book. Rowling is a total bit.... Witch when it comes to ebooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stage is set for book 7","review":"The action keeps moving along in book 6, which has set an awsome stage for book 7. The final showdown between Voldermort and Harry. The unfortunate loss of a major character really thickens the plot for this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Harry Potter Book in the Series","review":"This Harry Potter book in is the best one in the series because it is very exciting and has lots of little fun things in it that are very entertaining. It is really sad at the end. If you want to read an engaging book with lots of romantic events, this is the book for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the series!","review":"Unlike several of the other reviews - I am going to refrain from sprinkling spoilers throughout my review.Read this one in a weekend - and enjoyed it thoroughly.I have to report there is much less whining by Harry Potter than in #5 - much to my relief.This book pushes the story ahead more efficiently than the others... however it does so without the charming side plots featured in the other books (the comic relief) - the main side plot in this one involves evidence of the main characters maturing and developing other interests. In #5 my favorite side bit was George & Fred's development of their various joke candies, etc. It was a great long set up to a gloriously funny chaotic scene. That funny element really isn't present in this book.This one is slightly darker than the last - definitely more mature. I eagerly await the final book!If you want to continue reading reviews - I warn you to be careful as you progress - loads of SPOILERS below!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This An Example of Writer's Block?","review":"Easily this is one of the worst Harry Potter books. Easily the first five hundred pages could be cut. The first three books in the Potter series were enchanting...what happened? The magical and delicious writing has turned into a dizzying and boring series of silly teenage \\"gasp\\" omg's strung together to make a book. J.K. Rowling where are you??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Longwinded and poorly edited","review":"Rowling's writing is going downhill--that, or her editors have put her on such a high pedestal that they don't feel as though they have the right to edit her work anymore, which is NOT good. Book 1 was FABULOUS because the editors hacked away everything except that which was necessary--EVERY little detail came full circle in the end; there was no extraneous nonliterary mumblegoo. 'Tis not the case with her most recent books, particularly this one, which had absolutely zero resolution in it. Save for the fact it has a cover and numbered pages, it can hardly qualify as a book. If you're a Potter fan and you haven't read book 6 yet, wait until book 7 is available. Books 6 and 7 apparently will be functioning as one story as far as plot, climax, and resolution are concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"and the end draws near...","review":"This is a much darker, more mature book. By the end, schoolyard pranks are playing a backseat and the gang learns what it means to put friendship and loyalty ahead of everything else.Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up before our eyes.This book grabbed hold and did not let up. It is more than just a kid's book (for anyone who has been living in a cave these last few years). It deals with human emotions and the trials of growing up. That's what makes it such a great story... it's more than magic, witchcraft and wizardry..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little darker","review":"I finished the book today. I definately felt it was much much darker than the previous books. I could have done without some of the teenage/developmetal angst that was threaded through the book. All in all I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a bit disappointing...","review":"As was many others, I was very excited to read the newest installment of J.K. Rowling's immensley popular series. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is quite intriguing, and gives us a lot of answers, but I just couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. This time around, Jo produced an exceptional book, but one that lacked part of the atmosphere of the others. It is definitely the darkest book in the series, and many dark things do happen. This year, for Harry, seems very different from his previous years and the book is lacking some of the other book's humor, which is to be expected considering the darker tone of this book. Due to this, I would not recommend these books for very little kids, because it is an emotional book. Some of the events and feelings that take place in the book seem a little bit awkward and out of place. Still, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a book I'm sure other Potter fans like me will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Returns!","review":"J.K. Rowling has another great book, with \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" Half Blood Prince has adventure, and all the tough parts of being a teen. I loved this book. It was very entertaining, suspenseful, and quite funny and quirky. There are different surprises: adventurous, and romantic: Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, etc, etc. I think this book will appeal to about ten through adult, because it mgiht be difficult for younger kids who do not understand a few words such as snog and such. Overall, though, this was very entertaining and charming and adventurous, this is a must even if you are not a fan of HP this book will make you one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"J.K. Rowling Does It Again!","review":"This is a really good book. This book is about Harry in his sixth year of Hogwarts. Harry is suspicious of Malfoy and Dumbledore teaches Harry lessons so that he will be prepared when he has to fight Lord Voldemort. Hermoine and Ron are also mad at each other for a little while. I started it last week and have about 200 more pages to go..so I can't really comment on the ending. The rest of the book is very good and I haven't been able to put in down. This book does not have as much adventure as the other books but it is still really good. I can't wait until book 7 comes out. Read the other Harry Potter books before this one or you will be lost. Run to the book store and pick up this book now!P.S.-I'm not a kid- I don't have a login"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry in confused times","review":"Just finished the last book. As some reviews rightly pointed this book needed serious editing. Lot of snogging and very little actual stuff. And please the journey to the cave and the BOAT!! it felt like I am watching some very old contrived horror movie and drinking unknown stuff and dumbledore going crazy and finally dying. I was so confused and so thoroughly disappointed by the plot twist that it was unbelievable. And Snape killing dumbledore its pretty obvious there will be some serious twists in the next novel very obvious. Harry falling in love with Ginny! and yes the very spidermannish finish Yuk, its nice to have some light stuff in an otherwise bleak novel but this was just too much. Jealousy snogging and parties felt very little magical mostly haphazard. Still looking forward to the last book something like the Matrix started out really strong right now I feel as if I watched the second movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry does it again. . .","review":"Again, a well written, engaging book. I bought this for my nieces and nephews and out of 3 books there were 2 cover to cover readings! The loss of a loved character prompted some good talks about the nature of loss and life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Turning Point","review":"This is the most emotional book of HP so far. In the first till third, you got adventure, and it got darken to terror; then in the fourth, you got a hell of competitions and a friend's death; with the fifth, the gathering and a tragic, shocking end while in this sixth, it got indeed very dark and emotional with more tragic death than the last one and the turning point of Harry's battle with Voldemort. This whole thing made it hard to guess what will the seventh book bring.Many questions about Voldemort's parents answered and the suspected would reveal himself, cold hearted. And the Half-Blood Prince? Read and be astounded.It was so exhalarating, surprising and moving. Worth the time and the effort to carry the heavy book everywhere I went :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually and Unfortunately Disappointed","review":"I was DYING to read this book and on the edge of my seat waiting for it to get here, for Sirius death to be validated and for us to advance in the plot. But I was disappointed. Though the plot advanced majorly, Sirius' death was NOT validated. I love the way COS was woven in and the use of the pensieve and Dumbledore finally being open with Harry, but the romance and predictability of the story really tore it down. It seems as if some of the plot was taken from horribly written fanfiction stories.The book really looks as if it has changed from a great fantasy story to a more media charged novel. With the movies and all the media hype, maybe Rowling has been blindsided.I love Rowling and the Harry Potter series, but I'm most definately disappointed. This book isn't horrible, but is has left me wondering how book 7 will turn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, exciting, and an emotional roller coster.","review":"Harry Potter's sixth installment is the best novel so far in the series. The love stories, and the back history of Tom Riddle kept me deep into the story until the very end. I did not move for hours. This book leaves a lot to be answered in the 7th novel, and I cannot wait for it to be finished. I highly recomend the recorded version by Jim Dale if you don't have time to read. He brings a whole life to the novel that completes the effect of J. K. Rowling's majical imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my most favourite bks in the series","review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was incredible. The ending left me in tears. At that point, you realize that naive trust in everyone can be abused and that not everyone has some good in them. Though not as full of humour as the Order of the Phoenix (Fred and George's pranks with Umbridge were absolutely hilarious!) and not filled with many Quidditch/competitive events (like the Triwizard Tournament) as in the Goblet of Fire, this one had more maturity. Another reviewer said that the death in this book could've been prevented if Harry had confided in his elders but I don't think that would've helped. Naive trust can be abused and was abused in this case. Overall, this one and the Goblet of Fire are my two favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but not what i expected","review":"Yes, i waited until 12:00 to get it. Yes, i finished it in about 5 hours, and yes, it was a great book. But no, not what i expected from the stadard JK usually has. I know that it was written just to set up the seventh book, but i expected better. Halfway though the book didn't even sound like JK's writing style. Oh, well, i'm still going out at midnight to get the seventh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was she under the Imperious Curse?","review":"Was JK rowling under the Imperious curse when she wrote this book? The entire thing was just very boring and tedious, and what was with all the sudden relationships? I mean come one. Could they stop making out for one minute and take a breather and get to some actual story and character development. The beginning of the book was probably the best because it started out with a nice flow, unlike previous books from the series. And near the end of the book, something happens that will most likely make you say, \\"What the heck did she just do?\\". I think many people will be disapointed with this book, but im sure there will be a lot who will absolutely love it and say its the best one yet. This book was just highly disappointing and Rowling better get cured of that Imperius curse and right a book that closes this series with a bang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment . . . Don't waste your $","review":"I've read the 5 preceding books and was really looking forward to this installment. However, I would not recommend it and struggled along through some very dull text in the middle section to even finish it. There is very little action, no real spells gone wrong, mysterious adventures in the castle, or in town, and frankly a whole lot of NOTHING. The main characters have become teens, so there is some drivel about who has a crush on whom, but it seemed irrelevant to the story. Several of the characters we have been introduced to so far seemed to play only minor roles in the story line (ie Hagrid, Professor McGonnall). And in the final battle, they killed off a very popular character (who I won't name here), but I'm sure the loss will disappoint many fans. I won't be getting book 7. I would prefer to remember this as an amusing series, and hope that I will forget the disappointment of book 6 in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed after reading this book. It read like an overzealous, teen-age angst fan fiction. there was no substance at all, it seems liked the ending was a set-up for book seven. it was fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed","review":"I did not receive this book. I got an email several days after my order stating that the person could not find the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter Tapes","review":"When my wife plays the tapes they skip in places. We have tried different players and that didn't help, they still skiped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very suspensful, I suggest you read this book!!!","review":"Okay,I have to disagree with that smart alecky 10 yr old! Buy this item!! It is very interesting, and I could not stop reading it!!! But I did have to give it 4 stars because of the ending! (But I will not ruin it for you so I won't share the sad event) But if you do not enjoy reading books with deaths, then this might not be the best book for you. I am an 11 yr old girl, and adore these books! Yes Harry and Ginny like each other, but its not dirty or gross! And I think that kid that commented on here too forgot to add the part where it is Ron that has the girl all over him not Harry! (But none of the events are dirty!!)I just can't wait until the seventh book comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, but ultimately disappointing","review":"Ms. Rowling does have an engaging way with words--I've read this tome twice. However, the second perusal was more or less to spot any foreshadowing or an escape clause that concerns the climactic event. Said disturbing happenstance is the second in two books that has turned my Harry Potter experience into something of a love/hate affair. I love reading the books--I've hated the endings of the last two installments. I also miss the sense of wonder that permeated the first four. The books have, sadly in my case, acquired more of the darkish tone of the movies.Hopefully, the seventh and supposedly final book will offer a less disappointing conclusion. At this point I'm hooked and have no choice but to finish the experience off. I do however hope that Ms. Rowling has only been toying with us to set up a special finale. Personally, I can get enough real life in real life thank you. But like this book's ending or not, it's a page-turner the first time through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling is at it again!!!","review":"I loved this book with all me heart and soul. The chapters were quick, the action fast paced, and the anwsers to my satisfaction. Fans of the series should be warned that this book is very sad because for the first time in the series, one can actually see it coming to an end. Yes, Mrs. Rowling has set the stage, and the events that will carry us through the rest of the series have now been set into motion. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book....less \\"snogging\\" next time please!","review":"As the title suggests, it's a good book. I thought Rowling went a bit astray in the 5th book, but this book makes up for it. Nicely written, definitive plot, twists, turns whatever you expect from a harry potter book. My few complaints are, as some other reviewer suggested, some mature content unsuitable for children as well as the way harry potter reacts to the \\"death\\". Reminded me nastily of the 5th book again. So, in conclusion, Great Book, Great Reading, for the author, next time, less snogging would help a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like the first five books, it was really awful!!!","review":"Way to dark and boring. Much to much making out and kissing! Plus killing off such a strongly loved character bad idea. THIS BOOK WAS IN SHORT A WASTE OF TIME! Nothing mythyical or fun happend in this book. I hated it. I have read and enjoyed all the other HP books and I may be done with this series forever. JKR Please Please Please look at how many people are disappionted and go back to your old writing style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Suspense Continues","review":"I was thinking that this book would tell that the Half Blood Prince was Harry, but J. K. Rowling kept the suspense up until near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen Fry version of Audio CD almost 200 bucks!","review":"This review is not for Harry, it's for the shmucks who are selling the British version of the audio book at such a disgusting price. I have listened to books 1-5 read by Stephen Fry, purchased at a reasonable price in Europe (EUR 30 to EUR 50), only to come back and find all the American versions read by Jim Dale. Sorry, but 20 seconds of Dale was like nails on a blackboard compared to Fry. As of December 26, 2011, Amazon's price for Fry's version of Half-Blood Prince is a whopping $199.00! Does Stephen Fry come to my house and read it to me personally? Why is it so expensive? I'll have to have a friend ship me a copy from Europe unless someone out there wants to sell me their British CDs. Anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of my life!!!!","review":"Well... I have to say that this book got me in trouble... My parents found out that I have bought the six book ( my parents banned me from reading Harry Potter) I love Harry Potter!!! My parents had to hide all the books from me... that was sad... I wanted to say that if you are in to fiction books... you have to read the whole series... i think its best not to watch the movies first because you'll say... who's that? and what's that?... well... of course there is only one option left!!! and that is to read the book... you can also find lots of interesting Harry Potter news on [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"definetly what i expected","review":"wow this turned out to be an awsome book, i knew that i would never be dissappointed by a harry potter book. though i have no idea what so ever how she is going to wrap ALL of this up in 1 more book, theres so so so very much to cover. The end left me hanging and with much to think about, its kind of sad that we have to wait like 2 more years to get the 7th book (i think its already written also) but eh, all the more suspense i guess, yes very good, if you havnt read any of the harry potter books, or you wont let your children read it or soemthing because of witches n stuff, stop that and read them!, they are absolutly amazing books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's at it again","review":"This has got to be J.K. Rowlings' best piece of work yet.If you've read the first four you'll be suprised at this one.This has an intersting twist of emotions.From love to death to all around adventure.This is one book you won't want to put down,I know I couldn't!! This is definatly for \\"wizards\\" of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediocre Start, Superb Ending...Mature Subject Matter","review":"First, let me say that this was an entertaining book. The final 200 pages of this make for a great read with secrets revealed, action aplenty, and a great set-up for what will be the final book in the septology. The first 450 pages were entertaining, and filled with lots of characterization and romance, but were sorely lacking in thrills and action.NOTE:My 9-year old son devoured the first five books in the series earlier this year. He started to read this book and lost interest before finishing the first four chapters. \\"Dad, is there any fighting?\\" he asked. I also think the death of _______________ and the other characters' reactions to the situation would have gone right over his head. When he picks up the book again in five years to reread it, I am hopeful he will more fully appreciate Rowling's excellent handling of the characters and situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and informative","review":"This book helps to explain much of what happens before Harry was born, mostly about how Voldemort came about. It fills in a lot of blanks but it leaves you frustrated and wanting more. I cant wait to read it again and then on to book VII"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Hate","review":"I think JK is a fantastic author and I really enjoy these books. This book is great and wonderful and I want everyone who is a Harry Potter fan to read it and make up their own mind. But part of me really didn't like it. (IF YOU HAVENT READ,DONT READ AHEAD! )I feel that Harry has lost enough in his life. He has lost everybody that means the most to him. I think its a depressing book with too many unanswered questions. Its great to leave your readers with questions, so they will be interested in the next and last installment. However, I think it left too many. it was like it was just a filler book. Even though, there were many many important things covered as well. All in all, I did enjoy the book despite some of the plot. and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well connected plot elements","review":"The characters are more three dimensional and mature, the plot more comlicated, and the interconnection between plot elements is more seamless than ever.Without giving anything way, it seems to me that Snape's first loyalty is to himself, and that he must have known his decision would irrevocably mark hm as a hunted outcast - a decision he wouldn't have made unless he thought he could be protected somehow.This book proves that those in authority don't always know what's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-o-r-i-n-g!!!","review":"The sixth book in the wildly popular \\"Harry Potter\\" series drags along, and seems like the diary of an old lady. No action whatsover. Now, don't get me wrong, I am a die hard HP fan. This book just didn't justify my expectations.Dumbledore applauds himself for every acheivment, while we plod through pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of silly, lifeless romance, with no depth or meaning. There are so many things to get you wondering, but it's not a satisfying kind of suspense, more of a \\"get on with it\\". It seems like our beloved JKR is content with being unbelievably rich, and has stopped putting the magic into this once great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Penultimate Potter!!!","review":"...well, if you, the reader, hsve ever read any of my prior reviews, you must know what i will say of this magnificent novel.

I can't say anything more than what i've said to convince you that this is one of, if not THE, most magnificent series i have ever read. Period.I cannot wait for the final book to be released.The final battle has begun.

This book was suprisingly good. J.K. Rowling is an incredible author. She writes so well! The 6th Harry Potter is packed full of surprises and different twists that will blow you away.Harry is changing so much in this book and is on his way to adulthood.

I would recommend it to anyone that has enjoyed the past five books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My Goshhhhhhhh!!!!!","review":"This book is so boring. I am glad that i borrowed it from the library and not bought it, especially at the price that its sold for. I read the first four chapters and i have to say, it was soooooooooooooo boring.

Although you have to because it is to long. This book is at the reading level for ages 13 through 18. Mostly adults read this book. I know, the length scared me too. I read it in about three weeks though and ths review is for a grade. This book is not for the traveling type. I really wouldn't take it anywhere.

In this case: NOT: lousy flat characters, often awfully stereotype (harry and ron and their interaction with girlfriends). Plus - guess what, the story goes on - keeps the bucks rolling too. Having been a fan from the start I decided this is my last Potter - and I could have done without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this series?","review":"I could go on and on about all the things wrong with these books, however, from my perspective it seems as though J.K.

It is almost as if a CRAZED political pundit has put his gorilla thumbs all over the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Taking","review":"Everything about this story is excellent.J. K. Rowling solidified her position as the best character creator in the history of writing with this book. Reading this book is like a train ride that takes you on a journey to discover levels of detail in characters that seemed impossible before. From Voldemort to Dumbledore and from Harry Potter to Snape, there's so much revealed about the characters over the course of the story. It creates the perfect build up to a grand finally.Also, the previous two books in the series were a little light on imagination, but J. K. Rowling is back with an imaginative vengeance in this installment of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Never Be Able to Pick a Favorite Harry Potter Book","review":"I guess whichever Harry Potter book I'm reading at the moment is my favorite. :-) It's been a pleasure to follow along with Harry, Ron and Hermione as they mature into young adults. Sooooooooo ... maybe they're getting a bit more moody with each book, but what teenager doesn't. After finishing Book 6, I got a tad verklempt because there's only one book left ... we think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The darkest, and in some ways the best, of all seven","review":"Everyone (children and adults) loves a great \\"good vs. evil\\" story. I often think that something that everyone raves about just can't be as good as the say, but Harry Potter exceeds the reviews.The incredibly rich detail in all the Harry Potter novels is really the best aspect of the story. JKR creates a whole world that readers can't forget about. There many subplots, but JKR keeps them all straight.While this book is definitely dark, JKR manages to keep many humorous and lighter aspects of the previous books, parts not shown in the movie. This book pulls you in and will not let you go, as it is the cliff-hanger before the finale. It will leave you crazy until you read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.I can't tell you how great all the books in this series are, you'll have to read them for yourself. Harry Potter is the new Star Wars, the new Lord of the Rings. It already is a legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Harry Potter Book","review":"This book is so good. I love all the Harry Potter books, but this one especially. At the end, I was so mad at Snape I just felt like jumping into the book and performing the crucacious curse on him (yes, I am aware that doing this is highly illegal and cruel, but still, you get my point: I hate Snape). Surprisingly, I actually felt bad for Malfoy because his life has been torn apart by Voldemort. One thing I really liked about it was how you got to look into Voldemort's past, before he turned himself into a monster, when he was still just Tom Riddle. Another thing I like is how half the book was taken up by stuff about relationships (especially the part when Harry and Ginny kissed). That made it more fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always but than expected","review":"Themselves delivers just when they said that it delivered.

He realizes he is the only one who can defeat Lord Voldemort, and spends much time with Professor Dumbledore gaining insight into the Dark Lord's early life. Harry also finds time for Quidditch and a girlfriend, while often sparing with his old enemies, Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy. Although the book is filled with overlong speeches, Jim Dale's clever voices more than hold your attention.The audio cassette edition is excellent. Versatile actor Jim Dale does more than just read the book; he performs it, using a unique voice for every character, so it's like listening to a movie. His voice is very easy on the ear; he reads at just the right speed and makes each page exciting.This 12-cassette, 19-hour edition is fun anytime, but would be especially entertaining while commuting or on a long car trip. I heartily recommend it to fans of the Harry Potter series.Kona"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Harry Potter classic!","review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a must read for all fantasy book fans.

Can't wait for the next one. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Rowling is Back","review":"I've followed along with the publication of each of the books as an adult without the benefit of saying I was reading them for my children. I've read them all purely for my own enjoyment. Books one and four top the list as favorites. I felt book five was interesting, dark and slow; I was suspicous that perhaps J.K. Rowling had lost her touch. But this book rivals Goblet of Fire as the new favorite. It's thrilling and likely for it's most infamous plot twist, a tad confusing - intentionally so, I'm sure. I now am more than ever anxiously awaiting book seven so I can determine if what I read in this book is in fact what it seems. The plot thickening is understating the turn of events that occur in this installment. Potter fans will be horrified and thrilled once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW......Amazing","review":"i was so excited when i got this.. i went to the midnight maddness at the local chapters so i got it around 12:20 and i imediatly went home and read the first 100 pages. i took a break and finished the rest... it takes a while to get into, as the beggining is slow (yet amusing) but it really starts to build up and the last 100 (or so) pages are Phenominal.

A good, thrilling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was okay","review":"The book was definately less eventful than the previous books, but it still was good. It seemed to be a transitional period from book five to book seven. Also, the events seemed rushed and like they were just there to say something, and then gone. Like, Dobby and Kreacher only reported to Harry once and boom, he got his information. Speaking of these two house elves - they keep repeating the point that you can't apparate or disapparate on Hogwarts grounds, but, Dobby and Kreacher apparate and disapparate!!!! Ron even says he wishes he could disapparate like a house elf. So why, if you can't apparate or disapparate on Hogwarts grounds, can Dobby and Kreacher!!! That confused me a lot, if you have any thoughts, let me know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changes Everything!","review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a tight, convoluted mystery novel that has changed the Harry Potter series forever. By the end of the book Harry Potter's world has been overturned so completely that the Seventh Book should bear little resemblance to the ones that came before it.This book also reveals many secrets including:The identity of the Half-Blood Prince.The reason that the DADA position changes every year.The secrets of Tom Riddle's (Lord Voldemort's) past.How Voldemort was able to survive the attempt to kill baby Harry.This book ends with the shocking death of a main character at the hands of the person least expected to be a traitor.

Or is she trying to evolve into a dark fantasy writer for adults ? I used to like Harry Potter for its delightful simplicity yet complex wondrous magical world building. It used to be a joy to read Harry's and company's adventures. But somehow from Book 5 onwards, Harry Potter no longer delivers. Book 6 has deteriorated further. Just do not understand the popularity of this series. For those of you who are still a child at heart I recommend the following instead, coming of age books featuring child protagonists which are notches above Rowling's writings, - \\"In the Castle of the Flynns\\", \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", the darker \\"Boy's Life\\", Fantasy/Sci-fi \\"Finity's End\\", \\"Tripoint\\", \\"Rider at the Gate\\", \\"Cloud's Rider\\", \\"Balance of Trade\\", \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Warchild\\" and even the horror \\"IT\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"four out of five ain't bad","review":"This review was perfect, and I had to quote from William Norton.\\"Save your money.

Everything in it, included the 'twist' at the end, was completely predictable. The one thing that wasn't was the couples. Harry/Ginny? What the hell? Harry never saw Ginny in a romantic light, ever, then BOOM! He's in love with her.The whole Ron/Hermione thing was predictable, but it has no support. They make a lame couple, and Ron is hardly mature. This entire book was a waste of my time.

I would not recommend buying this through Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I enjoyed it but it wasn't as good as it could be","review":"This was a okay book but a lot of words were said about nothing, especially in the first 3rd. It was a bit fluffy and all over the place and Dumbledore is made out to be pretty dumb and it kind of shows how dumb he was in the other books. Hermione and Ron are pretty weird how they don't believe Harry's suspicions. It's not like he doesn't have a history with this sort of thing. So even though parts were more mature, parts were still very unrealistic and over drawn out for suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointment.....","review":"652 pages, and through 632 of them, Rowling was still at her best. But the last chapter was extremely disappointing. She leaves us with something like the cliff-hanger TV programs that end \\"To Be Continued\\". I guess we'll have to wait another two or three years to see what she has in store for us. I can't fully express my disappointment without disclosing elements of her plot, so I guess you'll just have to read it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince","review":"This book serves as a set up for the final book of the series: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I highly recommend starting at the beginning of the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.Barring that at least watch the movies up to Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix. In Half Blood Prince we learn the secret of Voldemort's power. We get some more back ground on the characters. Harry finds love and there is a major calamity in store for him. A great book but it will make best sense if the reader is familiar with the series. Also, this book was worth reading as it sets up the Deathly Hallow book, making Deathly Hallows much more coherent and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider-man","review":"This story was a very good story that left me very depressed in the end.

It seemed as if half of the book could have been cut out because it was so dull or useless. J.K. Rowling seems to have stoped trying to make a good book or something. It has a dull boring meaningless begining and a rushed, dark, terrible ending. This is the worst book in the series, the best is the 3rd. I hope the 7th is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Buy!","review":"Ok, now this book was not what anyone was expecting, im sure. Jam packed with some much action and suspense that you cannot stop reading. It did, i have to admit, contain some parts that were not very mind captivating, but i guess thats how all books are. However, the use of imagery is incredible. J.K. Rowling is a fabulous writer and when it comes to putting pictures in your mind, she is the best. She definatly makes it so that it flows with the rest of the series and does not jump around too much, causing havoc to the reader. This is definatly the best book of the series, and is a very good beginning to what is going to be the best book ever written (the 7th book of the series), at least I am hoping for a thick, action/adventure novel complete with imaginative imagery, and suspense filled chapters. This book is a definate buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as great as my experts hoped","review":"I've enjoyed reading this special series to my children who are 13 and 11.

I myself would have given it 3 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but do I have to wait another 2 years?!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. There are a lot of things that you finally learn about \\"He Who Must Not Be Named\\" - you know, he's named that because you can't really hope to spell it correctly without doing a google search. Finally we get a closer look into the man who became the menace. We also get to know Dumbledor better as well. More character development and maturation occurs here than in many of the other books.

Rowling sets the stage for Book 7 and I am curious to read more, although there are a lot of unanswered questions going into the final book.Maybe I got sucked into it, but I enjoyed the short romance between Harry and Ginny. I do agree with some of the other reviews in that this book didn't need to be as long as it was.

I found myself not caring about the characters or what they where doing. Hermione might as well have been a cardboard cutout that Harry towed around with him.Harry's obsession with stalking Malfoy didn't make a terrible amount of sense other then making me feel like Harry has nothing better to spend his free time on then trying to stir up trouble. It seems like he will take any small event and try to turn an adventure out of it.

I HATED her in this book. Aside from the ridiculous level of her jealousy and anger, she was so stuck up and completely insufferable about the fact that Harry was outdoing her in Potions. Get over yourself!!! But I really was glad to see that Harry matured a lot, in Book 5 he would have thrown a tantrum at the Minister of Magic, now he just sets him straight clearly without all the dramatics. Anyways, I was very disappointed in the book like so many reviewers before me, I feel like the author was just filling in the gap between numbers 5 & 7. I'm glad I borrowed the book & didn't buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The war has definately begun...","review":"This year is unlike any Harry has seen yet. An obivous foe has a (seemingly) very important task from a very important person. There is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher that is definately unlike any before him/her. There is plenty of teen angst to go around for the whole trio. Hormones are a-blazin.But these things aren't nearly as important as the task set before Harry by none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry learns a lot this year. He gets answers to many many questions. And he must deal with the Prophecy repeated to him at the end of book 5.This book is darker than any of the 5 before it. A war has been waged. How many casualties will there be? Who will these casualties be? Many of the answers will leave your mouth hanging open.Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"It's been difficult for me to get into the Harry Potter books, having already seen all of the movies to this point. However, when the theatrical release of this film was pushed back into 2009, I thought now was a good time to try again with this one. THAN GOODNESS I DID! I've even started going backwards in the series.What a great read. Rowling's writing is quite good. The scenes are very well described, and the character development is exactly where it needs to be. Rowling really makes you care about the characters all throughout this book (as well as previous installments).I found the climax to be rewarding, and quite descriptive. I really cannot wait to see the new ideas in the book brought to life in the movie.For those who've found the books difficult to get into, and have seen the movies, this one is a GREAT read while waiting for the \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" to debut in the theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This book was an amazing story.

It is for young adults and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Harry","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with the writing in this book, as I feel that J.K. Rowling has changed the way in which she writes for the second-to-last novel in the series. Unlike other reviewers, I feel that Rowling may have swayed too much in thinking about the sure-to-come movie of this book, and may not have written as truly as she has for the other novels in the series. I found the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore less believable this time around, and Harry's spitting frustration a little hard to take at times.However, all of that being said, there are some very funny, laugh-out-loud parts in this book, and overall I enjoyed reading this novel.My recommendation would be that, if you have not read book 5 in some time, re-read it prior to beginning book 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically, amazing!","review":"Unbelievable! JK's on a roll and if the next one is even better than this one she may be put down as one of the greatest authors of all time! I'd rate it 6 stars (for book six) if I could. Harry really starts to see Dumbledore as a real friend, the weasley's are going to have someone familiar in the family, Malfoy starts acting odd and old Snape finally shows his true colors with an astonishing death. Harry finally sees why he must destroy Voldemort(thats right I said his name}and discovers what Voldemort (I said it again)was like when he was a kid and what he has turned himself into.And maybe the power love may be useful in more ways than harry thinks. It really has a good ending so that you can't wait for the next book! Sheesh! I can't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"The first half of the book was rather uneventful but the last 300 pages or so was amazing...

Many things have been further developed and explained.I have to say that because of the way events were resolved at the end, however, I am NOT as eager for the seventh book as I'm sure I would have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ~ can't wait for book 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"One of JK Rowling's best in the series yet! This book was the perfect length having each chapter entice the reader to stay up a wee bit later and keep reading!!! All favorite characters are back and many more adventures occur; there is darkness as expected and a few creepy instances but overall a superb next installment of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues to amaze","review":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood prince continues the story of magic, that was started when Harry Potter entered Hogwarts what seems so many years ago. Now in his sixth year at Hogwarts Harry will continue in his epic struggle against Voldermort with the assistance of Dumbledore, the mysterios Half-Blood Prince, and of course his old pals from the D.A.I can say that the journey is darker this time and is prbly not the most appropiate thing for small children. Yet, despite the death, war, and mayhem Rowling still mantains her wonderful ability to weave a story that awakens the inner child.Favorite thing about this novel:At long last Harry Potter is leaving Harry the boy and has finally become Harry the Man.Worse thing about this novel: A lot of friendly old faces (Hagrid and Neville for example) are all but gone with only a few cameos. Though Luna Lovegood does have one very pleasing appereance during a Quidditch match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupefied","review":"Die-hard Harry Potter fans (like me) will certainly fall under Rowling's magical spell once again. While the book can sometimes be a bit wordy and repetitive, she has done an exceptional job of laying the groundwork for what should be a climactic conclusion. Not only do we come to understand why \\"he who must not be named\\" turned to the darkside, but we also learn exactly what Harry must do to (hopefully) destroy him once and for all. Readers beware-the ending will leave you reaching for the tissues and feeling like a dementor has sucked the happiness right out of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed","review":"sadly this book just did not cut it for me and is by far the worst book in the series first JK rowling plays it to be a good movie about nine chapters dedicated to dumbledore and harry I wanted something new and what next six chapters about girls I do not mind one or two and then at the end I feel like the story hardly moved I will still wait at midnight for the last one but I hope it's better than this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful . . . as always!","review":"A bit more on the dark side, but just as good as the rest. It's hard to believe we all have to wait two years for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I thought this book was really good. Finally things started happening that I had been wanting to happen for a while now. While I do wish there would have been as much action as there was in Goblet of Fire, I certainly wouldn't consider myself disappointed. Mrs. Rowling has done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Read","review":"Jim Dale does a great job reading this book. He clearly differentiates most of the voices and uses emphasis and acting abilities very effectively. The content itself is probably second only to the fourth HP in terms of quality.Anyway, it was well worth listening to, even after having read the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another can't put it down book.","review":"Just like the other books in the series, I'm having trouble putting this book down; however, the storyline isn't as intense as the other books. I'm ready to get to the exciting scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's done it again","review":"Jk Rowlings is a writer - It's going to be interesting to see what she does after Harry Potter because she's so good at writing about Harry and in Book 6, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince she does her best since the Prisioner of Azakaban. I do have one regret - I just wish Harry wouldn't lose everyone he cares about. I am looking forward to Book 5 with some regret...It will be over. Thanks to Ms. Rowling I and my 12 year old daughter have loved this journey. Take your time with the last one - we'll be waiting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Wow. I just finished it and I absolutely loved it. It was easily the best book and it just completely sets up what will happen in the 7th. Speaking of the 7th, I hope it comes out soon. I think that everyone wants to know what the final sentence that ends in 'scar' will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than book 5","review":"I thought this book was better than year 5. The last few chapters were very compelling you didn't want to put it down....until that last chapter!!! But you'll have to read it to find out how it ends....Still a good read. I'm now awaiting to see what is in store for the next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry - come back!","review":"Well - I was reading some of the other reviews, people are being far too critical and completely missing the point. Do remember what genre of book we are reading?? You can't take it all so seriously, its about the 'magic' (excuse the pun)!Well I loved it - I was enthralled from beginning to end and yes there were some bit that seemed abit repetitive - and it could have been shortened somewhat. BUT when I was reading it, I forgot everything else I becamse completely absorbed! It was funny, exciting, desperately sad...and I keep thinking about it since I finished the book. I have become 12 again and I am 27! Is it weird that I now think Harry is proberbly gorgeous??? What a hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading for grandkids","review":"They couldnt put the books down . Every morning I was greeted with\\"Oh grandpa thank you! thank you! Im on chapter _ Its So exciting!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely... you've not waited this long to buy it!","review":"Although all six books are about the same characters in the same settings, J. K. Rowling has managed to make each instalment in the Harry Potter saga starkly different from the others. Where book one started out with excitement - of an oppressed young man entering his rightful world for the first time - each successive book has taken the reader not just further into Harry Potter's story, but also deeper into his world. Book six peels away one more layer of mystery about Harry's purpose in life and sets the stage beautifully for the grand finale - book seven. Can't wait for it to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book was the most suspenseful, touching, shocking, and saddest books of series. I teared up a bit while reading it! Definately worth reading (as are the other books in the series. FYI: Many parts in the books do not make it to the films)! I was so completely shocked while reading the last two chapters. The Harry Potter series IS definately worth the hype!!! I can't wait to find out what happens in the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter","review":"Very good story, continued the masterful work and made me even more anxious for the last book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'll get to sleep tomorrow","review":"I read this book so fast that Im sure I missed some important clues but only one thing mattered to me- Romance for Harry atlast...The book was really dark...anyone under the age of 12 shouldnt come near this book. I was shocked by the ending- didnt leave me very satisfied. But still kept me reading all night long and now I have to go work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge step down for JKR","review":"The first 5 books of the HP series were extremely enjoyable and showed an enormous talent of the author. Book number 6, however, is bad! All the characters are there and the same terminology as ever. But there is almost no plot - just the description of the life of Harry and his friends and enemies. And of course there is the build up or accumulation of information and events towards ..... what?? Obviously - book number 7!I think this is a disgrace for such a talented author to write a whole book as a promo (an advertisement) for her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed in this book!!!","review":"I know this will offend many who are Harry Potter die hards but...I can't even put in to words how disappointing this series is getting. It started off so good (and the overall plot was decent but) the more books she writes the worse they get. I am totally in agreement with the review above; this book is like a bad episode of Saved by the Bell!!! I am so sorry I wasted my time reading it!! But you almost have to at this point.."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIller, filler and more filler with big type to boot","review":"This is not a book that deserves to be on the same shelf as the other 5 in the series.It was shorter than the last one, and I swear that they made the print bigger to get it to 650 pages.Most of the book was filler setting up for book 7. I liked the old school stuff about \\"he who must not be named\\", but the rest just seemed to droll along.The book seemed like it was rushed, which is a shame given the detail of the other 5.This one will be easy to do as a movie given that the whole story should be easy to tell in 90 minutes.Sorry, J.K., love the series, but this time, you let the fans down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling Does It Again!!","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is easily the best book you can read this summer. J.K. Rowling writes a wonderful novel about the beloved teenage boy, his loyal companions, and thrilling adventures. All 652 pages of this book are interesting and eventful. This is a must have for any fan of the series! Rowling creates and allows you to travel to a world that you can only imagine, filled with unique characters and distant lands. This book is like a ride that you never want to end. Pick up a copy today and experience the magic that is Harry Potter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet!","review":"Ever since the UPS man delivered Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, I couldn't put it down. If you didn't pre-order it, buy it now! In this installment you are drawn even more into Harry thoughts and feelings. There are parts of the book where you laugh and then there are parts when you will cry buckets. I don't want to reveal anything for those you aren't finished reading it yet.But there are so many mysteries at the start of the book, some are answered at the end and others we are going to have to keep waiting for the last installment. And I can't wait for that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!","review":"Harry's mood wasn't consistent with with the previous book (he should be more moody and crabby now, after all that's happened, shouldn't he?). The grammar and punctuation were terrible. There was too much kissing. There was too much gore. The only interesting parts came near the end. The rest was formulaic and nearly plotless. The whole thing was an overblown introduction to Book 7. If I had actually bought a copy (rather than borrowing it from the library), I would be very angry at having wasted my money. As it is, I'm angry that I wasted so much time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing and quickly written","review":"This book was a horrible disappointment for my whole family who have been hanging onto the hope that Rowling will write the final books with the flare and suspence that she wrote the first 3 books. She did not. The characters weren't developed to the standard of the first 3 books. Hermione would never have let the half-blood prince alone until she figured out who it was. Harry, Ron, and Hermione weren't up to their usual standards on searching the myserious happenings; just look at how they handled Moaning Myrtle. We were so horribly unimpressed by the writing in this book that we are not even sure there is a point in reading the 7th book other than to find out what she plans on doing with Harry. I won't be holding my breath for the next one and none of the kids I have spoken to will be either."},{"rating":"1","title":"JKR wandering off into the wilderness","review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the divergence point for Harry Potter. It's where the story goes wrong and JKR ends up wandering off, trying to create a story over which she had long since lost control. She turns Hermione Jane Granger - champion of underdogs and defender of Harry Potter and remakes her into Hermione Jean Granger - uber-twit and lover of all things Weasley. It's really sad and the whole story devolves down into an increasing circle of implausible decisions on Hermione's part and then on Harry's part - owing to the fact that he no longer has a strong, smart girl to stand by his side.Don't bother to read these last two works. They're claptrap at best and a soul-crushing disappointment at worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is by far the best in the series yetThe only problem is that the end is such a cliffhanger that waiting for the next book is going to be harder than ever before."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far... Rowling's Best!","review":"When this book arrived in the mail (on release day, thanks to the ever-speedy service of the wonderful Amazon.com) I started to read it instantly. I just couldn't put it down. As things become more serious in Harry's world the suspense goes over the top. It is of course wonderfully written and at it's end I literally wanted to cry. I'm 17 and not much of a \\"tearer\\" but the book's end (as well as the entire book) parallels with real teenage (and adult) life and sparks the magic that touches us all. I know Harry Potter may seem to be a hype, but just as Professor Flitwick teaches his wizards and witches, the book has sparkling charms as if the professor created it himself. Please enjoy this classic sixth adventure of the life of Harry Potter!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter And The Half Prince","review":"Like all the Harry Potter books it is excellent. I wish one of the character plots hadn't happened, but I'm extremely interested to see where she is going from here. I don't want to give away the plot, but the book is a must read and I'm ready for book seven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"I am a big fan of Harry Potter and I read books #1-6. I found that in books # 5 & 6, J K Rowling lost a few of her amazing ideas because they seemed to get boring. In book 6, she did do a better job than in book 5 and it is also not as long and boring. There is great suspense and delivery and it will keep you reading.I recommend this book for any Harry Potter fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boy who lived strikes again!","review":"J.K.

Carol"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrid piece of tripe","review":"This is the worse book in an increasingly stupid series. Why, despite having had his life threatened every year and seeing a friend die, Harry Potter fails to take his education seriously is completely beyond me. I also fail to see how Voldemort is evil; he's more a petty thug with a bunch of incompetent, fawning sycophants. They have a chance to wipe out a significant portion of Hogwarts, including Harry Potter and many, if not all, of those he holds dear and completely fails to do so. Huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.","review":"This book was an amazing use of my time and I read it in 7 days. Loved it so much. If you like heart thumping breath taking adventures, then you would love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling finds another level","review":"I have a question. Who has matured more, Harry Potter, or JK Rowling? What started as a series of children's books, with adult appeal has become adult literature, with appeal for teens. This book has a powerful majesty about it that was only briefly glimpsed in books 4 and 5. The humor and fun is still there, interspersed with tautly written action sequences and some very unexpected development of character and twists of plotline. But, the most astonishing development takes place near the end of the book and hinges on a subtlety of thought and point of view, and with profound effects on the rest of this series. You will need to read these passages several times to grasp the full brilliance of this marvelous author. Brava Ms. Rowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I am a teacher and have absolutely loved all of the other books. I was very disappointed with this one. I felt that too many questions were left blatantly unanswered. This author doesn't need a ploy like this to get us to read her books!Why would a great wizard like Dumbledore blindly trust someone like Snape? The readers deserve to know the answer to that question at least. It was very unsatisfying to me. I'm sure I am well in the minority. I just expected more of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"6th book rocks!","review":"I have read all the Harry Potter books but overall this one is my favorite. There is a lot more drama (seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione are all growing up). There is romance for Harry, Hermione and Ron. We also find out an awful secret about Snape. However I was suprised at how J.K. chose to end book 6. The wizarding world seems to be falling apart. I am not going to give away any clues to what happens to those of you who have not read the book yet. You will have to read it to find out! I give this book 5 stars because it rocks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half -a-review for half a book.","review":"Harry Potter is no longer a story for children. What happened Ms.Rowling? 303 pages into the book and no magic, I used to relate to Harry Potter, and, felt I knew J.K. Rowling. So far very dissapointed, maybe the rest of the book will be better, one can only hope..... R.W. Salisbury,Massachusetts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter 6 breaches the gap","review":"Without giving too much away, I believe Harry Potter 6 will satisfy the curious. It answers questions we've all had about the similarities between Harry's past & Tom Riddle's past. It furthers the development of personal relationships and, for once, answers questions about the recurring evil that is Voldemort.Please don't be alarmed if, halfway through the book, you're feeling un-satisifed on the drama or turn of events - it goes to a place most unexpected and surprising. I suggest - to anyone who's never read the HP series...wait until Book 7 arrives - then start from the beginning. You won't have had to wait as long as us for the conclusion.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um????????????????","review":"Given how formulaic the other books in this series are, it was disappointing to see the formula being repeated without anything to give it a bit of spark. A formulaic series like this needs something in each book to set it apart. The incidents we got in this book are not it. Only a few words. Dull. Boring. Uninspired. It could so easily have been different, but even the moving, powerful moments, were done in a flash with no real emotion. It was all too simple.I am a bit sick of Harry being right about everything. He always has sneaking suspicions. They are always right. Yes, Malfoy is nasty. Yes, he probably is plotting behind your back. So what? Harry could be wrong sometimes, just to keep things interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Build-up","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" by itself is a very good novel. When compared to its predecessor \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" and the last installment \\"Deathly Hallows\\", it doesn't quite measure up. The sixth book of the series is largely a build-up to transition to the final stand-off in the seventh book, but it seems like there is just a little too much talking and not enough classic Harry Potter action. I guess this was a pretty necessary transition, however, as it does set up the conclusion of the series very nicely. I suggest that if you have not read this book yet to make sure that you have the seventh book handy as you are going to want to continue on as soon as you finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't give away the ending to anybody...","review":"This is the point in the Harry Potter series we've all been waiting for. It has all the typically amusing Rowling word-play, but the plot was always what I liked about this series. The darker tone of this book is nice, the ending was very unexpected. I can't really write anything more without giving something away.Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"A really good book. I enjoyed the way J.K Rowling had all the readers grow up with the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince","review":"I got the book a few days after it came out, but that didn't stop me from probably being probably one of the first people to finish it. The book was pretty good, but I kept waiting for some action and it didn't really come-it was mostly just Harry trying to prove his suspicions of Malfoy and Snape, Quidditch, what they were learning and Harry finding out more about Voldemort-the part with the most action was probably when Harry and Dumbledore went into the cave to try to find a Horcrux. I think there was even more action in the 1st book, which was like three times smaller than the 6th. Maybe the 7th will have more action-I really hope it does. And, the end was pretty said with the death. But even that wasn't really actiony. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!","review":"As with all of the books in this series I thouroughly enjoyed joining Harry & friends on their adventures. I was sad to have finished the book and I will be eagerly waiting the final book!!! Until then I plan to reread the entire series!!! This book is definitely darker than those preceding it, but I think this makes it all the more entertaining and I think you could argue that it accurately reflects our times. Harry has matured a great deal and Rowling does a great job of filling the reader in on a great deal of history. I was however left wanting to know more about the history of Tom Riddle and his motivations as well as Dumbledore's overeagerness to see the best in people--as this is his true fault and has so often prevented Harry from making progress in his boarderline obsessive \\"investigations.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"So much to be resolved...","review":"There really is not point in going overboard and trying to sound overly smart. This is simply a good book, the most interesting (however, not very progressive) installment in this series. If you haven't bought it yet, buy it. If you don't like Harry Potter and have read all the other books, buy this one. I find it to be highly satifactory. As a final note, has anyone given any consideration to whom J.K. will kill off next? Personally, I beleive that Neville ended up being the REAL chosen one, and he will die fighting Voldemort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in quite a while","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than the last two. It seemed somehow closer to the first two books. Stephen King writes about stories being alive for him as he writes. That was the impression I had about this book. The last couple seemed \\"forced\\", as if the author had to work at them to make them complete. This one flowed and felt natural as I read it.I was interested to see Hermione frustrated by matters academic and Harrys' successes with the Half-Blood Princes' help.As always, I look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more is there to say?!","review":"With over 2,000 reviews already, I do not think I will be putting tooo much time into this review.To sum it up quickly, I would have to say that this book was a great one, but it did have some dry and boring spots in it. Not the best of the series. Most likely a set up for book 7!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I have to say that while this book doesn't have the charm of the first, the eeriness of the second, the fear of the third, the adventure of the fourth, or the impending doom of the fifth (whew!) this book manages to push us further down the final path.Easily misread, I had to go over it a few times to finally see many of the clues JKR is leaving us.Great book, definitly not something you can just pick up and walk away with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"Congratulations JK Rowling.

There is no plot. Frankly, without the other books in the series it cannot stand alone, has no merit whatsoever as an individual work.To its credit, there is some interesting information concerning Voldemort's past, but this was often long-winded and could have been severely condensed.The romance was irrelevant and unnecessary. Yes, they're 16 and \\"in love,\\" but this does not have to take up half the book. Also, I could care less about Tonks and her relationship blues.There were far too many clichés in this book; the one-sidedness is getting annoying (all Slytherines are deceitful, all Gryffindors rule, etc). The interesting characters (Neville and Luna) have been pushed into the background for mundane, clichéd Slughorn and Ginny's many lovers.Cliché death; I cannot re-read the book without grimacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can wait for the next one!","review":"As always, this was another great Harry Potter book.

It does not have the action of her previous novels, but I enjoyed the interactions of the now teenage wizards. I do not understand why anyone would think this is a rip-off of anything Lord of the Rings, unless this is the obscure 'Lord of the Rings: the Puberty Years'. I was also shocked to read that someone was surprised by Harry's new love interest. I thought it was obvious novels ago, although not as blatant as Hermione and Ron. Haven't you noticed she has been slowly getting cooler? Like she can play Quidditch, is funny, and boys think she is hot.I look forward to the final book in the serious, but I am sad to think there is no 7th year at Hogwart's. Who would be Head Boy? What happens at graduation? Perhaps we will never know.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I've been a big fan of Harry Potter ever since it first came out, when I was about eleven years old. I grew up into a teenager, as did Harry and his friends. But honestly, Rowling's interpertation of teenagers in this book is horrible. I know very few people my age who think of kissing and getting laid every other second (and they're both pregnant). That's basically what she has turned the HP kids into--hormone driven teens that think only of the opposite sex. It was a dissapointing read, and I really don't think it's worth over five bucks.I only read the Harry Potter books to escape into a world of magic, not stupid crap I can watch on MTV. There's enough of that stuff in this book to make you want to throw up.There's no point in hurrying to read this book (if for some God-forsaken you absoloutly have to), as Rowling's gonna take at least three good years to write the final book. Don't buy it, go to the library insead."},{"rating":"2","title":"follows a formula","review":"Book six isn't bad but I'm getting tired of J.K's formula in the Harry Potter series. The formula follows: Harry thinks something is wrong, no one believes him. Harry tells his friends his suspitions, no one believes him. Harry has to go on a quest to get something since he turns out to be right. Along the way someone dies or gets incapacitated. Harry is vindicated but at a small cost of his soul.It is funny. Everybody went crazy when book five came out since someone was going to die. But book 4 and six also kill off a major character and it is like no one cares. . .Also book six is frustrating since it ends like a Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Now to defeat the evil wizard Harry needs to collect 6 items of blah , blah, blah . . .I was hoping the series would conclude in books 7 but it looks like J.K. doesn't want her money train to run out. . .It is a good read but the series is starting to read like a bad soap opera. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"best in the series!","review":"i enjoyed reading about the characters' love lives, it brought some more depth into the plot. I also have to give props to Rowling- i wasn't expecting the twist at the end at all! i cant wait until the next book, since it'll be very different than each school year in the past. let's hope it doesnt take her too long to write the final book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugg.","review":"I was expecting a lot from this book... it was the first one I attended a 'midnight party' for - and thus was very disappointed when I realized it read no better than a common fanfiction.There were few (if any) points of comedy held between the covers, and this in itself was very upsetting. The plot was hurried and lacked detail, and the way Harry kept sneaking off belayed his age in the book, making him appear to be eleven again.I honestly understand why certain things happened, but I'm extremely disappointed in J.K. this time around... this book lacks many things that could drastically improve the quality of the story. I can only hope the seventh book in this series is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but good","review":"I recently finished the book and found it pretty good. We all can't wait to get to the end of the series, that way we'll see what fate has in store for mister potter. I say pick it up if you want a long read. I also recommend Dope by RObert Escandon. It's kinda like a childrens book, but recommended for those who want to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.........","review":"Book six is a great read - continuing JKR's engaging, entertaining, and original concept of Harry Potter's world.As our favorite characters grow up, though, the story becomes much darker. With the progression of the series, there are fewer lighthearted parts, and more heavily dramatic ones.A natural progression, perhaps, but this series definitely stopped being \\"for kids\\" somewhere along the way.As a side note - I was incredily relieved to find that the argumentative disposition that Harry (as well as other characters) developed in book 5 did not carry over to HBP. That was WAY overdone in OOtheP, and if I had to choose the very best thing about this one - that point would be it.I would highly recommend this latest installment - and am left, as millions of others, eagerly awaiting book 7 (and am fearful that soon - we will have to say Good-bye to our favorite young wizard forever)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait for # 7","review":"Another outstanding entry in the series, with a very interesting story and a shattering climax.

Now I'm not saying I don't like it because of the events that happen (the person who dies) I'm basing it on the fact I think JK Rowling seems to think that by killing off a character, the plot becomes more interesting. I think the quality of the writing isn't half of what the fourth of fifth books are. And honestly, who decided that by adding emotional teenagers who date around and have little sense of moral value would liven up a story. The point of this book is to represent the depression of war and the true evil of Lord Voldemort, I hardly saw any of that. The one liner innuendo and the distraction of intense immaturity distracted from the plot. I think she could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This was probably right up there with POA as one of the best books in this series. I hope that my initial reaction is wrong and this is all apart of some big plot but my goodness this was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"Though I agree with many of the reviews that say this is a book leading up to Book 7, it is necessary and filled with information.

That said, this review should be taken as product quality.The book was bought used and with the exception of crease lines on the spine, is flawless.

I had no problems and fully recommend using this outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding & Amazing!!","review":"The sixth book of Harry Potter forfilled all of my expectations.The book answered many questions and brought forth new ones.The story-line is filled with death,love,mystery,etc.It's everything you could ask for in a book. Adding some real suspense and horror to the book was something that J.K. Rowling did magnificently. Okay, the book is pretty sad, but every good book has it's drama. This was an outstanding book. The best in the series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I think JK Rowling just keep getting better with Book 6 in her series. Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts is fun as Harry continues his journey with new characters and amazing puzzles to keep even the most avid HP fan entertained.Like most HP fans, after I read book 6 I immediately read the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence to gain even more INSIGHTS and CLUES into Book 6 and JKR.

Compared to the previous Harry Potter books, this one apppears to have been written with no storyline in mind. We were introduced to a couple of new characters who did not add anything to the mix and yet some well loved characters seemed to be lost to the author. The ending is so hopeless, which would be OK in the middle of the book where there is hope of some resolution. It is unacceptable to wait 3 years for resolution to this dark ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype has gone to her head","review":"C'mon people! Rowling's first book was a work of genius. Every succeeding book has deteriorated in quality and this latest one is no exception. She keeps introducing new characters without properly developing the existing ones. The romances in this latest effort are embarrassingly bad. Her formula has become so tired. I loved Rowling's first book. It depresses me so much that so many people can't see the difference between that work of art and the shoddy knock-offs she has been presenting us with since then. I just hope that she finds an editor with enough backbone to tell her that she needs to do a better job for her final installment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressively inferior","review":"When it comes time to introduce my children to this series, I'm going to encourage them to stop at the Prisoner of Azkaban. The literary merit of Rowling's writing decreases steadily throughout books 4 and 5, and dramatically in The Half Blood Prince. Much of it is boring to the point of being un-readable. The plot is weak, thin and predictable. Harry, Ron and Hermione complete their tragic transformations from noble, insightful, loyal young people to whiney, shallow, irritating brats. It's as if Rowling decided children are no longer worthy of good literature, and pounded out another long-winded stylized piece of garbage that, with the right special effects, will make for another mindless movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALY GOOD BOOK","review":"I have to say,I was realy close to not buying this book. after what happend in Harry Potter and the order of phonex. i wasint sure about getting this one.But i was wrongThis book is awsome.

It fells like you are in the book. what Rolling did is she made you realy close to a character. then some thing happend to the character. then it keeps you wondering whats going to happen to the man that caused it.this is a very good book and i highly recommend it for any body thats a harry potter fan. i cant wait for the next book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter And The HAlf Blood Prince","review":"Dear J.K. Rowling,I really liked your book. It really suprised me when malfoy was a soul eater. I think that this was one of the best books that you have ever writen so far. It suprised when dumbeldore died by severus snake. I really like the monsteres in the cave. I was also suprised when hagrids spider friend died. Proffeser slughorn was a relly good carechter but you should have added him in other books so we new him better. Also i liked is how you intoduced the horocruxes of voldemorts souls split up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with the direction of the collection so far","review":"When I was in middle school, the Harry Potter books were the kind I would have killed to have found in the school library. As the series progresses the books seem to slowly creep up both in complexity and in their dark mood. I am twenty years old and now prefer the Harry Potter series over my past favorite \\"The Wheel of Time\\". The consistancy in the quality of her work makes me wish Rowling had started writing these books ten years ago.The last book in the installment thus far continues the trend that \\"I\\" have seen in Rowlings work, but I personaly felt the effect more in the transistion between the earlier books. Rowling seems to be almost at her peak ability and I hope she finishes her series before falling to Robert Jordanism (the eleventh book in the Wheel of Time was horrendous)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book so far !!!!!","review":"Let me start by saying I am a Harry Potter Fanatic. I loved all of the other books and have read them all numerous times. I even have them on tape as well for road trips. Did I mention I am 37? What a geek.This book was a huge let down. Mrs Rowling what happened?? There is not much of a plot and it is somewhat dull.. You don't get the attachment to characters like you did in the other books. The rich detail is also not there like in the other books.Had the first book in the series been like this I never would have been sucked into harry potters world.The ending was shocking but I was so bored by that point I didn't care.I hope she steps up to the plate in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"this book was not so good. it had a tendacy to drag on and is redundant to say the least. way to predictable. alot of unanswered questions, from book five, ideas she started and never followed through. charchter death to predictable and unrealistic. this writer makes far to much money for medicore books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Excitement and editing","review":"I am again disappointed in the newest Harry Potter book, as I was in number 5. I may buy the last book, when it comes out, in order to have the set but I will not rush to own it.This story isn't as magical or as inventive as the earlier books. Nothing gripping or intriguing happens other than people bashing each other with spells. The characters do not seem to grow and the lack of skill development by the hero leaves a lot to be desired. A hero that isn't able to learn and doesn't excel at anything but gets by on luck can only last so many books - I think 4 was the limit.Too bad I had such high hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF!!!!!!","review":"Ok, so we wait and wait and wait and wait, do a little more waiting and then what do we get? A romance story! There is no action like the other books. We waited for nothing! It was a rip off! JK Rowling is losing it! All the other books id give like 5 stars or something. Not this one. Never.

Ah!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have the action and excitement gone to?","review":"Where was the action and excitement? The first 3/4 of the book was just a whole lot of babbling about Harry's feelings and frustrations. Where is the magic, the trill and suspense?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly, Richly Satisfying","review":"The only trouble with the Harry Potter series is the long wait between books and that problem will be magnified between Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the seventh and final book. J.K. Rowling has ended this newest book in such an exciting and dramatic fashion that it is both richly satisfying while still leaving many unanswered questions. The new characters are interesting as always if not quite up to the level of the previous books. The romance quotient is bumped up a notch for many of the characters, which is appropriate and handled well. But the best thing about the newest Potter book is the driving speed of the narrative and the creeping sensation of darkness overwhelming everything. Rowling keeps up this sense in clever ways even during what would have been ostensibly brighter moments. A real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, delevered as promised","review":"Well, my copy of book 6 was waiting for me at 9:30 in the morning at my post office! Yay Amazon!It took about 9 hours to read, and then I re-read the last part again. I thought it was a great addition to the series! Yes, the constant \\"snogging\\" was a bit annoying (including use of the word), but remember, we *are* talking about teenagers. The character developement was enjoyable and sometimes very moving, bringing out sympathy for Draco and even for Voldemort (watching a monster develope, and wondering if his childhood had only been different, would he have turned out better). Learning why the Defense against the Dark Arts position is cursed... and a hundred other things. Over all, an excellent addition to the series, and I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Review","review":"This is a great book.

Bad ending?","review":"The first two acts of this book are exceptional, but I feel the final act is hampered by Rowling's lack of command of action. Just like the previous books in the series, Rowling is amazing when she's describing the unique environment and the wonderful characters at Hogwarts. In Half-Blood Prince she delves more into the character of Voldemort and his background.Unfortunately the book's inrecdible suspense must playout in the end, and I feel it is quite a disappointment. I never felt Rowling was very good in her action writing, but this ending just seemed like one long plot device to set up the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This was the best Harry Potter book of all time! I read it in 2 weeks and 1 night I read it from 9p.m. to 12a.m.! That is how good it was!

Rowling. It feels kinda like watching a season premier after waiting a long time for the conclusion to a cliffhanger season finale. They tie up all the loose ends from Phoenix within the first several chapters (i.e. why occlumency is no longer necessary) and then once Harry returns to Hogwarts, we are returned to another fantastic adventure of the boy-who-lived, or as they call him now, \\"the chosen one\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not my favorite","review":"I believe that this book is darker than the first five installments, but It was a very thought out plot to me. Sure, there were some parts where I was like 'Huh? we're in march alreay?' and of course that traitor.There was also some humor, such as Won-won. But, honestly, where did all the finer details go?A very good book, but slightly disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for kids anyore...","review":"I knew that this series was going to get dark after book five, but it went far beyond what I expected. The Death Eaters are no longer in hiding, and the Wizarding world is once again living in the shadow of terror.There is some humor, of course. The new Quidditch commentator, the Weasley's new dillema, and various other small events are funny, but for the most part it's grim. Harry, thankfully, is not nearly as self-absorbed in this one as the last one, and Dumbledore is once again involved in Harry's life.Some things alluded to blossom, but a few other events are quite surprising.All in all, a very good book, but it has too many frightening scenes for anyone under the age of at LEAST 10. Be prepared for deaths of minor and one major characters, and many new romantic entanglements. And, of course, a new Dark Arts Proffessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy beginning, few inconsistencies, good ending","review":"Bad:These are books intended to be for children and I was very disturbed to find \\"slut\\" used in this book. For someone who used an alternate term for making out(snogging), I expected much different from Rowling. I could deal with all the murder, dark magic and hatred in the book, but it was always described with taste - skipping over the vulgarities. Hopefully she won't have the vulgar terms in there next time around.I was also unhappy with the fluff at the beginning. It wasn't until about pages 150-200 that things were actually getting interesting. It seemed like there was a lot of writer's block in the beginning of the book.I would say this is the worst book of the series.Good:Rowling weaved a pretty good story this time around. After the fluff, the action of the end was awesome and the pages were turning as fast as I could. Overall, the ending was worth the time and will keep us guessing as she takes time off before book 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Jim Dale does it again!

The ending I must say is very suprising! I almost cried when reading the final two chapters of the book. It was as action packed as the other 5 books but it has a lot of meaning to the series. As it does when all the new books come out, it clears a lot more things up about the rest of the series. Although, to who ever reads this comment on the book and hasn't read it, I advise you to read the 5th book over. If you have only read the fifth book when it came out and haven't read it since, the 6th book will not make a very much sense. The one thing that I really disliked about the book is that they really didn't get to go to anywhere new (not including the cave). I would still give this book five stars and I can't wait until the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They just get better and better","review":"I'd like to sit here and list things I love about this book, but I would hate to spoil it for anyone. However, if you're a Harry Potter fan, know that you won't be disappointed with this book.

But this one is different. The story becomes so predictable and typical, there is no more those subtle humor I used to love. As some reviewer put it, this one reads like as if written by some Harry Potter fan.Compared with book 1-4, the book is filled with more hatred than happiness, more contempt than respect. Anyone is judged just by the house they belong and sometimes even by how their name is spelled. And those kind of judgements always turn out to be right in the book. It's almost like promoting racism. Was JK Rowling a racist after all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a read!","review":"Book six is a definite page-turner, this one will grab you and keep you interested. It also brings a more 'adult' line of thought into play, showing the development and maturation of her characters. I was relieved that Ms. Rowling took it up a notch or two compared to book 5, adding more darkness, but am still a little disappointed in her lack of any explanation of HOW the magic really works. I'm still cheerfully looking forward to the last installment.Durk Simmonsauthor \\"Strings of Connection: Book One of the Witches in America Series\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling does it again!","review":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince stirs up just as many questions as it answers, and Harry potter fans wouldn't have it any other way! Harry is changing and growing, and in the Half-Blood Prince, this fact makes him seem so much more alive.I had the unfortunate experience of hearing the 'spoiler' before I had opened the book - but knowing what was going to happen didn't lessen my shock when I read the ending.Rowling writes in a 'sing-song' way that lulls the reader into a trance-like state. This is a much needed series for the young adult age group. It's actually bringing them away from the TV and into the land of their (and Ms. Rowling's) imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon did NOT gift wrap or respond to my complaint","review":"I paid for gift wrapping.

I bought the Half-Blood prince the day after it was released and loved every moment of it.

You have to have it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfies Harry Potter Needs","review":"Like most people, I was excited to hear that Harry Potter was going to be released. Now, I'm not an obsessive fan that dresses up like the characters, but I have read the series a few times. I bought the book the day that it came out a finished it the next day.I thought the book was great, however, I was disappointed when J.K Rowling didn't go deeper in some of the characters pasts, such as a certain 'Half Blood Prince'. Also, the book felt a bit rushed and didn't really have any good 'funny moments' that usual happen at Hogwarts. I was also surprised on how Ginny matured and the way Harry was beginning to feel.Overall, this book was good and it makes the reader yearn for the last installment of the series. Hopefully the last book will answer some questions that people began asking throughout the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Seven of the Harry Potter Series","review":"I wasn't exactly sure what I should rate this book, but I decided to give it 5 stars. I could not wait to get this book and once I started reading it I could not put it down. The plot of the story, I thought, was very good. I especially loved all the relationship dilemas because they seemed like real-life situations. But to tell you the truth I wasn't totally satisfied with the last few chapters. I was very sad to see one of my favorite characters die and very upset at how it happened. It seemed that the person who killed him/her didn't really have a motive. I also didn't like how Rowling did not go into more detail about their classes and the school life. That always has been one of my favorite parts of the other books. But I have to say I still enjoyed this book very much and am looking foward to the seventh book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big questions if you look closely.....","review":"I am in a mix mood now after I read the book.

Isn't \\"love\\" the \\"answer\\".Other then the question(s) it leaves and the STUPID super hero set up, I liked it. Enough humor mixed with suspense and tragedy to be a true JK book. I think it is a must read for Potter fans.

I felt cheated-to read 600+ pages and have the book end with only questions and few answers was most frustrating. With each prior book there was some sense of victory, a confrontation with Voldemort, and a complete story. This book felt like a \\"Part 1\\" rather than the 6th book in the series. The ending was not believable and provided more questions than answers. It is frustrating to think that it will be another couple of years before these many unanswered questions are addressed.

I have read enough of Harry Potter to make me puke up his glasses but when it comes to children there are only so many ones that are mature enough to handle the witchcraft and trickery that dominates these so-called stories. It's basically mass brainwashing but for the love of Pete, just be glad they are reading this instead of more openly liberal material.

This is not the story I fell in love with. The story I know is not predictable, unimaginative, linear, and trite.

To me this book is for younger adults-children but, I also believe that their is no such thing as a \\"reading level\\" also I do not mean to say that older men and women. The first 3 books where my favorites in this series so far 4 and 5 left me with a feeling regret and now 6. When the book can be summerized with a paragraph or more for other online reviews that means to me that there is not very much interesting detail in that particular book.

Harry is in his sixth year of Hogwarts, where romance and violence thrives. The staff has been mixed up and Voldemort runs rampant throughout the world. Sounds like basic Harry Potter philosophy, no? No. Harry has emotions of a teenager, that of a real live human being, unlike most of the characters nowadays. Harry Potter has obtained the title I gave to the Lord of the Rings so long ago. It has been quite apparent that this book, or more or less, these books, have achieved that of what your mind's eye could only dream of. I may sound scripted, or in your mind not, but Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the greatest Harry Potter book to grace my bookshelf-and my imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fun one.","review":"Surprisingly, given its place after Voldemort has returned and just before the final battle, Book 6 is actually the lightest book of the series. Some of the set pieces (the two opening chapters, the Felix sequence, the kiss) are among the best in the entire series. The rest of the plot, though, is quite weak. The book is a fun enjoyable read, but it doesn't really feel like a full year, especially one in the middle of a war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book in the series","review":"A very good book in the series. This book moved much better than the last one. It also flowed much better from the last book than the movie. In the movie, Harry went from dark, mood and feeling all alone to suddenly upbeat and hopeful in this movie. In the book however, he was still feeling rather down at the begining of this book. Also, the movie most deviated form this book than any other. The Burrow was never set a fire in this book. I also like the Ginny character from the book much better than the movie. She is very outspoken and confident. She is even a good Quiditch player. This book also sets up the last book very well. Harry is now on a mission. I found this book read much better/faster than the last one. One more book to go. Oh, and I still wish these books were released in eBook format."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Rip-Off!","review":"This book was a disappointment to say the least. It is merely a \\"filler\\". No plot; a pointless death of a major character (who may return in the last book, see the hints in his/her conversation right before his/her death), a blatant retread in the use of the \\"book\\" plot device from the \\"COS\\"; any exciting action scenes were hastily clumped together at the end, with even half of this action encountered second-hand. The only redeeming part of this book was the information gleaned concerning Voldemort's past, but even this could have been explained in short order. I am not sure, but it may be that JK Rowling had writer's block and needed to get a book out. That is the way this book reads.

My enthusiasm was waning by page 300 and kept going downhill thereafter. I found the half-blood prince identity and the death to be little more than anti-climactic and certainly bore none of the emotion that such matters would have in previous books.

We started to take this one back at first, but that is such a hassle that we made do using it as I said.The self-propelled feature is nice, but the unit is badly made and not worth the money.

There is a series to lights to tell you if you are moving too fast (why not just say \\"move slowly to get best results\\"?) The bladder design is clever but not practical, as the container is virtually impossible to clean. The dumbest part of the design is the \\"smartmix\\" bottle that dispenses soap. The pump for the \\"smartmix\\" soap bottle broke within a month. And then the valve has to be set in two positions everytime you turn the machine on or refill the water of soap.

I purchased this to provide a flexible way to connect various USB devices to Windows PCs including cell phones, MP3 players, and cameras but I have found that it although it causes the device to light up or the PC to see a generic USB device - I have yet to see it actually work while if I unplug this cable and use a corresponding standard USB cable with the same device and machine - without rebooting or changing anything it works. It appears that the cable itself is NOT thick enough to provide enough EMF shielding for USB to work correctly.

I'm curious about what Faith thinks of Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\" era, and of her own recent explanation about her works in the early 1990s.

Many times we come to prayer asking God to get rid of this problem or to help with this other situation, etc. However, what about God? What does He want from us? Where does He want us to go or do? We will never find the answers to these questions if we do not do what the title of the book says.To put it simply, prayer is like the conversation that one has with a dear friend on the phone. You talk, they listen; they talk, you listen. The same should be our relationship with out God. This book is geared toward orienting our spiritual life not toward venting, asking or pleading. But, toward listening, patience and acting. Groeschel presents a very simple and human approach to prayer that, in the end, is fruitful.This book is a must for anyone young and old in their faith. It is never too late to return to the basics of spirituality, especially if we listen at prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another B-3 wizard emerges","review":"With help from several guitarists (including Bob DeVos, who's worked with Charles Earland & Groove Holmes), Dave Braham delivers a promising debut.

What I needed was a vacuum that can fit my student budget and that can clean the carpeting well and yet protect me from allergens in the dust. This machine's power and its hypoallergenic filter seem to be doing the job. I find it easy to navigate and clean. My major disappointment is with the hose for the peripheral brushes. It is very, hmm... suspicious... It is very short and made of poor material; together these two things mean that it will get destroyed easily and also that it is difficult to use. Since I probably wasn't going to use it anyway, and since a lot of vacuums of this kind and at this price don't even have a hose or a hypoallergenic filter, I say that I am quite pleased overall. Finally, I don't think the description says that the vacuum has a nifty-looking light source in the front, which makes cleaning more entertaining :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, academic, and READABLE!","review":"The Publishers Weekly blurb succinctly captures the basics of the book and Fischer's important contributions to better understanding the importance of the Crossing, the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and the guerilla war in Jersey. More importantly, Fischer points out Washington's excellent military leadership. General Washington has taken a lot of heat for supposedly not measuring up to other military greats; but he better appreciated the \\"big picture\\" of winning the war, even if he lost his fair share of battles. More civilian and military leaders today should better appreciate what made Washington's war-leadership successful.Fischer also fully discusses the Hessians' contributions to the war; they are often underappreciated components of the British forces.Finally, his bibliographic essay and appendixes are fantastic for those wanting to quickly find important little tidbits about Washington, the Revolution, or the specific battles of Trenton and Princeton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some useful information","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. While the author has some decent analysis of the strategy and strategic reassessments on both sides of the war, his numerous detours from the main narrative were clunky and very distracting. Why was space dedicated to the so-called first American \\"feminist\\"? Additionally, his writing style made this book seem like an overly long term paper. In comparison to Robert Middlekauff's work, or similar works by Joseph Ellis, this book reads very poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington's Crossing","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's historical information is well written and interesting. The presentation of the events as well as the author's analysis of the causes and results including the deeper long term effects are insightful. It's good history, well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This was an absolute joy to read. The book is not only about the crossing, but gives a good background of the events, politics and emotions that surrounded the American Revolution. Then it gives eyewitness accounts, from diaries, about the actual events that happened. It also gives details on aspects of the army, culture, political background and important figures that fill in the gaps and make the whole story read like a motion picture or documentary. The book tells how all the parts fit together. Truly a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"2500 Change the Course of History","review":"Six months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost.The British routed the Americans at New York, occupied the three colonies and advanced within sight of Philadelphia. George Washington's army, having lost 90 per cent of his troops, was in shambles.On Christmas Eve, Washington rallied his men, crossed the Delaware in a howling nor'easter and attached the British mercenaries at Trenton. The army representing the young country killed or captured almost 1,000 of the enemy. During the next 12 weeks, Washington struck the British again and again, shaking them badly. Traumatized, the British hold on New Jersey was broker; their strategy discredited.This is a great book. Painstakingly researched, well-written, it casts new light on one of our country's most crucial periods of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington's Crossing","review":"Well written with research that debunks many of the legends that surround the 1st battle at Trenton. Also a good interweaving of the individual stories with the larger political and military situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"American deserved this book","review":"Fischer's book on Washington's crossing of the Delawar and the subsequent battles of Trenton and Princeton is a marvelously written book. Washington's Crossing is written by a historian that loves to tell stories. Fischer apparently loves to write because he does it so well and his book is full of footnotes, notes and maps; enough to keep any second rate amature historian happy for weeks.Fischer's attention to the details associated with the principles of the story is also impressive. Even the private soldier isn't overlooked. The trials and tribulations of Washington and his army are well documented by Fischer. Reading this book drives home the sacrifice made by so many of the citizens of the wonderful country. Fischer's coverage of the \\"enemy\\" especially that of Cornwallis is also impressive.For any reader looking for a true picture of the early days of the American Revolution, Washington's Crossing is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Washington's Crossing has everything I look for in a history book: easy to read, well-researched, well-organized, unbiased and entertaining.

I am an attorney as well, and I often recommend this book for clients to read as a primer to the subject (especially when I tell them what it will cost for an hour of my time to explain it!). There are a few books on the market on asset protection, but this is the only one that is geared towards the landlord or small-time real estate investor. One caveat for the reader- there are some sample forms in the appendix, but they appear to be for example only. One should always review these concepts with an attorney to make sure the forms are drafted to comply with the client's specific needs and appropriate state law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starter Book for Asset Protection","review":"On my first reading of this book, I said, \\"Huh?\\" Then, I attended a corporation seminar. Both the seminar and Bronchick's book were instrumental in formation of my expertise in the use of corporations for asset protection for my real estate business. Admittedly, this book is light on details, but the diagrams and examples provided more than make up for that. Besides, you should seek professional advice anyway in addition to this material.This book is a goldmine for the entrepreneur. Not only is the advice great for those of us in small business, but the material is a rich source of pratical ideas you can apply to your operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thorough enough","review":"This book tries to cover land trust, C, S, SP, GP, LP, LLC, estate planning, asset protection, and more in 100 pages.

None of the entities was explained in detail to give the reader a complete understand.I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's new to the concept.But it does cover most of the ideas of asset protection, and has a good collection of legal forms. So it might be a good addition to somebody who knows what he's doing, but just need a quick reference. This is why it's a 2 star, instead of 1.So, pick your place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book skims over everything.

However, about two chapters into this novel it began to seem really familiar. As it turns out this story (the marijuana in the plane that crashes into the back country lake in Yosemite National Park, and is discovered by the climbers at Camp 4, among others)is--- a)true, and b) well treated in a novel from 1987, by Jeff Long, entitled \\"Angels of Light\\". I felt very disappointed while reading through the rest of Barr's novel, as nothing new or different happened. She has no forward note, historical note, epilogue or other mention that this work is based on a true event and has precedence in fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unnecessary violence","review":"Barr is an uneven writer.

I would skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a 10 star....","review":"After the miscue of \\"Flashback\\", I was absolutely thrilled that in \\"High Country\\" Anna was the Anna of earlier works. She's back where she belongs, in the high country, tough, gutsy and totally enjoyable. The plot is great, the characters are believable, and the scenery is beautiful. Thank you Ms. Barr.

It's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable action story, not Barr's best","review":"This is certainly not the best Nevada Barr book out there. In fact, it's in the running for the worst one, but I have others yet to read. The characters are thin and the plot predictable.This is not a book for mystery lovers, though if you like action-adventure movies the final third of the book is for you. Like the movies, though, the events were unbelievable and the heroine should have been dead several times over. Even so, I kept reading, which is how this book squeezed out that second star.I was also surprised that Barr seems to dislike Yosemite so much. Even more puzzling, she keeps praising the Natchez Trace Parkway, which is not exactly a crown jewel of the national park system. To each her own, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten, underedited","review":"I was so disappointed with High Country. I've liked Nevada Barr in the past, and I love Yosemite, so I was looking forward to a good read, but I couldn't get past about page 50. WAY too many serious errors early that the editors didn't catch (including a \\"whomever\\" for \\"whoever\\" on p. 22) as well as overwriting on Ms. Barr's part.

Because of this first experience I will not purchase anything by Nevada Barr or anything being narrated by Barbara Rosenblat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS BOOK!","review":"I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read. I did not like it because of several reasons. First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much. One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter. Second, it was so mundane for a mystery. The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk.

Maybe a bit heavy on the near death experiences but all in all, good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Anna Pigeon mysteries yet","review":"High Country comes back to the things I first loved about Barr's Anna Pigeon mysteries: compelling plots with plenty of twists and turns, and Anna's knowledge of the natural world around her.

I suspect Barr is having a mid life or late mid life crisis and poured out her feeling in this novel. Too bad, 'cause I read for enjoyment or education and not for depression. Don't give up on her, for she has many good novels out there. I just finished Blood Lure and it was a keeper. Based on High Country, if I was Anna's boss, I'd retire her to a desk job in the home office for a while, wouldn't want her depressing all the young rangers with her whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Country, Maybe","review":"This book is just plain awful. I love Yosemite and my son works at the Ahwahnee restaurant, so I bought this book hoping for a connection to the story. What a waste of time. I am not even sure Ms. Barr has been to Yosemite. Her descriptions of the park were so generic they could have come right out of Fodors.There is nothing compelling about this story, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, Anna Pigeon herself is distracting the way she continually has little mental asides that have nothing to do with the story. If this book is indicative of the rest of the Anna Pigeon series then the praise I have been reading in other reviews is misplaced.Nevada Barr missed some wonderful opportunities to include all of the truly majestic features of Yosemite in her story and instead we get drivel. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"thesaurus walts","review":"Anna Pigeon is a great gal, but in this latest installment of her life, the horrors she endures at 50 roll off her too easily to be at all believable. Her physical ordeal in the dark and freezing mountains alone would be enough to make even quite hardy people need a few days of rest. But good old Anna, tender of heart thogh she is, is hardly phased by the violence, the suffering, the nastiness she encounters in this book, even though Barr allows a sentence or two of quick, sentimental reflection from time to time. And I wonder how some of the other sentences would have turned out had Barr not had her thesaurus handy - plethora used too many times, not withstanding!

The cover of Chinese Cafe (while offering an acceptable orchestration) is pretty dreadful. It's odd that the performing artists aren't even listed on the liner notes (well, there are no liner notes, really). Perhaps that is why the price is so low. I guess this one has two valid prospective groups of buyers: Joni fans who just have to have all Mitchell-related work or are curious about it; and people who like Joni Mitchell songs but don't like her voice (imagine!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"blasphemy","review":"There are certain labels, such as Dressed to Kill and Red Eye, that put out so called \\"Tribute\\" albums, which are nothing more than unnamed artists covering songs.

It contains such unneeded recipes as \\"balogna sandwich\\" and \\"BLT.\\" The barbecue/grill recipes are on the simple side (marinate in Italian dressing, then cook), but that's not necessarily bad. The author's most intruiging suggestion, not echoed in any other barbecue book I have read, is that smoke does not belong in low, slow barbecue. If he's right, and he may be, you can save a lot of time and money. Use plain old charcoal, forget the smokey hardwood. His point is that the flavors should come from the meat, the rub (or marinade), and and the mop.

I have never had any issues with the suction--works very well. The only downside is that the brush gets pretty gunky after awhile and has to be cleaned. It is also quite loud, so not good to use while others might be sleeping. It has a nice long cord and the cleaning solution works well and has a pleasant clean scent.

I thought maybe mine was just clogged with something, but after reading reviews here, I must conclude it is the design.The seal to the top tank (cleaning solution) leaks, so it leaves a puddle whereever I set the machine down.Cleaning out the dirty water tank (what bit it does pick up) is difficult, so bits of wet, dirty fuzz grows mold if not cleaned with a disinfectant after each use.Most of the time, we just use our spray bottle and lots of paper towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises more than it can deliver","review":"I had great hope in the Bissell Powerbrush but find myself disappointed. First off, the unit is extremely loud. I would suggest the use of hearing protection. (no, I'm not kidding... my gasoline lawnmower is quieter.) Secondly, the suction is insufficent to pick up much liquid. If you put two or three ounces of cleaner down, you might get one ounce back. This isn't a big problem on carpet, but I do not like the results on furniture. On the plus side, the cleaner is pretty good at removing light stains on carpet, and although it is too big to wield in my car, it can clean my wife's minivan pretty nicely.In short, I wish I hadn't bought it, but not so much that I want to try to get the store to take it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect product.","review":"Very good product.

Basically, you are buying a machine that squirts formula+water onto your carpet (the trigger is fairly stiff, too) and brushes it in with the rollers! It says \\"tilt for suction\\" which still doesn't work, but if it did that means you have three steps: squirt the formula onto the carpet, use the brushes in the regular position, then go over again with the machine tilted! I, in fact, did do this. I used nearly the whole tank of solution and in the dirty water tank was at most 1 tablespoon of water that had been suctioned!

But I used this machine about three times a week for 4 yrs now and have loved it. My brushes are finally so full of hair and crap that I need to take them and really clean them but this machine takes a beating and gives you your old carpet back. the only stain that it has not completely cleared is a coffee stain on my white carpet that sat for a few days before I got to it.

However, a month after moving in we noticed our floor was looking dingy and spotty. So we moved our couch back and it was horribly spotted underneath. We went ahead and used the rug doctor as a temporary fix, but I wanted something for occasionally spills and such. I also have a two year old daughter so we have the occasional juice cup leak.The Spot Lifter took out all of the spots. When some of the spots reappeared two months later they weren't nearly as dark as before. It only took about half of the time this time around to get it all out.All in all you can't go wrong with this product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't imagine anything more useless.","review":"I don't expect much from a handheld but this was ridiculous. A spray bottle of solution would be much easier to use and *anything* would get the solution out better.I used it to try to clean up and orange juice spill and both the juice and the solution are still there. I am going to take it back, and clean up with a damp rag. If you are thinking of buying one, you might as well spend the price on wash cloths instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least!","review":"Yes, it does clean well & yes the scrub brush is great BUT trying to get this apart is no easy task!! Pushing in the 2 levers to take the tank out to fill it takes lots of pushing & pushing. About the time I'm ready to give up, it suddenly opens. And if that isn't enough, trying to release the tank underneath this to get rid of the dirty water...I've only been successful one time. Now, as I filled the cleaning tank today (exactly as directed & not overfilled) the cleaning tank started to leak...just a drip or 2 at a time. There are no holes anyplace to be seen, everything is in tight...even rescrewing the lid several times & it's fine...but it's leaking...from the bottom. I've decided when I get the dirty tank full...I'll just throw the whole machine out! Talk about poorly designed...Bissell has been a great company in the past, but this sure is a loser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completety Ineffective","review":"All this device does is spread out carpet stains. It is incabable of extracting any of the cleaning solution that is sprayed onto the carpet or upholstery. You would be more effective with using a spray-on carpet cleaner and a rag. At least you could remove some of the stain with a rag.A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrifyingly Loud!","review":"I read a review that someone wrote about this \\"little\\" machine being as loud as car wash and I just thought that was impossible for such a little machine to be that loud . . . well, he wasn't kidding!

It's an awkward shape, and in order to get it to suction up the moisture, you have to keep holding it in a certain way. It really tires my arms out and I have to keep shifting hands. It did, finally, get rid of the stains (pop, cats, shoes), but it was hard to use. I also feel that it's heavy for it's size (especially when the tanks is full of water). I'm giving it to a neighbor and buying a full-size model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This- Sprayer Problems","review":"The first unit I had didn't spray at all. I called Bissell and they exchanged it for another unit. The replacement sprays a very small amount of solution on the spot and I must wait several seconds to pull the trigger and spray again. It is frustrating to get the solution on the spot, pouring it on would be easier. If I hadn't gotten this as a gift, I would demand my money back, but alas it will be yard sale fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This little machine has got to rank as the worst cleaning gadget I've ever owned. On the plus side, it is easy to use, lightweight, and has a nice long cord. The problem is, it doesn't work well. The suction is poor. Squeezing the trigger to spray the cleaning solution gets tiring very quickly, would probably be torture for someone with arthritis or carpel tunnel probems. It's annoyingly noisy (hey, it SOUNDS like it's working!). I've tried various cleaning solutions hoping maybe one brand would work better than the Bissell solution, but the problem is obviously the machine. I can clean spots quicker and easier and much better by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Run, don't walk, away from this product.Basically the spot lifter just makes a bigger mess than you started with. The worst part is when it randomly explodes out the back end for no reason, spattering whatever it is you've just \\"cleaned\\" up all over the carpet again. I used this thing to clean up dog barf the other night, and I remembered why I hadn't used it in months. It spattered out the back end, so I took in in the bathroom to clean the machine up, which ended up being such a messy, horrible process that I had to clean the entire bathroom afterwards! I would have been better off leaving the dog barf alone. Yuck.I would also recommend wearing ear plugs if you buy this, as it's very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"It is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. the suction was very weak. I tried to clean up a spill in my car and it couldn't suck up the liquid at all. I ended up buying a more expensive wet vac to clean my car. This product doesn't cost much, but it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked out stains well","review":"I just purchased this handheld tonight and tried it out - it works great!

But it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell Spotlifter is Fantastic!","review":"this bissell spotlifter is great. I show it to my friends & family all the time, & sold 2 more for Bissell with my simple demonstration. Everyone with a car, pet, children, or any kind of carpeting, needs one. (They are super fantastic) I also like the Bissell Quicksteamer plus. (larger version) thanks Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive piece of junk!","review":"My husband bought this for me, as our couch and carpet desperately need cleaning. I had problems right off the bat- the cleaning solution would not spray, no matter how long I sat there pulling the trigger. My husband finally discovered that tehre was a problem with the O ring, therefore no seal being created to allow the cleaning fluid to travel through the tubing. So, I put some cleaning solution and water into a spray bottle, and figured at least i have the brushes and suction.not even 10 minutes after turning this machine on, the brushes broke- the gear stripped! Total waste of money, and an afternoon of frustration as I tried to solve one problem after another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spot cleaner","review":"This little machine truly lifts spots. Even old baby formula/food/wine stains that professional carpet cleaners have not been able to remove- I have a white carpet so you see everything. Con: it doesn't suction very well, you have to go over the wet area several times to pick up the water, although my carpet is very thick. It may suction better in thinner carpets(?) The cleaning solution that comes with the machine works well, but smells very strong & lingers in the room for several days, so I used other solutions & it worked just as well. I give it four stars because of the suction & it is very loud. Overall, I recommend it. Its worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough suction!","review":"I thought, just the thing for my stairs, which are always a mess (dog, cat, me--spilling tea, coffee, who knows what.) I had high hopes because my carpet shampooer is not great on the stairs and the Bissell Spot Bot has a nice hose attachment but it's a bit heavy for me to lug up the stairs. However, this JUST didn't have the power. Not really recommended for my application, which was carpeted stairs. Maybe would be ok for a vacuumed-out car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it twice, (total of 30-40 min)...then it broke","review":"The brushes were quite effective while they lasted. Unfortunately one of the plastic gears dissolved during its second use. Also the vacuum was very effective at making noise, but only got about 5-15% of the water out. All in all it lasted a total of about 30-40 min."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, no, save your money.","review":"Wow, I hate this thing. Cleaning the machine took longer than hitting spots in my hallway. If you enjoy cleaning hair and dirt for an hour out of tiny brushes than this product is for you. This thing turned a quarter size stain into a foot long strain across our living room floor. I could go on but I am exhausted from standing over my sink cleaning this ridiculous piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after 1 day","review":"I purchased this to clean up pet accidents instead of lugging out the huge steamer all the time. It woked great out of the box. Cleaned up perfectly, even a week old coffee stain on a beige carpet. Today I was using for another small spot...just stopped working. First it wasn't suctioning any of the liquid out of the carpet then the motor stopped. It is going back today. Tis is what I get for not checking the reviews first and being impulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"no suction!","review":"I have had several people try to get this spotlifter to pick up moisture from carpet, but we can't make it work.

I ended up waiting past 30 days to first use it (so it was too late to exchange) and - surprise - the sprayer didn't work! Okay, a little bit of a pain, but not a big deal as I used a small spray bottle of water/solution to spray any stains. This worked for about 3 times and then - surprise - the brush will no longer turn to scrub the spot. So now I have to spray the spot and scrub the spot myself and have this vacuum up the remaining water, which I have to say it does rather poorly. Overall, a poorly made product and a waste of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is crap","review":"I bought this unit thinking it was powerful enough to clean a piece of furniture. The problem is that it doesn't distribute the cleaning solution properly. There is a manual trigger sprayer to distrubute the liquid. It doesn't work very well. You spray once, then it goes limp. You might be able to clean a small spot with this thing, that's about it. It would be just as easy and cheaper to use a spray bottle and towel. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective right out of the box!","review":"After many years of good use my battery operated Bissell finally would not hold a charge. It was time for a replacement and thinking this 1716b (with a power cord) would be better (more power, no charge time and continuous use) I made my purchase.To my surprise, the sprayer was BROKEN right out of the box! On the first use. I called Bissell customer service and they asked me for the serial number. According to Bissell the units serial indicated it was over a year old. I guess Amazon is selling OLD stock? Anyhow Bissell has agreed to replace the unit at their expense.One last thought, The battery operated unit has an electric pump for the spray which is nice, however this unit requires you to pump the spray like a Windex bottle. Hey Bissell why the down grade on this spotlifter?PRODUCT - 1 STARBISSELL CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4 STARS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We bought this after inheriting an outside dog that had to learn to become an inside dog. We had been using SpotShot which is a great product, but we were using a lot of it and it didn't seem very economical. When we got this we were very excited it did a fantastic job; it had great suction, cleaned stains that a professional couldn't get up (I do suppose that could be the cleaning solution that came with it though)and was exactly what we wanted. After a few uses, however it made a terrible noise and the gears in the rotating brush wore off, we returned it for another one I really figured that it was a rare occurrence (I should have done more research). The new one just made the same terrible noise and it is going back to the store tomorrow. If we replace it it will be with another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I liked that it had a constant power supply versus a cordless, but am not impressed with how weak the suction is. It takes a great deal of effort to get up any of the \\"dirty water\\". Leaves the carpet wet, even if you don't spray a lot of the solution. It is also heavy and noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible suction","review":"I have two dogs and bought this cleaner to help remove a stain where one of them threw up the night before. Although it did remove the stain, it left my carpet soaking wet! I used almost the whole tank of fluid and it didn't even suck up a tablespoon of dirty water. I continually ran the suction over it, but it didn't work. It's going back to the store tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the $","review":"I ended up taking this back and getting a Hoover full carpet cleaner. if you want to clean you carpets- get an upright steam cleaner- these things gt clogged and mine broke after the first use."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Bought this device when our cat was sick and we had lots of clean up to do. This was no help at all because it didn't work. First of all the sprayer for the solution didn't work at all. We were desperate so we sprayed the area with a hand sprayer and tried to clean it with this machine. It was a total waste and we returned it the next day. Replaced it with Bissell's Little Green spot cleaner (see my review). It cost twice as much but saved my sanity and my kitty's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotlifter?","review":"I have used Bissell products in the past and been pleased with the results.That being said, this product has been a disappointment out of the box. The trigger spray failed to spray and the \\"spotlifting\\" is poor at best. I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've had this products for a little over a year, and never have been able to get it to work properly. The spray mechanism is worthless, and we right off the bat wound up having to use a separate spray bottle. At the start, the suction portion (and yes, contrary to other reviewers' suggestions, we did have it correctly positioned for the job) would only pull back up less than a quarter of the solution put down. After a while it stopped suctioning anything up at all. The suction port quickly clogged with debris, and is impossible to clean, because the clear plastic shield is not removable. The rotating brushes aren't too difficult to remove, clean and replace ... but that is about the only plus to the thing.The machine is not worth the money spent, I'm sorry to say. Another life lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprayer doesn't work out of the box!","review":"This machine is terrible, the first time I went to use it the sprayer doesn't work!

I think you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK for the floor mats in your car - but not much else","review":"The biggest problem I have with my Spotlifter portable cleaner is it leaves the carpet very damp after you've attempted to clean a stain. It's good enough for cleaning the floor mats in the car, but it's practically worthless for cleaning shag / house carpets. The hand vacuum doesn't have much suction power, and hence the reason for using it primarily on car floor mats. You'd do better by simply purchasing a spray can of Woolite carpet cleaner, and use the Spotlifter only to work the soap into the stain, as that's about all the use the Spotlifter is good for. The bottom line - don't expect the results of an upright in handheld carpet cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a bad one?","review":"I have had Bissel products before and they were awesome. This one however arrived needing repair. When I had reinstalled the belt, the trigger which sprays solution stuck and would not recover. I finally poured solution on the spot only to find the unit had next to no suction. I sopped up the solution with a towel and returned the unit.Having had such good experience with Bissell in the past, I am truly sorry to write such an awful review, but this was not a good experience, and I am hesitant to try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOUD","review":"It works well. I bought it for pet issues, and it takes care of fresh and not so fresh spots. Pulling off the reservoir is somewhat difficult. The receptacle rinses easily, but you can't leave on the reservoir to rinse. It all has to come off. The cord is plenty long enough with a GFI on it which is nice. The only problem is that it is so loud I have to wear earplugs when I use it. It is like a jet taking off at the end of my arm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for doggies","review":"We got this because we have three dogs age 5, 15 & 16.

Oly used it once so far so i will update this review after more uses. The parts seperate easy to clean. You do have to tilt the reservoir to get in and out, but instructions are clear about how to do this. This product is just a spot cleaner. It is not a carpet cleaner. I knew this before we bought it. We use it for a cat that pukes every so often. Works perfectly for that. Glad we bought it. Only reason it has 4 stars is because we haven't used it enough to give a more complete review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, until.....","review":"I bought this yesterday after having the older, cordless version. The sprayer was horrible on this one, manual vs. automatic on the older version, but I figured I'd deal with it as we have pets and young children and were in a desperate situation! It was great yesterday...the spots I worked on showed improvement. When I went to use it today, however, the sprayer was putting out more of a drizzle, even with a full tank, and suddenly I realized the powerbrushes were no longer rotating. I checked them out and realized as another reviewer wrote, the plastic gears are worn away! I would expect that over time, but not in 24 hours! This goes back to the store tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The negative reviews were right on...","review":"It has terrible suction...it is loud and it doesn't clean very well, and I was just trying to use it to take little yogurt stains off the rug.

I had a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. and it was pretty good, but the hose just fell apart (cheap plastic). This product is a waste. Read the other reviews, it is correct that it has NO vacuum, and the spray part is like a hand pump...you have to pump it out with the trigger...unlike the Hoover which sprayed it out using the vacuum pressure. You can pump out a cup of hot liquid, and you will get back about a quarter of a cup. Then, I use my shop vac to get almost the last three quarters that this junk will leave in the carpet. At the moment, my spot clean method is a pyrex cup of hot water and cleanser, with a stiff dish brush to clean...and the wet/dry shop vac to suck up. Not very convenient!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets out spots from 3 cats and a dog","review":"Once you learn how to use it, this product is pretty amazing. I use it on a biweekly basis to get rid of kitties little furball presents. Also gets up dog pee and poo. The secret is to use a good carpet spot cleaning solution and to learn how to alternate between putting the brushes down to lather the cleaner and putting the vacuum down to suck up the solution. I used to use a little green machine but could get that to work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless piece of junk","review":"Right out of the box the pump-action carpet fluid trigger didn't work. Since it was out of warranty (I didn't try it until six months after I purchased it on Amazon) I took it apart and found that the plunger in the little pump was stuck and had to be manually helped to return to its proper position for a full pump. Obviously a defective part, but I got a good look at the insides of the machine. All of it looks flimsy, from the gears rotating the brushes to the delicate plastic tubing running from the reservoir in the back to the front nozzle.In essence this machinre is like a spray part of a steam iron, with rotating brushes to go over the prayed area. It's a lot less trouble to use a hand brush and a spray bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"We tried a couple different solutions to the \\"head-flop\\" problem in the newborn's carseat.

I didn't realize that the trimming wand and the handle that you use to manuever the vaccuum were one and the same. Kind of grossed me out. Also, it doesn't slide back together easily once you try to use the trimming wand. The hose has to be completely stretched out to replace the cleaning pipe. I bought it for that feature (easy access for attatchments). It also is very heavy. And last but not least, the inside filter clogged about the third time I used it. This caused the suction to completely stop on the attatchments. It took me a while to figure out why it wouldn't pick up any more.

I found it very easy to relate to and very sentimental since many females have and have had at one point in their life a close relationship with their mom. The memories are based on her life in Madrid when Soledad was a child and then eventually married and had her own children at which time her mother played an integral role in the life of her children as a grandparent. The book to me serves as a reminder to all of us of the importance of familiar relationships and that nothing last forever. Important people in our life need to be appreciated and oddly enough we sometimes only realize that when we become older or when they are gone... forever. This was a nice read and a pleasant reminder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I purchased this screw gun for my carpenter husband (he has over 16 years experience and loves this screw gun as well) to use when building our deck.

I agree that a Multi disc set is what these guys deserve, but this will come eventually. Anything this iconic... I mean who else has that ZZ logo that makes the best damn Key Chain in the world for the best and Coolest Car in the World, as well as the Coolest music...

I absolutely love it! I recommend it to anyone who likes Rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"ZZ top is a great band thats why ig ave this 2 stars.....but this greatest hits album lacks there early stuff. Its mostly from 77 and on like there MTV days when they became \\"pop\\". If you whant there early stuff (wich is better in my opinoin buy there first 2 albums)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machine Gun Rock","review":"It is nice to have the greatest hits including their earlier great tracks. I do love their machine gun styled upbeat 80s stuff such as ELIMINATOR and AFTERBURNER but their 70s blues flavored rock is also enjoyable.Until recently I didn't notice that Jimi Jamison of Survivor participated in Eliminator album and their 90s stuff. Yep, he serves as the backing vocal of GIMME ALL YOUR LOVING lending his high-tone vocal. ROUGH BOY is an excellently made power ballad though I am a bit surprised that they do such thing. I really miss STAGES from AFTERBURNER album and original version of LEGS but overall it is nicely made greatest hits package.If you like southern blues rock be sure to have this. And it is enjoyable to 80s rock fans for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZZ TOP RULES!!","review":"ZZ Top rules as they have produced some of the best music ever along with Metallica, Van Halen, and George Thorogood. This greatest hits CD has several excellent songs and my favorite tracks are La Grange, Gimme All Your Loving, Sleeping Bag, Sharp Dressed Man, Tush, and My Head's in Mississpii. FOR GREAT CLASSIC ROCK AND BLUES PLEASE PURCHASE THIS CD FOR YOUR COLLECTION. LONG LIVE ZZ TOP."},{"rating":"2","title":"zztop","review":"mostly fun to listen to...on the way to work it is motivating!

Comprised of Billy Gibbons on lead guitar, Dusty Hill on bass, and Frank Beard on drums, ZZ Top relies on good old-fashioned guitars and drums rather than keyboards to get their sound across. They have succeeded extremely well, and this Greatest Hits collection is a testament to their staying power.This great cd is an anthology of hits that has made ZZ Top a successful band for almost thiry years. Unforgettable songs such as \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"Tush\\", \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\", and \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" have become staples of ZZ Top. Perhaps the best song on the disc is the extended version of \\"Legs\\". Each song showcases ZZ Top's unique sound and Billy Gibbons' distinct vocal style.Each song on this disc is excellent. I recommend this disc very highly. Pick up ZZ Top's Greatest Hits and listen to some good Rrockin' blues music at its absolute best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of a great Texas Blues Band","review":"ZZ Top is a classic American blues band. Billy Gibbons is a master of blues guitar.Over the last 30 years or so they have come out with some of the finest blues you will ever hear.Gimme All Your Lovin, Sharp Dressed Man, Tush, Sleeping Bag.

Enjoy..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid book full of information.","review":"Part memoir, part social commentary, this book is about missing people in Great Britain. It's a bit dated now as it was written before the internet came into widespread use, but much of what it says still applies. The book is not about specific cases so much as the phenomenon in general. O'Hagan, a journalist, interviewed runaways and homeless people in addition to law enforcement officials as part of his research. Much of what he says, especially about the people who die and are left undiscovered in their apartments for months, makes for very depressing reading. This book is well worth the time to look at and fostered greater awareness in myself, although I knew a great deal about missing people already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Think","review":"This is the usual fare that critics at the New York Times discuss at trendy Manhattan restaurants, the kind of self pitying whining that distinguishes their \\"leisure\\" section for privileged urbanites, opposite the \\"news\\" where blood thirsty articles condoning American war crimes prevail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wicking and absorption","review":"I really like this product.

It may have better been titled Roman Pottery I Have Seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Distort History With Modern Views and Philosophy","review":"This is the kind of book that is easy to review--and easy to denigrate as a yet another effort to read the past through the lens and viewpoint of the present day. This book refuses to enter into the past times and refuses to present a viable history of the late Roman empire; the author disdains plausible historical conclusions and fairness in historical writing.Call it what you will, Marxist history, post-modern history, Howard Zinn history., this book appeals to people mis-educated in how to write and read history. There are empirical data in this book, but they only serve as a smokescreen to hide the imposition of the author's present-day emasculation of the truth of the past.Unfortunately, this kind of history is encouraged in today's colleges and among the so-called \\"intellectual elite. Read this book only to see how poorly history can be written. \\"Quid est haec dementia.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Stuff","review":"This little book is not going to catalogue all of the barbarian invasions or exhaustively explore the many reasons for the fall of the western Roman Empire but it is going to answer the question: what was the effect of the century-long collapse of civilization? The sensitive New Age Guy historiography of the 1990s that saw the invasions as a kind of semi-consensual rough wooing and which downplayed the older accounts of devastation and ruin have now been authoritatively blown out of the water. Ward Perkins shows that the barbarian incursions did, in fact, lead to the destruction of comfort, leisure, law and civilization and he has done so by meticulous demonstration of material evidence. The postmodernists who claim that exposing the truth of barbarian barbarity is merely a kind of lingering racism or \\"othering\\" the outsider should be embarrassed by the intellectual clarity and courage of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scholarly Analysis of the Fall of Rome","review":"Did Rome really fall? Did it matter? Was the fall of Rome just the loss of a collapsing city that left life much the same under the new barbarian overlords? These and others are the questions that Bryan Ward-Perkins asks in this book. This book is not a narrative of the events surrounding Rome's fall, but an argument that it truly did constitute an event of great magnitude. It is a struggle to read at times but it contains much useful information that cannot be found elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Chispa","review":"You should check out Banda Zeta if you like Techno-Banda.

Since this book is now a little dated, some of the issues discussed is only applicable to a discrete cache chip. It also has good detail on cache coherency protocol but the MESI/MOESI protocol described in the book is not exactly what's used in the industry so reader beware.

I highly recommend this product for anyone who has indoor pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a good job, but NOISY!","review":"I too loved the concept. However, the Catch-All Vac does not pick up enough to be Bissell Steam-Mop ready (5 stars! for the Steam-Mop) and it is noisy. If noise matters to you, stick with a manual carpet sweeper. A good manual carpet sweeper will pick up as much debris from bare floors as the Catch-All Vac, although it will not have a place to attach a dry dusting cloth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little Vac","review":"Very light and portable. Good price. I used it for the first time and it picked up rather well. The little can that holds larger particles does fill up quickly. Of course I am using it to pick up cat litter.

I read the other reviews and decided to give it a try. Battery life is extremely short... getting only one use before recharge and the only room I use it in is the kitchen. I have also noticed that after charging.. I put the battery back in the unit and didn't use the vac and the next day when I went to use it the battery was dead AGAIN. This product is a total piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for laminate wood flooring!","review":"I have a new home and my entire downstairs is laminate wood. I have three cats and a toddler, so needless to say, I have a ton of sweeping and cleaning to do on a daily basis. The Catch All has done a grea job on crumbs, dirt and cat hair. I just love it! The way the duster hooks on is great, it stays put and the vac works well too. Real sucking power. My only slight complaint is getting crumbs out of corners is challenging. If can be done, but with a bit more effor than is needed on the rest of the floor. Overall, this product is a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought this as I read in these reviews that it would be good for hardwood floors. Within the first week of using it on brand new hardwood floors and tile, it left behind scratches. It is now in my closet. I don't recommend this for hardwood floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this little machine!","review":"I have had this for approx 1 month and it's wonderful! I've never used a cordless sweeper before so I can only compare it to a broom or vacuum. It's much better than a broom, it doesn't flip the dirt all over the floor and it doesn't hurt my back like using a broom. It's so lightweight that I won't use my vacuum on hard surfaces now. It has the option of using the dust cloths but I use it without them too.Ideas for improvement are minor: I wish it would stay charged longer. Most of my house is hard surface and I usually have to charge it twice to clean all the floors. Also, the power button could be more in the middle because the bottoms of the kitchen cabinets tend to hit the button and power it off.I don't know how long this machine will last but after 1 month, it's still going strong. I think it's definitely worth a try for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay","review":"I have purchased many items through Amazon, yet I've never written a review. That's how thrilled I am after using this terrific little vacuum-broom-dusting thing for the first time. I have one dog, two cats and one fiance, and all of their furry deposits are now in the garbage can in two dense, neat clumps.Unless the battery turns out to suck, I will be rushing home after work each day to run my new best friend around all the bare floors in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"making housework that much easier","review":"I bought this because using a Swiffer/traditional broom combination just wasn't working for a two-bedroom apartment with all hardwood floors and two indoor cats. It's easy to set up, you can use any brand of electrostatic cloth with it, and it picks up all the grit that merely gets pushed around with a Swiffer or a broom. It gets stray cat litter (the bane of my life) like a charm, and it's easy to clean the brushes and dirt catcher as well. I only wish that the vacuum was a little stronger, but I can't complain. Dump your broom; this is worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery needs work","review":"I purchased this item this summer and at first it was great, picked up everything, until the battery life went south. It would work for a few minutes on full-power and then it was going dead but would run for 20 minutes. Thought I might have over charged the batter and ruined it so I purchased another one and this one I made sure that I didn't over charge the battery and the same thing happened again. Maybe I got two batterys that were lemons but what are my chances. It was great while it lasted. $20.00 a battery is not worth it if it only works for a few months...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I had brought the swiffer vac but due to a recall I had to send it back and so I thought I would try this. Didn't work nearly as well as the swiffer. One it didn't fit under my cupboards like the swiffer vac did and it didn't pick up everything. The swiffer vac was wonderful and I'll be waiting for swiffer to come out with a new one. I sent this one back"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"This doesn't work very well, the battery doesn't stay charged long enough to finish the job.

Yes they are easier to clean but, since you can SEE all the dust and dirt and pet hair - seem to need it more often.This makes cleanup easy - is it is light, suprisingly powerful and easy to store. PLUS - each time we use it (daily) we are shocked at how much dirt comes out of the removable debris cup on unit - pet hair and food scraps we could not even see !(...)I give it 4 stars, would give 5 if: Charger was wall mountable ( the vac has a neat wall hanger handle, and folds flat to hang on the wall in about the same space as a broom would take, but the charger is a table top device - wish I could mount them together on the wall in the utility room - would be really handy ).

We have a \\"fur\\" child that sheds constantly and this will get his silky hairs from under everything. The cup is quick and easy to empty. I first used it with the Swiffer but I find that I really don't need to. This picks up everything we need it to. I am glad that I bought this one instead of the Shark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it kept running, I would have kept it!","review":"I ordered this because of the Swiffer recall. When I first got it, I loved it, especially on carpeting. However, within a few weeks, the battery pack kept getting loose and I had to constantly keep pushing it back in. It finally got to the point that I had to duck-tape the battery pack down for it to run and that didn't work too well. So, it went back to Amazon. I've ordered quite a few things with Amazon just because of their return policy. They even paid for the return shipping.I've since purchased a Dirt Devil Power Sweeper and that is much better. It's dirt cup is quite large and no paper filters to bother with. It works well on my hardwood floors, area rugs and even the wall-to-wall. It's also a lot quieter than the Bissell. Nice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No difference between this and the dustbuster on a stick....","review":"None. Actually may be a bit worse. Doesn't really cut it for kitchen sweep up with small children. Just doesn't pick much up over the size of dust. Probably would be great if you're just getting pet hair or daily dust, but if you have children under five, then this won't cut it. The catch tray is also too small, even for much pet hair probably. And, the on switch is on top of the unit, so if you're trying to get under kitchen cabinet overhangs, it turns itself off. AND, the battery charging thing is a pain - the other kind has a plug in to the unit as opposed to a charging unit (those always seem to disappear at my house).Oh well. Move this one upstairs for dust and finally cave in for a real one. Drat. I really liked the cordless concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Primer","review":"Understanding the Scriptures is a very easy to read primer on the seven Sacraments of the Church as in the Church today. Mr. Stravinskas explains each sacrament well, without going into unnecessary detail that would lose the average reader. In the first chapter the author explains what a sacrament is; then he devotes a chapter to each sacrament. One of the most interesting parts of the book is the epilogue in which the author speaks out on his opinions on the state of the sacraments in the Church today!This is a book you will enjoy reading, it's not a boring discourse and it's easy enough for young adults to read. This book is solidly orthodox Catholicism without any special interest spin found so often in Catholic books these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"It was ok, but not great.

Then, he calls an HKMP5A4 a MP4. Mr.Halberstadt, there is no such thing as a MP4. He refuses to give the reader more depth, and mistakingly calls the MP5k, just the MP5.

The side buttons are for the back and forward functions in your browser.

Use the grinding/metal cutting blade if you've got paper thin metal to cut or trim. Otherwise it's a trip back to the hardware store for either a replacement or something much more robust. My first one ended with the arbor lock breaking and the blade permenantly affixed. Also, the gear mechanism is so cheesy it stripped out and now there's no torque on the blade. I went back for a second zip mate (maybe the first was just a dud?) and the second has done the same as the first (stripped out gears). But don't think I was out cutting brick or concrete with this thing. It was all light duty work. When cutting masonry the blade makes its way through the material on its own. You don't force it.

I then purchased the Zip Mate attachment, and have been disappointed with it ever since. It does a nice job of cutting, and such, but the problem is with the alignment procedure for the pinion gear. If you install the gear into the Rotozip, and don't get it down far enough, it will rub an axel inside the Zip Mate, and destroy your attachment. The tip of the pinion gear axel will also round over, not allowing you to remove the Zip Mate attachment without taking the unit apart. I wish there was some way to see how far up the gear is setting so that you could re-ajust if needed. Other then that, I love my Rotozip tool"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zip Mate","review":"I have used this tool and I cannot believe that a company would try to sell this off as a grinder type tool.

I just broke my Zip Mate yesterday, probably due to the gear being misaligned.I can't see paying $$ to replace the Zip Mate when I only paid $$ for the entire Roto Zip / Zip Mate kit on sale last January.

I first had issues with my Rotozip it wasn't a year later that I needed to use the Zipmate after my warranty was out,and it was a dissapointment as the Rotozip was.What a waste of money! it would be a great tool if it worked as advertised sadly it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems fine","review":"It's shipped from a different vendor but it seems fine.

This shouldn't be important to most people since the fit is good and I don't expect much \\"leakage\\", however, not being genuine, it may not be a real HEPA filter, and if that is a health requirement for you, you might want to pay a premium and order from Amazon directly.I had weird burning/tarring smells coming from my vacuum and found that this filter was extremely dirty (it was black on one side and white on the other). After the switch, I ran the vacuum for a bit and it seems like it has since disappeared. Bottom line, replace your filters every so often!

I received two \\"Crucial Vacuum\\" branded filters when I ordered this item (Bissell HEPA Media Filter, 32076).As noted in the review of the Crucial filters,Bissell Style 7, Style 9 HEPA Media Filter; Compare to Bissell Part#32076, these filters are notably short (~1.8mm). Numerically, this may seem like a small difference in tolerances, but it allows a significant amount of air leakage through these gaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Fit for Style 7","review":"Purchased the filter from Amazon.com (vs. the Fulfilled by Amazon vendors), and still did not receive a genuine Bissell product -- a generic version. Also had the same issue as a previous reviewer of the filter being about 1mm to 2mm too small (thus defeating the point of being an air filter). I ended up folding up a piece of flat cardboard to fill in the space -- seems to work OK, but not ideal of course.In short, poor manufacturing quality on this generic version of the Style 7 Bissell filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as expected","review":"I took a chance based on the other reviewers and hoped that I would receive a genuine product. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. The filter sent is smaller than the original. In my opinion, this is false advertising to say it is a genuine Bissell filter. I was replacing the genuine Bissell HEPA filter on my vacuum and the one sent to me was much smaller leaving a gap of about 1/4 inch all around. On top of that, the side that faces in and collects all of the dirt is black! In the original, it was a white filter and the picture for this product indicates it would also be a white filter. How is one supposed to know when the filter is clogged if it starts black? I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap After Market Item","review":"The item i received was not the actual filter, but a cheap knock off.

Some DYI websites say that you need a pneumatic nailer, but this one works fine and is less expensive. Best of all, it does not consume any power other than a swing of the mallet. Since I did not have readily available power on the job site, this was a obvious choice. It jammed on me once or twice, always my fault for not having it aligned properly or double swinging when the nail was not set right. But, this was easy to fix. I was able to disassemble the machine, pull the jammed nail out and reassemble the device is a few minutes.

Can not say as to how they work as I have no way of using them without a nailer. Looks like the best use for them might be a paper weight.

Needless to say, I sent them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errr, kind of hard to evaluate a nail, but....","review":"I used these nails to install a tongue and groove pine floor. As far as a nail goes they are pretty typical.

Used in a Ramsond RMM4 gun. They worked perfect. Never jammed and always went in except for when a nail hit another nail already in the floor.I would like to comment on Amazon and shipping these. I order 3 boxes and only one made it without the nails getting out of their box and spliting and getting all over. It's the luck of the draw, if Amazon would just tape up the nails in their box I think that would fix it but just thought I'd pass it along that it maybe better to buy them localy if you want them intact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"half county","review":"Watching DVD after the 5th song is wasting of time and one good country song.

It's unfortunate that it didn't work out. First of all, Byrne's voice, which usually adds energy and intrigue to the music, merely gets in the way on this album. (\\"Girls On My Mind\\" in particular) On top of that, many of the songs are just plain irritating (\\"Monkey Man\\",\\"Twistin' In The Wind\\",Girls On My Mind\\") or forgettable (\\"Hanging Upside Down\\",\\"She's Mad\\") All of that said, this album does have some good points, like the catchy refrain on \\"Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)\\" and another on \\"Million Miles Away\\". Overall, this album isn't terrible, it's just not at the level of Byrne's other solo albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grossly Underrated Gem","review":"David Byrne's albums always seemed to go by unnoticed, and with Uh-Oh, this is truly a crime. This album is so diverse and colorful and it really deserves some recognition. With the help of a lot of different musicians and instruments, this is a very bright and happy album. The comical opener, \\"Now I'm Your Mom\\" starts out a bit off-beat (musically and in subject matter), but includes a wondefully rhythmic chorus. Other highlights include \\"Girls On My Mind\\", in which Byrne's vocal delivery is extremely reminiscent of the latter days of Talking Heads, which is cool to hear. \\"Hanging Upside Down\\" has features enjoyable and fun lyrics with a driving guitar throughout. \\"The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)\\" is a very jumpy tune which truly captures the essence of 'Uh-Oh'. The album's closer, \\"Somebody\\", is also probably its best track with a very epic and large feeling which ends this album perfectly.

Online dating is A LOT more competitive now than it was 10 years ago and techniques like \\"end your message with a joke\\" are really commonsense.

Each Inspector Banks book moves us further into his life and ties us closer to his very believable characters.This book takes a short detour into the past with a wonderfully creditable portrayal of wartime England, while moving the reader subltly along in Bank's life.

I couldn't put this book down from the first page. Fair warning, however: there isn't a great deal of mystery here. You figure out what's going on pretty soon. However, like the best novels of Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell), this book is not so much about what happened as it is about the characters. Peter Robinson absolutely shines at creating characters that you really care about. It is the unfolding of these characters and the vivid representation of Yorkshire in the 1940s that make this book one of the most interesting I have read in recent years. I highly recommend this book, and can't wait to read his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn\`t know it\`s part of a series of books","review":"This book was one of the last books I bought in Germany before I immigrated to the US and finally I read it on my honeymoon.I picked the book because I was always fascinated by flooded towns(I strongly recommend \\"Under the Lake\\" by Stuart Woods)in dams, so this one definitely fulfilled all my expectations.But I don\`t think I\`ll read his other books. Usually those series of books by Martha Grimes and Elizabeth George etcetera are very repititious, the first one or two books are usually quite promising and the third is just a variation of the same theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, predictable plot; dull characters","review":"Very disappointing. Weak plot, boring characters, particularly the main one, Inspector Banks (even his angst is tedious), and a story that should have been told in 150 pages combine for a very weak novel. Only the last 30 pages come alive (also, a few with Gloria). I am truly astonished by the reader reviews and professional critiques. For those interested in crime fiction and psychological suspense you will have to read Breakheart Hill for the psychological element and Void Moon for the crime fiction. Then find a copy of Andrew Taylor's Four Last Things, quite simply the finest suspense novel of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fanastic Story - You'll Enjoy This One!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This is the fourth of the Banks series that I have read, and it is my favorite so far.A skeleton is found under the floor in a house at the bottom of a flooded reservoir that has dried out in a drought.Two stories then begin. One, modern day, in which Banks tries to piece together what happend to this woman more than 50 years ago. The second story take place in the past and tells the story of the dead woman as it really happened. All the while, the reader gets to watch Banks try and reconstruct the killing, while also reading the actual story as it happens leading up to the killing.The other nice thing about the Banks series is that it gives us \\"Yanks\\" a slight flavor of what it's like to live in the UK. This is also very refreshing.Buying this book is money well spent. Give it to a friend when you're done. They'll thank you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book!","review":"I had this book sitting on my bookshelf for over a year. I'd picked it up at the airport, read the first few pages and then set it aside, the way I do with countless other books I buy.The other night, I was desperate for something \\"light\\" to read and I picked it up again. Read another chapter and I was hooked.I like the way that Robinson writes--spare but with enough detail that all the various descriptions of wartime Britain that I grew up with somehow came together into a poignant whole for me. And the mystery itself was a good one; very suspenseful with a few twists that weren't \\"unfair\\". . .the clues were there when I scanned back.I've read lots and lots of the modern English mystery writers and I think that Robinson could well become my favorite. However, as this is my first, I will reserve my final judgement until I can get to the bookstore (tonight!) and start on another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of ten Allan Banks's mysteries","review":"I have been a big fan of Mr.Robinson's for many years since I read his short story \\"Innocence\\". I have read all his Allan Banks' mysteries and his last book is great. The characters from the past as well as from present are all very written. You remember them long after you finished reading. The war period description is very realistique. And, of course, Allan Banks is as good as usual in solving the crime which is over fifty year old. I like Allan very much. Let's face it: there is not very many great investigators who listens to the classical music and reads nineteen century english writers. Banks does not talk much, but he can listen and observe, and he cares about the cases he investigates. In this book he gets a lot of help from new character, Annie. I hope we will see both Allan and Annie in new mr.Robinson's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing audio book","review":"This refers to the audio version only:The wife has read the entire series one after the other and really enjoyed them. Since I'm in the car for my job I listen to a lot of audio tapes. I liked the story well enough, but the reader is terrible. For some reason he thinks Banks' voice is deeper than whale dodo. He strains to get the deepest possible register and frankly I found it very annoying. I mean no one talks like that. It may be that the reader has no confidence using his voice for femine characters, so he uses his regular voice for the female characters, then feels he has to go super low for the masculine. I managed to get through the whole book but just barely.I tried another of the Bank's series, but got so irritated at the unbelieveable voice I had to give it up. If I ever get the time I'll have to read the series as I sort of enjoyed the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drama and historical detail","review":"This is one of my favorite DCI Banks books. I thought the historical details were interesting and the present day drama was skillfully interwoven. I love the way the author gets inside the heads of his different characters. Their thoughts and descriptions of each other make the characterizations so much more subtle and more-dimensional. I enjoyed reading about Banks and Annie meeting for the first time as I was introduced to the series through some of the newer books, when their complicated relationship had already been established."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as exciting as the jacket describes....","review":"I found the book to be slow moving and at times hard to follow. I didn't get caught up in the story until I got to about page 150, I had to continue to read in hopes that the book would eventually become exciting, as exciting as the jacket described it to be.The main thing about this book is that there is three main stories with many subplots. There was way too much information given about minor characters. However, the main character, Alan Banks, although a bit strange was a very strong character. Eventually you get halfway through the book and the story becomes interesting, but unfortunately, I figured out who the murderer was early on in the story. It seemed as though it was difficult for Peter Robinson to keep the story moving forward. It wasn't the worst book I've read, but it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated for most hobbyists","review":"While the book itself is great, and shows how to build an \\"industrial (almost)strength\\" type machine, the required complexity and construction, are beyond the ability of many hobbyists (as well as being relatively expensive). In particular, it requires welding and fabrication skills not generally available to the home hobbyist. Having said that, there is much to be learned, and using some of instructions and resources in the book, many people could easily build (as I intend) to build a somewhat simpler version, than is shown in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great harness","review":"This is a great harness, it's not complicated to put on, my dog seemed to feel comfortable in it, it did not seem to chaff him behind the front legs and it was sturdy, I didn't worry it would break while out for a walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Pimp Movie ever!","review":"All bitches are the same...I keep em broke! keep em looking good and all that but NOO DOUGH!!!

One thing I notice while viewing this movie was that it was a video copy from someone placing a camcorder in front of a TV recording this movie camera with the close-capture words at the bottom of the scream. At first I thought that my close-capture was on but further examination show that this was a second rate DVD. I’m going to keep this DVD with the close-capture but no further orders from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Hype!","review":"I had heard so much about this. Rappers talked about it. Rappers acted like him, but this film is not at all what I expected. Keeping in mind that I saw it on VHS and the quality was very questionable for Blockbuster.Anyway, this Mack in my mind was to be a powerful pimp who took no s**t. Instead, he is a laughing all of the time, guy who seems to not be concerned with what's going on around him.I won't go into details as I don't want to waste much more time on a film like this, but it is hard to watch and one of the corniest of the 1970's black films, or films starring more black people than white people, so they are black. I did not want to see this again. Most of those films I keep in my mind with the idea of adding them to the collection, but not this one. This film has too much hype! Where is \\"Three the Hard Way\\" on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"blaxploitation at it finest!","review":"i'm so glad i own this now i had it on VHS back in the day and now it is in my DVD collection and i'm very happy.this is a blaxploitation classic if u dig this kinda cinema then do yourself a favor an get this movie you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"took me back to my teenage years","review":"It's been years since I've seen the Mack.

Much like him, I love \\"revenge\\" films and this is a classic in that genre. Released in 1973 (some 38 years ago) this one will stand the test of time. What a great commentary on the life as a pimp, a prostitute, corruption and devotion to family. This is a must...and I can't say enough for the 70's fashion. You'll \\"dig\\" these rags. All 5 stars.

Didn't see it until I was forty, and was definitely disappointed. The movie was trash and I hated to even rate it with a star, but the computer wouldn't let me leave it blank.Black people are the last people on earth who should be watching such nonsense, which so thoroughly degrades and exploits Black women...Not to mention how it insults the strengthening of Blacks as a race. Goldie was a punk whose highest pathetic dream was to make him some money off the backs of unthinking women. Viewing such things was about as interesting as watching a movie that's promoting the reinstatement of slavery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This a Classic film about the pimp game.

I paid $40 for each pair and was severely underwhelmed. WHile they look great, they are the most uncomfortable flats that I own. They are a bit narrow and too snug for my slightly wide feet even though I order them a half size bigger. I would not reccommend these, however if you have narrow feet they are an okay buy for the current price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate V-Twin Chassis","review":"I have been contemplating building my dream bike and picked up this book to learn more on about the chassis of a bike. This book provides some good basic information, namely the different manufacturers. However, I think it could have went into more detail on things like the geometry of the frame or effects of swing arm length. In alot of instances, instead of going into detail the writer points you towards your local shop for info. There were plenty of pictures but overall not much text. It felt like a lot of the pictures where there just to make the book longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better.....","review":"Pretty pictures, but in all a very shallow book about the basics of creating a bike by bolting together purchased componenents. Just one page devoted to discussing trail, and only a vague sentence or two on how it effects handling. Then, a complete chapter on how a pro shop fabricates a frame. Interesting, but anyone with the ability to actually make a frame won't be impressed by the knowledge presented, and anyone without the ability will be no closer to it by reading. The book seems thrown together; too much info here, not nearly enough there."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you know nothing, its a start","review":"If you are like me, and have never built a chopper, only riden rice burners, it has good information.

It features a great combination of strength, flexibility, and cardio if you really put in the effort.I also like that it's a barefoot, low impact workout. No special equipment needed.Ellen is a master at easing you into some high intensity moves and then backing off just in time. I also like how she lets the music set the rhythm in all of her dvd's.Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"energizing and relaxing","review":"I love kick boxing and high intensity cardio but am worried about the long-term impact on my knees. As a break I bought this video. At first I felt disappointed, because the workout was so easy. Towards the middle to end of the workout I started to feel slow burn. It was more intense than I thought while being relaxing. In just a week, I feel the results physically, but also mentally. I would recommend this video to anybody who needs to get back into shape, or wants to maintain their conditioning but doesn't want a high intensity or advanced fitness video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Ellen","review":"I really enjoyed this workout. It provides a lot of different variations for anyone, no matter the fitness level to be able to follow. I have to say there are a lot of piles and tone, ankle, pointing. So, if your not used to ballet this can cause your ankles and feet to get sore or cramp up. Other than that.. nice DVD. Ellen's cues are excellent, her smile and information about what you are doing and why you are doing it are amazing! This is a must have for any fitness collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for joints and back w/ graceful movements","review":"I have chronic back and neck pains from working in front of the computer all day everyday in a stressful environment, and this exercise program really loosens and stretches my back in no other physical therapy can do. The movements are so graceful and feminine and yet I get a good total body workout. It is so much fun and I'm totally addicted to it. Ellen is a great instructor with calming, confident and yet soft voice, with helpful tips. I exercise to a lot of DVDS of yoga, cardio, weights and stretch, and this is one of the best and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen is my homegirl!","review":"If you sit at a desk all day and have hideous neck and back pain..... this is your workout. These exercises feel so good after sitting at a desk and wearing heels, I want to cry with happiness when my back starts to loosen up. It's my #1 favorite mid-week workout ever. It's not super high impact, but it does have sufficient intensity and length that it's not a strictly \\"light\\" work-out video.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well rounded workout!","review":"I stumbled upon Ellen's crunch pilates video when I first started working out at home - though I liked it - the Crunch format got to me. Ater seeing her on Fit TV I was reminded how much I enjoyed her easy workout style. This video gives you a work out that will get your heart rate going (not too harsh) and will tone and stretch your musceles. You feel it the next day - however it is a very well rounded and well balanced work out which leaves you feeling energized and happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings...","review":"While this is gentle on the body if you have back/knee issues, it's BORING and repetitious. It drove me crazy.Just when you think, thank GOD this is almost done, you realize you still have the OTHER side of your body to work out. After a half an hour, frankly, I was done! Not physically, but mentally.I did feel the burn the next day and it honestly helped my torn rotator cuff, BUT the thought of doing it again left little to be desired. I like to either work both sides of my body one after the other or at the same time. I think it's just a mental thing, but it makes the time seem to go by faster.If you don't mind this, this is a great workout; if you DO mind it, keep looking for others out there that offer great benefits without the mental strain (i.e. Leslie Sansone, my fave)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is basically an \\"in class\\" production and a bad one at that.","review":"This is basically an \\"in-class\\" taping and a very bad one at that.Which is a shame since the exercise regime could be a good one if you could get past the droning soundtrack, intermittently audible cues, and vertiginous cinematography. Ellen Barrett drops a few grades by showing so little respect for her audience as well as the talent contribution of other professionals.Unless you already know her every move by heart, and are a die hard fan, avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"love dvd and ellen barrett","review":"This workout is so good because it combines cardio, pilates, and even ballet moves to give you a good workout; even though I didn't sweat that much, I definitely felt the burn. Ellen Barrett's focus aside from giving you a great workout is also that you feel good during and after the workout. Another thing I like about Ellen Barrett is that she is always focused on getting you a longer leaner shape and avoiding bulk. I am definitely seeing a difference especially in my legs/thighs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Ellen's Cardio!","review":"At first I really didn't think that this was going to do anything \\"cardio\\" to me.

I love Ellen's style, she is a great instructor and I always enjoy her videos. I also love that I get a great workout in bare feet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fresh and effective","review":"This workout is deceptive. Done properly you will sweat and your muscles will feel the effects afterwards. This is a thorough workout--all muscles are worked with a very good cardiovascular component. One word of caution, if you are at all uncoordinated there are some moves toward the end of the workout that require some thought and probably should be practiced in isolation. However,this is a workout that leaves you feeling energized and invigorated. I like the fact you don't need shoes but you should have a yoga or pilates mat. Ellen is inspiring and lively without being annoying and the music is also motivating. I particularly like it as I work out very early in the morning and don't always enjoy a lot of hyperactivity and noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful workout","review":"Many, many years ago, I took \\"Modern Dance\\" classes in college.

I can see, and feel, the reappearance of muscles that I haven't used in years. I have been away from consistent exercise for quite a while.

I've never been one to do weight lifting or serious cardio. Ellen's workouts keep me feeling great. I alternate between the three videos during the week (Mon, Wed, Fri)and do my treadmill in between for more cardio. Over the years, I've joined various exercise programs only to quit because of the inconvenience. With Ellen, I can do the routines right in my own home, first thing in the morning, then get on with my day. I have two other of her tapes, but prefer the three I mentioned. I believe these exercise programs will keep me feeling good and hopefully prevent some of the stiffness and lack of mobility that plagues many of us as we get older.

I was very excited about this DVD, and while the workout itself was fabulous, everything else was disappointing. The backdrop in the studio is a little distracting.

However, that was possibly the worst use of $240 imaginable. I can run over the same little bit of dirt numerous times, then go get either the Eureka or the Shark electric broom to actually get it up. The concept is sound, and so many of us would more than welcome a true, efficient cordless vacuum, but folks, this ain't it. Last night my husband came home with a new Oreck, cord and all....after going through two battery packs vacuuming with The Beast (apt nickname considering size and weight), the Oreck pulled up twice what was in The Beast's canister and did it, even with moving the plug around in less than a third the amount of time.Sign me still waiting in Southern California....http://www.morganriver.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Freedom","review":"Finally someone smart figured this out.

I like the fact that I wont run over the cord with the brush and have to replace it because I frayed it with the brush. It has plenty of cleaning power, I have a dark brown carpet so I need to vacuum frequently. It is super easy to empty the canister, the batteries last a little longer than the 1/2 that they claim, you are never without power, they are also very easy to change, the only flaw I found was it didn't get close enough to the edge for my taste, with the dark carpet I can even see light dust. Of course that's what the attachments are for, but if it had edge cleaning capabilities I would consider it the perfect vacuum. It does a great cleaning job, it's easy to use, and easy to maintain."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, it doesn't work, and don't count on your warranty...","review":"The unit's brushes become clogged with junk, mainly hair, and then shut off every 10 seconds to 1 minute. Yes, we've taken it apart; yes, the batteries are conditioned and charged fully; no, my carpet is not tall. After several calls to Salton (Westinghouse's distributor) they sent me a replacement that was dirtier and more dinged up than my own vacuum and had the same problem out of the box. They did apologize and send another; however, the money-back part of your warranty they say is only if the product is discontinued.

We let all customers turn the vacuums on and check displays out before purchasing and even though it is the easiest for me to display, since I don't have to run to an outlet everytime someone wants to turn it on, it is a waste of my time as no one is interested once they get to really check it out. It's bulk and weight are a large turnoff followed by it's lack of power. Yes I conditioned the batteries. Westinghouse spent too much time making it look cool rather then making it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"When I bought this, I was excited by the cordless feature. BUT the vacuum does not pick up anything heavier than a feather. I thought that a cordless vacuum would save me time because I would not have to plug it in. But this is not the case. I was constantly having to change the power packs and emptying the canister took way too many steps. Also, the charger is always plugged in, wasting energy. The vacuum comes with 2 battery packs, but only one fuse for the battery packs. So you have to order the second fuse. <br />The hose does not click into place easily, so when I use the vacuum, it constantly falls off. <br />I have had this vacuum for only 1 1/2 years but it is already broken. Although I am sad that I have to fork out some more money for another vacuum, I am glad that I can finally get rid of this piece of junk.<br />I ONLY recommend this vacuum if you have a serious lack of outlets in your home, minimal dust, and no carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convient, but ineffective","review":"I love this concept, but until this vaccuum can perform better, it is not worth the convenience. It claims to be 15 amps, but the sucking power doesn't even come close to that of a 12 amp plug in model. I'm returning mine tomorrow, and purchasing a plug in. Hopefully in 10 years when my plug in dies, the cordless will be up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT Suck (anything)","review":"Got this for Christmas. Took 48 Hours to Condition both batteries. It is VERY heavy to push (not self-propelled) and it doesn't pick up things visible on the floor and carpet. Took it back to the store. Bought another brand - filled the dirt cup up 3 times (and this was 1 day after I vacumed w/ the Westinghouse). As I was packing it up to return it, I saw all the yech was stuck in the bottom of the vacuum - something another reviewer mentioned is an on-going problem. STAY AWAY FROM THIS EXPENSIVE NIGHTMARE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst I have ever had!","review":"I bought this vacuum because of it being cordless and that is a plus with this vacuum. Perhaps the only one.I have had this since the 1st part of October, not having been smart enough to return it. Every single week since I have had it I have had to take the plastic bottom off and unstop it as it does not put the dirt in the canister or at least very little of it. I have just finished doing it again. It is always clogged. I have never been able to find out if it works good or not as running it over one carpet and we are clogged again.So, here I am, stuck with a vacuum not worth a hoot and have no decent vacuum to clean with so I have had to buy another one.I e-mailed the company but got no satisfaction so I am out $300.Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WESTINGHOUSE UNPLUGGED... Timing is everything!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this vac at Target (on sale for 149$). I was at first disapointed because after conditioning and charging the batteries I couldn't get the vac to suction. But after taking the botton plastic \\"thing\\" out of the bottom and only have the clear shield on the botton. It seems to be working really GREAT. I only use it for light daily routine cleaning. I also have a Shark Cordless sweeper and that one works GREAT. The Unplugged comes in a close second to my Shark. Wait to buy the Unplugged until it goes on Sale!!!!!! Don't waste your money on paying full price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned before even trying!!!","review":"I did not even try this vacuum! Once I read the maintenance schedule for the unit it went back!! It has 4 filters with 4 different cleaning frequencies and four different cleaning methods! Give me a break! The Editorial review on this site says \\"life long HEPA filter\\", very deceiving as it doesn't mention the other three! I would not recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogs Constantly -- Sooo Frustrating","review":"I purchased this vac at Target mainly because of its cordless feature. It worked great when I first got it; however, within a few months it was clogging constantly and not getting my carpets clean. I have to disassemble the bottom compartment and empty it every time I use this vac. even though I go around and pick up all the bits of leaves, crumbs, paper, etc. before vacuuming. After only 16 months or so I am about to replace it. I have kept the filters clean, and the batteries charged and conditioned as recommended - this doesn't seem to help. Also, the onboard tools (brushes, crevice tool) fall out of their holders constantly. Perhaps this vac would be ok for someone with no pets, kids or heavy foot traffic, but it is definitely not up to any type of heavy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak & Heavy","review":"I cannot recommend this vacuum. It is very heavy (expected considering the battery) and it does not clean very well. Suction is weak and the connection from the cleaning head to the body of the machine is very narrow as are the channels in the cleaning head itself. The result is it clogs repeatedly on hair, small pieces of paper, anything much larger than a grain of sand. This would be a smaller nuisance if they had made it easier to clear the jam but it requires tools (screwdriver) and you must turn the device over which is awkward.On a somewhat more pointed issue the machine does not clean even remotely as well as competing corded products such as the Hoover Windtunnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time nor your money!!!","review":"I bought this item in October and have had nothing but problems with the it. Not only the first one, but the second one that the manufacturer sent out as a replacement. Westinghouse normally makes good products, so I was amazed at the waste of money I spent on this product. The suction is not even there, the hose is a great idea; when it is not falling out of its holster area. Worked so-so on tile butreally lacked suction on carpet.I have a vacuum that I don't even use. The idea is great but it should have an option for cord use and I think that will help a little since it works better for the first ten minutes and then goes down hill fast from there.The place I purchased this from was a dude also... even after all of my problems they wouldn't even give me a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum doesn't suck &#65533; have suction, that is","review":"Contrary to the main Amazon review posted with this product, I bought the Westinghouse WST1600 Unplugged Cord-Free Vacuum and I have just sent it back. I thought it was too good to be true, and it was. The power was pitiful; emitting a weak whirring sound more like a fast-food giveaway toy than an almost-$300 appliance, it dragged more dust and fuzz across the floor than it picked up, and the amber light started flashing that the battery charge was almost spent, WAY before the advertised half hour. (Yes, I had fully conditioned the batteries for 48 hours before starting). I really wanted to love this machine, because other than its lack of pick-up power, it is beautifully designed, and all of its parts would seem to fit together perfectly and fulfill their mission with ease -- if only it would suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsatisfied","review":"If you like recharging ever 10 minutes, cleaning HEPA and other filters often and pushing dirt around your house this vacuum is for you.

I read other people complain about this after purchasing the various versions out there, I just purchased one, and sure enough it's just a tad warped where I cannot fully insert a towbar into it. The top bike-rack mount is fine, but the main receiver is just that much bent where the only possible way I could get the towbar inserted into it would be using a sledgehammer and I'm not going to ruin my towbar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The item could be sold for double and be worth it","review":"Every so often an item comes along that not only works but it's priced low.

It is a complete waste of time. It is an exercise on the part of the author to say absolutely nothing in so many words. There is nothing funny in the book.

A man tricked into becoming a soldier in the union army (Janssen) attempts to escape the prison camp he's in. The first time is a failure and so the movie begins. He does 30 days in \\"the box\\" and tells the jailer his time was up \\"three days ago\\". Janssen (Macho) does manage to escape on his next attempt. This man has had all he can take of what life has dished out to him. That's the only reason I can think of why he would kill a man (Carradine) over a bottle of champagne. Carradine and Jean Seberg had just been married. She witnesses his death from the second story of their honeymoon suite. The marshall of the town decides Macho acted in self defense but Seberg goes after him and offers a sizeable reward. The ending is sad and ironic but there aren't many good westerns with happy endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Parents and Students","review":"Finally, a book that looks at all aspects of finding and funding training for a career after high school.

It's the adventures of a young Austrian refugee who volunteered as a British agent and was dropped into France posing as a German agent and carrying false invasion plans just before D-Day, World War II. Partially because of his convincing performance, the Germans were ready for an invasion at Calais, with Normandy defenses left weak enough so Allied losses on June 6, 1944 were far less than expected. He knew he would be exposed shortly after that date-he was then supposed to escape. He did, but it wasn't easy. I was fascinated by this incredible but true story, the facts for which British writer James Leasor obtained about 1980 from previously secret sources.

Pagan Celtic mythology is strongly overlaid--to the point of being muffled and erased--with Christianity, Greek zodiacs, and the Olympic pantheon. (A Valentine's cupid in the Lovers card, and Janus as the Celtic god of death?) Sexuality is not positively portrayed. The woman in the Lovers card crouches over, hiding her breasts, and Queen Margawse is characterized as \\"fatally flawed\\" because she is lustful. The Culdees are described as holding onto the remnants of Druidism and being a \\"lower cultus of spiritual development.\\" There are no pictures for 1-10 of the minor arcana, only symbols, and I found that difficult to relate to.

Cahoone wanders a similar musical landscape as Kathleen Edwards and Allison Moorer. Though her songs depict a less graphic world, it's still a painful and lonely one. However, despite all this, there a thread of hope woven throughtout the tapestry of her songs. \\"Couch Song\\", the album's best track, is an absolute gem. Consider it a primer for an impressive album with nary a weak song. Though this one may have slid under your radar, it's one of the better surprises from 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Own","review":"A simply wonderful album.

If I had had the misfortune of being treated by the authors, my Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosis would never have been made. I was one of many whose TSH remained low yet I had very elevated TPO antibodies. Fortunately, my endocrinologist understood that not everyone with Hashi's presents with an elevated TSH unlike these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by my doctor","review":"My doctor recommended this book.

Sticks to a very by-the-book, TSH-test-is-king, \\"if your blood test is normal you must be fine,\\" endocrinologist-driven perspective of thyroid disease. Ain is a thyroid cancer doctor, Rosenthal is a thyroid cancer survivor. While their discussions of thyroid cancer are detailed and may very well be helpful to thyroid cancer patients, it's evident that neither has much personal experience or new information to share on topics beyond thyroid cancer. Might be a good addition for a thyroid cancer patient, or someone who wants a basic conventional overview reference book on thyroid disease, but you're going to get pretty much standard American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist/American Thyroid Association official position info, albeit well-organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Info Available for Thyroid patients","review":"It actually made me angry when I read that there is no reason to use combination t4/t3 therapy (long term). I know that your body is supposed to convert t4 into the active t3 hormone, but the thyroid normally produces about 20% of t3 directly. Why not try to get as close to the ratio of t4-t3 hormone a healthy normal thyroid produces? Some people also seem to have conversion issues. I DO NOT do well on t4 only medication. I tried it for a long time! I have to take Cytomel along with my Synthroid or I feel terrible and my free t3 levels fall way down, while my free t4 levels are at the top. My endocrinologist said that many of his patients seem to need t3. Relying on TSH after beginning treatment is ridiculous, especially if you do use t3, as it suppresses TSH. My doctor adjusts my meds based on symptoms and free t4/free t3 levels. Read Mary Shomon's book instead if you want more unbiased information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick to dismiss symptoms....","review":"The book is well organized, and if I had thryoid cancer, I'm sure I would review it differently. However, it consistently harps that if your TSH is within normal range, you are not hypothyroid. I also states normal is different for each person, but does not tell people how to determine their personal normal. It goes on to say hypothyroidism has many symptoms of other disorders, but there is a huge void of what to do if your life is in fact non-stressful, or diet is already really good, and you don't drink or smoke, but still have symptoms. It feels like although the authors have a high degree of expertise, there is still a huge chunk of people left out of their scenario, people whom they \\"poo poo\\". There's more to this problem than they care to admit, and it is obvious by the holes that are left in the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Pharma [..]","review":"This book is fairly comprehensive. For that I give it the two stars. But, it uses the conventional endocrinologist view that TSH is god and treatment with \\"T4 Only\\" is the ONLY way to go. WRONG. It does work for SOME people, but not all can convert T4 into T3. If your doctor is of the \\"T4 Only\\" school, and your free T3 and free T4 and TSH tests all come back \\"within normal ranges\\", find another doctor who will treat by symptoms. The authors feel that sub clinical hypothyroidism does not exist. They state to \\"look for other reasons for your health problems\\" if your tests come back normal. This is totally WRONG and the reason we have so many people out there with chronic illnesses. They also trash Armour in this book when it has helped millions of people.

I devoured this book in a few short days, somewhat at a loss at first because I was reading the last of a trilogy and had not read the prior installments. However, the book was so well written and so compelling in its characters and their conflicts, internal and external, that I could not put it down.

This book can only really be appreciated if you have read parts 1 & 2 of the series (Transformation and Relevation). It's hard to know what to write and not give away any major plotlines.In this book Seyonne finds some hard won, and unexpected truths about the ancient war that ripped his homeland apart. He also finds he must make a larger sacrifice than he ever dreamed to prevent himself creating a worse situation in the future.The other characters you grew to enjoy in books 1 & 2 are not forgotten here, but the real strengh of these books is in the character of the narrator, Seyonne.

More hard spots for the hero and then the ultimate sacrifice. I have seen that before in book number two and one. I do not recommend this book. You need to know about the first two books to get full value for the third book, but after the first two you get bored reading the same basic plot. I really do recommend book one and two since Carol Berg is an original writer who breaks new ground in the science fiction genre. The hero Seyonne is a new type.

If you haven't read Transformation and Revelation yet, then by all means do so and prepare to be in thrall to one of the best new writers in the world of Fantasy.

For fantasy fans who are truly tired of the typical goblin/trolloc/hero/dragon stories, this one is for you.The series is 3 books long, and while there is a part of the second book that drags a bit, the series is truly worth the investment of time and thought.

Restoration does not follow the formula that most fantasy writers today seem to embrace. There is no young character who begins life as a low-born person only to discover that they are the savior of the world. Restoration begins in media res.

I don't know if the author is getting paid by the word but there were a lot of times that paragraphs seemed too long and didn't really provide any details to move the story along. I got frustrated and ended up skipping through quite a few sections and got to the point that the story and main characters had changed so much that I almost lost the will to finish the book - something that almost never happens to me. So all in all I was really disappointed in the conclusion of a series that had so much promise to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Stars for Restoration (final book in Rai Kirah series)","review":"I LOVED LOVED LOVED the first book in this series 'Transformation'. The arc of the relationship between the two main characters from where they started out and where they ended up was great!! 'Revelation' lost some of that relationship when Seyonne was in 'demon hell' and the story dragged down during that part of the book, but their respect for each other was still evident. The third and final book 'Restoration' again got bogged down when Seyonne was with the 'nameless god'. And the relationship between Seyonne and Aleksander seemed to be losing ground. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good read. I had hoped for a cleaner resolution in the end (but maybe that's just me!). I would recommend this series to anyone who likes Fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad","review":"I did not receive the product that I ordered.

While I think her intentions are good, the information is pretty general and not that useful. Instead, I highly recommend \\"Benzo Blues\\" by Dr. Edward Drummond, to someone contemplating coming off benzodiazepines.

Unfortunately, it lacks some more precise information on the day by day withdrawal process, and what to do when you are feeling so horrible to avoid falling again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs your attention and doesn't let go","review":"This book has it all -- murder, kidnapping, political prisoners, mother/daughter conflicts and even an Act of God. Once the action starts, it doesn't stop. I have a few small quibbles with the book (for instance, the crime that starts the book is never fully explained), but it doesn't really detract from your enjoyment. Best of all, I liked Britt. Her frustration about her story of a lifetime getting pushed to the back burner really rang true with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great.","review":"Act of betrayal was a wonderful book.

Because,this game is still pretty decent.It's got nice graphics.Especially for an old Genesis game,the storyline seems cool and it's got some gore...but oh my lord.The game is tough.On the upside,there is a password system though,but the hard difficulty is what really kills this game.So buy it....if your up to one HELL of a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit for a King!","review":"High quality set - hubby said it made him \\"feel like a king\\".now if only they would sell matching drapes...Sheets are very luxuorious feeling even after several washings.Great buy for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice for Battery Powered Screwdriver","review":"I got this thing two years ago.

Will not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke on the first day of use","review":"I got this for my son who works as a lot attendant at a car dealership. He has to install license plates on new cars. He took it to work and as he was putting on his fifth plate it started making a grinding noise internally and stopped working. I had thrown out the receipt (my own fault), so we just wrote it off. We certainly won't be buying another one though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Handy Screwdriver","review":"This cordless screwdriver is great for the normal around the home type jobs. The forward/reverse action allows for driving or retriving the screws, along with a spindle lock for starting the screw manually. The screwdriver is rated at 180rpm with 40 in/lbs of torque, which will not allow the over torque of a screw or even stripping a screw out, even in hardwood! The charging system is great, it seems to last even longer than the rating of 350 screws on a charge.A great handy screwdriver for around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem with catalog Description","review":"Web site indicated that the screwdriver came with a wall-mount charger, but it actually came with a simple plug-in, like most others these days.

Cannot comment on merits of the new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this screwdriver in June of 2011. I used it maybe 7 to 10 times. Now it sounds like the gears are grinding against each other. I had a older one that I had for years and years until it quit so I thought I would get another one like it. Big mistake.

The reverse only works intermittently and the control has to be repeatedly pressed to resume operation. I have a shop here on the farm so only keep a small power screwdriver to do jobs here in the home. I am replacing a wall mounted B/D power screwdriver model 9072 type 2 purchased in 2001 that I have used so much that I have worn the labels off of it.

It worked wonderfully while we were putting a house together. It worked hard every day. Last month a gear broke and because it had been so good we ordered an exact replacement.

The first tool might have been unusually good; but we don't want to experiment with a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy From This Vendor","review":"I bought this item from Deerso and they mailed me the box without the screwdriver in it. They took an additional 2 weeks to correct the problem. I called with Amazon CSR on the phone 3 way the girl name from Deerso was Julie. OMG she was so rude to me with the Amazon CSR ON THE PHONE EVEN!!!! I felt so appalled I told Julie I would never buy from them again. She was so proud thati said that she good Mr. S. Just do that! I was so amazed on her brazen rudeness and asked the CSR DID YOU HEAR THAT?! He said yes sir and was very very aplogetic. If you buy this screwdriver from them be prepared to spend $50 to get talked to like you are bothering them and you must kiss their tale because they say so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed-up","review":"I purchased the product in Sept-08 and by Jan-09 it was nonfunctional. The gears are made of plastic and the center post of the gear is aluminum. That post sheared off one of the 6 gears (configured in 2 layers of 3 gears) and rendered it pretty much useless.

It's good for a couple of screws here and there, but try to do anything like putting a piece of Ikea furniture together and it runs out of batteries before getting done and it's not powerful enough to drive some of the screws. I've had it in its charging cradle hung up on the wall and the battery degarded quite quickly as well.This would be forgivable if this tool was one of the kind that bends so it can get into small spaces, but it doesn't even do that.Was not very happy with this tool. The best feature was the overtorque protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker 9074 3.6 volt","review":"Bought another one of these because my first one was so good.

It is easy to use, has adequate power for light duty household tasks and should last for years as long as the user does not expect to use it for heavy duty jobs. The locking feature allows the user to put more torque on the tool for tightening beyond the capacity of the tool's batttery and motor. Care must be taken however, to avoid applying too much torque in manual locked mode, as the gears inside the head are plastic and might be stripped if the tool is used too aggressively. Otherwise, the tool is of good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"I thought this unit was the replacement for my BK Power Driver. NOT ! ! !

Beware","review":"I wonder if the other reviewers here, who don't seem to have problems with it, have a more superior, older edition of this teapot? I bought this tea maker recently and it has a design defect: if you fill it with loose leaf tea, when you pour the tea out you get the smaller tea leaves/tea sediment and somehow the tea leaves from the infuser also tip out into your teacup. So it's a real mess. The infuser basket doesn't sit well and gets stuck when you try to take it out. It's not the fault of the loose leaf tea I have, because I've tried different kinds. My other teapots with infuser baskers don't have this problem. I hardly use it now - pity as it was so expensive! It just looks nice sitting next to my Frieling coffee pot, but it's a real white elephant.

His unrequited passion has driven him to write poetry that has been received avidly by the ladies of the community. Marguerite has endured a repressive, loveless marriage for several years, and even her husband's death does not free her. People suspect that she did away with her husband herself, thus gaining her the nickname of the Poison Widow. The local women are titillated by the Midnight Bandit, a man who recites poetry as he steals. To win Marguerite over, Charles writes to her as the Midnight Bandit. But her dark past is connected with Montagu Renny who is blackmailing her. She feels that she must hide her dark past at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great electric guitar CD","review":"This CD is really very good indeed.

I believe this to be a good product, however, they seem to have nearly nonexistent customer support. UPDATE: It's been hours later and still no return call from Rigid.

Wrong on both counts. It was more along the lines of \\"You should so totally buy a beautiful, wonderful dress, maybe even a COLUMN dress, for that wedding you have to attend. But don't ruin it with icky shoes!\\" As far as the \\"fashion personalities\\" they listed, I didn't find myself in any category. Rather, I know what category I'm in, and they didn't think to list it. The only thing I liked about the book were the letters written by people with fashion crises--first date ever, etc, included at the beginnings of the chapters.

Last summer on a hot day I even put a very long 1/2\\" bit onto it and went through very thick, soaking wet (which binds up bits) pressure treated wood. I really pushed the drill hard and it got smokey and a bearing started to make an awful sound. But a year later I'm still using it despite that sound and it still has no problem drilling.

He's the reason I got into guitar when I was 12 and why I play the way I do. I love his albums and I heard \\"Baroque & Roll\\" on the G3 tour so I got this album when it was released. My verdict? It's one the worst Malmsteen albums. Dougie White was a poor choice for a singer and Malmsteen sounds so sloppy on this record.. The album sounds like Malmsteen was uninspired and just wrote and recorded them in a day. There's no inspiration, no emotion, nothing. I mean, when it from this to \\"Unleash the Fury\\", I was like what happened? \\"UtF\\" was great and his new one, \\"Perpetual Flame\\", is his best in years. Sure, it has all the speed and neo-classical flavor of Malmsteen but it's too long of an album and where's the instrumentals? There's only 2 real instrumentals (not counting \\"Air\\")?

Overall this is just great work, Yngwie obviously still has \\"got it\\". My favorite tracks include Razor Eater, Valley Of Kings, Ships of Fools, Baroque & Roll, Majestic Blue, and Valhalla. There are a few more that I like, and a few i'm not really fond of (mad dog mostly). The instrumentals here are great.The reason I gave this 4 and not 5 stars, however, is because of a missing track. There are a few different versions of the cd - this one has battlefield and dreaming on it, but is missing probably the best track, which is Touch The Sky. This is just a great song, and although I like dreaming and battlefield, I would rather they put Touch The Sky on instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product and easy to use with VueScan application","review":"I own one of these--bought it used in 2004--and have had nothing but success in transferring images from film to digital. Initially, I used it only on a Mac G3 as that was what the Minolta software supported. It worked fine on the G3 as most of the image processing is done in the scanner. Recently, I tried VueScan [...] and found that not only was the scanner supported, it worked like a new puppy on my iMac with Snow Leopard! OK, I used a Ratoc SCSI to firewire boxRatoc Systems FR1SX FireWire to Ultra SCSI Converter (IEEE1394), but other than that it was a simple setup.Hardware vendors have every right to discontinue support for product software and drivers needed to support operating systems introduced many years after the hardware was discontinued.

These include electron-hole recombination, where the free electrons and holes are inherently a stochastic process, based on underlying quantum mechanics.This idea is also investigated with related effects, like interband transitions. Most standard texts on semiconductors might treat these transitions at some aggregate level, to derive steady state current, for example. But it also means that the basic transitions can, in and of themselves, contribute to the noise fluctuations in that current.As circuits keep shrinking in size, and currents fall, such phenomena might become more important as limitations to device performance. It is well worth keeping in mind the mesoscopic effects analysed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"pitcher size appropriate for one or two cappuccinos","review":"If you are making your cappuccinos one or two at a time this picture is fine for those that drink their coffee Italian style.

It lacks any sense of practical application to the real teller of tales. It seems methodical and logical, but ultimately, the information is not based on practical research or practice. There are several excellent books on storytelling. This book, written by a freelance author, can only be seen as a book which seeks to capitalize on the currrent growing popularity of the art form.

After his departure from the group, his solo career has been a lackluster of a his former self.His 1992 album, World Falling Down, is a beautiful collection of songs that still spark a scream into any Cetera fan. The songs blend here elegantly from Restless Heart, Cetera's final Top 40 song, to his dynamic duet with Chaka Khan, on the song Feels Like Heaven, and even a short reunion with Chicago member, Bill Champlin on Wild Ways.Each song here still shows that same old soul that Cetera has been known for.

I loved Book 4 it was probably one of my favorite books so far and I was so worried. But even with leaving out a lot of the book this movie was amazing. They highlighted on parts that you will need to follow Movie 5 if you are not reading along. It was made so well that for 3 hours and 40 minutes I was caught up in Harry's world-just like the book. I was sucked into the jokes, the special effects, and the power that Harry Potter and gang have. If you like the first 3 go and see this movie if you have never seen a Harry Potter movie--no worries go and see this.

Also would be nice if the dragon stuff also show what the other champion gone through.It is good that you see the struggle in Harry in making the right moral decisions in real time.Since there are so much stuff in the book, the film really do not have the time to develope the characters the way the book does.Overall a good film despite its darkness"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is so Awsome","review":"I love The Harry Potter movies!

Secondly, when J.K. Rowling agreed to having the films made she said they would have to stay as true to the books as possible and she had final say on anything that was cut out. Unless you are the writer, director or Ms. Rowling herself you don't know what is being left out and I can promise everyone that nothing will be left out that is important to telling the story. That is why the first two movies were so long and the next two will be even longer. Ms. Rowling wants the stories told right and they will be. My only fear is that they won't be able to keep all the actors togeather for all seven movies. When the movie finally does come out and people can write reviews on something they have seen, I sure they will all be very positive.

I felt that the new director must be addicted to \\"action\\" movies. There is a lot of action in HP4; so much that trying to piece the story together is difficult, even if you know the story. There isn't much of a story here, just a lot of special effects. For HP4 purists, you will be disappointed, I think, with the lack of accuracy to the original story. The crucial parts of the story were glossed over so quickly (or missed entirely)you could easily become lost. I also didn't like the way that Dumbledore was portrayed in HP4. Dumbledore's character is supposed to be strong but quiet. This portrayal really missed the mark. The writers took so many liberties with the book's characters' personalities that I was appalled. Very disappointing movie. I agree with the reviewer that Rowland would be upset with this latest attempt to represent her hard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Funny Adventure","review":"I just went to see this movie and I have to say I was pleased with it. Many of the characters were portrayed almost exactly how I imagined them. (ex. Frank Bryce, Rita Skeeter) The tasks were the main focus and they were exciting and fun. The script writers did a very good job of cutting an extremely large book down to a decent size movie, while still keeping its integrity. There was a lot of humor in the movie, which was good since the ending was darker than the rest of the movies. I thought they handles Lord Voldemort very well, although his nose issue was kind of weird. I also didn't really like it when Dumbledore sounded mad when Harry was picked. I don't remember him being mad in the book. I thought that was out of character. The rest, however, was superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOF DVD release date","review":"This is my 2nd favorite of all the HP movies. Sorcerer's Stone still remains my favorite to this day.

Remember my name is: Tame the Greatest if its not there I'm not telling!!! Bloody Hell(Ron's most famouse quote)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked!!!!","review":"This movie sucked and The Prisoner Of Azkaban is way better.Plus this movie has absouloutley nothing to do with the book and it's crap.So please don't buy this movie when it comes out please I'm begging you.You will hate it dearly and you'll definitely regret it a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"1. It's still shorter than the 1st 2 movies.2. They are wearing worse clothes than in movie 3.3. It seems like Mike Newell is making this movie into a romantic comedy.4. It's a Ron/Hermione relationship.5. It's not accurate or literal and a lot of scenes are cut off.6. There is more singing, and this will be a lot lighter too.7. The camera work and the costumes are horrible from what I saw.8. Many people are cut from the movie like the Dursleys, Percy Weasley, Bill or Charlie Weasley, and John Williams is being replace by Patrick Doyle.9. Change is not always good, PoA proved that.10. The sets and scenery still looks horrid from HP 3.11. Why can't WB find a director that can actually direct and not give us crap from BBC or Masterpiece Theatre?12. I can hope that HP 5 will improve from all the director's rubbish we've been getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAROLD POTTER MOVIES ARE THE WORST EVER!!!","review":"Yes, I am calling the little nerd Harold again. I cannot believe they are torturing us again with the CRAP! When will it ever end? C'mon people, why are you buying into this gargage? I strongly believe that the majority of us are really getting sick and tired of all this H. Potter jazz. THIS IS NOT GOOD ENTERTAINMENT WHATSOEVER!!! Like I said before, that Radcliffe character must have no acting talent at all because he can only make these stupid H. Potter movies and that's it. If you're into this crap(these movies or the books for that matter)then you must not have anything better to do! Whoop-Dee-Doo It's Harold Potter...Who Really Cares Anyway? 1 star is too generous so I rated with 0 STARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A fragmented, shallow,watered down spoof at best. A few spectacular special effects do little more to hide the poor quality of this horror than a pound of make-up can do to hide ugly. While I understand that in the time concerns of motion picture some of the book has to be edited out and thought they did this admirably with the first three installments in the series. Mike Newell's version of Goblet of Fire was just pathetic. It appears obvious that Mr. Newell is no fan of the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING!!!","review":"Sorry but not jumping on this bandwagon. The movie was dull as dirt. It was very choppy and just when you thought it was gonna get better it got worse and dragged on what seems like forever. Great if you have insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful collection of songs!","review":"I bought this album for its opening song: All in the April Evening. I have very special memories of singing this in a choir as a child, in England--so it was important for me to find a good recording! So happy that this one is it! It has a very moving rendition of this lovely piece, followed by many other very nice performances of other songs--both folk and sacred--that would please any ex-pat nostalgic for their homeland, and nostalgic for that unrepeatable time of childhood innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, stylish, comfortable, and they fit like a dream","review":"I love these boy shorts! They look kind of silky and are very flexible, comfortable, and flattering. They offer enough coverage that nothing is falling out or bulging over, and the overall look is sweet and sleek. A great underwear essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonky sizing, climbs more than expected","review":"I have trouble finding a brief that does not ride up so I chose these based on reviews stating that they would stay put. I had trouble choosing my size: I have a 12-inch difference between waist and hip and though the panties fit low the sizing chart is based upon waist size. I ordered half-way between my waist and hip. The panties are made of a nice soft cotton and the lace is good quality--no itching, no rolling up--but they climb like mad. I only wear them to sleep and even then I wake up uncomfortable with them creeping up. I wonder if the problem might be solved with a larger size (plug my hip measurement into the waist measure on the size chart) but I'm not interested in the investment required to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits perfectly","review":"Nice and silky. I always buy this brand and style. Happy they keep coming up with new colors and fabrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not lacy!","review":"I ordered the navy/classic and I thought it would be actual lace over backing. The lace pattern is just printed on and it looks pretty silly in person. Also the lace on the top and bottom is pretty low quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"I really like this panty. It is comfortable. I have them and all different colors. I am a size medium, and I wear a size 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"its gone","review":"when i hold this item on my hand i told my husband, its cute, isn't? but after i washed it, and then i put it on, its too big!!!and after wash, the color mix, and then you see the color is awful and the lace area is broken. can't you believe it? i just through it away immediately. so sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"best ever","review":"These are without question, the best panties for wearing with slacks. No line at the leg, no line accross the middle of your behind, and no riding up. They are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant. Sizing runs true to any other Maidenform pantie you've ever bought. Can be had cheaper at a Maidenform outlet store, but still well worth the price on Amazon. Buy lots of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"These are fantastic! I highly recommend them; the quality is great, the fit perfect, and of course a name brand you can always trust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good fit","review":"These boys shorts ride low in the back and do not stay up. The 2 stars is for the material and construction. The fit.... lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what a expected","review":"I didn't like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality. It already came with a loose thread. But it fits good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I bought these \\"boy shorts\\" to have a comfortable option around the house. I am a 45 year old man. These are not made for men much less boys. My butt must have been hungry because it was eating these shorts the entire time I tried to break these in.Can you call them girl shorts instead. False advertising to say the least"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"These panties are cute, comfortable, and don't give the dreaded \\"panty line\\" under trousers. I also find them to be breathable, unlike some microfiber undies. A+!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this book. It is too expensive!!!!","review":"This book consists of only about 150 more pages, and the contentsit present just ordinary and can be easily found in other textbooks which is much cheaper!!! I only recommend for those people who think they are rich!! There are many other choices!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous stories, HORRIBLE editing and printing","review":"I love George Macdonald and some of these short stories are among my alltime favorites. But I was terribly disappointed with this edition. The printing goes so close to the spine that it's a struggle just to hold the book open wide enough to see it all. The stores are just crammed in together like a poor quality homemade book. Typos are rampant throughout. My recommendation - by all means get these fables but get them individually or get a different edition of the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor edition","review":"A poor edition of this beautiful work. Binding and paper quality are not as expected considering the high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Water is an exciting and wonderful book.","review":"As my first Sally Gunning book, I am extremely impressed. Under Water is exciting and filled with mystery. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is filled with suspense; murder in a smal town and so few clues. I am planning to read all of Sally Gunning's books and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed or made.","review":"The figure was fragile from the beginning so any handling made the cape fall off. Once it did, it would not stay on again. The only way to keep it on would have been to glue it. Fine for a display on a shelf but not as a toy for a child, not even an older child."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a toy--it's a collector's item.","review":"We received this toy and immediately it was a problem. The helmet and cape don't stay on unless you superglue them and the lightsaber also comes apart. With all of the pieces falling off, this toy was not easy to play with and both my son and I were disappointed.I bought another one in the store where I could look at it and make sure of what was happening.This one goes better in someone's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good drill if the bearings don't break","review":"I bought this drill a year ago. It worked great the first hour I used it. Tons of torque. However, the bearings on the back end of armature couldn't meet the demand and promptly broke, thus locking up the motor and making the drill useless. I replace the bearing and the thing worked good (not great) up to a few weeks ago when it broke and locked up again. B&D has made great drills for a long time. I don't know if it is my particular drill that is a lemon or if the model is just poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 years and still going","review":"I've had this drill for close to 20 years and it still works like on day one. I have built vegetable raised beds using deck screws and 2 X 10 planks. My wife has built a playhouse for the kids. For house shores it's a nice workhorse. It's made of tough plastic that easily endures falls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This drill seems cheap, but doesn't meet the basic functions of a drill. The fwd/reverse switch is terrible and doesn't always make contact. you have to try 2-3 times fiddling with it before the trigger works. The chuck is hard on your hands and impossible to tighten. Even tiny drill bits stick in what you are working on. Just useless even if it was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comfortable pump.","review":"This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box. It looks great with a skirt or slacks. My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy. I have the shoe in black. If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Boat","review":"This boat is great! The price is great to. The boat isn't real fast, but it has great manuverability.I have a pond I use it on and it works great if you stand clear of the weeds. The boat works well going backwards too. It pulled it self outfrom some weeds.Overall it's a great boat for fun, but for racing ,spend a litte more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you value your mouthpieces!","review":"It looks nice, and it is convenient to hang the pouch on the nylon strap to my case. But I gave up on this pouch after the fourth time it dropped mouthpieces out of the gap between the closure flap and the top of the case. Two of them were damaged by landing on a concrete walk.After the first and second times the mouthpieces escaped, I closed the flap with great care each time. It didn't matter. The case needs a better fit at the top, a guard at the sides, or better yet a zipper closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am completed satisfied with this product. I would have been happier if the case opened through a zipper but the zipper pocket on the outside makes up for it greatly. I use it all the time and it does what it promises. I suggest a product like this for any trumpet player whom has multiple mouthpieces. It's better than letting them fling around in your case damaging you instrument or each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but not the greatest","review":"I read a lot great reviews of this book and I guess my expectations were too high. It is a nice book, a little bit difficult to understand with many complex words. But who understands the brits anyway? It is good literature with all sorts of tales and adventures in the whole world. It is funny that the same things can/will happen to you if you travel around the world, but 40 years later! The world didn't change much after all. This book will keep you reading until you finish it because of the great detail of the adventures. Nice book, worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jupiters travels - An excellent read","review":"This is an excellent read, well written and immensely interesting. Ted Simon dips into his experiences of a four year journey around the world on his Triumph motorcycle. This is not just of interest to motorcycle fanatics or travel adventure junkies but can be accessed by anyone as you share in Teds experiences. The only draw back is that it is just a sample of his many adventures as space would not provide enough room for him to divulge more of his adventures. I need to check out the sequel \\"Riding high\\" with further stories to pass on to those of us who would enjoy sharing his adventures. Well worth a read, what an experience to have achieved, an inspiration to many.Riding High"},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating Journey","review":"This book is about Ted Simon's experince of riding around the world. Not only does he write about his actual experinces, but he also writes about how he feels. Some parts of the trip are glossed over in just a paragraph while others take pages and pages. It was very interesting to see hwo he felt the trip changed his life. I would have given the book five stars, but it bogs down in places. This book is more about an adventure around the world than it is about motorcycling. Overall, it is a great story and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"This book is extremely well written. The author eludes to his journalism profession and it is eveident. A little too much \\"who am I\\" searching to suit me. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good motorcyle travel story","review":"Enjoyed the cultural observations and practical descriptions of travel on a motorcyle almost as much as I enjoyed the look into the state of the world in the 1970's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"While I liked the overall direction of the book, I wished Simon would have spend less time on his incarceration. He simply goes on and on. That said, I really admire him for being able to undertake such a trip. Given the mechanical work that he did on a regular basis, not too many of us would, or could, undertake such an adventure. If you like this, I think you'll also like the Ewan McGregor series, Long Way Round, and Long Way Down, which are highly readable and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"And there's a beer in Australia for you too mate","review":"a DAMNED good read. I agree with the last reviewer totally. I was sick and confined to bed at the girlfirends house when I read this book and it was a blessing, a darned good read. So if you are ever in Australia, I'll cool a tinny for you too,,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Million Thumbs Up!","review":"If you are a rider and you havent read this CLASSIC you should be ashamed of yourself! \\"Jupiters Travels\\" is REQUIRED READING! You will Not be Allowed to Ride Anymore if you dont read \\"Jupiters Travels\\". NO READ-NO RIDE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've always ranked this as the finest travelog about motorcycle touring ever written. I agree with all the positive comments by other reviewers, and don't have a quibble to make. I've read this book twice, and loved it both times.However, the best motorcycling touring book is \\"Mi Moto Fidel: Motorcycling Through Castro's Cuba,\\" which I consider one of the best travel books ever written. It's a fascinating and sometimes hilarious, sometimes hair-raising story of a 7,000-mile journey and justifiably the winner of both the 2002 \\"Travel Book of the Year\\" and the North American Travel Journalist Association's Awards of Excellence \\"Grand Prize.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for motorcycle adventurers","review":"This book has been an inspiration for many a motorcyclist over the years, including Charley and Ewen of course. Great story, great adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, but this book was boring","review":"I give it four stars because of content, but as much as I love reading about motorcycle trips, this book was boring. It was an interesting story, but I don't think he (or his ghost writer) was a very good writer. Sorry Ted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck in a rut? Read this book","review":"I haven't even finished reading the book yet, actually Ted has only reached Cape Town. But his journey down the African continent has already left a deep impression on me.. how huge is the power of the human spirit.On page 178 he writes \\"I am learning as I make my way through my first continent that it is remarkably easy to do things and much more frightening to contemplate them.\\"As I negotiate the various obstacles that I find blocking my own journey I hope these wise words burn long in my conscience. Fantastic reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Biker's Classic","review":"If you're enjoy taking a trip on a motorcycle or you're planning such a trip, check out this man's adventures on a bike. Surprises around each bend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring","review":"I went to a slide show at Powell's Travel Bookstore where Ted Simon showed slides from his journey and talked a little about his experiences. I was fascinated and bought the book. It is amazing and inspiring, and just like the warning on the back of the book, I was tempted to give up college and buy a motorcycle. Then I remembered that I can barely drive a car...But this book is truly inspiring, although I had to keep reminding myself that the man who completed the journey was the same person that I had met at Powell's. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful journey into self and world","review":"Ted Simon's Jupiter's Travels is among the best books I have ever read. It is a delightful narrative of his journey round the world punctuated with compelling insights into the nature of life and reality. It is among the best books I have ever read.READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jupiters Travels: Four Years Around the World on a Triumph","review":"I did not read this book. It was a gift for my son who enjoys motorcycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up!","review":"Kept waiting for the book to get better but ran out of pages before it did. I felt Simon left out too much and was just riding to put on miles. Would agree with an earlier reviewer that there was too much (fuzzy) philosophy. I also thought the material was too dated and could have been updated somewhat. I was disappointed probably because I expected much more judging by the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jupiter Travels","review":"This is rated too high. I read and found it extremely bored, found Mr. Simon too negative as biker and feel him an opportunist. On a couple of times found my self trowing this book at the floor. I felt I waist my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking But Poor Quality","review":"We purchased this for our son and his wife. The top fell off one day and the nob on the top fell off because it was not properly welded to the sugar bowl lid. We tried everything to try and re attatch the nob, including Gorilla Glue but nothing worked so they now have a sugar bowl they can not take the lid off of without getting sugar all over the place. It is nice looking but I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"sugar bowl is to small","review":"I thought that the sugar bowl would be larger for every day use, it would of been excellant if it was. Thank you for asking for my opion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"This little sugar bowl looks great on my countertop and the quality is superb. Before I ordered I thought it a was on the pricey side, but now no regrets here. I may order the matching creamer. One caution though: this is a very shiny stainless. The photo doesn't really look like it. So if you're looking for matte, this isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sugar bowl","review":"This is even more quaint and aesthetically pleasing in person! One reviewer talked about smudges; thus far it is doing well. It fits snuggly by my keurig...thinking about buying another for cane sugar. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made in China! But.....","review":"Like almost everything these days, this coffee pot is made in the People's Republic of China. But don't let that put you off. It is extremely high quality and very well made (unlike most Chinese products). Furthermore, it makes the best cup of coffee I have ever tasted and has completely changed the way I appreciate coffee brewed from freshly ground beans.I have been using my coffee pot many times a day for a month now and it is still in perfect condition. It has also been in and out of the dishwasher. I also have the tea infuser and the creamer and sugar set. I just regret that stuff like this can't seem be made in the USA any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not photographed well","review":"I ended up sending the sugar bowl back. From the picture, I thought the base would be porcelain and the spoon and top would be stainless steel. Turns out the entire set is stainless steel.The size of the bowl and the spoon were SO ideal. I hated to return it, but the tell-tale signs of finger smears would have driven me crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gain Ground is Awesome!","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this game. If you love 16 bit games and you love strategy games that require you to think a little bit, this is the game for you. There are 20 characters all with different attacks and speeds of movement. You have to choose which characters you think will be the best to either clear all the enemies off the map or get to the finish line. Once you choose a character you have to have enough skill to then utilize it. It is the perfect combination of action and strategy. In my opinion, this game is more fun than any current generation game I own for my xbox 360, but I love collecting classic Sega Genesis games."},{"rating":"2","title":"star of david candy mold","review":"candy mold was bigger than I thought.

Well, so much for this album. Despite neat cover art and a good first track, there's nothing really to brag about in this CD. It's what you would call \\"average\\" music; it's okay listening, but nothing original. I mean, this is from a FORMER PLANKEYE ARTIST! There's nothing in here that measures up to that band. I suppose if you like punk you'll have fun with this, but I'd rather listen to Starflyer 59 or a classic Plankeye song."},{"rating":"2","title":"these are what they say they are.","review":"These dots allowed us to make moving easier letting us identify items easily.

Novell products aren't as simple to set up as MS, but they are far more functional, robust, scalable and stable than any of the swill that the beast of Redmond pumps out.Buy Netware.

I also didn't find the combinations interesting.4.

I don't need the charger to bring the batteries up from a deep discharge - I have a 30 amp clamp-on charger for that, I just need them kept up between usage events and this little charger does the job great. It has a small form factor and is designed to be permanently installed and hard-wired; exactly what I wanted.

The problem, in my opinion, with the beginning of this novel is that the author has tried to pack in too much background information in a short period of time. It gets tiresome, as each page skips to years ahead.

I knew I should have stayed away when selecting my jigsaw at a local store I noted that 8-10 boxes seemed to have been opened and re-taped... I now know they were most likely all returns.I will be steering clear of this brand name from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade falls out, very frustrating","review":"This saw almost always loses the blade after just a few strokes. I have tried different blades including Black and Decker but they all come out while cutting.I have many B&D; tools, most of them very good ones including a compound miter saw, a table saw and reciprocating saw. All were very reasonably priced. But I have problems with B&D; drill chucks that won't hold a bit, and with this saw that won't hold the blade.If you are a mild-mannered person who never swears and you are thinking of learning to curse, buy this saw. It will have you cussing like a sailor in no time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - in TRUE Black & Decker style","review":"This company's products are garbage. Their jigsaws are no exception. I need a jigsaw about once a year. So, I bought a B&D; with the quick release blade system. The blade is locked in place when you start, but soon enough it will simply pop out. The blade will be lodged in whatever surface you are trying to cut. REALLY frustrating.I noticed that if you exert a bit of upward/forward pressure it helps, but it can't be trusted to cut a surface w/o the blade falling out.Do yourself a HUGE favor, don't buy B&D.; I will never buy this brand or SKIL ever, ever again. Both have life cycle designed only to exceed the return policy of the store. It's all trash.Costs more, but I've bought Dewalt a few times now and they're worth the money. Even bought them used with great success. I have Dewalts several years old, no issues. For decent performance at a good price try Ryobi.

The battery dies after cutting about 12 feet of 3/4 inch partical board, then needs to charge for 3 hours. Luckly I have two batteries which came with my drill and the one which came with the saw. Even so, I am unable to complete a project without long delays charging batteries. The engineers who designed this saw were not thinking too well when they coupled it with a 14.4 volt battery. Were they intentionally trying to jip me or were they just stupid. The saw would be just fine for cutting a board or two, but running out of power every five minutes is a little lame.

The problem is when you've got a big job and need a circular saw for huge boards or a full day of cutting ... this cordless saw cannot do that.This is the perfect saw if you are a homeowner who does the odd DIY job around the house but does NOT work with powertools every day or even every weekend.

That's two 8 ounce cups of coffee. It won't make two 12 ounce cups of coffee, which is what two Small coffees at Coffee Bean or StarBucks would be. 8 ounces is perfect for a regular sized coffee mug, but it still isn't much coffee.

It keeps the coffee plenty hot too, even without preheating the container.No problems with coffee grounds getting through the fine mesh strainer part, no problems with the top breaking, no problems with the handle. Haven't even had any spills happen, cos I don't just slam the top down and let the hot coffee shoot all over (some people are just stupid I guess.)Somewhat expensive item even for the open box price, but I expect this will last a lifetime when not abused.If I had any complaint at all, it would be that the mirror-finish on the outside takes hand-polishing to clean up.

I have had it for a few years now and have not had any problems. I remember reading how people were saying in the reviews that it doesn't keep the temperature very well but I never saw that as a problem. I typically will drink the contents in 30-40 minutes in the morning and its still warm enough when I finish. I've got the brewing down to a science at this point: To save time I will split the water between the stove and the microwave, microwaving half the water on high for 4 minutes at which point the water on the stove is about ready also. I then put the ground coffee in the bottom and pour in the water which brings the temperature to 195 (you may need to adjust times based on your stove/microwave power). Then let it stand for 4 minutes before pressing. That's what works for me, hope that helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Looks great, coffee is good and stays warm. This is an ideal gift for a french press coffee lover. Cleaning is a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the way to go","review":"I am completely satisfied with this french press. It is so much handier than a coffee pot. I Threw away my drip coffee maker because the coffee even tastes better out of this french press. It is great for 2 people. I you have 4 or more to serve you will still have to have a coffee pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new kind of coffee!!!","review":"I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this french press. I absolutely love it and have no complaints. My only suggestion would be to be making it in a larger size."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid and elegant","review":"This french-press device is worth every penny. Coffee is excellent and it stays warm in it about one hour. Easy to use and clean. We're very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but Does Not Keep Coffee Hot","review":"I'm so disappointed with this french press. I preheat the press with hot water, and brew the coffee for 5 minutes. The Bodum stainless steel press I have then pours coffee that is piping hot. I bought the Frieling press for my office because I thought it was so great looking. I'm just baffled by the fact that the coffee is lukewarm after 5 minutes. It seems that a lot of air can escape from the spout. The Bodum lid is designed to block air from escaping through the spout. The Frieling lid is not. No one else has mentioned this problem in their review, so I'm confused. It seems like a huge design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good product for small servings","review":"I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a TWO 10oz mug serving. It does not provide a large serving - the 5-6 cup serving must be for smaller coffee cups. We can barely get 3 servings out of it if we used traditional cups. Excellent finish and build quality. Very impressed with its design. It has multiple uses beyond just coffee - great for making tea or as a jug for juice. Also fabulous for travelling as it won't break (no glass)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor cosmetic issue","review":"The spot where the handle is attached to the body isn't as smooth as I would expect from Frieling. Where the two pieces are joined together is a lumpy mess -- looks like a piece of modeling clay with shiny silver finish painted over it.Other than this cosmetic issue, the press delivers as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"Gorgeous - smaller than I thought but perfect.

I really cant say enough good about this product. The concept is simple, so i really cant credit the maker with any groundbreaking innovations.. but it is extremely well made and solid.I use it daily and it just cant be beat. I've gotten to the point now i wont drink anything but press coffee. So i end up taking this with me when i travel. It's been all over the world and the finish looks the same.I actually have two of these now. I bought a second to fill up a thermos to bring to work. I also have given it as a gift.if i could give it 6 stars i would."},{"rating":"1","title":"frieling french press review","review":"I am rather disappointed in this pot.

The only positive is that it is pretty to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am VERY unhappy","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend to replace his Nissan which was falling apart after many years of daily service. I wanted to get him something a little nicer looking - am I ever sad I did. Although it does make good coffee, after only 4 uses, we are unable to get the filter asembly back together. I have written to the manufacturer to have them replace it, but no luck.I would recomend the Nissan or the Bodum stainless steel, which I have used for years without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 5-6 cups","review":"I think the design is beautiful, but this is NOT a 5-6 cup coffee press.5-6 espressos, maybe. 5-6 cups coffee, NO.It measures out to be 3 cups of liquid, if filled to the brim (no grinds).It makes 2 cups of coffee.PLEASE STOP LISTING IT AS 5-6 CUPS OF COFFEE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good with a weakness","review":"I thought this was a fine coffee maker until the threads on the shaft that pushes the strainer apparently wore out and stripped the threads so the strainer would not stay attached to the shaft.

The key to good FP coffee is to pre heat the vessel with hot water before you make coffee. I gave 4 stars because unless the coffee is at the perfect consistency it either is too hard to press or you get grounds in the coffee.This will probably last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, easy to clean and won't ever break","review":"I bought this stainless press because the 2 previous presses I had were glass, and they both broke.... so this one won't!

You can disassemble the filter to clean it out (and I recommend you do every month or so... just rinsing isn't good enough!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive, won't break, keeps coffee warm.","review":"The plunger was not a very tight fit, so we sprang out the metal mesh, which helped.We chose this stainless design after breaking our 3rd glass carafe from another press. No worries about breakage, but we miss being able to see through the glass to see how much ground coffee we've added, or how much coffee is left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Love it!","review":"It is attractive, well-made, and easy to use. It does not squirt coffee out for us as some have said, but then we don't move the press very fast, either. (I can't imagine why you would do such a thing, in any case.)The seal we get is great. Very, very few grounds get into our coffee. The welding is excellent. There are NO PLASTIC PARTS which we really wanted.There is no metallic taste at all. It keeps the coffee hot for a good while since it is insulated (double-walled).When we read the bad reviews we had some concern about getting this, but it has been great so we must have gotten a really good one. We've been using it for a while and it has had absolutely no problems yet.Worth the price for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"FrielingFrench Press","review":"I have gone through numerous glass French presses. This one is great! No glass to break, easy to operate and easy to clean. I particularly like the finished edge to the screen. No more catching the screen on everything. It is heavy and durable. The coffee stays hot for a couple of hours. All in all, I am well pleased with the purchase. It makes great loose tea too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable due to metal taste","review":"Bought this item to replace a 5 year old glass bodum when it broke. Mine was also \\"made in PRC\\".Washed it well, made two pots of coffee and the coffee tasted of metal both times.I believe the very tight fit of the metal plunger screen against the metal interior wall of the press caused metal to be \\"shaved\\" off. The scratching sound it made when plunged was horrible, and plunging took much more force than my glass bodum. A final clean and wipe down of the inside walls with a white paper towel revealed heavy grey staining - I'm sure it was metal.Perhaps this would break in over time and stop tasting of metal but I don't want to drink metal until then. So I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely design, smaller than expected","review":"I really thought this french press would be larger. Although it is rated at 25 ounces, we actually only get 1-1/2 normal sized coffee mugs of coffee from it! Our coffee mugs measure 9 ounces so I am not sure where the 25 ounce capacity came from! I recommend this press for a single person who wants just a cup and a half of coffee in the morning!It is insulated and does keep the coffee hot but given the small capacity there is no need to keep it hot! I can drink a cup and a half of coffee before it would get cold for goodness sake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Rocks!","review":"Great quality and looks. This is made very well and keeps coffee hot long enough for you to finish. It is attractive and very solid and heavy. I highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - it's really that good","review":"In an obsessive pursuit of that perfect (a.m.) home brew, I began with a lesser French press. Recently uping my game, I decided on the Freiling. It is impressive in every respect and delivers the quality (and heft) you'd expect at this price point. Paired with my conical burr grinder, I'm enjoying that perfect morning cup of coffee... gone are the days of slugging back the bitter, dirty water from the corner barista.And while your at it, consider splurging for the accompanying sugar, creamer & tray set... I did! They look and work great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Snob","review":"I am coffee snob and believe the best coffee comes from a french press. My last on was amazing but the glass broke. When this came in I was not expecting for it to be such beautiful metal. Its is simply gorgeous. I have not actually noticed that much different in taste as I am always trying new differently roasted coffees. I highly recommend this if you are into french pressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best french press I've ever used!","review":"I got this (from amazon) in 2006, and have been using it ~every day that I've been at home since (over 6 years now). My wife and I usually split one of these in the mornings, sometimes 2 on Saturday or Sunday. It keeps heat well. As another reviewer said, pair this up w/ a good burr grinder (we splurged on a Baratza Virtuoso, which has been used daily for 3 years, and works great). It is easy to clean, with the mesh part (3 separate pieces) able to unscrew from the plunger rod. The wire mesh piece is just starting to fray, so would appreciate any advice on the replacement part."},{"rating":"1","title":"More form than function","review":"As long time French press users, we hoped we'd hit the jackpot based on other reviews of the Frielling 5-6 cup. This press is impressive when it comes to form and style, but scores low on functionality. First, the \\"5-6 cup\\" description (assuming 6oz cups) must have been measured from the top of the pot. But with the long shape of the pour spout, there is no way to fill the pot to any more that 1 1/2 inches below the top without creating the second problem -- hot coffee and grounds spraying all over when it comes time to press. (Yes, we know to use the proper grind for French press, and we know to push the plunger slowly.)For us the 23 ounces of coffee the Frieling can safely produce is not enough to make it our daily press. We are back to our glass Bodum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anonomous","review":"FABULOUS!!! I purchased this as a gift for relatives who are very highly educated, worldy, well travelled, serious chefs, who've enjoyed coffee brewed all over the world (even Antarctica!). Needless to say, gift buying for them is tricky! When they got this, their Bodum decanter had just broken, so the timing was perfect...they love this model! Use it daily! In fact, they're so impressed, that they now order it from Amazon.com & give it as a wedding gift to newly married couples in their social circle. Also note, there is a coordinating sugar & creamer set available for purchase that matches perfectly, holds adequate volumes of sugar & cream, & makes a stunning table display. I already have a few Bodum sets, including the stainless steel insulated models, so I won't need another FP, but I also will give this Frieling model as a wedding/housewarming gift to coffee aficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a difference all stainless makes!!!!","review":"Wow I've had this press now for about a week, and I LOVE it! I was using a 32oz bodum stainless steel French press with a plastic plunger that I've had for years. The taste of the brew out of this Frieling is pure java now no bitterness. I didn't realize how the much better the coffee is with the all stainless steel construction. I would have given this thing a five star but i think the handle could be a little thicker for easier puring, and i wish it wasn't made in china. All in all it's great. Built well enough to last for a life time."},{"rating":"1","title":"french press","review":"This is a \\"refurbished\\" product. In the past when I have bought refurbished items they are really like new. This one had the top of the plunger bent.

Otherwise, this is a wonderful item, keeping the coffee warm to the second cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice French Press","review":"I'm very pleased with the Frieling french press.

Makes great, hot coffee. The one flaw is I seem to get more grinds in the coffee than with the old glass type press. It's funny though, because my husband's brew (from same press) never has this problem . It just takes some practice with how much water you put in and how fast you press it - I think. Until I get it right I just pour my cup through a small strainer I have. I even bring the press over to the table while I have my coffee just because I like the way it looks! I can't imagine ever needing to replace this coffee pot. I will probably buy another one to make more coffee for entertaining. I see us growing old with this press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best French Press Ever!","review":"My husband loves this French press because it is nearly indestructible. He loves the design and the fact that it is super easy to clean. The capacity of the cups is an exaggeration; 5-6 cups is really more like 3 cups, so buy one size larger than you think you need. We originally purchased the 5-6 cup press but it was too small so we returned it for the Frieling 35 oz press which is PERFECT; we can even use the old wire mesh and rod assembly from our three broken Bodum presses. We are extremely happy with this press and will NEVER go back to the glass version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, But An Investment","review":"I have been \\"tinkering\\" with coffee for many years. I roast my own beans and own a grinder that cost more than my first (used) automobile. Do a little research, and you will find that most coffee connoisseurs recommend the use of a French press for the best cup of brewed coffee. Two main reasons: 1) coffee should be brewed with water just off a boil in order to release the full flavor of the beans, and, 2) the natural bean oils end up in your cup, not trapped in a paper filter. Even the best home drip coffee makers fail to brew at the proper (hot) water temperature, and most suffer the paper filter issue as well. I encourage you to read all the other reviews for more detail about this quality product. Then, if you are ready to start experiencing quality coffee (from even medium priced beans), buy a Frieling Stainless-Steel French Press and get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Press.","review":"A friend has one and I just had to have one, too.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"After 2 broken glass Bodums, I'm not going back to Bodum again. I highly recommend this French Press. It's nice that everything is dishwasher safe. It took a little getting used to because with glass you can see the coffee and liquid measurements. However, you will quickly adjust. I am a weekend coffee drinker, so I like that you can use the press as a pitcher/carafe as well. It's pretty and highly functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"insulated French press","review":"As advertised. Keeps coffee warm for at least 3 hours which was my goal. The press part works well - no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far!","review":"Although I've had this product for only a few weeks, I am more that pleased. My principal motivation for the purchase of a stainless steel french press was to avoid the glass version, since I have broken many.A bonus with this item is that the screen is very fine and it filters virtually most grounds, avoiding the mud at the bottom of the cup. This was a surprise since I am using a blade grinder. Therefore I may forgo purchasing a burr grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This press pot is just about perfect. Built like a tank, but elegant looking. All stainless, so don't worry about wearing anything out. Cleans easily which ever way you want. As for brewing, it seems to me that the steel brings the water down to correct temperature without any fooling around, excellent coffee.I grind Peet's Major Dickeson Blend with a Solis Maestro.

I have two coffee grinders and It does not matter which one I use(both conical burr)the Breville of the Nuova Simonelli at the coarse max setting, the results are terrible. The filter is not tight enough, and the mesh holes are too big to catch the coffee grind. You will end up running through paper filter afterwards. I have just completelly wasted my money on this expensive (but good looking) dirt water maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but doesn't hold the heat","review":"I love the look of this pot, but I ordered it primarily because I thought it would keep the coffee hotter than my glass french press.

It is not a thermos but it does keep my coffee hot long enough. I use it for tea as well.

Fantastic construction. Keeps coffee warmer longer than the average press because it is double walled. This will absolutely last my lifetime. SO easy to clean, too.My only issue is that it is taking a while to get the hang of a French press. I like STRONG coffee but people recommend a course grind of coffee for a press. I cannot get my coffee strong enough with a course grind. I went back to a regular grind and it is so much better! I don't mind a tiny bit of sludge at the bottom of the cup after I drink it. It reminds me of Greek or Turkish coffee.Bonus: It is a much greener product than an electric coffee maker and no trees are sacrificed to make filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"The Freiling is great!

On the first pot I received, the screw stripped at the base of the filter after a few uses, but I received a new one from the company right away.

I like the design and construction of this press, deducted a star only because it is so pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking and Great coffee","review":"I must say that this Frieling Press does make the best cup of coffee I have ever had. I have tried other manual coffee makers like the Melitta ceramic drip, but the difference may be in that they require paper filters that may detract from the taste and the fact that I grind my beans fresh for each pot may help. The manual drip Melitta required two fillings to brew one full pot, which was a negative aspect.I use a wire mesh strainer to sift out the small grains of ground coffee before brewing and have almost no grounds in the cup. Using a coarse grind is a must do.If I preheat the pot with HOT water before brewing I have no need to reheat the coffee at least for the first two cups and I like my coffee hot. This insulated pot does work well and has a beautiful finish. There is a little sediment in the bottom of the cup, but that may just add to the coffee experience. I highly recommend this Frieling Press for a great cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek & Functional","review":"I purchased this French press, which holds several cups of water, with the expectation that it would make smooth, dark coffee.

It is perfect for my partner and I to enjoy hot tea!After losing two glass french presses to eventual \\"accidents\\" and, mind you, we are careful people, we decided maybe we should look at alternatives. At first, I was a little regretful over spending 80-something dollars on one fancy item, but the use I get out of it is well worth it. I also no longer fear it randomly cracking and leaving me without good tea/coffee for a week or so.Overall, I would say if you are agonizing over whether or not to purchase this one, go for it. You can take it camping, and it is completely stainless steel, even the filter inside. I know this will last me a very long time, and I will try to give an update in a year or so on how this thing has held up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has this been my whole life?","review":"Once ordered, we were so excited for it to get here! It seemed like it took forever, but in reality, it was only about a week. Upon arrival, the press looked amazing, felt amazing, and (even though it was 7:00 at night) we produced our very first cup of french pressed coffee, and IT WAS AMAZING! The press is sturdy, sleek and easy to clean. My only complaint is, that I wish that I bought a larger one. There are 3 coffee drinkers in our house, and one pot fills our larger than normal cups. It is perfect though because we just make another pot right away, by the time we are done with our first cup, the next pot is ready!

This is a wonderful French press coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good - a couple of nits","review":"Works better than glass beaker units as far as keeping hot longer, and of coarse will not break as easily. One nit issue is the wire screen on the plunger does not seal as well as some glass jobs I've had. This means you'll need to push a little slower than you might with those other units. Also, I could see how a quick start would cause liquid to blow out the spout as there isn't anything to slow it down if you push fast initially. Go slow and this unit performs better than glass. Clean up is about the same as or better than glass beaker presses as the stainless steal seems to not stain very easily at all. The handle weld looks OK but maybe this is a weak point. Have to see. So far it seems like it will outlast a glass beaker (at least in my house) - this alone justifies the extra expense. YMMV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I bought this for our travel trailer for when we're dry-camping and have to rely on solar power for our batteries.My only complaint is that one has to be careful when inserting the filter and pressing down.

Wish I had got another Bodum.","review":"This sounded good and has decent reviews(???). I needed to replace a Bodum and figured it costs more it's gotta be at least as good if not better. Turns out I was wrong. First off, it's incredibly heavy. If you're weak or getting on in years you may have trouble lifting this even before you've poured the water in. It makes washing it tiring. Next the construction - The carafe itself is good, but the plunger has some issues. Its tight but not smooth. Compared to a Bodum its terrible. The metal piece that holds the filter on has sharp edges. Sharp enough to cut you, watch out when washing it. Operating the plunger feels rough and requires more force than the average Bodum. It causes coffee to squirt up frequently even when being careful.This is better than a cheap press but pales in comparison to even a $20 Bodum. Do yourself a favour and buy two Bodums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photoshop has finally become easier to use","review":"Thank You Sharon Steuer!!

Just a tiny bit of sideways motion and yep, paper starts to slide right off...Sounds like they've had this model forever - maybe it's time the old B&D; spent some money on R&D; and upgraded their product a little bit.Looks like it goes on the garage sale pile and it's time to try out another..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best at this price point","review":"I've had this sander for so long I can't remember when I bought it (must have been late 80's). While it's still going it needs a new rubber pad and bearing, so for me it's just going to be cheaper to get a new one. I've never had a problem with the paper releases as someone else mentioned, nor do I think it rips the sandpaper all that often. Most of the time when a paper rips a hole it's because I've tried to go over a sharp edge. It would be nice to have a variable speed, but I've lived without it this long...Very reliable and dependable tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfit for the purpose","review":"Black and Decker should have added a bottle opener or cork screw attachment to this item so that it would not be a total loss.The pad is just a bit too long to comfortably accommodate a standard 1/3 sheet of sand paper; you are left with a bare millimeter or two for the clamps to grab. Speaking of the clamps, they are either poorly made, badly designed or both. Clearly a waste of money at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sander but wastes sandpaper","review":"I like the feel of this sander and want to use it for finish work. It is advertised as a 1/3 sheet sander, meaning you should be cross-able to cut three pieces 9\\" long from a 9 x 11 stock sheet of sandpaper.The sandpaper isn't long enough. I even have some sheets from Norton that are 9-1/8\\"+ long and they walk off the sander.So to use this thing I have to cut the paper from the length wise direction and so I only get 2 pieces of paper I can use.Effectively it wastes 1/3 of your sandpaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a beating and keeps on sanding!","review":"I've had this sander for more than 15 years!

My positive comments is that she has a nice singing voice. A number of the songs use a repeating verse/refrain format that I found to repetitive and boring. After listening to it I immedietely put it away and have no desire to listen to it again. A number of the songs have a lot of words, but if it weren't for the lyrics included I'd have no idea what she was saying. Some compare her to Enya, but Enya's latest album is worlds above this in variety and appeal. From reading her CD notes and listen and reading the lyrics, she seems to have a foundness for yearing for a pre-Christian world (pagan).

It's a wonderful album, full of everything from traditional songs to contemporary; The Lady of Shallot is a beautiful poem put to words.Overall, her work has since captivated me, and I highly recommend this as an intro to anyone who is interested in Celtic or New Age music in the slightest! While all of her stuff is good, this stands out of the crowd as being great.It's also good for meditation, something which I consider a plus; if I can listen to it as meditation music as well as for regular, day-to-day listening, I know it's good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting melodies, moving lyrics, enrichment for the soul.","review":"Loreena McKennitt's unbridled talents leave her contemporaries in the dust.

And if you don't own this cd, buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous collection","review":"I love every song on this CD.

I enjoy listening to this cd regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"Everything Mckennitt does is beautiful, but I have a special fondness for this album. It starts out spectacularly with \\"All Souls Night \\", one of my two favorite songs on the album. My second pick is \\" The Old Ways \\" which I could see and feel as she was singing like no song I have heard before. It's short, but incredibly eerie and beautiful. All the others are wonderful as well. I did not take to \\"Lady Shalott\\" the way ninety percent of the reviewers here did. It's lovely, but the theme just didn't resonate with me. I usually prefer her original work anyhow. However, it still is not something I skip over. I listen to this album all the time and is definitely equal in skill and quality to her other top recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"In listening to album for more than two years I have discovered something. In many instances Loreena has to FORCE herself to controll the power of her voice in this music. Her voice alone could easily blow away and override and instrument and she sometimes has to stuggle to keep it in check. Such a voice is moving, haunting, lovely beyond words. The Visit is a Must Have in any CD collection. Loreena will take you away with her voice alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Overall, a good CD.

So I have to take the batteries out after every session. Which isn't terrible. Last week I noticed other problems with the joypads. The game's camera tilted down without me pressing anything, and would do so incessantly and uncontrollably. Today, the up and down on the right joypad quit entirely. I can crane left and right, but I can't tilt up and down at all. So, as far as I'm concerned, this is junk. I've had my old PS2 controllers working fine since system launch.

Its just your imagination. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst batteries ever","review":"I was given a Versa Pack system for Christmas a few years ago, and these batteries are by far the worst rechargesble batteries manufactured by anyone EVER. I love the idea of the versatility of the Versa Pack tools, but these batteries render the the entire set virtually useless. The batteries don't keep a charge, and don't last for more than 5 minutes of use. Trying to use them for any sort of project is a complete waste of time. NiCad batteries are just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality/Engineering","review":"For the last 10 years I've used B&D;'s cordless driver with torque adjustment with much satisfaction with one caveat.Their VP100 (Silver) battery sucks. I've now gone through atleast 11 of them with this driver. They all worked fine for the first several months then performance drops off rapidly. Most of them would take a charge but capacity was diminished. Under load their useful life was measured in minutes.Maybe B&D;'s strategy was to get us hooked with the inexpensive VP100 (Silver) just to make it impossible to get along without upgrading to the more expensive VP110 (Gold) version.I would suggest when you purchase one of these batteries through retail that you save the receipt and scratch a mark on the battery every time you recharge it so when it fails (& it will fail), you can place a warranty claim for it's failure to recharge 300 times. B&D; really wouldn't like that. Ha!Caveat Emptor! (Buyer beware!)Jake"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy these","review":"Do NOT buy the \\"VersaPak Silver\\". These are advertised as having no \\"memory effect\\" but that is blatantly false. These are nickel cadmium batteries, the old type of rechargeable. \\"No memory effect\\" is a term used specifically to differentiate newer batteries, such as nickel metal hydride [NiMH] and lithium ion from the older nickel cadmium (NiCd) types. In fact, these ARE the batteries with \\"memory effect\\". Because of this effect, \\"VersaPak Silver\\" batteries will quickly lose their ability to hold a charge after your Dustbuster or other tool is plugged in continuously. Instead, save yourself the trouble and spend the extra few dollars to buy \\"VersaPak Gold\\" batteries which are NiMH and DON'T have the bad memory effect. You can leave a Dustbuster with the gold batteries plugged in continuously without having a real impact on battery life. Remember to recycle your \\"VersaPak Silver\\" batteries because they contain toxic cadmium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Versapak GOLD instead.","review":"The silver version of these batteries just dont last. You will get 60% MORE life from the Gold batteries for a few dollars more. I have many B&D tools that run these batteries, including the \\"Snake Light\\"...the Silver will go dead with one days use, as compared to the Gold, which will last up to 5 full days of use. You can get these for the same price at Lowes and Home Cheapo. You'll pay tax of course, but it evens out after subtracting the cost of (not) shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I have five versapak products. Out of 14 versapak batteries we are down to two weak ones and two that still power one vacuum.

Once charged they don't stay charged long enough, and they wear out and stop holding a charge before I think they should. Maybe it's because I'm a very light user, but I'll put a charged battery in a screwdriver, remove and install a few screws (no drilling), then leave the battery in. I'll come back some days later and the battery will be dead. So, I need a sceond backup battery to use when the first one dies. I'll switch batteries, put the first one on charge, and repeat the process a couple weeks later when I need it again. After repeating this process for couple years, it's time to dispose of the batteries and buy more. Is it unreasonable to be unhappy if I need to spend $40 every couple years to have a cordless electric screwdriver?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"300 charges\\"?

Perhaps it's just defective, or I ran it down too far, but B&D's claims of \\"no memory\\" and \\"300 charges\\" for these batteries is way out of line, in my experience.I still like my VersaPak dustbuster, screwdriver and drill, so I'm going to order another battery. Or three. (Even though that will cost about as much as the original set of tools did, with batteries.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"does as intended","review":"The VersaPak system works great.

Plan on replacing them about every 2 or 3 years (assuming you use and charge them to the letter). The standard battery chargers take 3 to 6 hours to charge these which is too long considering their typical life of only 5 or 10 minutes in use.

I only wish I'd started reading it RIGHT when we broke up, not six months (and many horrible groveling emails) later. I gave my copy away and have purchased / recommended it for several friends.

While Man has a special covenant with God, a covenant that binds us to our Maker unlike any other flora or fauna on Earth, we all share as members of Creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Molly Saves the Day","review":"Molly returns in \\"Molly Saves The Day\\" as an enthusiastic ten-year-old headed off to summer camp for the first time ever. Along with her best friends Linda and Susan, Molly enjoys meeting the challenges of camp. Well, almost all of them- Molly is afraid of swimming underwater after she fell off the dock during a swimming lesson. In the final days of camp, the counsellors organize a game of Capture the Flag, which pits Molly and Susan against Linda in an all-out battle. Molly's team's plan backfires and leaves Molly and Susan to save their team from losing the game. But to win, will Molly and Susan have to betray their best friend?I liked this book because it was fast-paced with a good dose of adventure while retaining realistic content. Molly is, as always, lively and lovable and I really enjoyed this installment of her series. I highly recommend this book to any fans of WWII historical fiction or the Molly series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT AMARICAN BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this book was relly good. it was about a girl in this coler war she and her friend are on the blueteam and there other friend was on the red team and how ever got the other teams flag and the blue team wins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Break No Bones","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read.Kathy Reichs has disppointed me for the last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break No Bones: A Novel ( Temperance Brennan Novels )","review":"Book came in the time frame and in the condition specified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"This is the first of Kathy Reichs books i have read (actually I never made it through the whole book). I will more than likely not read any more of her novels, too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I am a Kathy Reichs fan but was very disappointed in Break No Bones. The story was improbable on many levels (frolicking with Ryan while Pete lies in the hospital, etc). The characters were flat, there was little tension in the story line, and the ending felt like the author was rushing to meet an editor's deadline. If you really need your Reichs fix, wait for the paperback or go to the library--not worth the money for the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I realize this isn't a popular opinion...but I will never read another Kathy Reichs book because of this one. Temperance Brennan is an extremely self-centered and humorless heroine. I could'nt figure out how this women had any friends. Plus her working with the olice like she does is unreasonable. No way would she get to do the things she did. I know, I know...its fiction...but I really want the plot to make sense. Sorry fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best......","review":"I love Kathy Reichs' writing! I have read and re-read all of books. There are two I would list as not my favorites. I did not like Deadly Decisions, and I did not like Break No Bones. For some reason I felt nothing for the characters in Break no Bones. I thought tense situations were resolved to clean and conveniently. There was not enough conflict between characters like I am used to. I felt no sexual tension between Andrew and Tempe. I want the fresh and hot writing from her past books. I must confess....I will be first in line to buy her next book...I can't resist knowing what Tempe will get herself into next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me reading","review":"The only complaint I have is the main character always seems in pain! It is tiring! And confusing, the reader is to be drawn by her strength but she is always in a constant romantic quandry and nursing wounds. Otherwise the storyline was strong and interesting. Authors description of Charleston was vivid and I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story good....but!!","review":"I've enjoyed all the Temperance Brennan books. I often listen to them on CD in the car, as I did with this one. I really liked the story, but the narrator has to go. Her voice (accent?) was very annoying and distracting.

I listen to books on CD constantly as I have a lengthy commute to work each day. I have never watched the TV show Bones so have no clue about that. All I know is that whoever reads this book is monotonous. Maybe it is the story itself. I will always give a book a chance by listening to the entire first CD, which is what I did with this. I am used to much better reading from the likes of Joe Mantegna (James Patterson novel reader)and Lorelei King (Janet Evanovich novel reader). I can't have a book putting me to sleep. Sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"BREAK NO BONES BY KATHY REICHS","review":"I love her books. I find them very informative as well as I really like her characters. I watch Bones on TV.

Try as hard as she might (and she REALLY tried!), Sue Grafton or Janet Evanovich, she is not. The sarcastic sniping she sprinkled into \\"Break No Bones\\"--especially between Ryan and the snarky, incredibly un-likeable Pete--was just plain forced. If anything, Tempe's intense seriousness was what made her fun to read. I disliked the tone of this book so much, I didn't finish it. Who did it?

I really liked the two first books in the series but this one reads like a cartoon. Right after I finished this one I happened to start on the new Minette Walters. Oh dear. Different league entirely. She actually composes full sentences, even entire paragraphs, and provides characterisation and plot background. The only descriptive parts in \\"Break no bones\\" seem to be technical jargon about skeletons.

I enjoyed it, but I wasn't exactly captivated by it. But the reader of the book... yikes! She is really terrible. She mumbles at times, and just doesn't seem to put much into it. No question, this one is the worst read audiobook production I have listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible narration","review":"This review is for the audio CD. The narrator uses a breathy, whispered, languid, mostly somnolent delivery style. The reading is choppy and stilted, with inappropriate pace and emotion delivered during dialog and action. This narration is so bad that I am going to buy the paperback and read it, even though I have problems reading.At times the narrator sounds like she is drugged. Other times she sounds like a voice over for a romance novel. She has no feel for the characters and makes the romantic banter between Tempe and Ryan sound like a child reciting a book report."},{"rating":"2","title":"another enjoyable mystery...","review":"I've read every novel Kathy Reichs has written, and have enjoyed the character development most of all. The accuracy of the situations and her explanations of medical and forensic terms is finally sticking with me, so following the story is much easier. This book is once again in the deep south, which I like more than those stories that take place in Canada. This is another fine read in a whole series of fine reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"My first Kathy Reichs. I'm disappointed. The plot is ok, but you have to have an intimate knowledge of anatomy as well as a detailed map of Charleston and environs to appreciate the progress of the plot.

I actually prefer English Language books, since many titles are badly translated, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and boring","review":"My lastest audio book in the car was Break No Bones by Kathy Reichs. The main character was the inspiration for the Fox tv show Bones. I love the show, so I was prepared to love the books.I hate the book. The only thing it has in common with the show is the character name and field of occupation.The book has a lot of extraneous, rambling information that contributes nothing to the story. It starts out very slow, and doesn't get into the story very quickly. I listened to several chapters while trying to decide if I was going to bother listening to the rest.I did listen to the whole story. It did have a bit of a twist at the end, but most of it was predictable and boring. It could have been cut in half, and the story would probably have improved.If you are a fan of the show, I would suggest you avoid the books completely. They are very disappointing and have nothing in common with the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any TV Show","review":"\\"If you like CSI or Without a Trace or Bones, you will love Kathy Reichs.

It's complete covering everything from legal to marketing to finance yet it also is remarkably easy to understand and navigate. This isn't just another dry text nor is it a stripped down real estate for dummies.

My only complaint is I wish this had been published a couple of years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this and make them rich","review":"I've read a few of the other reviews of this book, and some of the information is accurrate. For instance, they do repeate things...entire paragraphs...over and over. There is no real original thought at all in this book. These guys also go on and on about how much better it is to buy and sell houses without the help, aid, or assistance from a realtor. By reading between the lines, it is obvious these guys only want to line their own pockets. They claim this isn't a get rich quick scheme...not for the one who tries it. It sure is for the authors.

It's true that to be a big-time investor you need to learn what the big guys do. Having said that, this one just assumes you have bought and sold homes for as long as the author (20 years) but that pertains only to 1 out of 500 of us.

Unfortunately, the zipper of the top hatch broke durin the flight, so Roger had to be manually restrained throughout the flight and on the tarmac, where he could have run off. We had used the product twice before for quick vet visits, so the zipper failed after only a few uses.

When we came home I checked out the manufacturer's website and found no warranty information. I even emailed but got no response.

I thought she would fit in an airplane approved carrier easily- I was wrong. Her legs are pretty long, as well as her body. I was trying to find a pet carrier for United, but she couldn't fit in any of the regulated carriers, so I went out on a limb and bought this carrier. She fit in it well and after reading another review about someone using this carrier and folding it down, I hoped I could do the same and it worked! The last flight I was on was an EMB 120 Brasilia turboprop (30 seater) and there was no way my dog was going to fit under the seat, but they didn't say anything and thankfully the plane wasn't full so she sat next to me. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is bigger than airline approved and it was much more difficult to fold down than I had hoped. Great bag, I might use it again to travel with my big cat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog chewed through it!","review":"I think this could be a great bag if you are not traveling far or have a very relaxed pet. Our 11 pound dog managed to chew threw the mesh siding about 20 minutes into our 5 hour flight. I think if the mesh was more durable it would be a great bag. I just feel I cannot give it better then a 1 star rating because we paid alot of money for this carrier to last 20 minutes.

The worlds are very detailed and the music in some of the levels are really good like Lava Reef and Death Egg Zone to name 2 of my favorites. The game is designed very similar to Sonic 3 with a sub-boss in the middle followed by the mustache maniac Robotnick. The fact that you can lock it onto sonic 3 makes it that much more enjoyable and makes sonic 3 that much longer.

Although graphic novels, the best types, can be painted novels, or use mixed media or digital compositions, manga to realistic style - these aren't really covered in this book.

For those that don't know, dikes are the tradesman name for diagonal-cutting pliers.I have never used the angled dikes made by Klein, but I am sure they are of the same high quality that everyone has come to not only love, but expect also. Once you purchase these, you will never buy another brand of dikes, because these are simply the best.There really isn't too much to say about these, just that they are of the best quality tool steel, have a very sharp cutter, and will do their job for a long time if used properly.

Too many of these types of book are page after page of overblown and unsubstantiated claims mixed in with dubious and eclectic philosophy. Dr Duke, however, backs up claims wherever he can, frequently with reference to proper research, and in many cases he will come out and say that he he is doubtful about certain claims made for this or that herb. His writing style is also quite enjoyable and occasionally funny (although I could do without some of the cutesy names he gives some of his own concoctions).

Boy was I ever wrong. Out of a total of about 30 songs I only liked about three. If you don't like the EXTREME rock/rap beat then I would NOT recommend buying these CD's. Some of the songs were so loud with the beat you couldn't understand the words and sometimes you couldn't even hear the words.

That, of course, is due to the quality of music that has been put over the past year. As with the past few years there are bonus songs - this year there are 3. The highlights for me were Toby Mac's (featuring dc Talk meaning that it's dc Talk) Atmosphere, Voice of Truth by Casting Crown's, Homesick by MercyMe etc...(the list goes on).

I was disappointed in 2005 but loved 2004, so I took a gamble on the aught-six CD. The music is much better than the previous years (and I really liked 2004, so that's saying something).Technically, the music sounds fuller and stronger and has more depth. Musically-speaking, I find the tunes more pleasing and more professional and lively.Lyrics-wise, it's fantastic. Profoundly inspiring and stirring. More than a few songs brought a tear to my eye and a tangible feeling of warmth to my soul. Very stirring and deeply touching. I highly recommend this for hungry Christians, seeking the message of God's love and grace via song.

He knocks just about every great film from the 60s and 70s in a way that definitely sounds like a generational difference in tastes. He knocks Hal Ashby, he knocks Godard, he knocks Truffaut, he knocks Coppola, he knocks Altman. Basically, he attacks any who differed from the traditions in classical studio cinema up till that time.Okay, it's subjective you say. It's opinion. Yes. But his reasons for dismissing these filmmakers feels like rationalization, not sound reasoning. Shipman comes off as someone resistant to change, to evolution, and it makes his book a somewhat annoying endeavor.That said, any book this big on cinema is not bad to have around the house, if only to flip through for fun now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victory yet waits...","review":"So this game was made purely for asthetic value. The graphics, artwork, and music are unmatched by any game ever made. However, where gameplay is concerned, many may find it lacking. 2-D sidescrolling made repetitive, this game is completely pre-programmed and provides no changes ever when playing. The world is vast and you could go many different paths, but only one works. It's half a joy to figure out which is the right one. Once you find the right one, though, you'll find you've memorized the entire game. It can be real hard to hit enemies with your punch or jump kick (only attacks), but the ridiculous difficulty may be enough to keep you playing.

So I'm used to these movies by now.First of all, if you are thinking of purchasing this movie for the pure enjoyment of a good horror flick, FORGET IT. This movie's plot line is damaged beyond repair. The actors are bellow par, at best.I watch these movies for the pure enjoyment of watching such a terribly horrible film. The ideas that the Horror Fest movies come up with are a lot of fun. Me and my buddies watched Nightmare Man with incredible enjoyment because it made us LAUGH out loud the entire time. It was so freaking hilarious. Every moment is beyond predictable and the twist at the end... well... let's just say it's as if it came straight out of a \\"Scary Movie\\" sequel.Anyways... Bottom Line: This movie sucks SO bad that it's awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Awful movie.

Also, you get a very good adventure with all the crew as the support story.Even if you know LAND BENEATH THE GROUND, this will be a bonus, since the story has had sections rebuilt from edits previously not restored.The restoration is fairly good, and totally within character for Bark's work.The Cover of the Comic is good, although I had the center of the Comic separate again from the cover, but no damage, since I am getting the two comics repaired.Hopefully you will know the story, so those who do will enjoy the comic, and the kids can enjoy a very kid friendly comic, vastly superior to the rubbish around now. Absolutely superb Work, great stories, detailed characters, and an ongoing mythos in the Duck Universe that still resonates ( as I said, it re-appeared in DUCK TALES tv series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay a little more and spend less time.","review":"I bought this sander trying to save a little money. It started out working pretty well, but got to the point where it would take a long time to sand and the finish boot broke in half. Black and Decker did replace it, but by that time I was fed up with this sander and had bought another type. It never picked up any dust and performed poorly in a short while. My advise is that if you are doing any type of half-way serious woodworking, then spend a little extra money. You'll be glad you did (and it will cost less) in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most versatile sanders out there","review":"This model combines the effectiveness of a random orbit sander with the detailing of sheet and detail sanders at a pretty good price. I found it easy to attach the orbit and detailing pads, and the velcro does a good job at keeping the sanding pads in place.The only negatives are the sound (it's noisy), the fine detail pad lost its effectiveness quickly due to wear (thankfully, B&D includes several extra detail pads), and most of the dust ends up all over the place instead of in the collection bag. I still recommend keeping some old-fashioned sandpaper or a sanding stick handy for detail areas and hard-to-reach places.For standard household work, this sander worked well for my most recent sanding project (sanding a window moulding). As I said before, the 3-in-1 features make this a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart within 18 months","review":"Mine fell apart within a yaar and a half, and I haven't bothered to try to get it fixed. Most of the time, it sanded pretty well, and I love the hook and loop. But, this isn't the model to get.Spend a little more and get a high quality tool. The dust was never collected at all, so it was worthless without a shop vacattached.I am finished with Black and Decker tools, I have never had one last more than a couple of years. Spend the money for the better tool, it will make for a better result, and there is nothing more aggravating than having the pad fall off in the middle of your project.If you are buying a gift for an aspiring woodworker that you love, get a Porter Cable, Makita or DeWalt. Mine was a gift that I was too sappy to return... Now, I am asking for a new Sander for Xmas, think it will be a Porter Cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked three hours","review":"I used this sander three times. About an hour each time. I tried to use it tonight and the switch would not turn it on. I shook it and tried again. It started smoking below the swith inside the housing. I'll take it apart tonight and see why it started smoking, but there is no way it should have a problem like this with so little use. I think I will go back to Dewalt or Makita. The Dewalts are under powered, in my opinion, so I may check out Makita first. I hope this helped. I have never had a sander quit after 3 hours of use before and thought folks should know the issue I had. The smoking wires inside are a safety issue as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Black and Decker Detail Sanders are absolute junk. I bought one, used it for less than 30 hours of intermittent operation and one of the platen support posts broke off. Went to town and bought a better one. It lasted less than 5 hours and one of the platen supports broke. Now I have two pieces of junk. They have also changed their repair parts so that you cannot purchase a replacement platen with the support posts attached, you can only buy the platen.

After playing with he 425 for maybe 10 minutes, I decided to go home & check their prices against retail to see if it was a good deal or not. Which was the little voice in my head saying they just don't look right.

From the little rubber things on the legs, to the tightening handles, to the mdf 'wood' platform, to the threads on the vice thing; the overall build quality is very very bad.

Assembly instruction is poorly written with pictures so tiny that they are pretty much useless. Then when I tried to clamp a project (a 14\\" X 12\\" board), there is no way to get it clamped down securely. The adjustment options were either too big or too small to get all 4 clamps on it! I tried using only 2 clamps, but it was impossible to secure it, and I did not want to tighten it too much fearing the cheap plastic handle might break off.

In Lady of Light, Evan and Claire fall in love in a short period of time and marry. Not only do they deal with the problems of most newlyweds, but Claire brings along her troubled younger brother and immediately moves to a new country. In this new country, which is Evan's home, Claire deals with questioning in-laws and working daily with Evan's first love. Did he marry on the rebound? Does he really love her? Does he still long for his first love? When tradegy looms, the whole family must work together. But how!?! The complicated relationships must grow stronger or break.

The Hallelujia Chorus was the Seattle Christmas Ship's transition theme last night when we cruised Bill Gate's Lake Washington and not a foot could keep from stirring. The ship became a pure megadecibel sound source for those huddled together around bonfires on the beach and those in the 18 ship posse trailing the Argosy \\"Spirit of Seattle\\".

I wanted to use Why Do the Nations... with Jarreau to audition a pair of high-end stereo speakers in the store, and the band sounded like they were recorded in a shoe-box.

It pays homage to the original, but brings a lively, joyful, unique sound to the musical ideas Handel started with. It modernizes it without degrading it in any way. I still love the original (Tafelmusik's is my favourite rendition, as true to the original ideas as possible), but I love this adaptation equally as much.

I play it LOUDLY in the car and at home and have been known to break it down, measure by measure, in order to figure out the arrangements. I've performed the traditional Messiah more times than I can count and love it, yet I am delighted and astounded every time I listen to this fresh, innovative and dynamic piece of music (like I said, year round). Thank you, thank you to all the musicians, artists, engineers and technicians who put this piece together.

I was very much misled by the other reviews and by the overture into thinking that this CD rearranged the various sections of Messiah into these traditional types of Black music. Not so. It is true that a track or two has a few bars of African drumming, but 99 percent features a drum synthesizer. Similarly, you can hear the occasional few bars of gospel, but 99 percent of this CD features Messiah reworked in a sort of 70s Black pop style. At the very least, I thought the Hallelujah Chorus would be a rafter-rocking gospel chorus - Lord, they made it into a show tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Longing for a recording of \\"Handel's\\" Messiah stripped of all of its classical majesty and beauty?

This isn't \\"authentic\\" black music - it's a mangling of a masterpiece.

He should have also explained why mistakes were made when moves were given in some of the tactics that were given with the entire game. This book simply does not explain things and the writer does not seem to know his stuff. LOOK ELSWHERE FOR A TACTICS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Understanding of What Kids Need","review":"OK - this book has some good examples - but this book must have been put together in a few days as it was not logically arranged, and both the games and solutions to the problems in this book were not explained. Kids need to be told what was wrong with this, what was wrong with that. This book is absolutely horrible. Wish a ZERO was possible here - the nice thing about this book is it has good quality printing and binding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Chess Teacher","review":"I teach chess in the public schools in California and purchased this and several other books to provide problems and lesson plans.The Chess Kid's Book of Tactics contains some good problems for students. It is lacking in quantity and contains numerous mistakes.It's weakest point is that it provides some sames without showing in many cases where the errors were made. For a strong player using the book as a teaching tool this isn't a serious problem. However, for a student reading the book his or herself this is a major flaw.Overall the book isn't so bad. However, there are several better books available on tactics for students and chess teachers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Useful Book","review":"After reading CHESS FOR JUNIOIRS (also a David McKay Book - I highly recommed it as a first book) I got THE KID'S BOOK OF TACTICS as my second book.It gives a nice sample of different positions using important tactical ideas in the most simple form. I found the problems to be to easy for me and wanted something that was more challenging.There are some comments on the sample games used, but in most cases the moves are without comments and knowing where the good and bad moves are made is not pointed out.Even with these weaknesses I would say the book is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I purchased this book along with the author's King and Pawn book. This book is a little better. It has a fair number of simple problems for students to work on and sample games to go along with it. I agree with the other reviers who claim that a big miss with this book is that in the sample games the author fails to point out in many cases where the errors where make. This lack of important information drags the book down considerably. There are also numerous errors in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tactical Blunder","review":"I call this book a tactical blunder because this is the worst book I have ever seen on tactics. The games have little or no analysis - you have no idea of what is going on. There is not a lot of material covered in the book. You would think a book on tactics for kids would explain things - it don't! If you want to really get a good book on tactics get \\"Combination Challenge\\" or \\"Art of the Checkmate\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Example Games Have Very Little Explanation","review":"David Macenulty gives complete games that show at the end where the idea of the problems are used.A very serious problem is that most of the games have very little or no explanation. The games have terrible mistakes being made without them being pointed out.I also found some better moves that those that the books says are best. I know this is true because I showed the better moves to my chess teacher who is a master and he congratulated me on finding the mistakes. At the age of 10 I find the problems to be too easy, but the writer of this book to not know what he is writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not a \\"best buy\\"","review":"When I got this book I was excecting more content. This book must have been put together in a few days. Just because it is a book written for kids doesn't mean it has to lack content and have so many oversized diagrams to take up space.The actual material, however, is ok, which is why I could justify not giving it one star. There are many good books with tactics out there that have a lot more problems to work on. My favorite is WINNING CHESS TACTICS FOR JUNIORS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of mistakes and lacks analysis","review":"I found this book to have a fair number of mistakes in it. However, even if you forgive the mistakes the sample games that tie in to the positions give many horrible moves without pointing them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of my list","review":"There are not enough puzzels to work on. I ordered this book then when I was at the National Elementary in Pittsburgh the bookstore there had so many tactic books with much more puzzels for the money.The example games don't tell much about what is happening. Simply said - not a good book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give a 0 rating","review":"A big miss - two thumbs down. Got this book for my kid and he didn't like it, so I gave it a closer look.Here is what I found:Almost no comments to the games inside. Not a teaching book. The author often gives a ? to a move but doesn't tell why. Makes me and my kid scratch out heads! Confusing. So we aren't Bobby Fischer at chess, but this book should help us here!There are some obvious mistakes in the book that make it clear that either the author never got a chance to proof read his own book or that he doesn't know what he is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased with the quality or quantity of the material in it","review":"This is a very, very basic book on tactics. It is just ok for someone that has just learned how the pieces have moved.I found that there was not enough examples of problems to make this book worth while. There explanations are not very good and not as clear as my other two chess books on tactics and traps in the opening (they all had a lot more material too). I felt that the diagrams were much bigger than they needed to be and that a lot of space was wasted on the pages. I have looked at the McKay Chess Library for Kids and they don't seem to have anything beyond super beginner stuff that is the same style."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUMMER!","review":"I got this book for my Birthday and must say it does not even begin to compare to my Serawan Tactics book. It does not have enough examples and it doesn't do much to tell you what is going on with what it does have. I like books that tell you move by move what is going on, where mistakes are made on both sides. Often a series of moves are given and you don't know where the other person went wrong because it doesn't tell you.My two star ranking is generous - probably 1.5 if they allowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Else - Very Sparce","review":"This book is lame in my opinion because,Number One - I found some mistakes in it that no writter or publisher should miss,Number two - There isn't enough actual stuff in it. It will take someone in my grade who has learned to play no time to go through it and be bored stiff if he has been playing chess in the club at there school.Number three - Overgrown sizes of diagrams just take up space. This book look like the company that published it got the material and had to make it BIG to make it into a book instead of a booklet.Number four - Judge this book by its cover and you will not want it! I gave it away to a friend so I can beat him. Maybe not so nice, but this book actually teaches you some incorrect stuff!!! My other book by the David MaKay Library by another writer was very good, just not this one. So don't judge a book by its publisher, but by its author is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Instruction","review":"I found that between the lack of proper explanation, poor organization and mistakes in this book it should never have been written. A good book on Tactics: Art of Attack in Chess (just fantastic) for more advanced players and 1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations for mid range, and Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors by Hays for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read these reviews first!!!","review":"There is a reason why this book doesn't have very good reviews. After reading the first part of it I found it was not well organzied, had some big mistakes and didn't tell anything what was going on with the games it has. It shows a lot of games where it only takes you up to the tactic where you must solve it but does not tell you where the other person went wrong (the other books give a queston mark \\"?\\" to tell you where) and what was correct. You want to know where the mistakes were made and what should have been done- then what to do to take advantage of the mistakes.There should be some strong knowledge of chess before a book should be wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking it over and using it","review":"I have spend over a week using this book. I think this is an honest review. I can understand why it has two stars by others. The author has probably tried his best but the problem is that there are better tactics books and I own a couple. One is the Reinfeld book, 1001 Winning sacrifics and combinations and the other is Seraswans book on tactics. They have more things and tell me better why they work.I do chess class after school in New York City and have heard good things about the author of this book. He is not my chess teacher but am sure he would do good as my teacher in person. So you might still want to buy this book because my ranking by stars is only due to other better books like it but the book is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chess kids book of tactics","review":"Most of the games do not show where the mistakes were made and all of the games do not have notes to them to tell what is happening. If a move is bad it should have a question mark and tell you what was correct. I wanted a book that would explain things to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't explain things like it should","review":"This is the worst tactics book I have seen. The games have little to tell you where mistakes were made that lead up to taking advantage of them. The games have few comments period.There is not enough material in the book to make it serious to learn from.So what books I recomend to study tactics? They are WINNING CHESS TACTICS FOR JUNIORS by Hays, WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS and THE ART OF THE CHECKMATE. Look into these three books and then make a decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got this thing - BIG MISTAKE","review":"I purchased four books by Random House/David McKay for kids level training: Chess For Juniors, Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors, Chess Kids Book of Tactics and Chess Kids Book of the King and Pawn Ending. The first two are the very best book I have ever seen the last two are the worst two books I have ever seen (ok, so I only own about 150 chess books). [...]Lets get into this! This book has \\"oversized diagrams\\" to fill in the space for lack of material. This book uses games to go along with the tactical problems set up (good concept if done correctly). The problem here is that as stated by the other reviewers there is very little analysis of where a player went wrong to reach these bad positions - why bother with the games in this case? I agree with another reviewer that this book must have been tossed together in a rush. I would have never got it if I read the other reviews in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK. Works better than your average towel.","review":"I'm trying to teach my dog to jump off a dock into Lake Champlain.

I can cover her entire length and therefore give myself an advantage to win the battle of whether I can dry her before she really wants to dry herself (by minimizing splatter from that shaking as I dry her).While this is a sizeable towel, putting a clip in the long-side middle allows me to hang on a peg to be ready for action at the door.This washes up nicely - but you really want to be sure to wash alone the first couple of times.I just now checked the current price on this and there is a special going on.

I wish that it was more entertaining for kids so that they would want to read the book and enjoy reading it. I could barely get through this book myself because it was so dry and lecturing. The amount of stuff the author suggests you need to be organized is dizzying. I think this creates a barrier to entry for kids because they don't have all that stuff. My son would not read this book.

Heavily orchestrated, only the few moments of Portugese being sung now and then made it sound at all Brazilian. And there was no trace of Jazz to it at all.

Jobim's recognised compositional idiosyncrasies and Claus Ogerman's lush arrangements keep pulling the music (and the listener) away from the deadness of muzak and into an extraordinary soundscape of traditional instruments and Brazilian-style orchestration.

Today's minimum standard is 24-bit and, actually, the current top standard is DSD (re)mastering. So, there is a big technological gap between the sound offered by this CD and what exists nowadays.I cannot recommend this CD if you are an audiophile or if you already own the previous, 1998 release. The other re-releases of Frank Sinatra albums on Reprise have similarly not been remastered.To anwer the question of David, there are only 10 tracks on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra at his most powerful and finest","review":"This album rates as on of my favourites. Sinatra's rendition of \\"Night and Day\\", \\"Misty\\" and others is stunning. By the early 1960s, recording technology had improved enough (stereo was standard, or at least common) and Sinatra's voice remained in fine form -- I prefer this to the boyish 1940s recordings, although these are treasurable on their own merits -- allowing the tonal splendor of the vocals to fill the room.\\"All or Nothing at All\\" provides a marvelous contrast to the version with Harry James in 1939.

Not at all a rock band, more of a plugged-in folk band. Mr. Good should conside becoming a sad song swooner instead of an angry jaded rocker.The lyrical content combined with the emotional impact of the moody songs makes this collection a good back drop for stuffing your lonely face full of chocolate.She's Got A New Diguise and Fearless are heart wreching love ballads. Where as the blue Haven't Sleep in Years shows the deepest wounds this would be poet is trying to share. A very personal portrait. Not the best over all CD made, but it shows the potential that this unit has if they could only kick up the volume about a thousand times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What [junk].","review":"This is my favourite band in the whole world, so when I bought their debut album I thought it was going to be good. But it is terrible. Matthew Good hates this album, and with good reason. It is awful. The songs are mediocre; they put the album together fast, put very little money into it and it shows. Compared to their best album, \\"Beautiful Midnight\\", \\"LotGA\\" is awful. I give this album two stars, simply because it has one redeeming quality, \\"Omissions of the Omen.\\" It is an excellent song, even though it isn\`t mentioned in the track listing. It\`s a hidden track that that comes after \\"The War Is Over\\" and it\`s definitely worth waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREDIBLE BAND, okay debut.","review":"MGB is an awesome band. And when they make their crossover to the U.S.A., they will leave the competition far behind.But their debut album, doesn't quite stand up to their jaw-dropping follow-up albums \\"Underdogs\\" and \\"Beautiful Midnight\\".Probably the best song on this album in the anger-fueled \\"Alabama Motel Room\\". However, this same track is also available on their \\"Raygun\\" CD - which, although it is much shorter, is a far superior CD, (The song \\"Generation X-Wing\\", is outstanding!.).I blame producer John Shepp for not being able to produce an album that displays MGB in all their glory. \\"Symbolistic White Walls\\", \\"Radio Bomb\\" and \\"Fearless\\" are pretty good songs, but MGB have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This video would be funny if it weren't so rediculous.They might as well have Hulk Hogan throwing around Steve Urcle.I mean there is no real ability, just random flailing of random extremities.Some one not familiar with this particular martial art, being introduced to it by this video, might completely write it off as useless.If your looking for good instructions on silat, your in the wrong place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashy and showy Silat for demo only","review":"I think of non-fiction martial arts videos as one of three types.1 - instructional . . . here's how to do it2 - reference . . . since you're studying this, here's a reference catalog of the stuff you already know3 - deomonstrational . . . where the person on-camera is showing off his skill and ability without trying to teach you how to do anything or help you learn the art.This video falls into the third category.

It is also one of his weakest albums lyrically. Coincidence? I'm not sure. The lyrics seem rather pointless when compared to some of his other works like \\"Viva Hate\\" or his later release \\"Vauxhall and I\\". Musically, it sounded more like general, vapid alt. rock than it did anything else. Songs like \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\\" are the highlights of the album, but the rest of it seems to fade away with the passage of time.

The 'L' position is uncomfortable as it doesn't bend nearly enough. Also, the battery is a complete waste and began to die after only a few minutes of use (after a full charge). There isn't enough power in the first place to put a screw in more than halfway, even after first nailing a hole. I couldn't even hang a standard set of mini-blinds with this piece of garbage.

And thought a choke chain was fine. I will admit I have been proven wrong! He's a great dog inside and usually walks just fine outside, but has the highest prey drive whenever another dog, squirrel, or car catches his attention. Before when using a choke chain on another dog she would continue pulling causing the chain to tighten and would not even notice the correction. I like how this herm sprenger prong collar does not keep tightening when pulled on. Tried it on my arm before putting it on my dog t make sure it did not cause pain. The quality is superb with rounded prongs. After one 20 minute walk session he is starting to learn to ignore the outside stimuli and to stay closer while walking.

I wish I had saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch two Biker Build Offs on TLC you will learn more","review":"about metal working than this terribly mis-titled book. Read the other low rated reviews. They cover the problems well enough. Only thing I can figure is all the 5 star reviews are friends of the author or something.One guy mentions how much he learns about metal shrinking. My question is how? It is mentioned many times. In one place they have a photo caption saying heat shrinking works by heating a spot and then blasting with air to quick cool it. As for mechanical shrinkers, they never tell you how they work. Or give any info on how to figure out how much or how to really shrink metal. You will learn it can be shrunk and pretty much nothing else.For someone wanting to learn metal work, it isn't useless. It is pretty close to it. You honestly can learn more by watching some Biker Build Offs as metal is worked in the background. I haven't been this disappointed in a book in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heads up Custom car builders!","review":"What I found in this book, as a bodyman, was that it helped me to understand how to form sheetmetal into patch panels to fit better, how easy it was to manipulate the sheetmetal with several new techniques.

The potential candidates I found were in the $60-$80 range. After searching online and in stores, I decided to just purchase another Sterilite, just newer and fresher. It beats the price! The old one was just too old and stained (had it for about 4 years). Sterilite Ultra is the best, sturdy, reasonably priced dish rack I found. It's large, can hold a lot if dishes and pots. With time it will get dirty, even with frequent washing, because it's quite difficult to get the water stains out of the spaces between the ridges, and around holes (as it would be of any other plastic rack).

When you first get the cable, its an amazing product. However, with both cables, after using them in my car for a few months, they start going out, only playing audio through one channel (usually the left). Both continue to get worse, to the point now with my second one that I can usually only get sound through both channels for 4-5 minutes at a time. As such, its hard to recommend this product to anyone who will use it in a car, and I would be wary of it even for home use. When I contacted Belkin, they offered to send me a third cable (with me paying shipping), but it isn't worth it anymore. Its a shame, too, because when it works, the sound is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This cable is thick and seems to be well made, that is until you start moving it, plugging and unplugging ect. If you are going to use this cable for an application where you plug it in and leave it alone it might work. If you plan on using it to connect a laptop or mp3 player to external speakers(applications where you will be constantly plugging, unplugging and moving it around) you may want to look at something of higher quality. The problem I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve(silver) comes unscrewed from the jack(gold) and with little surface area to grasp it is difficult to tighten adequately; also if you bump or move the cable while music is playing through it will cause a cracking sound in your speakers and often the left channel will mute. Like I said this cable might work if you never move or unplug it but otherwise look elsewhere. On the positive side cable does seem to be made of heavy, quality material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked promising","review":"The construction seemed very durable when I first got it and everything worked as expected, but a few months after my purchase the solder joint broke on the female end.

My neighbor has a dog that is really annoying. It will bark when a leaf falls from a tree for up to 20-30 minutes solid. Not just any bark mind you, but one of the loudest barks I have ever heard from a canine. This resulted in my childish response, to blast that sucker with this horn when he was driving me nuts. Well, needless to say, it only aggravated him further. The horn works well, and I'm sure all my neighbors are glad I only used it once. lolI have solved the problem of his irritating bark for the most part though - I replaced all my windows on the house with triple pane glass, and that cuts out an amazing amount of the sound. I can now watch TV on the opposite end of the house from the dog, and I do not have to turn up the TV when he barks.

Many clustering methods are described. Most can be seen to have some degree of subjectivity, in defining what ends up in a given cluster. Or whether a cluster even exists or not.The analysis of Web documents forms a major portion of the book. This data set is vast, continually changing and expanding. Plus, it is noisy. Unlike many clean data sets that might be extracted from a corpus of books, for example. Attention should be paid to methods of automatically extracting information from the Web.The book does not go much into the higher level problems of defining ontologies. Which are very hard tasks.

Sure, it's good to see David Wayne has returned to the band, but his voice has somewhat deteriorated in the past years. His voice sounds more whiney and nasal than before. I found myself wincing in pain trying to tolerate the vocals. (I only made it to Lb. Of Cure on the CD.) Mike Howe will be missed because he had the voice that fit in PERFECTLY.Albums such as Blessing In Disguise and Human Factor were truly awesome CD's (as were their self-titled and The Dark) but I think it's time the band turned in their guitars and drums, and just retire. The music on this CD is just rehashed music from the 80's with no thought or time put into them. Who knows though, maybe they will put a new album out that totally blows this one away.

There was little to glean. The author sounds like a teacher from the 1950's. When I read a book on writing, especially once purporting to teach the reader how to write \\"in flow,\\" I'm expecting the author to practice what she preaches.

Chances are, if you don't know what flow is then you probably wouldn't be interested in the book in the first place. In fact, the first 40 pages or so are spent entirely with defining \\"flow\\". The rest of the book is variations of the same theme.While she does reveal working habits of writers, she admits that just because something works for someone it doesn't mean it will work for you. I could have figured that out for free.I think Ray Bradbury summed it up much more succinctly in his essay \\"Zen in the Art of Writing\\" - \\"Work. Relaxation. Don't think!\\".

DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I am a student in a very rigorous AP/IB program (this year I took 9 AP and IB exams combined.) I can say with no hesitation that out of all the books I have used to review my respective subjects this is the absolute worst. The entire book is written as if you should already know everything by taking the class. Due to that fact, why not just use your own class notes? I'm sure that they will be of higher quality, and more suited to review the appropriate material than this sorry excuse for a review book. It is very hard to find a page in this book that does not have significant grammatical errors, but also in which the author does not pose at least 5 rhetorical questions; I'm sorry but when I paid my 20 dollars for this book I didn't realize comedy and lack of information would be the return on my investment.

Very easy to read and an interesting story. Roone is so creative and you really get to know him in his memoir. I enjoyed all of the behind the scene stories about Monday Night Football, Wide World of Sports, boxing and World News Tonight. He had to deal with a lot of difficult people -- mostly in the news division -- but he knew what he was doing and always succeeded. This is a success story. The greatest story is how he got started when he was a waiter in a restaurant. It's too bad that the kids working in the restaurants, fast food places and retail stores don't read this and apply themselves to their jobs because you just never know who might be your customer! Roone was always a pro and that's why when fate intervened, he succeeded. I highly recommend this enjoyable and well-written book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"Every once in a while there is a book that you hate to see come to an end. Roone: A Memoir is one of those books.The reader races through his busy days right along with him. The reader gets the inside jokes and snickers at the absurdity of many situations that were common place.He does not allow you into his private life. He mentions the break up of his first marriage and casually introduces his second wife. So casually, that I missed it and had to go back and find the reference.The stories about current TV personalities and those who have passed are captivating. His experiences during the Munich Olympics brought back memories of that horrific nightmare.This is a book that will definitely be a gift to the sports minded people on my list this Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor matching of product","review":"the online catalog has no real tie to the proper charger and the applicable battery pack.

It charges fine with a B&D charger and works with the 12volt drill/driver. In fact, it puts the drill on steroids. The only problem is that the Dewalt has a ridge around the battery case that prevents the clip holders from grabbing. I just use a big, strong rubber band to hold the thing in place.

In fact, since it works and is readily available at the local hardware store, it is far superior to the Piece of S*** 130 by Black & Decker.Had I to do it over, I'd just avoid the Black & Decker PS130 system entirely and instead go with something with either an engine or a cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"The drill works ok but the batteries die very fast.","review":"I bought 4 of these drills - two for me and two for friends.All batteries get tired quickly with usage and they die quickly ( in that they no longer hold a charge at all ).

They're oily and sugary. Lots of sugar for quick energy and the oil stays on the stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that's why much of fast food is so popular, it tastes good and its satisfying, but it ain't necessarily good for you! The recipe makes it sweeter, and certainly oilier, than eating an ordinary candy bar. I think a Snickers tastes better.For those who are using these as meal replacement bars, I'd be real careful. The bar might be 'balanced' but it isn't a meal. Whatever energy bar you consume, they're good before a workout or post-workout for recovery but don't confuse them with a proper meal and all the components found there.As for me, I prefer an Odwalla bar or Cliff bar.

Odwalla (at least Peanut flavor) seems the most like Real food with real peanuts in it.

Indeed he was a showman and a shaman, but the soul of this great man seems to talk in many of these amazing photographs by Timothy White. Some of the images are candid, some contrived, but it's the glimpses of Indian Larry in his infamous bike stunt, the one that eventually claimed his life, that are the most moving.Apart from Larry, the pictures of his bikes are equally breathtaking, and his soul indeed lives on through these creations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A spectacular book that captures Larry and his friends in a wide variety of moods.

I would have given this bar 5 stars had it not used palm oil. This ups the saturated fat, which I need to watch. Corn surup not the best thing to be ingesting either but since I am working out and burning it off its proabably not a problem. This bar has the lowest sat. fat (2g, 10%RDA) than their other two bars and the most potasium. The later is important to me because it may help ward off my leg cramps.

The set came with no instructions, so I have yet to figure out how the Satellite arm assembles and works. One of the wheels came off the shuttle in the first week (my son specifically requested a Shuttle with wheels, so he could land it). While we were able to get it on, it continues to fall off. They just did not make this \\"playable\\" for the kids who would be most interested ... 5-9 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Toy","review":"My son loved this toy and was so excited when he first opened it.

Jesus, people, if you're gonna pay tribute to Ministry, try remaking songs that they actually WROTE! Horrible. Unoriginal sound makes this album sound like it's an insult rather than a tribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"This album has some over dramatic reworks, but it's the ones with a sense of humor I enjoy, like the TRS-80 cover of Everyday is Halloween. I don't understand the cover of Lay Lady Lay though. Anyone who takes Ministry seriously should pick up With Sympathy, that's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste The Cash","review":"Tribute albums usually tend to offer 3 or 4 good covers, and a bunch of lousy ones. Well, this is no exception. Meg Lee Chin's cover of Scarecrow is fine, Pig's cover of Just Like You is surprisingly mediocre (well, even geniuses have bad days I guess), and the Hate Dept. cover of Effigy is a tad too overdramatic. These are the best of the lot, though Everyday Is Halloween still bounces as it should, though this track (as well as most of the others) suffer from unfortunately self-conscious production, a problem which has reared its ugly head too often in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but most tracks are really good.","review":"I was never a big Ministry fan, but I like this album a lot. There a few standout tracks like Meg Lee Chin's \\"Scarecrow\\" and TRS-80's version of \\"Everday is Halloween\\". I also really like \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" but it is strange to see a cover of a cover. I wish someone covered \\"Work for Love\\" but overall it is a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Industrial fan takes Ministry too seriously from Midwest","review":"I don't know what the first review is all about. Once I saw the cover art making refrence to Ministrys first release/synth masterpiece \\"With Sympathy\\", I knew this was going to be worth a listen. Fortunately I was right. Meg Lee Chin does a very pastionate and dark version of Scarecrow. I love her voice! I never heard of TRS-80 and Here, but both of their covers are stuck in my head. Why doesn't Alain Jourgenson sing with a British accent anymore? Maybe we'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive","review":"I'd love to review the CD, but the order never made it to my home and I wound up with a refund.

Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute gem!","review":"This book is co-written by two of the founders of Improv in America, Del Close and Chana Halpern and a student of Del's Kim Johnson. I've just started improv over the last few months and this book has explained the basics in a deeper way than I have yet heard. Additionally, they accompany the explanations with short form games to help you and your group experience the meanings for yourself. Throughout, the book builds the improv basics into the expert level of the long form game The Harold. It is very simply written and easy to understand. It's only 150 pages, but packed with invaluable insight and experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much WANK!","review":"I found this book a waste of time. It was a real chore to get through as the authors spend half of the book blowing sunshine up Del Close's _______( fill in for yourself). The HAROLD is a form of improvisation for the self - centered. As I was reading its description I could ask myself only TWO questions: As a performer -why would I want to alienate my audience with my own self-indulgence? As an audience member - why would I want to watch something like this?. The authors discuss this improv form as though it is some sort of mystical, exclussive cult activity. No thanks. Keith Johnstone's IMPRO and IMPRO FOR STORY TELLERS are the only way to go if you are interested in improvisation that your audience will remember long after they've left the theatre. If you are more interested in the inner workings of your own mind - stay home and do a Harold with your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harold?","review":"I have studied improvistation for over a year now and I have to say that the Harold is one of the most difficult to perform let alone learn. Moreover, the Harold is no good if it is performed by less experienced improvisors. The Harold is one of the more boring types of improv experiences that I have ever encountered. I have heard it best described as \\"An opening, three sets of scenes, a group scene, another three sets of scenes, another group scene, and finally the round up three scenes where the first laugh happens.\\" How true this statement is. This book is the manual on performing this utmost boring improv form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"If you think \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\" is funny, and that's the kind of comedy you want to do, then this might help. I personally don't care for that. I was just looking for something to help me generate ideas on how to think on my feet as a public speaker. I didn't really find anything useful in this book for neither public speaking nor stand up. This only seems to be geared toward group comedy.I don't know what all the good reviews are about."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 pages of insight; much much more of self-promotion","review":"From start to finish, the overall message of this book is \\"Del Close was a god, Charna Halpern is his one true disciple, and without them, the careers of countless comedic geniuses might never have come about.\\" I have never felt so strongly about a book to comment on it on Amazon before, but the name-dropping and self-congratulating in this book is astounding.The shame of it all is that there are a few pages of insight into how \\"connections\\" make for some of the best humor, but these are lost in the noise. If you're looking to learn more about improv, comedy and/or human nature, Impro by Keith Johnstone is a far better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bitter book","review":"This book is so bitter. It repremands a learning improvisor on the very thing they should be trying, experimentation. It trys to enforce it's view of an artform that is often open to interpretation. I used to love this book until I realized it's just another name dropping text trying to masqerade as an authority on improv. I recommend trying Mick Napier's Improvise or Keith Johnstone's Impro instead. They realize that there is very little room for the term 'don't' in improvosation. Truth in Comedy is just another example of the politic laden ImprovOlympic machine that makes Charna Halpern money and doesn't pass on any of the profit to the performers working for her. To buy this book is to contribute to a corrupt system. Don't get suckered in like myself and many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know Who??","review":"I think this book is a complete waste of time and merely serves as a lure to get people to take classes at the Improv Olympic theater in Chicago. It is incoherent and all it suffices to do is drop names the entire time. Wow, so famous people studied at IO then we all should. A complete ego stroke for owner Charna Halpern, but nothing new is taught here. Do yourself a favor, save the money on the book and actually go take classes. This is paperback trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Content, same useless comments repeated","review":"Good idea, terrible book.

If there is a worse book, I just hope noone publishes it or buys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good place to Start","review":"This is not a difficult book to read and gives a fair list of new games that I had never played before. A lot of the games would be quite useful in developing certain skills like physicality etc, but the book doesn't touch on some of the bigger concepts in Impro like Status. Also there is a lot of name dropping and patting on the back, which might add a slight authority to the book, but ultimately doesn't really teach you anything. Still, I got a bit out of it, so it is worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible binding!","review":"I loved this book, but the binding literally fell apart after a day.

We were assigned to read the first two sections last Monday night and before the next class me and my classmates found that everybody didn't respond to the text well.We felt it was trying to push rules and creeds on us, almost like joining a frat. We complained to the teacher and he finally admitted that he didn't even read the book before assigning it and that he, upon reading the first few chapters with us, discovered how crappy the book was.We may all try and get refunds.

It's not going to make you great overnight, but you will catch mistakes and avoid breaking your scene. Most valuable suggestion is to find the \\"game\\" in a scene, and play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It depends what you're looking for","review":"While I read this book it became clear to me that all any improvisation text can really off offer is advice. Halpern has a lot of excellent advice to share about improvisation that would be found most useful to novice and intermediate improv artists. And she very successfully pads her advice in funny examples and anecdotes to create a humorous and entertaining book.Although the book is funny and even inspiring at times, it won't help you improve at the hardest part of improv: thinking on your feet. The good news is that anyone can become quicker on their feet with a bit of practice. So if you're looking for a good introduction to the basic practices of improvisation, this book is what you're looking for. But don't buy it expecting it turn you into an improv genius overnight. Overall, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bible for a new group...","review":"These 160 pages are a great foundation for forming a comedy group.

If you want a cheap product this is for you but if you want reliability I would never consider them again. They did not even offer to inspect the battery at fault to correct the problem.

I read this book in one sitting and thoroughly enjoyed it! I put it in my classroom and it has already been a hit among both 7th and 8th grade girls. Those who think this sort of mean behavior doesn't really happen to girls at this age are mistaken. But also, the author offers the reader an insight into why Massie (the leader of the clique) acts the way she does. The book is funny, as well as frustrating and touching. The characters could stand to be a little more fleshed out, but maybe that will happen in the sequel, which I will definitely purchase for my classroom. I recommend this book to girls in grades 5-8."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"ick! don't ever buy them! they're a waste of money and your precious time! i hate them! HATE them!

I found myself laughing almost all the way through it, not becuase it was funny, but because it was so very, very pathetic. Every single character annoyed me, the plot annoyed me, heck, I'll just go right ahead and say the whole entire book annoyed me. It was an unrealistic look at middle school cliques. The characters were weak and had no personality, they were all the same annoying person to me. It makes me wonder what the authors middle school life was like, because mine was and is worlds apart from what is portrayed in this awful book. Don't buy this book, don't read this book, if you want a good teen novel then go look at some of Sarah Dessen's works, or someone else who is actually better at writing than chatspeak."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG. What crap!","review":"Normally I like almost every book I read. This is true with very little exceptions. Maybe I just don't get it or maybe this isn't the style for me but after reading this book, I seriously felt a little bit dumber. This is a book about a bunch of stuck up brats who's insignifigant little problems somehow claim the attention of everyone around them. Maybe I'm wrong and you'll like this Mean Girlsesque book. It appears you certainly wouldn't be alone but frankly it insulted my intelligance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a Great Series","review":"This book is a great start for a great series of books! When Claire and her dorky family moves in to Massies guesthouse, they are keeping Massie from hanging out with her friends. Massie and Claire both know that Claire will never be part of Massies infamous \\"Pretty Commitee\\" but that doesn't mean Massie will stop making it more clear or that Claire will stop trying. Massie, Alicia, Kristen and Dylan do all they can to make Claires life miserable, and their doing a pretty good job. Watch Claire strugle to be up to Massies standards at Westchesters best all-girls private school, Octavian Country Day (OCD) in this great book by Lisi Harrison. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation Gossip Girl at its worst...","review":"'The Clique' is an imitation 'Gossip Girl'-type book poorly done. I suppose it is understandable if you are within the age range of ten to twelve and you enjoyed it. Why write a book targeted towards such a small group? First of all, there is not as much you can write about, because, face it, what can twelve/thirteen-year-olds do that can provide an incredibly interesting plot? It isn't that appealing to read about kids. I guess I could recommend this to anyone that fits in the previously stated age group, but any older...don't pick up this book, it will leave you extremely disappointed and pissed off (if you spent money to actually buy it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, who wants to read about 7th Grade?","review":"I'm sorry to the author, but this was just a disappointing book. First of all, after I picked this book up to read, I found out that it was about seventh graders. But who wants to be reminded of that time of life? It's terrible, and not fun to read about. The characters are also unpleasant and flat, not at all real or believable. Seventh graders being that mean and spending that much on clothes? I suppose it happens, but who wants to read about it? Poorly written about a bad subject choice, this book is not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"the clique 1","review":"claire lyons is just anormal girl living in orlando, but when she moves to massoe blocks guesthouse , she looks likea totall fashion nobody.massie and claire are total enemies, now you wait to see what happens next..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clique","review":"The clique is a very good book to read.

I am a fifteen year old girl, so I am in the age group for this book, and I was appalled at some of the content. There was some mild foul language in it, the girls have all the wrong kind of morals, and the plot is completely ludicrous! I cannot believe that parents let their daughters read this! It teaches girls that the only way to be accepted is to wear designer clothes and be promiscuous with much older boys at TWELVE YEARS OLD! I go to a private school, am a cheerleader, have an older boyfriend, and considers myself pretty popular...and I do not partake in any of the activities that these girls do. It is a pile of crap and I am so ashamed for even reading it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"Unfortunately these books celebrate the worst in our socieity. Consumerism and shallowness run rampant. The characters in these books have party planners and limos; they lose their Gucci wallets when they switch from their Prada bag to their Vitton bag. They believe they have absolute authority to judge others. I could accept these books if the characters would experience some type of growth or epiphany at the conclusion, but they just go on to spread more hate and discontent. These books condone and encourage in worst in our society. The author clearly cares only for increasing her balance sheet and not at all for her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Trash","review":"I thought that this book was the most unoriginal garbage I have likely ever read in my life. The characters are ridiculous, spiteful and shallow, and nobody could possibly sympathize with them, or relate to them on any account. The plot is weak and cliched. The most horrible part about this book is that the main characters are so totally unlikeable. Also nobody in the actual book even likes each other. They are rich and spoiled and the characters turn on each other constantly . All the characters in this book are like sheep , following their spoiled leader. And it turns out that the only character that is even remotely decent or likable(Claire), is such a weak person that she follows Massie even when she knows that Massie is cheating or being nasty or absolutely unfair ( which she often does).This is a ridiculous book and encourages people in a round-about fashion to be nasty.I would advise anyone about to read this book, not to. It's truly a horrible book and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! So Awesome!","review":"I thought this book was great! I'm in 7th grade too.

I read a 1 star review that said, \\"What 7th grade girl buys designer clothes or hand bags.\\" Umm a lot of people do.

You guys are under the book #1(the first book of the series) and i highly disagree. Lisi Harrison probably recognizes there are some girls that are like Massie,Dylan, Alcicia, Kirsten and Claire.So shut up already. These books actually show how the teen mind works. Alot of us are cruel to eachother and some( low percentage) is not. These books are very realistic to girls for young adults reading. Besides, the books are hot. i like this book and i think all of them were very good. The girls are just growing up. In each book, I remember when I was in middle school and I did the same things these girls did. Personally, I think Massie's character is funny. Even though, she is sometimes mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical << Teenage Review","review":"This is a very stereotypical book. As a teenager I can \\"see\\" the cliques in school. However, they aren't like they are described in this book. Everyone is NOT focused on how to get into one of the cliques. This is unrealistic. In the book, girls received \\"gossip points\\" for the \\"best\\" gossip. Never in my life have I heard someone talk about getting gossip points in school. Don't bother wasting your time on this book. It isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGHH","review":"When first hearing about this bbook i was excited, but then after ordering it, to my disapointment it was horrible! it seems as though the author is trying to write a book that in some ways are like gossip girl, alist etc etc but failed.

Those clever lines that Massie said made my bf crack up!!!! I loved the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?????","review":"This has got to be one of the dumbest books ever. It's about these rich, mean, spoiled, stupid kids and how their entire pathetic lives are consumed by gossip. BORING. Reading it is torture: it feels like all your brain cells are dying. The characters are all very 'simple-minded'. For example, they love to lie and say that so-and-so's booger fell out. (They do that a lot in this book.)In the book, everyone literally worships the nasty, cruel popular girls who love talking about boogers. No one with half a brain in real life would ever look up to anyone like that. Spare your mind and avoid this book! If you love catty drama, go out and create your own, because reading about other people's boring 'drama' is just too desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned Father Review - NOT appropriate for Teen Girls","review":"This book promotes mean actions against other children and some are definitely inappropriate. I've read some of the book. It said who was in and who was out. It said mothers were in and fathers were out. Since young ladies (teen girls) need good male role models as well as good female role models, this book possesses the possibility to lead your daughter to disrespect her parents, but also goes against almost all the things that I have instilled into my daughters dealing with respect and how to treat others. This is Definitely NOT a good message for such impressionable little girls. I feel that some kids are MORE mature than the judgemental brats in this book. They see this stuff at school and it's already hard enough to get them to make good decisions, why would I want them to read a book like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ehmahgod!!!! this is so stupid","review":"seriously!!! this is so unrealistic. i mean, 12 yr olds w/ designer clothes. and like, their biggest problems are their \\"jimmy choo heels getting stuck in massie's lawn.\\" oh big deal. then just pull them out. duh.and like, what kind of name is massie? who would name their kid massie? eeeuww. or a girl named dylan. stupid stupid stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"the clique","review":"Follow Massie, Alicia, Dylan, and Kristin, four girls from Westchester, NY, and Claire, a girl from florida, through their fights and gossip.

Massie and Claire have two completely different personalities. Claire is sweet, loving person and Massie, on the other hand, well she always brags and is really mean. Throughout the book Massie and her friends are always doing mean pranks on Claire. But Claire is always trying to find a way to get them back. Overall what happens in the book and in my life there are many smilarities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I really liked this book because it was interesting, fresh and entertaining. It didn't make the 'un-popular' girl vanquish over the in-crowd in the end and somehow make the school a happier place through the forces of good and rainbows and smiles and stuff, it just told the story. While the story wasn't realistic, and the characters were all glossed over, they all stayed in-character and their actions didn't leave you going 'um, whatever.' it just left you wanting to go get the next book. because, although it's unrealistic and similar to a clothing ad (shiny, smooth and enviable) it didn't try to make up for it with a cheesey ending or toned-down clothes. i could vividly picture the whole world they lived in and the author seemed to know what her characters were about, which is more than i can say for most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I have no words for this this book.

If you didnt like this book, you need to stop being so pessimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Lisi Harrison doesn't realize most people can't afford Juicy Couture, Prada, COach, Ralph Lauren, etc., etc. She's drilling into tweens/teens that you REALLY need to act bratty and spoiled.If you throw a fit when you don't get a job and claim to sue, (Alicia!) then call your employer and LBR, you won't get anywhere in life. Being popular isn't everything. All they care about is their \\"alpha\\" status and they suck up to Massie all the time. It's all about how alpha you are, id you're an LBR, your weight and your comebacks.Kinda predicatble. It's like all other series. As the series goes on, Massie gets kinda better, but it's still not worthit."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit unrealistic","review":"hi. i'm actually from westchester, ny, and a friend of mine read the book, and when she told me about it, i had to write about it. first of all, not all of westchester is so wealthy, maybe 1/2-3/4 of it. second, some of us people from westchester, or maybe even most, are decent people. this book is kinda steriotyping westchester as a rich, snobby place, but only parts of it reflect the clique. this reminds me of the o.c.- a basically unrealistic steriotype."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clique","review":"Massie who is rich, pretty, and popular, has a girl named Claire who is not so rich, pretty, or popular, is moving in with her.

Even though it was really unrealistic(the girls were extremely mean and stuck up) It was really interesting. As I was reading my heart filled with hatred for Massie and her crew, and I felt bad for Claire because she had to live with such a stuck up girl. It was fun traveling into a mean girls mind, so I could bewary of the trick they use on others.

The author definitely has a way of pulling you in with engaging dialogue and funny acronyms. However, books like these are part of the problem of bullying, not the solution. It perpetuates the \\"mean girl\\" behavior and excessive materialism. Unfortunately, the book does not reflect it's readers in personality or even socio-economic status. Not everyone can afford, or even wants to, a Louis Vuitton bag or Kate Spade purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great middle school drama!","review":"Speaking as a 13 year old girl, i can say that Lisi Harrison is one of us, or at least thinks like us! She captures every aspect of a middle school girl's life from designer clothes to boys to the race to be popular. The \\"geek\\" Claire really takes a stand when she is forced to live in Massie Block's (the most popular girl at OCD) guest house. Just goes to show that any clique can't stand strong forever! A must read for any preteen or teen girl!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clique is Great","review":"Clique is really good. It's kind of like Mean Girls in a way, but of course different.

I do know ;however, if your 13 year old is as impressionable as mine apparently is, give this series a wide berth. By the fourth book, her clothes were not good enough, her makeup was not expensive enough, and her shoes were lame. These things were all fine before reading these books. If Ms. Harrison is shilling for some teen fashion mag by authoring these books, she is certainly doing her job. My daughter also asked me for an $800 bag!(to which I replied \\"HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!) I informed her that her $35 Roxy purse could hold just as many lip glosses and love notes as could a Louis Vuitton. If you have a daughter who insists on reading these, make sure she is grounded in reality, I've obviously missed the mark in thinking that my own child was above such pettiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was the worst book i ever read","review":"this book is all about bad values,popularity,and how mean girls can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry!","review":"Sorry. i think this book is for people who are mean gossips who enjoy hurting people and backstabbing.

No matter how rich you are, chances are this would not be a possiblility, especially with the way Massie's mother was portrayed. It is completely cliche', with the whole \\"wanting to be with the 'in crowd'\\" thing. Naturally this is a common plot for books written for teens to follow, but this one does not follow that plot well. If you want a good read, read Gossip Girls, as this book is probably more fitting for 10 year olds.

They also learn to fill good about reading, they all learn to read and perents are happy there reading and enjoying it. As well the kids will get more into reading. Not all kids will like to read and not want to try, but if you can show them how fun it can be then most kids will love or not realy love but be ok with reading books.

Claire doesn't really fit in but she tries to fit in with another crowd. I loved everything about the book except for one thing, which is in the beginning of the book that there is a cuss word. There is only one question that I am left with. Do they really have schools that are like the one in the book? I can relate this book to my real life and I know people who are like Claire as well as people who are like Massie.

New girl at school sees popular crowd. Girl keeps trying to get into popular crowd. Girl succeeds, and eventually takes over group. Hmmm-where have we seen this before? The characters have close to no unique personalities, and are stereotypical. The clique girls only care about their status money, and making Claire miserable, but Claire still wants to be with them. The writing was so-so in the introduction, but gradually got worse, and by the middle of the book, I was so annoyed with the writing style that I eventually had to stop. People, this book only sells superficial values- for example, the only way you can become popular is through your looks and fashion sense- and only promotes brattiness, stupidity, and selfishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you want your kids reading....be careful","review":"My 10 year old tore through the first 4 books in this series (borrowed from friends) before I realized what was happening.

When I first saw it on the shelf, I had absolutely no attraction to it...snotty junior high girls didn't appeal to me. But when I read a paragraph or two, I was hooked. I really enjoy the way Lisi writes. It was as if I was experiencing the story myself. I could feel the leather seats in the Range Rover as I sat there right with the girls. I also liked her characters. I could so relate to Layne. She grossed people out eating her oatmeal. In 7th grade, I grossed people out eating my raw green peppers. I wish the ending could have been stronger. I liked what led up to the ending, but the actual ending felt a little weak.

There are very few schools in the US with a Starbucks inside it, and the girls are VERY cruel to the girl that moves to Massie's mansion. I don't know many girls that would leave someone out like they do because they don't own a Gucci shirt or a bottle of Chanel fragrance. I don't think it's a good influence on the age girls it's written for, as it could give them the idea that they have to own designer outfits, accessories, and cosmetics in order to be able to fit in, or worse, even treat other people wrong because they don't own this stuff.

See the first page of \\"It's Not Easy to Be Mean\\",(What does that title tell you)? LBR means, Loser Beyond Repair.These books are mean spirited, snobbish, name dropping, and petty, and if there is any type of lesson to be learned, (at least a valuable one), I could not find it.

This book just increases the dread within everyone to go to middle school. I can't wait. Trust me, this book is nothing but a moral decimator and just makes you feel as if you have nothing, reading about girls who buy a $700 skirt.

The only song I really liked off the CD was The Kids Aren't Alright. Then, a few months ago, I heard the new single from the Offsprings upcoming CD-Original Prankster. I thought that we were going to get another pop infested Americana Album. I couldn't have been more wrong. \\"Conspirace of One\\" is AMAZING. Its the best Offspring album since \\"Smash\\".

In the meantime, get the only good Offspring album, Milo Goes to College.

I can live with bands with no talent if they sound good - but this band sounds horrible. How did they ever get a record deal???? I would rather listen to garbage like Barry Manilow or N'sync. I hope the offspring goes down in an airplane crash along with marilyn manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straying from the Formula","review":"I don't understand what the big commotion is with Offspring's new album. I am very disappointed with their newest offering. The band is not the same Offspring we have all enjoyed in the glory days of Smash, Ixnay, or even the half-decent Americana. If you're a die-hard Offspring fan, you might be thrilled at their new offering, but if prefer Offspring's earlier works over Americana, don't pick up Conspiracy of One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ixnay on the Hombre-2","review":"moving away from Americana and back to the days of Ixnaysome of the songs sound very familiar. Vultures is very similar to Dirty Magic, Original Prankster is uncannily like Pretty Fly, and One Fine Day resembles Don't Pick it Up.although not as good as the raw sound of S/T, Ignition, or even Smash, this is stil a brilliant album from the Offspring. Ranging from punks hard outer edge to its slightly softer center, with such songs as Million Miles Away, One Fine Day and Living in Chaos.Original Prankster was definately not the best one to release, although i suppose it was the most 'radio friendly'. another 'Pretty Fly' in a way.a brilliant album, but definately not the best. but since they have nothing left to prove, what with all their hits, this is a fun album and i recommend it to anyone who loved Ixnay."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The...","review":"Geez! ever heard the word ripoff? Obviosly these guys are getting weaker every album. This thing should be 2-3 bucks. It's terrible! theirs only a few songs that are good, and 2 are bonus tracks I got from Best buy! It's okay, i don't think i could live without it, but it is really weak. you can hear the age in their voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I used to like The Offspring, I liked all the stuff they did before Ixnay on the Hombre. But their newfound sound, mixing latino rythms into their punk-sound just didn't do it for me. I am all for artistic growth and evolution...but damn' I really wish they would have stuck with what they did best, playing catchy punk-rock music. One can only hope they will return to their old sound, although it is doubtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"ThEY'vE doNe WaY BEttER!","review":"The offspring have done way better. \\"Smash\\" considered their best album (also of my opinion), \\"Ignition\\" , Their self-titled, \\"Americana\\", and \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" are all way better than this one. Once they left Epitaph and signed with sony i think they pretty much went downhill from their. I still enjoy some of their new stuff but my heart is with their older stuff with their true punk sound. Offspring is still my favorite band but i just don't listen to this album anymore. when their first album came out i don't even think i was born yet, I'm only 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offspring Rocks","review":"I listened to this CD at my friends house and it is awsome.

Ignore all the entry's that say that the offspring sold out. The Offspring have definently still got it. Actually when the Offspring are punk, fans still sour out on them. The fans excuse for this album:Want you bad. But that is one song. it may be a bit emo but it's one song and one song does not make an album. My favorite's off this song is Vultres, Come out swinging,One finee day and special Delivery. Give this cd a chance and don't listen to those people who try tosay that they are not punk"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Offspring at its finest","review":"Finally the Offspring has created an album with more than one good song. Like Americana's only good track is Pretty fly(for a white guy). I really like this c.d's music quality and punk views. The album cover is art and by far the best cover, it would make a great shirt that I would invest in. The track I want you bad is my favorite and original prankster is cool. In fact why go through all the songs that I like since all of them are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets old fast.","review":"The offspring, unfortunately, dissapointed me. I'm warning you, it gets old pretty quickly. What I've noticed for most rock bands is the fans always put the song with the worst lyrics on the radio. Yes, 'Original Prankster' was good, but I think the best were 'Conspiracy of One' and 'Living in Chaos'. The calmest song on the CD is Denial, Revisited, which I wasn't too crazy about. Overall, the Offspring did well. I liked their last album better, though.Like I said before, it gets old fast, I had it for a week and already knew it by heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"This album isn't as good as smash or ixany but is probably better than ignition.I'd say its about on a par with Americana it still rocks though.Dammit I changed again,CO1 I want you bad and one fine dayare the best tracks on the cd to my reckoning.One fine day rocked live at the M.E.N but anyways its a good album if you like the album buy it.If your a sad pop poser who thinks the offspring are the hardest punk gets, still buy it.If your a... actually ifyour anyone buy it, its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Offspring. You'll love this CD","review":"The Offspring are the best punk band ever! Especially the fact that they don't change there style like Green Day did. Don't get me wrong. I love Warning.

This installment gives a little more information into the Faerie side of magic in the Dresden Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story...but predictable outcome.","review":"I enjoyed Summer Knight and recommend it to any fan of the Dresden Files (by Jim Butcher). I suggest that you read these books in order so as not to spoil the endings for yourself by fore-knowledge of later outcomes. Still, having read most of the Dresden series, I often learn things about the characters that I missed in previous stories and am surprised and delighted by this fact.As I am not one to write spoilers in reviews, enjoy reading this book for yourself. It is fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome tale","review":"This is another great story!

Exciting ride with hummor and characters you can't wait to meet over and over. The tongue in cheek references are too cool. Harry Dresden is one of my favorite characters. I am surprised that someone has't put a tongue binding spell on him, but he would probably explode."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the Dresden Files series, truly a classic!","review":"I really loved this book, the third in the series I think, I've read so many of this series. While I really love them all, this one stands out as a really strong book.One of my all time favorite fiction series.Read 'em all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book in the series...","review":"Butcher's Dresden books just keep getting better. I noticed with this one that his writing style seems to have matured a bit...it had more of a procedural, crime novel feel to it - something I'm used to reading from the likes of Michael Connelly and such. And I mean this in a good way. Love Dresden, and his antics. Butcher throws in enough curveballs here to keep things interesting and keep me turning the page. I can't complain about that! Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Its one of the best in the whole series, tied with Small Favors and Cold Days, all of which deal with faeries. I liked it enough to buy it on both Kindle and in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT read!","review":"I fell into this book series by accident. But once I read the first book, I was totally hooked by this great hero (?) and his motley cast of characters. SUMMER KNIGHTS was no different than the first 3 books. I love Harry Dresden. He is not a genius, hia magic doesn't always work quite the way it should, but he is a man that cares deeply about protecting his fellow human beings from things they don't always believe exsist. In this book, Harry has to deal with things that he doesn't quite believe in. It's done with style and humor that is irresistable. It's a definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Summer Knight\\" by Jim Butcher","review":"This is my favorite so far of Mr. Butcher's 'Dresden Files' series. It has plenty of humor and nonstop action. I especially enjoyed the emphasize on the two faerie courts of Winter and Summer, and their battles for supremacy. Harry Dresden has the task of restoring the balance between the two courts before it destroys the balance in our world. This is already starting to happen on Earth, with things like raining toads. Highly recommended for pure fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun & Fast Read","review":"This was another good installment of the Dresden Files. It's fast paced, and has really good characterization. Harry Dresden has some flaws, but as I reader I always get the sense that he's trying to improve himself and that's one of the reasons why I think he's likeable.One thing I liked about it in particular was how some of the side characters in the previous novels played a more prominent role in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butcher does it again!","review":"Jim Butcher does it again with another great book. This book was a page turner from the first page to the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun reading","review":"Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series are well done and enjoyable reading. Make sure you read them in order though. Harry Dresden continues to develop as the series continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's on with the fairies!","review":"I found book four of the Dresden Files the best so far. It was explosive and had some pretty cool plot lines with things like old friends coming back into a storyline and people thought to be dead or trusted, proving to not be so. The series just gets better with each bookAlso, I think there may have been a few typos, but less so than previous books. There was also a new look and different paper quality to the series starting with book four. Hopefully that means less errors that were missed by editors previously.I can't get enough of this series and look forward to reading book five next. Definitely a 5/5 book.Priscilla"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairie Fight","review":"Butcher continues his Dresden Files with another breathless installment that begins bad (bad for Harry, good for us) and the tension rarely slackens.Harry's caught in the middle in a war between vampires, wizards, and fairies that may be all his fault ... but can he stop it from getting even more out-of-hand than it already is?If you've read the others, you know what you're in for. This is somewhat less tense, strangely, than Book 3 (other than the wonderful trial sequence at the beginning) but still a darkly comic thrill-ride of a book. Not the world's greatest literature, but unputdownable, and that's fine by me.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a few too many Fairies, Fae, Silde, Werewolves and Wizards to keep up with","review":"Butcher continues this series in typical frenetic style, throwing Dresden amongst the Winter and Summer faery Courts, apparently tasked with the job of finding the Summer Knight (I think)Unfortunately with a few too many sub, mini, side, and overarching plots it all becomes a little too much. I couldn't even tell you who the big bad guy was.Still this is Butcher's style, so if you like it you do, if you don't two stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel","review":"Summer Knight is by far the best novel of the Dresden Files. Not only does it continue the overall plot of the series, but it has a fascinating and interesting plot within the novel. The war between the two fairy realms is interesting. I think this is the most creative work I have read by Jim Butcher. Gone are the hard to believe, out of nowhere scenarios. In this novel the actions are believable within the concepts of the novel. Bravo! I really enjoyed this novel. If you are a fan of the first three novels then I encourage you to read Summer Knight.There has been a murder and a transfer of power is at hand. Whether the Winter or Summer fairies emerge victorious will determine if there is endless winter or endless summer on earth. It is my favorite novel of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie IS AMAZING!","review":"Carrie's voice is so beautiful and it touches my soul, I feel really inspired by these two singers because they aren't the Hilary Duff type.

I've given two away as presents and have heard good feedback on them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY NOT FOR ME","review":"Given his age at the time, Michael's voice is mature beyond his years. Alas this is not matched by Carrie. Carrie sounds like someone has their hands around her throat restricting her. She is also singing partly through her nose - nasal sounds.

I first played the original German version. So when I play I still use the German names which confuses people. The bean game is great. The pictures are cute, it's easy and fun. The only hard part is younger players (or people like my mom) have a hard time understanding the way a player's turn progresses. It's a little tricky because you aren't allowed to change the order of the cards in your hand and you are only allowed to plant beans from the FRONT of your hand, etc. But once you get the hang of it, it's totally easy. This is a game that you'll never get sick of, and if you do, you'll come back to it after time. It's one of those things, it's so simple you don't know why it's so fun but you just can't stop playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOHNANZA - - A REAL BONANZA OF FUN","review":"It takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game, but once learned, it is a lot of fun. A good game for four players, and a great game for six players. It generates lots of lively action, with the bidding for the cards.We played this game on a cruise with four strangers. They were no longer strangers, after the game. Everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it. That's how we got it. Bought the game after playing with family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent card game","review":"Hi, this is really an excellent card game.The instructions are easy to explain but the game dynamics are great. A game round can be between 30 and 60 minutes depending of the number and kind of players, but it's never boring.One thing I love about this game is that it can be played between 2 and 7 people and it's always fun and interesting.The strategy on the game is very simple, not a brain teaser, but as I said, the game is very interesting and never bored.A must have for collectors and for anyone who wants a simple, funny but interesting board game."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun game","review":"This is a fun card game of strategy.

It's not too hard too learn. Along with being fun, it can also be educational as it flexes your mind while trying to sell the most beans and get the most coins. Overall wonderful game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with more people, but even with three it's still pretty fun","review":"I have a hard time convincing others to play this game, which is why I usually seem to play three-handed.The trouble with a three person game is that you don't have enough competition. Less competition, and the trading is less cut-throat and intense. So if you think you'll rarely have four or more people to play, it might not be worth it.Incidentally - don't think of it as a \\"bean farmer\\" game. Think of it, more honestly, as a ruthless and cut-throat game of trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate details on bean cards","review":"First, let me say I love this game and it came in perfect condition. With that said, when I played it with a group of adults I never actually paid attention to what the beans were doing on the cards. After buying this game for a friend with younger children, I noticed that some of the beans are smoking, drinking, have guns, and are throwing up. Even though it indicates the game is for 10 years and older, I know my friend doesn't drink/smoke, etc. and wonder how appropriate the cards are for children that DO notice details like that. The whole reason for buying this particular game is so that my friends could play it with their older children (8 year and up). If it weren't for the inappropriate graphics on the card, it would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"Fun game to play, though I wish the instructions were easier to understand, since they change depending on the amount of players"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beantastic!!","review":"Our family loves the Bean game, as we call it.

One just shouldn't take beans too seriously, so this game is best played in a suitably wacky mood - the card graphics help with a laugh or two. I suspect that the game could be played in cut-throat mode, but we found that all benefited when all cooperated - a message one just doesn't find very often these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cutting wires and small nails/screws.","review":"Klein makes great handtools for homeowners or tradesman, after using these for a couple months I finally tried to cut one too many nails and the tip broke off.After being denied warranty exchange by two of the local electrical supply houses in town I called Klein support.

Boy was i worng to do that. Firstly the production on this cd is not as good as it should be considering the neptunes skills as producers. Secondly pharrell should not sing. Im sorry but he is not a good singer, and on top of that he tries to sing in a high voice that just ruins every song he sings on. He is a great producer and should stick with that. I mean at least chad actually has musical talent, he can play the hell out of the guitar, and drums. So pelase pharrell stop singing. The only song on this cd that is good is the song by kelis and nas. I would save your money and not by this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, wack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Don't consider buying this CD. Neptunes are the most overated musicians right now!! They have good artist on this record, but no good songs. All their beats are pretty good but way to similar. You want real music listen to Dr.Dre and his crew at Aftermath, not this new weak lyrics and soft beats people like these days.

This CD is not even worth downloading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Neptunes are \\"frontin'\\"","review":"I don't like the Neptunes, because they are ruining hip hop. Snoop Dogg is known for his gangsta image, and it's being ruined thanks to Pharell's poor production skills. The Neptunes are making beats that sound like pop music. If I wanted pop music, I'd listen to Britney Spears or Clay Aiken. Pharell will never amount to what Dre and Timbaland are. Pharell and his Neptune buddies need to stop making beats.

One bad track after another with no end in sight. The first few tracks are \\"listenable\\" so to speak, but then it just gets sooooooo bad. The tracks do not flow together. I found myself skipping to the next track hoping that maybe I would strike gold. Never happened. Like I said, Frontin' is cool. That's the only good song on this CD.

Period.Busta Ryhmes- Wack beat, wack rhyme.Fam-Lay - Hot, he is coming into his own.Clipe - Hot, new group...good effort.Kelis and Nas - Come on, that song is older than dirt. This is a filler track, but cool song. Iw ould expect better, new material from the Neptunes.The rest, well...draw your own conclusion, I would rather download this album or burn it that buy it.

Although it has one track (Loser)by N.E.R.D., but it isn't quite to par as to their previous release \\"In Search Of..\\". This seems to be more of a compilation CD for their up-coming projects in the future. You can still find those spacey synths and hard drums in their solid beats, but it's the same redundant sound that they seem to live off of. Not particularly their best work. This is more for those pop heads looking for the basic mainstream sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily i listened to songs before i decided to buy this","review":"a couple days before the cd came out i was able to listen to the whole thing on aol instant messanger. the beats on this cd are okay even thought they should be amazing because its the neptunes. the lyrics on this cd are pretty horrible because the artists are all horrible except snoop dogg. the clipse are on it a lot and suprisingly there lyrics weren't bad i guess they stepped it up a lil bit. anyway theres no really good song but some okay ones so don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neptunes Rule","review":"It seems like people writing reviews have different expectations from the Neptunes than what the Neptunes are all about. The Neptunes have been influenced by all types of music and this album is an excellent production effort. Differing music types arise and the Neptunes prove that they can master production of not only hip-hop, but also rock, r&b, and pop. While the Neptunes often use the same sounds, it is this sound that makes people like them so much. Without the metallic beats and unusual sounds that are unique to the Neptunes characterize this dominating production team. This album is a compilation, dont expect there to be a theme or the songs to match, because they don't. If you like the Neptunes, buy the CD. If you're expecting all hip-hop tracks and beats, then you'll probably not enjoy the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing Compilation For Neptunes Fans","review":"I just got this album today expecting some of the best production from the Neptunes and feel cheated. There is nothing groundbreaking on this album. Basically 7/10 of this album is filler with some particularly sub par production from the 'tunes. The lead singles \\"Frontin'\\" featuring Jay-Z and \\"Light Your Ass On Fire\\" by Busta Rhymes are the best songs on the album. Some tracks such as \\"Blaze of Glory\\" and \\"F**k n' Spend\\" are just plain awful. Overall the reason why I gave this CD only 2 stars is because it is a huge disappointment. Preview a few MP3s from this CD before you buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"phat beats","review":"this cd is good as hell. some of my favorite rappers are in this. snoop, ludacris, clipse, nas, that's all i can think of at this momet. i have 3 12\\" subs in my car and the beats are crazy. the only bad thing is that there are like 3 normal songs and they just dont bump. overall its the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD OF 2003!!","review":"This cd is the best cd of the year nuff said. Each track is different from the other, so you cant really tell that they're all from the same producer, for example:Timbaland with 'THE JUMPOFF' and 'CRY ME A RIVER'. No offense, those are hot joints though. The Neptunes already got 4 singles out from this album-FRONTIN, HOT DAMN, ROCK N ROLL, LIGHT YA A** ON FIRE, and it just came out this week. The top rappers on here aren't at their best lyrically, but its all about the beats and the flow. It's mostly a party CD, so get it and have fun. By the way I also went to their cd signing at Tower Records the day it came out. :]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"the Neptunes have a true sense of Catchy Grooves&Hooks here&there but after a while it thins out&then you have been down this road before.\\"frontin\\" Cracked me up with Pharell Singing.I dug the Skeleton element of the Song.the Hook was cool.Musically they have some Moments but these Guests don't add nothing really.I think the Biggest Problem I have with the Neptunes is that they are Hot Shot Producers who are all about Sound&Less on Lyrics to Me.as long as the Beats&Grooves are cool they are safe but if they have to survive doing Words&Music then they will have to Clone off Someone to still maintain what they have build up thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"1989 - 1995: May the Golden Era of Hip Hop RIP!","review":"These two \\"producers\\" are one of the reasons most hip hop is junk these days.

Here's the verdict: they are GUILTY! Guilty for leaving me EXTREMELY disappointed. I can't wait to get my $20 back (if I can)! The only really good song on the album is \\"Frontin'\\". The rest are loaded with obscenities (particularly the \\"Light Yo A**! on Fire\\" song--was all that cursing and sex imagery necessary?!), tepid lyrics, and nerve-wracking beats. I was expecting much more; they failed to deliver. Nonetheless, Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams are extremly talented artists, and songs like \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Change Clothes\\" and \\"Excuse Me, Miss\\" made a fan out of me. I will afford them this one misstep, and am confident that on future efforts, they will live up to the name they have made for themselves. I truly hope they tap into the talent that was NOT displayed on this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating look at a true shaman","review":"I am very pleased to see the life and work of Don Agustin Rivas in print.

Having worked with Don Agustin as a teacher for several years and heard many of the stories, it is good to see that the book remains true to them and captures the heart of Don Agustin's adventures. The book focuses on Don Agustin's personal challenges and accomplishments, but also contains many teachings and wisdom from one who has sacrificed much to be of service to the people and to the Earth.

Endearing frankness ... from multiple sexual adventures to cannibalism ... combine with a fearsome determination to excel in his shamanic world, years of undergoing plant diets (ayahuasca the principle plant medicine but there are many more discussed here) ... all make this man seem oddly trustworthy. The directness of style is nicely free of many literary conventions ... these are Don Agustin's most striking memories, told in a clear way, worked into a book by Jaya Bear. I enjoyed it as a fine adventure story, a great jungle yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's journey to magic, enlightenment, & healing","review":"Amazon Magic by Jaya Bear is the astonishing biography of Don Agustin Rivas Vasquez, an ayahuasquero, or shaman who is skilled in visionary and healing plant medicines.

I loved that old SNES game to death. I think I may have loved it a little TOO much, however, because I waited several days before actually entering my name to play it. Why?

As a result, his translations are long and cumbersome compared to the original text, and completely devoid of its beauty. If you want everything spelled out to you step-by-step, then this is the translation for you. But remember that the 'Tao Te Ching' starts off by warning the reader 'The Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao.' It is up to each person to find an understanding of the Tao in his/her heart.

It may also depend on your reaction to the author's assertions regarding the influence of the Hua Hu Ching text.As a translation, I can't recommend it. Like other \\"interpretations\\" of the same writer, it is difficult to figure out where Lao Tzu ends and Ni begins. There are clearer, more direct translators - David Hinton comes to mind - that do a better job of stepping aside and letting the original text have its say.As for the controversy regarding the Hua Hu Ching text, the author presents one version of its history; other sources present quite different versions. I found the text to be quite different in content and form - especially the later chapters - from what I understand to be Lao Tzu and am skeptical about the assertion that this it informed the formation of Mahayana Buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I bought this for my kids for Christmas a few years ago.

I, as an artist in ny, am ashamed to see that it takes so little to amuse the simple mind. His work is not about violence of creation, change, and revolution, but about corporate cheap tricks to bring in the herd of cash cows willing to submit to what a museum calls art for the sake of selling tickets to a side showIn his amateur attempt to create he has plagiarized the work of Fellini's satyricon. His use of the Guggenheim reflects these cheap tricks by the way he uses the spiral ramp with the vaseline flowing down it. An extremely arbitrary move, and a move that many amateurs make frequently when they don't know how to take an idea and transform it into a form.Ideas are a dime a dozen, but if the end results or form is as cheap as mattew barney's work is then the idea was not translated well. Simple garbage is the only way one can explain his work.

I find that most of these type albums give you the songs you were looking for but also tend to be loaded with more songs that are anything but the best of what the artist did. I had forgotten just how much The Rascals had done. This collection brought their music back powerfully. I was mainly looking for a collection with People Got to be Free on it and found it had been omitted from the redone TimePeace album which makes no sense. Add songs if you like but don't take songs off the original for a reissue. Looked at The Ultimate Rascals and found everything I wanted. Upon listening I also discovered many songs I didn't remember as being the Rascals even though I knew nearly every song on the CD.

My taste runs more to fast-paced murder mysteries. I like books I can read through quickly, and not have to linger over every word. Although I enjoyed seeing Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, I have never been that interested in the Robin Hood tale. So \\"The Archer King\\" was definitely not a book I expected to like. I read it only because two close friends raved about it so enthusiastically. To my great surprise, I LOVED this book! The writer is an exquisite story teller. The twists and turns of the plot kept me turning the pages. The main characters are drawn with complexity and depth. Lorele's writing style is so beautiful, I wanted to read every word. Although there was every reason for me not to like this book, \\"The Archer King\\" was one of the best and most enjoyable novels I've read in a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the archer king","review":"Touted as \\"Robin Hood from the pagan perspective\\", I find this book to be nothing to crow about. The \\"pagan perspective\\" is limited to dancing skyclad in one or two scenes, dreams about the horned god, and Robin using magic, not skill, to win any situation. The plot line is basically the same tales told by Howard Pyle and others plus a thought or two from \\"Prince of Thieves\\", with not much new material added. The characters are flat, with little to bind them together or give them energy. Maerin's religious introspective is stultifying after a while, and there is no spark between her and Robin. If you want paganism in this tale, stick to watching the series \\"Robin Hood\\" with Michael Praed as Robin. If you want better characterization in the written tale, check out Jennifer Roberson's \\"Lady of the Forest\\". Her storytelling is choppy, but her spin on the tale is interesting and her characters are better defined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product","review":"Bought this product for baking.

So after a month I gave it away to a friend who didn't care about the smell problem. One other issue is that it does not look very chic because the cover material is twill and it fits around the foam loosely (i.e. like a loose-fitting over-sized cushion cover).

If there was more \\"fuf\\" in the bag, it might have the support it indicates in the picture. On the upside, my toddler and pets love it. It appears I bought a 100 dollar pet bed and toddler toy rather than a comfortable chair.... lesson learned, I won't be buying another one of these I havent sat in first...

The unique board pieces and the use of the builder and pig makes the game even more fun than before. The ability to play with 6 people was a must for my family.

Arendt seems to start the story in the middle and assume too much background from her readers, a fault that grows only more irritating with the distance of time. Every straightforward discussion soon degenerates into a thicket of scholarly throat-clearing and asides. This is the sort of thing best handled by a clear-eyed journalist who starts the story at the beginning, introduces every strand properly, nails every discussion with plenty of concreta, and never abandons the reader. Properly told, it should get more interesting as it proceeds; with Arendt, it only gets more obscure and tiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil as the absence of ....","review":"In writing her book, \\"Thinking,\\" Arendt claims that it was Eichmann's absence of thought that underlay his evil deeds; and that her conclusion drew her to write the book (\\"Thinking\\").Her conclusion was wrong. It was the absence of feeling: the lack of feeling experience; the lack of awareness of feeling; and the lack of expression of it -- in all combinations.Despite Arendt's courageous reporting in \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem,\\" she demonstrates her own absence of thought - in drawing faulty conclusions, a sin of which we are all guilty from time to time, and one that is far less grievous than Eichmann's and those like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for a provoking analysis of morality","review":"I have to agree with the storm of criticism yourreviewer has received.

Do people ever really read the books they review? Anyway, this seems like dry mayerial but isn't. Eichmann seems like joe any guy who goes from mildly stupid underachiver and useless to a mass murderer who never fires a shot. How is this possible? Well, it seems that human nature and a group dynamic contribute to the banality of evil that killed so many.

I didn't use it right away with my first anchor piercing, and it took over 2 weeks for the redness and swelling to go down. I'm also using it to help heal a deep wound from having my first anchor piercing removed. The removal left me with a big crater below my collarbone and the H2Ocean is significantly speeding along the healing process. The hole was big enough that I contemplated getting stitches, but the skin is actually regenerating itself to close over the wound and it's happening quite rapidly. So, yeah... I'm pretty sure this stuff is magical. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for piercings","review":"I bought this when I got my nose pierced and have repurchased when I ran out.

My ear was fine with using H2ocean for about two months before it got infected. I was running low on the product anyways, so I reordered, but despite my best efforts to keep the piercing/area clean, my ear stayed infected for over a month. Despite warning against using alcohol on the area, I finally decided to just switch to using an alcohol-based toner solution that cleared up my infection within a week! H2ocean may be good initially, since the piercing is usually sensitive, but I wasn't really interested in spending $10 every two months to keep my piercing clean! The toner cost about $3 and will last much longer. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"A little disappointed.

My only gripe (if I can call it that), is if you have extremely sensitive skin, make sure to use this product along with jewelry that is titanium or niobium or else it won't heal AS WELL. This product does really well externally, BUT if you have jewelry that your body is rejecting, you'll end up taking the piercing out. Just to be safe, when I got my nipples pierced, I made my own mixture of dead sea salt and water, soaked a rag and kept them on my nips (cheaper route but the spray is more convenient)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This product worked absolutely amazing!

I got a free one with my piercing at the time, and kept buying more after that! Since then i've gotten 2 more piercings and it's worked wonders on all of them! Instead of using soap (which sometimes burns) this product is cleaner and easier to use whenever you need to. Its also good for cold sores, scrapes and burns!

And let me tell you, it did its job! I didn't want to mess around with heating distilled water and adding salt, like my piercer told me to, so I was looking for an easier pre-made solution. I've so far never had an infection or inflammation at all. This spray is super easy to use, I just spray a little on a cotton swab, and just clean around the stud before bed and in the morning, and then I'm done! Saltwater is a natural wound cleanser, so it only makes sense to bottle purified saltwater to clean piercing sites. If this stuff seems overpriced to you, remember that you only use one small spray every time you use it, so the big can of it will last you a really long time. Highly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite for ears...","review":"I got this to use while stretching my ears.

The POI was also lacking as one of the listing is Casinos, in Oklahoma we have around 90+, but only one was listed. Also the POI information was taken from third quarter 2006 information.

For a device that can't do it's basic function I give this a 1 star.More annoyingly though is the cheapness of MAgellan not to even include an AC adapter to charge the GPS at home, given that the first screen you get at bootup says how dangerous it is to program the GPS in your car while driving!!!!Customer service is awful, as anyone on this site can attest to.If anyone has a better suggestion for a GPS please respond.
