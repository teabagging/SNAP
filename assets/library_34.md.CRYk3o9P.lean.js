When many in the recording industry made a huge deal of the Natalie/Nat King Cole recording of \\"Unforgettable\\" in 1991, I, although happy it was successful,was not impressed.No, the record was great. The reason I wasn't impressed is for all the hoopla made over the record, the techinology used for it had been used 11 years earlier on this album.This album was built around Minnies' vocals recorded in 1978 with the great Leonard Caston. The instrumentation from those sessions was rerecorded, but Minnie's vocals were retained & paired with many guest artists. The result is new instrumentation and several duets w/Minnie created and released posthumously in 1980.What a beautiful tribute this work is to Minnie and her legacy. This album has only 7 songs(the perfect number), but it is well worth it. I will always have a place in my heart for this Perfect Angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I picked up three vials per 4HWW recommendations- honestly the AGG stack with Niacin and a good multi at night are giving me amazing sleep and great recovery after hard workouts.

I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is good with explosives","review":"During World War II, Polish solders fought throughout Europe. \\"Agent #1\\" (1972) is the story of a half-Russian/half-Polish man stationed in Greece on a special mission to monitor activities of Nazi and Italian forces and destroy any targets that could be a threat to the allies. Fluent at several languages, he is the perfect man for the job.Our hero, code named Agent #1, is good with explosives. We see him in action blowing up boats and always on the run from the Germans. Although he does not act alone on his missions, because he is so successful, he gets most of the credit for his groups exploits. The action and suspense builds as the film progresses.What makes this movie different from other World War II films is its Greek venue. Some of the scenes have ancient Greek structures in the background, giving them an eerie look. If you enjoy action/war movies, \\"Agent #1\\" is sure to entertain you and provide a story that is a bit different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollin' Those Dice","review":"Dice cup was as described above and am happy with the quality of it.

The duets are thrilling and Cotrubas is in magnificent and expressive voice. It's too bad that only past versions are used as benchmarks in reviewing a newer one.Domingo does not sound like Pavarotti (thank God !!!) and Cotrubas on this recording sounds the way she did in her best live performances.

But then when the instructor moves on to the next part of the body, you're supposed to stop and watch, then do it with the couple?? Kinda ruins the mood to have to stop the massage each time they teach it to you. I just followed the first time then kept touching as the second couple did it.

The techniques are explained in a clear and concise manner. The examples and exercises provided are very appropriate and serve to provide a good understanding in the subject matter. My only complaints about the book are that some areas are not covered as thoroughly as I would have liked (for example, the section on Thevenin and Norton Equivalents) and that some techniques of circuit analysis were left out. However, many other things that were not clearly explained in textbooks were made comprehensible with the help of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as a Study Guide or as a Supplement","review":"This book has a lot of worked examples and exercises so it could be used as a study guide or as a supplement for a base textbook.

I am an Electronic Engineer, but I have been working for the last 16 years as an Instrumentation, Automation and Process Control Engineer for the Oil & Gas Industry. As a result I have been involved mostly with Chemical Engineering issues in a day to day basic.

There is very little theory, and the exposure is somewhat limited in many cases. Also, it does not treat mathematics in a systematic way. For instance, the complex variable methods in the section on frequency domain seemed kind of haphazard, if you have a good complex analysis background you can fill in the gaps.Overall, this book provides a bunch of confidence boosting problems, which are good practice. But it's definitely a supplemental book rather than a textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not a place to Start","review":"This book assumes you know some advanced math and doesn't go over basic concepts with much detail.

Also, be sure to open it up and find out what kind of fuel you need for the flame. I had a fondue party and didn't open the box until the day of.

I have even gone as far to buy them for my son's classroom (at the request of the teacher) and the library (again, because they were so popular). For our books, the primary audiences range from Kindergarten to adult. This has no new pictures (which I don't object to), but no substance. Perhaps for the stated age range, these would be great (as a transition from the board books to the more challenging full-size books), but not as an extension of the excellent fore-runners.

Huff is definitely one of the best shows on television these days as it's relevant to our times and hysterically funny. The writing is smart and witty and the acting is superb. Even if I had been able to rent it, I'd still decide to buy it as it promises to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huff is not just Blowin Smoke","review":"I have been following Hank Azaria since I saw him on stage in an early David Stein production of \\"Grease\\". He stole the show then and continues to shine in Huff now. The role of Huff calls for an actor with both comedic and dramatic skills. Very few actors have the skills to shine in both of these areas (Jack Lemmon and the British actor Charles \\"Chuck\\" Pincus come to mind). Hank Azaria is perfect as Huff. He can make you laugh in one moment and cry in the next. Oliver Platt is simply hysterical as his deeply troubled but highly likeable lawyer.

Who do we need to talk to?I don't watch regular tv much....Huff and Six Feet Under.....best shows in recent history.By the way....I canceled my subscription to Showtime when they canceled Huff.......I protested the only way I could.....if they won't stand behind a quality show....they won't get my business.There should have been many more seasons of Huff...what a shame...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show On Television","review":"This show is genius.

There are overarching plot elements from these sources, but Huff is dynamic and original in a way I haven't seen. Huff's life is certainly not as naturalistic as Tony Soprano's or Lester Burnham's. It's more frantic by about a half-turn, and resembles the straight-faced, literary social satire in minitature of Philip Roth or Don DeLillo. Huff is the narcissistic center among a hurrican of impressionistic semi-characatures. There's more going on here than meets the eye. Hands down the smartest, most challenging show on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad This Wasn't A Gift!!","review":"My order arrived today. I love this show.

I will change the rating if this blunder is made good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best from TV","review":"I bought the first season because I heard good comments about it on TV. I never guessed that I was buying one of the most intelligent and interesting tv series ever! The dialogues are excellent and the performances deserve more recognition than they get, specially Hank Azaria (Huff), Anton Yelchin (Byrd), Blythe Danner (Izzie) and Oliver Platt (Russell). The story relates the life of a psychiatrist called Huff, the way he deals with the hard-working job of hearing others pains and sorrow, how he manages to separate his work from his home life and the fact that in his own family the mental health isn't the brightest spot. If you play the pilot episode, you'll want to keep going on watching some of the most shocking as well as amusing scenes ever played on TV.

Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman, Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining.

Yesterday I reviewed the worst spy thriller, today I found the bottom of the lowest of home invasion thrillers.I have usually been friendly towards Nicole Kidman, but I am challenged about my attitude now. She gives us a terrible performance as hysterical hostage here. We don't expect better from Nicolas Cage any more, but I still had illusions about Nicole. Well, too bad.Let's not lose too many words about this trashy flick. No script, no plot, no suspense, no actors, no nada. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Boring, Dissapointment of a Movie","review":"I was surprised by how bad this movie actually was...but I feel compelled to warn others..it is pretty slow and boring. The negative reviews on here are spot on. Cage plays a wimpy businessman who refuses to open a safe, and Kidman is a meek and 'sexy' wife that a crook has a crush on. Okay...the thieves are pretty clueless and their plan unravels...the action is more psychological than literal. I would rent this or watch it on TV if nothing else was on. Seriously.

At 90 minutes, it was slightly over a penny per minute, but it felt a lot longer and a lot cheaper. It was enjoyable in a sense, but has been done better before. Too much action and too many plot twists.

One of the few movies by JS that I haven't seen but probably wouldn't like anyway is 8MM-heard enough about that one to give me nightmares. Nicholas Cage and Nicole Kidman played the married couple on the verge of collapse when their home is invaded and have to put aside their pain in order to escape. The invaders have a fool-proof plan, or so it seems.Is this one of Joel's best? No. Is it enjoyable? If you can get past the language, yes. Flatliners was my first movie directed by Joel, liked that too, even though when I saw it I was only 10, believe it or not, (more about that one later on). What I don't understand is why this movie flopped so badly in theaters, with the research I did, that question has yet to be answered. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casting, writing, and acting.","review":"I cannot imagine a movie where N. Kidman and N. Cage blend seamlessly to create a believable world for our entertainment. That being said, this was not only poorly conceived; the acting was lazy and boring. I attempted to look to the set or costume design, or maybe the special effects or story subtext that might give the movie hope, sadly there was nothing.I would like to see this movie executed properly. Clean up the plot slop and give the ending a face lift and of course, some 'better' actors that appear committed to the film. THEN, maybe this could make it worth a Wednesday night rental.Nicole Kidman has the talent to pull off any role she sets her mind to. Ive seen some dynamic and genuinely moving work from her! What happened?Nicolas Cage is PERFECT if the action and story line can carry his 10 lines throughout the film. He just cant carry a film in any context.Watch some PBS and safe yourself a wasted night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, simply dreadful","review":"Though I understand why Cage apparently makes two movies a month because of his much publicised tax problems, I don't understand why Kidman allowed herself to be in this incredibly dreadful movie.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that I only laid out the funds for a rental. I tried like mad to find some redeeming quality in this movie but was completely unable to find one.This may be the worst movie other than The Wicker Man that Cage has ever been in (and that is saying a LOT). Please save your money and wait for this film to blight regular television. It honestly isn't worth the price of a rental at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"How many times have we seen this home invasion plot? Too many for it to be any different form any of the others. The only reason to watch it is if you are a fan of the actors.

This was so bad it hurt to watch. Nicolas hasn't made a good movie in ages so I sort of knew what I was walking into. Nicole is normally great and makes interesting, memorable movies.

However, this DVD is not really an improvement over the VCR recording I made of the film many years ago from AMC channel. It appears that no digital restoration, either in image or sound, has been attempted. Rather, this is direct copy from a video tape onto a DVD - at least that's what it looks like to me. The disc is manufactured in Korea and I suspect is not even for sale legally in the U.S. I don't understand why Paramount hasn't released it in this country - it was a huge hit in 1946 and won an Oscar for DeHavilland. Perhaps they're working on a restoration of it and plan to release it soon in all its glossy glory. Let's hope so! In the meantime, this edition is a stop-gap for those of us who no longer have a way to watch our old, disintegrating video tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-wrenching melodrama that's actually quite fun.","review":"Olivia de Havilland is excellent in this movie, which is a bit of a war melodrama and a bit of a woman's picture about the choices available to a pregnant, unmarried girl in a WWI-era small town.As Jodie, a girl who won't just settle for whomever proposes to her, she waits for true love, but, when it comes and goes too soon, she finds herself pregnant. Determined to keep her child and hide the scandal, the baby ends up in the household of one of her closest friends by mistake. Jodie, unfortunately, still is intent on keeping her child.The film spans 20 years, and, as you watch it, you keep waiting for the moment when she'll be able to hold the child she was forced to give away. When the moment truly comes, it's heartbreaking.De Havilland is absolutely terrific. The movie's fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprouted like crazy!","review":"I put these seeds in a conventional dome sprouter (mini green house) and they did great.

This one lacks the polish of Aeroplane -- but what it lacks in production it makes up for in freshness. It's inventive without being preciously \\"indie\\" and the lyrics are personal yet accessible-- no one does sincerity like Jeff Mangum.In the final analysis, this CD could have used some editing, but it's still fresher than almost anything coming out of Musicland these days, and I was extremely pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some REALLY great songs, but not a whole album.","review":"My, there are some really, really, really good songs on this album! I could listen to (and sing!) Gardenhead, Where You'll Find Me Now, Naomi, and especially the opening track over and over and over. However, I cannot rate it five stars for two reasons. One, there's a lot of unlistenable filler mixed in here as well. And two, I had the misfortune of listening to the sheer sonic ecstasy that is their follow-up, \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" first. After I let that cd reverberate through my soul the first hundred times (I don't think I'm kidding), it's very hard for me to give five stars to anything anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"Sometimes I love these guys and other times they really get on my nerves. Overall, I would say this is a great album. Still, I usually get through about 5 songs before I need to turn it off. Worth a listen if you are into that late 90's hyped up 60's thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instrumentally sound, lacks creative vocals","review":"I think the music on this disc is great. Its melodies are thick and powerful and groovy. I find the singing to be nothing more than a whiny voice without much range, and unfortunately it dominates the music. Like a lot of pop, too much of the song contains vocals, as if the band is afraid the music would fail if the singing stops.One of the problems with reading online reviews is usually only people who love the music take the time to review it. So here's a review from someone who thinks it's average."},{"rating":"2","title":"A four-track player + pure genius","review":"Neutral Milk Hotel is a band for people who like music with a soul and a lot of guts - just the way music should be. The exact opposite of those awful techno and pop sounds that are polluting the airwaves out there. This album picks you up and shakes you down, leaving you naked and hopeless in a few minutes. The lyrics are just the best since Michael Stipe in his prime. Jeff Mangum is a poet and full-blown musician. NMH's second album (In the Aeroplane Over the Sea) is just as good (if not better) and more well-crafted than this one. But both of them are a must for anyone who enjoys the far-from-dead rock n' roll (with a twist). It's a sound so strong that caught me over here in Brazil. Also try Olivia Tremor Control, Pavement, Guided By Voices and, the father of all, R.E.M."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love it the first time around it ain't so good...","review":"at least that's been my impression. Avery Island is NOT easily accessible which is why I now can still listen to it a year after purchase.

Gardenhead is the perfect example of a song that will start to stick with you after repeated listenings.Is it me or does this CD maintain the same beat throughout?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It!","review":"I'm only giving this one four stars because it isn't \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\" but you still need to own this album.

She expains the three aspects of the triple Goddess in detail, complete with myths and lore. The untrue myth that the dark goddess is all about gloom and doom is completely shattered in the section on the Crone. The Goddess is to be respected in all her aspects and is essential to birth, death and rebirth. This book also contains meditations to meet with and understand all three of the Sacred Mother's faces. A definite keep in my library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing that hasn't been done better elsewhere","review":"This book might -- MIGHT -- be of use to the beginner or the casual practitioner, but anyone who has been involved in paganism or wicca for any length of time will not find much here that hasn't been covered elsewhere. And, I am sorry to say, covered in more depth. The illustrations are nice, though, and for someone who is not very familiar with wicca or paganism this might be helpful, but ONLY as a start down the path. If you're further on down the Way, there's not much of any interest here, sad to say. And what is it with Llewellyn and spelling errors? This book is loaded down with them. People, Microsoft Word includes a spellcheck function - USE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another bad book by D.J. Conway","review":"Maiden, Mother, Crone suffers from the same lack of direction and rather shallow research that other books I've read by Ms. Conway suffer from. The first part of this book is simply a disorganized collection of very brief notes on a number of Goddesses from various cultures.Many fascinating deities and archetypal goddesses are provided no more than a sentenceor at best a short paragraph. There is no attempt to organize or compare these variesfigures by cultures or similarities or to draw any conclusions about the mythology of thegoddess whatsoever. Part two of the book is simply a dictionary of symbols that seems tohave been included to simply fill space. If you are interested in comparative mythology orin increasing your knowledge of various deities there are numerous other books of betterquality out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it difficult to read","review":"I really enjoyed DJ Conway's \\"Moon Magick\\" book and thought that this one would be just as fulfilling. The author didn't seem to do a lot of research and if she did it didn't seem to come through in her writing. I found that a lot of the work was inconsistent and a lot of times she wrote about goddess myths within a few words instead of investing the time to right a full report and complete body of their stories. To my knowledge some of the things she wrote weren't even correct but I'm not completely sure since she wrote about so many Goddesses I wouldn't know where to start. Honestly I just wish she had taken the time to write about a few important Goddesses and thoroughly research their archetype instead of mashed a lifetime's worth of information into a sentence or two. I don't recommend this for anyone who would want to know more about the Goddess, I wish I did have a good suggestion though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Guys rock","review":"Easily one of the best cop buddy movies, tough guys has the ingredients to pull it off. Lino Ventura and Issac Hayes play well off each other. Fred Williamson typecast as the heavy, plays with ruthless abandonment. The character snake is like a snake. He charms you like one and he turns on you like a viper and Fred does it with style. A priest and a cop is a great screenplay and Lino and Ike make it believable. If you are a fan of the cop-buddy genre, include this movie in your collection. I promise you wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning of the softening of their sound.","review":"This came out in 1995. Indoor living, from 1997 was their last of 5 great albums along with indicental music, foolish, no pocky for kitty and mouth to mouth. This is the beginning of the slide to a generally more gentle sound. They got declawed a bit. Worse, they didn't write any of the real together, soaring, 2 guitar power songs here that they did on those 5 albums. I'm glad I got virtually all their records. Who knows, in 10 years when I'm 61 maybe I'll be more into this and their other late 90's/2000's records, less fast, less powerful. Though, on listening to this, none of the songs hit that great musical groove that 5 to 11 of their songs do on those 5 great albums. Still, much better than a poke in the eye. chrisbct@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Aquired Taste, Worth Acquiring","review":"This is my favorite Superchunk album. I guess by definition they're grouped into the category of \\"punk\\", but that tag doesn't do them justice. They're songs are well crafted, and poetic. They also know how to flat out rock. If the chorus of \\"Greenflowers, Buefish\\" doesn't set your toes a tappin' then you better check yourself for a pulse.

I also ordered a car charger but I'm not going to risk using it on my phone. Did I return these items? No, I just threw them away, because at these prices, with shipping and handling both ways *not* refunded, I'd probably lose even more money returning them.

I personally am very unhappy with this purchase and cannot recommend it.UPDATE: I ordered a travel charger directly from my cell phone company and, while it looks exactly like the one I ordered via Amazon, it performs 100% better - it charges my phone in about 90 minutes.

My suggestion is that if you have a Razr, you should just try and use your computer to charge it. If you have a mini-USB cable (I had one that came with one of my hard drives. Alternatively, you can use the one that came with the Kindle) and a Mac, you can just plug it in and it'll charge.

We had tears rolling down our cheeks and he kept yelling \\"Stop! My side hurts from laughing!\\" Seriously, we've enjoyed a lot of books, but this one really takes the cake. No, it's not nice to laugh at another's speech impediment, but Wodney's predicament was about the funniest thing we had ever heard. And the illustrations! Wow! They just fit so perfectly. This book is just pure comedy.I read a lot of reviews talking about this book as being about bullying. Was this book supposed to be about bullying? I don't know.

The rat gets out of this situation not by eliciting any sort of positive change, but by he himself ridiculing another student, thereby winning the acceptance of his tormentors.Where is any sort of positive message to be found?

It was, but I didn't like the message. Basically the only reason Rodney gains confidence & becomes a 'hero' is because he makes the class laugh at another class bully so that she runs away.

I'm probably going to buy the movie now that I have heard the sound track for each seen. When your watching the movie you don't pay allot of attention to the music.

So you're seeing EVEN LESS of the movie with the new DVD version in comparison to the fullscreen VHS version! I can't tell you how ticked off this makes me. MGM recently got in trouble for pulling this type of tactic and it looks like Disney is heading down the same slope.

Indeed, the tracks with the guests work best (especially those featuring Nils Peter Molvaer on trumpet and Dave Liebman on soprano sax).The rest of the tracks seem to lack something, either becoming too conventionally pretty or too indulgently virtuosic. Yes, Danielsson is a very fine instrumentalist, but my own feeling is that the sonorities of the bass/cello are somewhat irritating when placed so far up front in the sound image, as they are on many of the numbers, especially without the balance of horns, winds, piano, and guitar.Not what I expected, and somewhat disappointing, but may be welcomed by those who are especially taken by the bass as a lead instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"i don't know how everyone rated this story so high. our heroine was in a horrible marriage, got dumped. then she gets into a relationship with our sarcastic, verbally and emotional abusive \\"hero\\". no matter how he acts with her, she loves him. he who only loves himself. she's pathetic, he's a lover of thousands, thinks it's ok. i wanted to tell her to pick up her pride and go home. our hero chose to be angry with her when everything wasn't going his way.

The thing is though, if you like The Sound And The Fury your probably going to have to read it a second time. Because of the way Faulkner wrote this book (which, by the way, is absolutely brilliant and an immense measure of his talent as a writer) it's very important to go into reading it with a little direction. The first third of the book is very difficult because it's written from the perspective and mind of a retarded man. But, once your through it you'll realize that that is what makes this such a devastating book- perspective. Faulkner was truly a modern master. This book shows the reader how varied the true perspective is of people who seem to be living every moment in step. There is so much pain in this book. It will tear at you and open you up. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Novel","review":"This is one of the best novels ever written. The prose can be intimidating and the way the narration jumps between past and present is complex, especially in the first two parts, but don't let that scare you away.

I have kids from k-8th grade using them year round, not just for a specific unit. The main way for them to break is if the kids stand on the wrong side of the board for too long or jump on the wrong side too many times (or if they are over the 150 lb limit). I really like them. The only draw back is if they do get stood on the wrong side, the ring may come off it is really hard to get it back on since the ball part doesn't deflate very well.

You just raise it to eye level or a little higher, and let it fall. BAM! Split wood! The key is accuracy not force. Let the 12 lb head do the work.For bigger logs, a bigger, harder swing is called for but this maul makes the job so much easier. Some complain about the handle being short? You must have short arms. At 6'1\\" this maul is the perfect length to get a good swing, but to still be accurate with the head. A longer handled, in my opinion, would result in a lot more mishits.

I have the complete works of Death and Morbid Angel along with other bands and listen to them frequently. I am even the lead guitarist in the Orlando based death metal band Gross Anatomy. What I'm trying to get at is that Cannibal Corpse took death metal and made it something it is not supposed to be. Death metal is music too, not just dark lyrics; that is something CC needs to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually buy this excrement?","review":"This is one terrible album, along with everything this lame excuse for a band has released. Why do people keep purchasing this garbage? There is no variety in Cannibal Corpses \\"music\\". Here is the song format for all CC songs: a)about 10 seconds of some annoying and pointless guitar noises b)enter sloppy blast beats that don't stop until the end of the song c)retarded lyrics about raping babies and eating dead people d)sloppy guitar work and frantic grunting throughout. I realize that death metal is not known for great lyrics, but this stuff is just stupid. It's not scary, it's not gross, it's just plain STUPID. I wish I could give this less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are still around?","review":"Boy, I was surprised to hear these guys were still around...and that they have released their tenth album. Is is any good? Well, if you are a Cannibal Corpse fan (and apparently, there are plenty of them out there), they could put excrement on a platter and you'd buy it. This release shows no progression from their first one. It is still silly, gorey b-movie crud that attempts to pass itself off as music. Still, there are those out there that continually buy these CDs, which is really scary. If, after 17 years and 10 albums you are still listening to Cannibal Corpse, there is something odd about you. Hey, that's cool...some people thrive in oddness. I'm sure you are otherwise a perfectly stable human being. But, seriously, it's time to venture out of the dungeon and expose yourself to something that will not leave your ears bleeding.

With the several various incarnations of the band, limited edition live releases, special pressings that AMT put out, it's TOUGH to keep track. Either way, 'Univers Zen...' is a worthy six track offering by these Japanese space-noise rock merchants. Liked the heavy guitar riffs in the ten-minute opener \\"Electric Love Machine\\", the haunting \\"Saturn's Mechanical Angel\\" and probably the freak-out twenty-two minute mind erasing \\"Crystal Sun And Silver Moon\\" the best.

The top artists in Cuba gladly participate in her CDs as a result (Silvio Rodriguez, Pablo Milanes, Chucho Valdes, Carlos Varela, Amaury Perez, Vicente Feliu, Santiago Feliu, Teresita Fernandez and others).With songs now classic like Alguien me espera and Si me falta tu sonrisa, this CDs shows the guajiro roots of her earlier works and yet it hints the evolution towards a purer and more deep style which is found in her following CD, Del verso a la mar. All in all a great CD and definitely a must for lovers of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect In-Betweener","review":"I originally bought this because of the size: Bigger than my largest slow cooker, but smaller than my original 18 qt Nesco. It's small enough to fit on the countertop but can still turn out two, super moist, 5 lb. stuffed chickens in record time, when using the convection option. Stuffed peppers, sauerkraut and pork, scalloped potatoes and chili turned out wonderfully! The only negative is the hot steam that escapes when lifting the lid. One needs to be careful and make sure to keep arms protected. Also the edge/rim of the roaster gets very hot and can cause a burn if bumped. But that's the case with almost any cooking vessel. All in all I really love the versatility and extra \\"oven\\" this product provides. I can't wait to try baking desserts and trying the slow-cooker setting. The Nesco web site ([...] ) also offers a nice variety of additional recipes for this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"The convection cooking is a joke. The Temperature control is way off. Slow cooking produces burned roast.In fairness I bought this from the factory outlet and it was a returned unit sold as used-like new. It does cook but you have to figure out the niceties of where to set the temp and adjust the time accordingly. I wouldn't recommend it over the eighteen qt non-convection oven which works much better, but as noted somewhere else in the reviews it will cook two stuffed chickens at once if you watch them and that's mainly why I wanted it. I have learned to live with it after some trial and error and use it only in the roasting mode - no convection."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Quality","review":"Somewhat poorly put together when compared to older Nesco ovens. Outer shell of the oven tends to 'cave in' a bit too easy...and handles don't seem to be sturdy enough to support the weight of the oven ... and even more so with a full load of food. Recommend caution when using... and especially keep young children away since outer parts become very hot. I believe Nesco should put an extra $5 of structural integrity in the oven (and charge for it) if they want to maintain a quality built image. If you can find a older/used Nesco model (not made in China) I think you would be better off. Overall: quality and safety concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"good one, but......","review":"Doesn't tell you how to get to the starting point.

As many others have reported, the build quality is very poor. I promise you it will break just about the time that the warranty runs out. At least they upped it to two years, so you may have a chance to get it fixed before it breaks.I extended its life by using a rubber band to hold the cable in place better so that all the contacts would touch, but finally the cable end that connects to the brick just broke. You can now buy replacement cables now from the igo site, but $20 to replace a shotty part that costs a few bucks isn't very good.The fact that these replacement cables are backordered tells me that many people have this problem.Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, may damage your device","review":"I was given this as a Christmas present.

The problem, however, is that the cords that come with the iGo are completely unreliable. I have gone through 3 sets of replacement cords in a few years and now I am in need of a fourth set. The replacements aren't that expensive but when you are out on the road and your power cord stops working it means your computer stops working and furthermore, trying to get a replacement cord can be difficult, even online.I highly recommend skipping the use of iGo products unless they improve the quality of the cords.

Good quality overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of them is defective","review":"Product does what it claims.

The 350 feels exactly like the 300. I can close the 300 but It should be easier to do if I can do the 250 for reps of 15. Just seems like the resistance levels are entirely inaccurate. I am ordering the Captains of Crush hand grips since you can get certified if you can close the number three. So if thats the case those grips have to be very accurate.

Although I haven't consistently worked on my grip, I'm able to close the 300 easily now and tried my friends COC 2.5 and could almost close that. But anyways, if you want big strong hands, this is the product.

So then I got an HG 200 and this grip is perfect for me I'm already up to 10 set of 10 and it kills my forarms. This really is a great product very nicely built. Only thing is that it squeaks now. It that no big problem at all. Overall 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusher Grip!","review":"While some people have commented criticisms of this product, the only one that I could see, and why I rated it 4 stars overall, is due to the sort of rough grip. I say 'sort of' because they really aren't that bad, but I can see how some who perhaps work office jobs or maybe people whose hands get damp a lot could have a problem. This is a set for LIFE. A good grip helps in all sports and bumps up that ego too, when you consider it takes 3-5lbs to crush a windpipe, approx. 40 lbs-force to snap a neck....Have a good day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"I would agree with the others that the knurling is a bit coarse, but you can mitigate that in a number of ways, particularly tape.Either Chemlight's a beast, I'm a punk, or his order was defective.I can't close 250, so they seem accurate to me.Like another poster, I had noticed some tendinitis in the elbow region, but this disappeared after I began varying hand position (sets pronated, neutral, supinated, etc.), instead of doing all sets in the same position."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine workout","review":"These are real grippers.

So keep this in mind before sipping, or you'll get a little disappointed. It's a really mild tea, no bitterness at all, and it has a great scent and flavor.

I thought that I would like to try so many of the recipes contained in this cookbook after looking at the wonderfully appealing pictures of recipes over and over. First, I tried the Maryland Fried Chicken. After mixing the ingredients and following the directions throughout the recipe, it turned out that there was a pretty large amount of ingredients left. Although this may have been on my part, as a new home cook, much of the coating for my chicken slid off and ended up on the bottom of the frying pan.

Why? The authors are conceited, smug academics who never miss an opportunity to take a swipe at Tarkovsky personally, who is obviously in no position to answer back. Furthermore, their interpretations of his films are somewhat narrow and overly literary (one of the hazards I suppose of spending your life on campus and not in the real world). Finally, the authors also never miss a chance to criticize other writers on Tarkovsky over what they perceive to be mistakes which are, more often than not, merely cases of Johnson and Petrie being overly critical when their own work is far from perfect, or simply wrong. Having got all that off my chest, this book does some good stuff in it, but it has to be weeded out. It's just a pity about the authors and their attitude.

I know everyone likes different types of novels and this is a bit out of my normal selection. Even so, I thought the writing could have been much better. The book is around 350 pages and the first 200 pages they haven't even gone underwater yet. The pace of the book picks up a good bit closer to the end but I still had to force my self to finish it. A few pages I had to go back over because it was so dull and slow It did't keep my attention.

What surprised me about this book was the Red Prince's attitude toward the Lebanese Christians and his behind the scenes dialogue with the CIA. He was focused on terrorism against Israeli targets.

This scope came with a nice soft carry case and a table top tripod. The scope included lens covers. Providing adjustable viewing through a fine tuning dial and power adjusting.I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Barska scope.

In addition, the magnification and warping of the mirror make it so that you can only focus (if you call it that) if your face is 6 inches or less away from the mirror. The variable \\"magnification\\" is achieved by rotating the ring which puts more warping into the mirror making the fun-house effect even more impossible to deal with and also causing the plastic mirror to pop of from its foam sticky pad. If this product were $5-$10 it might be worth giving it a try because that's about the quality of the product. I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fog resistance lessens with time.","review":"It works okay. After a couple of months, I noticed it isn't as fog resistant.

It broke, and I needed a replacement. After researching fogless mirrors, I went to Amazon to order this Fogless Ultra II Shower mirror. This was a good price and the product surpasses any mirror that I previously owned. It may fog at times, but a quick wipe and it is good. I recommend this product. Forget the fancy radio/mirror combos, just get a good mirror and it will last a long time for a few more dollars more than what you would pay at local discount stores. Great item with great visibility - no more wiping the mirrow while I shave in the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was disappointed to see a cheap looking mirror when I opened the box. The mirror was made of cheap a plastic. The reflected image (my face...) was totally distorted. The supplied 2-sided sticker could not hold the mirror on the tiles and I had to use RTV in order to attach it to the shower wall. After couple of weeks the \\"fogless\\" mirror became covered with fog the moment I opened the hot water in the shower. The whole mirror surface became quite \\"matte\\" after some time, and \\"mirror stains\\" (or peelings) appeared on the mirror edges and the plastic holder.Why 2 start and not 1? - Because for over 2 years I am spraying anti-fog spray on the mirror before I start shaving, and so I manage to do the job. But now I had it, and I am looking for a different mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Based on some of the high reviews the Zadro Z508 Fogless Shower mirror was receiving, I decided to buy one since I like to shave in the shower. When I received my purchase, the mirror was not attached to the self adhesive tape, it had popped lose. I made several attempts to reattach, would only last a few hours before it would pop lose again. I returned the product and reordered a second one, everything was seemless. The second unit worked great for one month until this morning when I found the mirror laying on the shower floor. I would not recommend this product unless you are willing to repair and improve the adhesive mounting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror fell off immediately but did not break.","review":"Generally the build quality was good.However, the mirror is stuck on with an adhesive sticker and immediately fell off. The mirror is not stuck in place by anything other than this sticker and if you press it on with your thumbs it dimples creating a fun house effect.I expect I will be able to put it on with a better adhesive. Still, this is designed for a wet environment and you are supposed to be able to increase the magnification by twisting. It is designed to fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zadro Fogless Shower Mirror","review":"Awful!! Came apart in shipping, mirror out of holder, had the worse time getting it to go back in place and stay. It doesn't hold on the shower wall for very long, when you least expect it to, it falls off.

Many folks say it fogs but I can't comment on that as the suction never held long enough to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I haven't even had it hanging for 24 hours and the thing is falling apart. What you may not realize is that the mirror is held to the frame by a sticker!!! Problem is the sticker does not stick.

But this product absolutely fell apart, so I can't help but warn others! First of all, unless you have a perfectly smooth, plastic shower surround, the suction cups will never work. I have a smooth tile shower and they don't even work on mine. So I bought this mirror because it was one of the few that came with this \\"waterproof\\" sticky tape. That fell off too. I finally just bought some Gorilla glue and that held the mirror to the wall. Then a few days later, the mirror itself came unstuck from the frame. And guess what! It was just more of this waterproof tape holding the mirror on. No wonder it failed. Because this was a Christmas gift and the box was thrown out on Christmas day, I couldn't get a refund from J&R. They're sending me a replacement, which I'm hoping will not fall apart as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met All My Expectations","review":"I researched several Fogless mirrors on Amazon before deciding on this one. I went with this one based mostly on the positive reviews. I have had this mirror now for several months and can say that it does what I expected. It does not fog up very easily. When it does I just splash some water on the mirror and the problem is solved. The suction cups work sufficiently enough, but the mirror will fall if I do not reapply pressure to the suctions every two weeks or so. This hasn't really been that big of a nuisance as I am in the shower more often than that. The first time gave me a real start, though, as it came crashing down in the middle of night while I was sleeping. They do provide a sticky patch alternative with the packaging if you so choose to use it.Overall, pleased with the product. Really enjoy having a mirror in the shower. I would definitely purchase this same product again. Although, maybe next time I will buy a model with a light built in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I read reviews","review":"After a mix up and the first one getting lost in transit.

Foley is great at drawing you into a scene or situation with vivid descriptions.But in Devil, Foley disappoints by dropping the heroine willingly into the hero's lap on day one (after spending pages explaining the woman's determination to never trust or love a man again). The hero's degree of guilt for something over which he had no control is silly. So is her saccharine sweet goodness, alternating self-reliance and helplessness, and too-even temper. You know early on that she's won him with her goodness, and that he'll come around as soon as he finishes his little revenge project. Their problems aren't troubling enough to justify the elaborate situations they have to overcome to end up together, and so neither is the happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH...","review":"I wish I had listened to the low rated reviews. Not a book worth paying for. The main characters' relationship felt off to me, and Lizzie's eagerness to give it up to Devlin was a very annoying inconsistency given that she just had her heart broken and had sworn off men completely. I also found myself drifting off the story since it wasn't really interesting and could have ended by the 5th chapter. Which is too bad since I was looking forward to reading a new author, now I'm skeptical to buy any other books written by Ms. Foley."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dreadfully wonderful book.","review":"As always, I love Foley's books. I love the fact that there is a history with each character, and that I'm able to follow along and truly come to love each character. Devil Takes a Bride had murder, intrigue, and best of all, love. However, I was disapointed with how Alec came across in this book, because he was always one of my favorites. I suppose when I read the other books, I expected him to come to his senses and marry Lizzy. Obviously, that book set all my expectations to rest, but still-- didn't anyone else expect Alec and Lizzy to be together? No one else seems surprised, so I guess not."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensual yet tasteful","review":"In this tale of revenge, Devlin (Devil) finds out that the accident that killed his parents many years earlier was instead murder. He plans vengeance, but in the process his plan is temporarily thwarted when he's called home by his aunt where he meets Miss Carlisle (Lizzie), who he must later marry in order to inherit his aunt's fortune. Wonderful chemistry between Lizzie and Devlin, and a love story that will move hearts... but what about the murderers? Will they get what's coming to them? Find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun book to while away an afternoon...","review":"This book had an enjoyable plot, and I liked that the main characters actually liked each other early on. Having read Ms. Foley's other novels, I enjoyed learning what happened to Lizzie, and Devlin was wonderfully flawed...a man any woman would love to save! Now I can't wait to find out where Alec goes from here! My only complaint was in her description of Lizzie's students. They were constantly refered to as children, and acted like 7 year olds, yet they were 16! I always thought that most girls during this time in history were considered old enough to marry. As this is only a minor irritant, I would still recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Devil","review":"This book was so great until the very end.

I did notice a slight increase in energy but that's about it.After about 3-4 days I started to develop insomnia. I was taking longer to fall asleep and woke up at least twice during the night with difficulty falling back asleep. As a result I stopped using this and within a day my sleep returned to normal with no insomnia problem. I later learned that this is a side effect for some people. Also, after more research, I learned that 100 mg is way too much to start. Perhaps if the seller sold it in 30-50 mg capsules it would have been better. This may be useful for some people but definitely not for me. I'm writing this to warn everyone to be careful.

The result is, as often, that the \\"noir\\" qualites get sort of lost in this quite laboured drama, depending much too much on its surprise ending. But watching Dana Andrews at work is always such a great pleasure, that it makes the film quite worthwhile, anyway, anyhow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond a Reasonable Plot","review":"Sorry, but I must dissent with the majority of positive reviewers for this film. The \\"surprise ending\\" comes out of absolutely nowhere and fatally ruins this below-average effort. Dana Andrews doesn't have much of a canvas to display his talents here, and Joan Fontaine seemed a very unlikely and unsuitable romantic partner for him. The plot skips too quickly to the courtroom trial, and I wish the death of Sidney Blackmer's character had been less contrived. The film has an intriguing concept, but unfortunately things are rushed and nothing ends up being believable. Fortunately, I rented rather than bought this DVD. I suggest that only \\"rabid\\" Dana Andrews or Fritz Lang fans do the same and spend the remainder of your saved cash elsewhere. Frankly, it's just not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky and preposterous","review":"A sloppy film that doesn't serve the best interests of anyone involved. Joan Fontaine is relegated to a supporting role that just about anybody could have played. Dana Andrews comes off as a mildy interested bystander, which is strange because he's the star. Most of the other performances are flat, but the real villain in this mess is the script, which is outrageously flawed. It begins with a crazy premise (frame a man for murder to prove the death penalty is flawed) and gets progressively loopier until it defies logic and credibility. To say more would be to give away too much, so I'll leave it at that. Save your money and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"This album is fun for about thirty minutes.

WHY?","review":"My name is Bryan Jonathan Morris. I have just finished Memnock The Devil. Unlike the other four Vampire books I had to force myself to finish it. I love Anne Rice's books, but I hated this one. Why did Anne Rice even write it is what I want to know. I think that it hurt all of her Vampire book readers. It was a huge wast of time to read. It also went too far when it came to everythin the Devil was able to do and it went to far when it talked about why God made the earth. It also made God look bad....I love God and I hated reading those parts but forced myself to so I could findout what was to happen. If you want to ask me about the book e-mail me. And for those Vampire Chronicle readers that are just finishing The Body Thief, I think that you should stop there because reading this book will make you very unhappy"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fight For Lestat, a classic tale of good and evil.","review":"Anne Rice captivates her readers in this chilling novel. Lestat is finally confronted with a greater evil than himself, and for all those that have been following his adventures, or for all those that would like to begin, this is a good place to start, or continue.Anne Rice blends the classic struggle bettween good and evil into something more, and to find out just what that is you'll have to pick up a copy of Memnoch the Devil, from the Amazon book store nearest you"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED it!!!!:(","review":"After reading all Anne Rice's vampire books, I could safely say that this is her WORST. It is pointless, tedious, and generally a waste of time!!!! I hate it, I hate it, I hate it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it! How could anyone who loves her books enjoy it?","review":"I have read the first 4 books of the Vampire Chroniclesand loved them all. They are all action packed and giveus an in-depth view of Lestats life and struggle. NowRice goes into a 400 page long debate on Good versus badand God versus the Devil. I would rather read the Biblefor that. This isn't about Lestat or Vampires at all! Ihad several friends tell me \\"Don't read it - it is boringand slow\\" But I didn't listen. I couldn't read it past 120pages and I couldn't even get through the cassettes. Ifyou like Anne Rice you should hate this book because ithas nothing to do with her former stuff at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The destruction of Vampirism","review":"**I request not reading on if you don't want me to ruin this or later books in the series** I am a fan of Anne Rice's earlier vampire novels. I thought that this novel and the ones that followed were plainly stipid due to the whole intertwining religion into vampirism. I think these books were just cheap shots in attempt for her to make some cash or an wasted attempt to satisfy fans. I'm a big fan of vampires and this ruined any enjoyment in reading any more of her novels. In my own opinnion she should not have made Lestat go all \\"goody-goody\\" and run to god."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant ...","review":"My favourite from the series. Deeply philosophical. Not a book I would consider \\"religious\\" this oeuvre has it's place in mythology. Whether you beleive in God or not, is not the point in this book, it is a view of what could be, of what might be, perhaps, of what should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Lumbering, turgid, incredibly boring. If she sat down to write a suffocatingly dull book on purpose, she could not have done a better job. I am not a religious person, but I found the theology bizarre. And there is page, after page, after page of it. Pure torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memnoch more gripping because of human side","review":"I believe that you have to be firmly entrenched in not only the vampire chronicles but also the work of Anne Rice before one can truly appreciate the breadth of this book.Lestat definitely takes on more human chracteristic in this volume and the result was to me both reassuring and haunting at the same time. The book itself was just that, as a Catholic I did cringe when when Lestat sunk into Christ's neck.But by the end of the book that feeling had past and I was left with a feeling I've come to expect and enjoy after reading one of the books in the vampire chronicles: thoughtfulness.Rice always gives us something heavy to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interview with Insomnia","review":"I loved the first four books. I am stuck halfway through this one because it is so turgid, and it is holding me up from enjoying the rest of the saga. The same debates are in the Bible, \\"Paradise Lost\\", and \\"Dante's Inferno\\", and the originals are a lot more interesting than the imitation. In fact, I'm just going to jump straight to \\"The Vampire Armand\\" - life is too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her best!","review":"I've read most of Rice's books, even the erotic ones she wrote under her pen name (the Sleeping Beauty series), and I think this is probably the best book she's written, next to The Vampire Lestat and The Mummy, the other two books of hers I really enjoyed. I think her weaving of \\"historical fiction\\" is beautifully done, and she presents an interesting take on god, the devil, and religion in general...but I don't think she overdoes it. She's a great storyteller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A point to remember.... it is fiction after all!","review":"Ms. Rice bewitched me again, but with this massive tale I was at moments enraged by her seemingly offensive look into our soul's state. But surely one must accept that she, is a storyteller of great imagination and we, feeling the emotions that we do while reading her work, must accept that many of her words have the power to enchant us. I enjoyed the adventure, came to loathe Lestat for his weaknesses and selfishness and all in all I am quite happy now that he is in a state of limbo, one hopes that Ms. Rice can simmer for a while as apposed to being on hot boil."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars that represent zero","review":"In writing this book she totally contradicts and may I say eradicateseverything 'Interview With The Vampire' stood for and represented, for exampleLouis in Interview asking 'am I damned?', how can Louis be damned if there is no God that destroys him/it. And yet in Memnoch there are practically dozens of God's falling all over the place. Anne has removed all mysticism from the lives of the vampires she touches, now they have incredible mind sapping, unearthly adventures 'every weekend' and go for coffee at 11 during the week in some plush hotel...what! Where are the dark evenings of boredom when all a vampire had was the crackle of the fire and a few words of contemptuous philosophical chat with another vampire to pass the time before the hunt, and if they did have an adventure it spanned centuries. Anne has refined the art of watering down the characters she so delicately created. Read this book only if you have lost appreciation for 'Interview'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly GOD-awful (pardon the pun)","review":"Believers and nonbelievers alike will have reason to hate this book....it's essentially a bad, lengthy religious pamphlet.Stuff several hundred pages of pseudo-pop-theological babbling into the mouth of a much-beloved, well-crafted character that (apparently) the AUTHOR doesn't know anymore, and you have this sorry, pathetic, sophomoric excuse for a \\"vampire chronicle.\\" END"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!","review":"This story is plainly repulsive.

More books like IWTV, TVL and QOTD, and no more Memnoch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"reading this book, I thought I'd gone to hell!","review":"Sweet Jesus! This is Anne Rice's worst novel ever. It is a plotless rambling ego trip for one of my favorite authors. I've read most of her books (published under her own name) and the only other book that was this bad was tale of the body thief. I loved the first three vampire novels, The Mummy, and The Witching hour. If you are looking for a fascinating story read those. If you want to read an occasionally interesting, but basically plotless work of heretical judeo-christian theology, read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"This is one of my favorite novels by the Wonderful Anne Rice!

Simply beautiful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought that it would only get better","review":"Having originally read this book when it was first published, I thought that perhaps rereading the book would change my perspective some years later. Unfortunately, the book continues to fall flat. Whether it is simply poor writing or instead my annoyance with her interpretation of religion I leave to other readers to decide. Having thoroughly enjoyed the first three chronicles, Tale of A Body Thief left me numb and bored with the series. I had hoped that Memnoch would reignite my passion for her novels. I have decided now that I must be content with the first three books and pretend the last two were never written at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A literary atrocity","review":"This book has no redeeming qualities. I miss the days when the Vampire Chronicles were actually about Vampirism. I feel like Anne Rice is desecrating her own characters. I fell totally in love with both Lestat and Louis; and in this book Lestat is irritating and Louis practically doesn't exist. I totally hated the plot. It was boring and pretensious and frankly, just stupid. This was the last thing by Anne Rice that I read. I can't bear to imagine what Pandora and Armand are like. I won't be finding out. I read Memnoch hoping for the magic of the first four books (especially the priceless scenes between Lestat and Louis) and found none of it. I was so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing story written beautifully.","review":"So now we see Lestat is truly half-human! It's about time. He gets scared, whines, and suffers just like the rest of us. Lestat is easier to relate to in this novel, which is my personal favorite next to Lasher.Not only does Rice give a frighteningly coherent theory of the beginning of the world and mankind, but also explains the reasons behind the \\"conflict\\" between God and the devil, Memnoch, in a way that makes complete sense. Some Christians may view this novel as blasphemous, but the clarity Rice provides is truly scary.If you're not a follower of the vampire chronicles, which I do admit this novel completely strays from, but a lover of Rice's poetical writing ability and beauty she creates with her lyrical prose, you will definately love this novel. It is a hauntingly beautiful tale, although quite scary, that will more than likely make you think twice about the true purpose of Heaven and Hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone who did not like this book should get a refund!","review":"Does Anne Rice stand behind her work? If so, she should personally give everyone a refund who did not like this book. First, Lestat sits in a bar and learns the personal history of a ghost; then we get a tour of hell and Memnoch's explanation of creation (and all that angel heirarchy....stop!). I ended up sympathetic towards Memnoch and didn't give a damn about Lestat. Somebody tell me why Lestat was in this story. I felt like I was reading Rice's interpretation of creation. I want a story! And not an interpretation! Anne, stop writing and pursue a career in biblical studies, for Christ's sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible is too good a word for it","review":"This is the worst since, and perhaps including the first in this series. A long - boring - trite treatise on religion and the nature of god and the devil, this is full of the kind of whiny self-loathing psuedo - introspective tripe that made the 1st volume so boring.If you liked any other books in this series, and arent too anal retentive to skip one, skip this one, and go on to the next. It cant be worse, and most of the others so far have been better, so...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Pulp Of Rice","review":"If you're an adult, this is a 1 star book; if you're a teenager, it's probably a 5 star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I go lower than 1?","review":"I never even finished it I was so disppointed.

I've read almost everything Anne Rice has written, including novels under aliases, so I am a fan of her work. And I usually love the descriptive labor she puts in to help the reader envision her characters. However, I found myself flipping back in the book the find out exactly how long she'd been dragging me through the heaven and hell garbage. Then I found myself at this site reading through the reviews for a kernel of hope that she might stop writing her own new religion and get on with an actual story. I can see from these reviews that I am almost through literal hell and will finish the book but I'm not running out to buy another Rice novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vampire story that actually sucks","review":"Puh-lease, my first grade reader had better writing than this one. The plot was boring, the characters were out of whack, and everything was just really, really awful. The only redeeming quality was that it was a Rice book. Yes, I love Lestat and Louie. But not when Rice is trying to turn Lestat into a god. (Thank the good graces that her subconscious rectified the faux-pas.) Rice is suffering from a major case of \\"Godism\\". She's trying to turn her pet \\"boy-toy\\" into a god. That's just not right. Lestat is a vampire, as is Louie, Marius, Claudia, Count Dracula, Knick Knight, Lacroix, and every other vampire that I have forgotten to name. Okay, they don't need to be turned into something that they are not. In summary, Memnoch just sucks man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again will I read Anne Rice !!!","review":"How feeble. Where is Lestat ? In the previous books I loved him, hated him , admired him , felt his anguish and so on.... what happened to him ?

I could say more about the rest of the content , however , I have already wasted enough of my time on this trash. Bitterly disappointed !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AND OFFENSIVE!!!","review":"I read Interview With The Vampire long before anyone else had even noticed this book. Then I read all of the sequels as they came about and for the most part enjoyed them immensely. Not so with this book.I could easily have read the first 50 pages and the last 50 pages and gotten the jest of the story. Everything else in there was just drivel!!! Not only did I find some of the content offensive, but it was boring on top of it.If Anne Rice wishes to write a book about her views on religion, then maybe she should just write one and not disguise it under the guise of one of her Vampire Chronicles.This book was really a waste of time. If you're only reason for reading this book is to find out what happens between \\"Body Thief\\" and \\"Pandora\\" or \\"Armand\\", then just read the very beginning and the very end. The rest of the book will put you to sleep.Luckily, for all us Vampire fans, Anne Rice went back to her old formula for the next two books. I hope she keeps it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ann Rice Novel I've Ever Read","review":"Normally I am an avid fan of Ann Rice novels. I've read Body Thief and Ramses and Interview so many times I know sections practically by heart. But this sorry excuse for a novel, especially a much awaited return to Lestat and his deeds, left me wanting. Rice's trip into the unknown realm was perhaps the worst side bar she has ever ventured down. Pandora was a nice return to her standard writing. That was fortunate because I feared her style had changed forever and that I would be left without a source for my vampiric novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice Fan Visits Hell","review":"I love some of her writing. I couldn't get enough of some of her writing. Lestat de Lioncourt has to be the best character, and Azriel the earth-bound angel is sex on paper. But this, I found, grated on my nerves and ocular senses.Fascinating as a theological debate. If you want to consider the view that God is not patient and all seeing, and doesn't care about his creations' afterlives; if you want to believe that the Devil is a Fallen Angel only because an impatient God doesn't give his suggestions the time of day; and if you have any interest in Lestat's idea of the Crucifixion, then this is a brilliant read.If you want to see Lestat being a cool collected *reasonable* Vamp, and you think he was the best literary creation of the 1990s, then put this book down. [If you want sex on paper, and a theological read, go order Servant of the Bones. No complaints there at all!]"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could she go over the edge like that??!?","review":"First of all, I want to say that I couldn't even finish reding the book.. Perhaps it was not the right time for me to read it, but no!! Even though I love vampires and such things, it was a disappointment for me. But I also know people who loved it. What I feel may be different the next time I try to read it. Anyway, after I left the book halfway, I didn't have the urge to read another book for 5-6 months!! But now I'm reading The Witching Hour, and I think it's fab,though very long. And I'm looking forward to reading Pandora despite my disappointment in Memnoch. I won't mention the narrative of the book even, because I don't want to leave the book I'm reading now!! But all the while, Anne Rice is some autor I love. And I'll finish Memnoch one day.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did this come from?","review":"I love Anne Rice. I adore Lestat. Who was this character pretending to be Lestat in this book? The behavior patterns were to say the least uncharacteristic of Lestat. Although the text raised interesting philosophical questions, I think those questions could have been addressed in a short story. It went on endlessly. I had a real rough time even finishing it. Please Anne, bring back the old Lestat. Still love ya though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Vampire Chronicle, but an excellent book.","review":"Memnoch the Devil is not, I repeat NOT!!!, a Vampire Chronicle. At least not in my opinion. My question is why did Anne Rice, who is the master of weaving a character and breathing life into him, chose Lestat to be the protagonistof such a religiously baised novel? I loved every one of the Vampire Chronicles, couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one, but this one threw me for a really large loop. Earth circling you coulds say. I don't know waht I expected but it certainly wasn't what Memnoch gave. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book and have read and reread it on numerous occasions, recommend it to friends---but not as a continuation of the storyline established for Lestat in Interview with a Vampire. It is a different genre of book from the vampire tales and I, personally, object to it being included in the Vampire Chronicle series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Anne Rice book I read","review":"I've read about 7 or 8 Anne Rice books over the course of about 4 years.

The last half was horrible and I forced myself to finish the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the books that made the burning bush turn to ash.","review":"This was like some horrible alternate universe fanfiction.

I've never been a huge Rice fan, and _Memnoch_ does not change my opinion, but I do believe it is better than the average Rice novel simply because the idea is somewhat intriguing. Some of the theology is entertaining and having the Devil as a main character is always a good selling point. As usual, Rice is overlong and belabors the point ad naseum, but at least she is trying to accomplish something here. When Lestat is not talking to the Devil, he is constantly preoccupied with another character's menstration and there is plenty of needless and boring explication of exactly how many levels of angels there are and every step of the creation of the universe. I can't recommend the book. But it is better than the trash that the two previous books in the series have been. Disclaimer: avoid the book if you are offended by religious images or ideas that are unorthadox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I hated this book. I had read and loved all the other books in the series, but this one just (wasnt very good). You simply don't mix religion and fantasy.

Its not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste any good blood lately?","review":"Have you ever not believed in something, but it came about anyway?That is the message in this book.In the world of a vampire God nor the Devil nor Heaven nor Hell exists.Lestat the main hero of most of Anne Rice's literature, meets the one person who he'd never meet, the Devil. This event causes all sorts of adventures.Read the book to find out.Anne does a great job of explaining the feeling of heaven and hell.Though the book does begin to slip away one's intrest, it still has a stunning ending.So try it, see what you think.I personally love the character of Memnoch myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A concept in search of a plot","review":"At the beginning of the book Lestat says this book has nothing to do with Vampires. Well there you have it. The bulk of the book presents an interesting and sure to offend many - retelling of the Devil's fall and God's relation to his creation on earth. Lestat and crew are cardboard characters that nobody who had not read the other books would even notice. This should not have been a Vampire book. The main reason it was, no doubt, was to sell more books. The concept was fascinating and deserved to be part of a novel with a whole new set of fully flushed out characters and a plot for them. This book was a big waste. It wasted the Vampires on a plot that had nothing to do with them, wasted a novel concept on a rough draft, and wasted her reputation as a writer with high standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I'll make this short and sweet, the novel was disapointing because; 1.

For the curious, yes, the title of this review is mocking a quote from Lestat.She has a lot of plugs into her previous stories, completely breaking from this story at some points. These plugs were far beyond what happened in Tale of the Body Thief; to me it seemed like shameless self promotion.Interview was a great story, unfortunately, everything I've read past that has been more disappointing than the last.

It gives a different view on creation and the battle against good and evil. Yet when Lestat goes into hell Anne Rice gets too carried away with trying to describe people in it and what's going on. I started to think I was in hell just trying to finish the book or at least get to the point of his journey. I thought the best part of the book would be how it ends, yet I was wrong.

I never would have imagined I would find an Anne Rice book that I did not like. I have always enjoyed her writing, but this book was so slow and I had a very difficult time staying interested. Maybe this is due partly to the fact that I do NOT believe in a literal heaven and hell. These are simply not a part of my spiritual beliefs. This book seemed extremely heavy on Catholicism. Even though that has always been a part of the back drop to Anne Rice's books, I was always able to accept that or overlook it. This book, unfortunately, is like one long \\"fire & brimstone\\" sermon, in my opinion and I can do without that. If I wanted that I'd be reading something other than vampire stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but thought provoking novel","review":"I recently completed Memnoch The Devil and I began reading some of the reviews on here. While Memnoch did babble on a bit and hold many controversial issues, I think people should take this book for what it is. It's a fictional novel and a very well written one at that. Rice was not saying that this is the way the world was created and she wasn't expecting everyone to believe in her views. She was just supplying a story and I personally think her brilliance shows up in this tale. A person who is sure enough of his own religious views would be able to put them aside for a little while and read this very thought provoking novel. While Memnoch wasn't one of Lestat's traditional adventures, it was an amazing journey. I can't wait for his next adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for it's genre, not my style","review":"It's ok for Anne Rice to delve into religious stuff, but please don't try to wrap your vampires in it, you just can't pull it off!

Since Lasher her writing has decended faster than Memnochs fall from Heaven.I loved the Vampire Chronicles, I loved the Witching Hour and Lasher but I am losing faith rapidly.Memnoch is incredibly slow. I couldn't wait to put it down.Servant of the Bones doesn't look much better.Please, please Anne get it together.Very Disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"One very dissapointed fan!","review":"I was a huge fan of all the \\"Vampire Chronicles,\\" until I read this book! I had to force myself to finish it! It was way too lengthy and wordy! After eagerly awaiting the release of this book, I was very dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her usual writtings","review":"This was a much anticipated book from her as far as I was concerned but after reading it I was highly disappointed.I had expected to read a book like all the others or better (as I have read everyhing she has written) this however was written like it was written by someone other than Anne Rice.Although I will continue to buy her books this one was a real disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the chronicles","review":"As a big fan of the first four Vampire Chronicles books I was extremely disappointed by this book. The author spent too much time preaching a rather unusual theological perspective and lost the main flow of the story. I found myself skipping huge sections of text without missing any of the plot. The Chronicles have always had a theological aspect to them, but it never consumed the story until this book. Your time would be better spent reading or re-reading the first four books in this series, particularly the second one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately Not the Best In the Chronicles","review":"I am an extreme Anne Rice fan, But this book has to be the worst in the Vampire Chronicles. I found it very hard to read but forced myself to finish it after an attempt to skip the ending made it difficult to follow the later books in the series. I felt that it was extremely long winded and the point was often lost.Before this book the thought of over describing a situation had never crossed my mind, Rice definately managed to do so. Had it not been a necessary step in the evolution of the chronicles I would have never gotten past the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good!","review":"This book explores more controversial views than any of her other ones. I certainly did not mind it, it actually made the book more interesting. It made me think about the religious world more clearly. It did drag a bit though. I recommend this book if you like philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are two sides to every story.","review":"The Angel HunterWhen Lestat is confronted by the devil and is told that he has an explanation for his actions and that God is the one with problem, I thought Anne Rice had backed herself into a corner that was impossible to write your way out of. But she did it! This book is dark and gruesome and well worth the read just for the dialogue between Lestat and Memnoch and how the author spins biblical lore in a new direction. The only drawback is the ending that is a bit deflating. I expected more of a revelation for Lestat and it never came. But, that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original, yet boring?","review":"I loved the first three books, particularly The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. This book was extremely boring and I am a person very interested in religion. I think that Rice has an original and interesting perspective on hell and the devil which she divulges in this book but it is so drawn out and rediculously boring. I have almost never found myself skipping pages in a book (last time may have been Grapes of Wrath in 10th grade) but I did that here. Also Lestat turns in to some kind of emotional superpansy in this book and can not make any decisions on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked by all the bad reviews!","review":"I personally loved this book. This book and Queen of the Damned are my favorites out the the vampire chronicles. I thought it was a different and exciting version on the \\"God vs. the devil\\" story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"To be fair, I didn't read this entire book, less than half way through I had had enough. This is apparently Anne Rice's take on what Heaven and Hell is,and that's her right, but I thought I was reading a book about vampires. Unless you're looking for a debate on God and the devil, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all downhill from here.","review":"This book was dreadful, the intrusion of all the religious dogma Rice drowns us in her books from here on out is unwanted. This is the downhill slope where all of her characters personalities start changing until they're not their old selves anymore. I'm refurring to all of Anne Rice's books that came after this.I remember reading this in highschool as a Rice enthusiast with another like-friend. We both thought the book was awful. We really didn;t care about whatever \\"point\\" there was supposed to be to it. A few bbooks latter, my friend swore off Rive & switched to Poppy Z Brite & I switched to Christopher Pike & Lemony Snicket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined Lestats Image","review":"I liked the book just fine but it ruined lestats whole image He's supposed to be a strong blood sucker that has very few feelings'but toward the end of the book he gets just as soft as louis. Anne Rice Really needs to write a book that reinstates his image."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God, Anne Rice's talent disappeared overnight!","review":"Ok, where do I start. The Title: the original one was Of Heaven and Hell, which I like better. The Reviews: How can anyone praise a book that was so SLOW. Personally, this book is an enourmous offense to Lestat. The Plot: Lestat has turned into a whining, passive Louis; too much and too little character building into Dora and Roger; Memnoch never runs out of breath; Christ turns into a meal for a vampire; Armand DIES, why why WHY?!?; I for one did not want to know how Lestat drinks blood from Dora (18+). Alright, I've pretty much dissected the novel, which I did not read entirely because I found it so BORING and TEDIOUS and UNGRATIFYING. The only good part in the book that Lestat went insane, which I liked, no offense to Lestat, unlike this book. The Queen of the Damned was her best. Killing Armand was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice's MEMNOCH THE DEVIL.","review":"I began reading the book with an open mind - I'd read some bad reviews. In fact, the first - third? - of the book was very good. It seemed Rice had got her gay erotica under control, and the story was going great. I mean, Lestat meets someone claiming to be the Devil? Sounds like a great idea to me! But then, we reach the part when Lestat actually goes with Memnoch, and we find ourselves on completely different ground. Rice uses Memnoch as a way to re-write the Bible and create her own religion: Riceism. Arguments about God, what happened, how the earth was formed - basically, history and religion mashed together in one great big science class. Die-hard Anne Rice fans may be able to make it through the book, but I gave up about 2/3 of the way through, feeling very disappointed. Lestat and/or vampire fans beware; MEMNOCH THE DEVIL is nothing more than Anne Rice's version of the Bible. My verdict: you ain't gettin' no hallelujahs from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but by far not the best","review":"Anne Rice captivated me with Interview With the Vampire, enthralled me in The Vampire Lestat, but from there her works have gone steadily downhill where The Vampire Chronicles are concerned. The Queen of the Damned led me up to the climax, but was worthless because this was not very exciting or thrilling. The Body Thief was slightly better, but again the climax was too brief and boring. Their plan succeeds without fail! Memnoch the Devil would be great if Rice wrote it without it being part of the series, but she wrote a Christian story among Gothic creatures of fantasy. . . and failed. If she succeeded in it, it may have been better, but it simply did not fit with the rest of the Chronicles. It had no real impact within the lives of the vampires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Treatment of a Touchy Subject","review":"Another brilliant addition to the Vampire Chronicles. In Memnoch the Devil, Lestat seems to show signs of a conscience and recognition of his own faults and possible vulnerabilities, which helps the reader to care for him.The story is far reaching and challenges readers to open their minds. Ms. Rice's imagination is awe-inspiring. Memnoch's feelings about God's relationship to humanity, being indifferent, struck a chord with me as I'm sure it will many other readers.The book was a surprise in that an author would take on this subject matter. Ms. Rice does so with her usual creative flair and writes a book that will long stay on my bookshelf. If you are a fan of Ms. Rice's work or have read the other vampire chronicles, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, mediocre, moderate perhaps, but far from good.","review":"A good enough novel from another author perhaps, but from Anne Rice? It feels as if she has straight jacketed herself in the mythic laws of both her own vampire history and those of the christian church.Too much retelling here and not enough new content.Lestat has descended into neurotic paranoia, as well he might being pursued by the devil, but who wants to read about a nervous wreck?Gone is the suave charm of the vampires as instead of being the hidden power amongst mortals they chitter and whine and are changed from being beguiling into wretched pathetic uninteresting characters.Does Lestat's final state indicate redemption? Is his wound at the hand of Memnoch and his understanding of the suffering in hell a way for he himself to be redeemed? Is he a more extreme form of Roger or even Uncle Mickey? I was left not caring, Lestat is transformed from a fiery star into a vapid lilting weasel spouting pastel philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original, not well-executed, not worth reading","review":"Anne Rice was clearly bursting with pride at her novel and radical novels set forth in \\"Memnoch the Devil,\\" so much so that she never really bothered to put much of a plot in. When you've got the devil as a nice guy telling the true story of the Fall and Lestat meeting Jesus, why would anyone need more?And, judging by the reviews here, I guess the Anne Rice True Believers don't. But for those of us who don't find the core concepts of \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" all that radical -- lord knows that they've shown up enough in genre fiction, television, movies and comics for the novelty to wear off -- tend to find \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" so thin, it's transparent.Even the gawd awful \\"Taltos\\" didn't wean me off Anne Rice, but \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" finally did. I winnowed down my collection of her books to the really good ones and \\"Memnoch\\" didn't merit a moment's thought.Borrow this from the library if you feel you absolutely must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memnoch the Devil","review":"This is one of the worst books i have ever read. I was so disappointed. It started out like any of the vampire chronicles but quickly lapsed into absurdity. It is hard to believe that the same woman wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and unenjoyable","review":"Being a fan of the other books in the Chronicles, this was especially disappointing. I found myself repeatedly glancing at pages ahead to see how long until the chapter ended so I could put the book down and take a break. As I read, I kept thinking to myself \\"blah, blah, blah....\\" You move from a gangster's ghost blathering on about his life, to Memnoch doing the same with his \\"take\\" on Creation and the Fall. Neither character made me feel sympathetic or that either made a convincing argument in their self-justification. I typically re-read books later on, but I'll be skipping this one when I re-visit the Vampire Chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Yep, this is bad. After Lestat kills a gangster, he ends up meeting a ghost.That is not all though, as he meets a Devil, and we get a long, tedious explanation and pontification on the whole relgion Heaven and Hell thing, and all may just be David Talbot had mentioned to Lestat before.Travelling to hell, Lestat gets hurt, and goes crazy, and Maharet has to help him.If you are a fan of the first three books, and that is the sort of thing you want, and don't want to read religious discussion through the mouthpiece of vampire characters, please avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFYING-THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY FICTION!","review":"My favorite Vampire is at it again, Lestat is Back! This time there is one Problem The Devil is after him. Looks like our Brat Price has finally met his match. After Reading this fifth enstallment of the Vampire Chronicles. I totally feared of what is going to happen to me when i die. Thank goodness it is only fiction, Pray that it is! Rice is at her best in this novel. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel!. Outstanding.","review":"This book made me question my own theological beliefs. Anne has obviously mixed and matched various fringe religious beliefs. (Some of it matched some Gnostic beliefs). Nevertheless it has caused me to delve into various archane religions. Lestat was great as usual. People that are very religious and inflexible to new beliefs should burn this book before reading. Again, this is a top notch book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"he he- to die for!","review":"This book by Anne Rice was simply stupendous. It was a work of many wonders, delving into ideas never before thought (or at least spoken aloud) of good versus evil and beyond. The intricism of her plot and the theology to back it makes you want to read this story in one sitting- over and over and over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"As a long time fan of Ann Rice and a practicing Christian, I found \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" to be extremely fun to read. The vampires in previous works have struggled with the philosophical contradictions of their existance. In this novel she addresses the issue. I love her style, and true to form she gives us compelling and thought provoking dialogue between good and evil. I highly recommend this book to people with the intellect and imagination to grasp it's subtly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampire Fans Should Stick with the other Installments","review":"This is a disappointing novel. After having enjoyed the first 4 volumes of the Vampire Chronicles, I had trouble getting interested in what was mostly a long dissertation narrated by the devil. Vampire fans are better off skipping this one, and moving right along to the Vampire Armand."},{"rating":"1","title":"what does vampirism got to do with all that ?","review":"I have always been a great fan of Anne Rice and I loved all her books, The Vampire Chronicles, the Mayfair witches, until Memnoch. I think the idea of creation and all that heavenly stuff being connected somehow with hell is just too confusing and boring. A sad follow-up to the great Tale of the Body Thief...I still love Anne Rice ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne lost me","review":"I was disappointed with this book, if only because the other Vampire Chronicles have such great storylines. Although I did enjoy reading Anne's interpretation of God and the Devil, I think both Lestat and the reader suffer. The story of Creation and such drag on and on while the ending of the book is too short and too weak. I'm left wondering what the next Chronicle has in store for Lestat...hopefully it's much more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahem... how disappointing.","review":"I purchased this book in its hardcover form as soon as it hit my local bookseller's shelf. The more I read, the more disappointed I became, until I finally just had to put the book down and walk away. Not one to leave a book unfinished, I managed to push myself thru to the very bitter end, which left me exhausted. I'm not an overly religious person, and I know that every one has their rights and opinions, but this went a little too far... even for me. Heavy sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, A total waste of time!!!","review":"I was waiting anxiously to read more on my heroic vampires-Louis and Lestat ,unfortunately.... it SUCKS!! This book is complete trash and I really felt like strangling Anne Rice! I can't believe she can actually write so coolly about Memnoch,the devil as though he was God. The devil was made to sound heroic and God was ridiculed endlessly!! Although this book is only fiction,still I loath to find that someone would actually cook up such a humiliating and inhuman tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH,TRASH,TRASH; A BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!","review":"This was absolutely no way for Lesat to end up! The book was meaningless except perhaps to Anne Rice so she could have her ideas of God and the Devil written down for prosperity. This is literary masterbation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The first four books of the Vampire Chronicles are the best of the series, but Memnoch the Devil had its good points. Even with the religious aspect of this book, it still represents some of Ms. Rice's finest work, even if Lestat is not quite the same as he was previously. Memnoch/Lucifer/Satan's own story was entertaining and interesting to read, and I genuinely liked his character and what Ms. Rice did with him and the angels and God.For those of you who enjoyed the earlier Vampire Chronicles, you may enjoy this book, but be forewarned - this book has a distinctly different note than its predecessors, and was a sign of Ms. Rice's changing beliefs, because the Vampire Chronicles would never be the same again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Anne Rice's best work","review":"I have to start by stating that I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I read the first four books of this series and thought them to be incredible moving, insightful, and a pleasure to read.Memnoch, the Devil was a true disappointment. Perhaps it was my high expectations, given the previous four books. What appealed to be about Anne Rice was her incredible insight into the human psyche and her ability to capture the depths of human emotions. In Memnoch, Rice goes off on a very strange tangent by focusing on religious issues of God and the devil. Although her ideas of good and evil [and heaven and hell] were mildly interesting, this novel had very little to do with the human experience. I found myself painstaking having to \\"finish\\" the book [I always have to finish a book, no matter how bad it is]. I still haven't given up on Anne Rice and hope Vampire Armand will redeem her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really a Vampire chronicle?","review":"I was left wondering why Lestat was even in this tale. The story seemed more about the Devil whining that God was an insensitive so & so than a tale of the vampires I have grown to love. Throughout my reading I was either bored, or (more often) offended. I am not prudish, but I did not like the way the God I and many others believe in was reduced to an indifferent, bumbling fool. I grew tired of Memnoch's retelling of the Biblical creation. I kept wishing Lestat would do something other than go on and on about how beautiful the Devil looked. Personally I think Anne Rice set Lestat up against God and the Devil because he had no other antagonists left. What next, Lestat in space?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the Worst of all Anne Rice books","review":"This book is not reccomended for any fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Overly religious, overly emotional, unrealistic and rather disgusting in parts it is definitely enough to put off all but her most ardent fans. Rice abuses the character of Lestat more than ever making him into a shallow, fanatically religious emotional wreck who uncharacteristically falls in love with Dora, the religious and frankly rather dull daughter of a wealthy New York drug dealer. The plot is jerky, sentimental, improbable and uninteresting and the book, overall, seems to be liitle more than a showcase for Rice's religious views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egos don't come any bigger than this.","review":"The Vampire Lestat. No more dark mystery. No more dark profound immortal gift. Lestat is now just some git with \\"long nasty, pointy teeth\\", as the Monty Python boys would say. Memnoch belongs in Southern California at a victim counselling group, talking about how, you know, like totally misunderstood he is, kay? God is a bad tempered hippy with a beard. Anne tells us all we need to know about evolution and creation, coz she knows, you know. She was there, honest.Anne is bored and has loadsa money, so its time to muck about with her readers for a good chuckle. If I had as much cash as her, I suppose I might feel like being as mischevious and see if I couldn't get away with writing a bit of old dross like Memnoch the Devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books that I have ever read...","review":"I am about a hundred pages from finishing this book and the only reason I am still reading it is because I keep thinking that it will only get better. I am not a huge Anne Rice fan. I read Interview with the Vampire over a decade ago at the behest of a friend and was not impressed. When I heard it was going to be made into a movie, I read it again and was still not impressed. The movie was better. Anne Rice has a huge fan base so I thought I must be missing something and attempted to read Ramses the Damned. Not impressed. After one hundrd pages into the Witching Hour, I gave up. No more. Recently, a friend of mine at work told me about the story of Memnoch the Devil and I decided to give it a shot because it sounded so interesting. This book sucks. Interesting concept but very badly executed. Boring. Why does this writer have so many devout fans? This will be the last Anne Rice book I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memnoch the Devil, a Vampire Chronicle?? HELL NO!!!!","review":"Anne, you have proved to me that if you wait long enought, your heros will fail you. This bookhas nothing to do with the Vampire Chronicles.Who is Lestat and Armand in this book, certainly not the characters I know from the past books.And also what do I care about the charater Roger. He has nothing to do with the story?! The good part of this book is Memnoch's story about God and Heaven and Hell but if I would really tell you the truth, it was trite and boring and non-developed. Anne take more time on writing books PLEASE???!!!!!. And also the endng was just pain stupid. Armand doing that. Anne dont you read your old books to keep consistenscy????? PleasePeople ignore this book, move on!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just shoot me!!!","review":"Spare me the \\"belief-challenging\\" bullshit. Anne Rice's last two books have been pure crap(MTD & SOTB). I fell like asking for my money back.On one side, you get to hear all about Anne's belief, and I mean everything.If you must buy it, wait for the paperback.(I recommend saving your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will never look at Heaven and Hell the same again!","review":"Memnoch the Devil poses questions which we all have yet oftentimes do not dare ponder upon. Together with Lestat and Memnoch, the reader journeys through Creation, and visits Heaven, Hell and Purgatory, in a way that Dante would applaud at.This highly descriptive novel takes you through a journey which none of us can accomplish while being alive. It raises questions, and opens up ideas and opinions for commentary.It definitely impacts your outlook on death, God, religion, the afterlife and guides you through two completely opposite sides of the spectrum.You will be transported from the pits of hell, through purgatory and into the beauty of heaven, together with Lestat, in a journey which will be unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who stole the vampire Lestat!","review":"I cannot give this book a lesser rating, because it was not a complete disaster. It was definately very thought compelling, but it lacked the heart and soul of the previous Vampire books. I read it straight through like the others, more out of loyalty and hope that it would get better. I did enjoy the story, don't mistake me. However, the characters were not as alive as in the previous books and the plot was all over the place. The wordiness reminded me of the Mayfair Chronicles; I was enthralled with the possibilties of the story, but at times did not think I could read another word. In conclusion, this was not what I had anticipated it to be, and so am still feeling unfulfilled about the destinies of my vampire LeStat and my Louis, as well as the others. For Vampire fans, you will be compelled to read this, but maybe you will enjoy it more if you lower your expectations"},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who has ever asked, 'Why?'","review":"A dark spiral from before the creation to the present. Anne's theories about religion, good and evil, the Devil and God, and who is the more evil of the two. As always Anne's philosophy shines brilliantly in the dark worlds she creates. A serious mind bender. For those who have read Anne's 'The Vampire Lestat', this is the great \\"Ohhhhh...\\" Lestat howled from the window, so it is only natural that Lestat is the witness to, as well as the vehicle through which all events transpire. Enjoy the ride"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I must confess, I am very saddened by the outcome of this novel. I was on edge, excited and waiting for it to be released, only to be shocked by the sheer boringness of it. I do not know what Anne Rice was thinking when she wrote this novel, Her ways of being precise and overzealous with her plots and descriptions went overboard in this novel. I had to force myself to continue reading this mundane literary piece even though I was beside myself with shock. I think Anne Rice's creative juice have either stopped flowing, or are on their way to that destination. She did an extremely excellent job on the first four Vampire chronicles, and she should have STOPPED. I do not recommend you to waste your money or time, this book is definately not worth it. Read the Witching Hour, Cry to heaven or The Feast of ALL Saints, those are soo worth your time and effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloodsucking Fun!!!!!","review":"I love all of Anne Rice's books. This is one set of books that I keep to read over and over. If you are a fan of Rice or vampires...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice went to the well too many times","review":"This boring installment is a notch worse than \\"Body Thief.\\" The series is masterful as a trilogy. Don't ruin a good thing. Read only the first three: \\"Interview\\", \\"Lestat\\" and \\"Queen.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment in this series","review":"Rice gets more and more lurid with the Vampire Chronicles, to the point where this hardcore Rice fan is getting turned off to the series. Lestat's stylish self is missing in this novel and it's hard to have sympathy for him. Religious overtones were a definite turnoff. Rice seems to take a love-hate relationship with the Catholic Church to extremes in her writing and it definitely detracts from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not better than some of the other Vampire Chronicles","review":"This one starts pretty slow compared to the previous four books of the Vampire Chronicles, but once it gets going it does not stop. I suggest reading the previous installments but dont let that stop you from picking it up. Rice rights them so you dont have to have read all of the series to understand it. I recommend it especially if you have differing ideas about heaven and hell. Overall, it is an excellent addition and should be a must read if you are a fan of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure entertainment, don't get hung up on the religion, great read, different direction for the chronicles all together!","review":"I \\"L O V E D\\" this book. Very intriguing with its ideas and topics, highly unusual AND controversial to say the least. In short, an awesome story of the vampire chronicles that just continues to mesmerize its readers. Same series, totally different direction. A. Rice is a talented author. Hard to put this down. Don't get hung up on the religious theories or fact (however you regard it as) and the twist Anne Rice puts to them. It is about the story, it is a story, a FICTIONAL story, she's not trying to re write the bible. It is purely fictional entertainment. Loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you're looking for...","review":"I am not one who searches for the meaning of life, or makes theories about \\"how it all started\\", so for me this book was a disappointment. What some might find intriguing, I found tedious. This book was not an important addition to the Vampire Chronicles, like Lestat admits in the introduction, it's not important in this story that he is a vampire. Anne Rice is a great author, a fact that doesn't change in this book, but for someone expecting another action-packed continuation of the glamorous lives of the vampire, this book is not fulfilling. For those who are interested in fantastic theological theories, this book will prove enjoyable to you at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I have read nearly all of Anne Rice's vampire/witch chronicles and fell in love with the stories. A friend and I trade the books and can't wait to discuss each new twist, however, Memnoch will not be one which we will ever read again. This book was dreadfully wordy and the story was awful. There was nothing about this book which will lead me to read it again. After I finally reached the mid-point of the story I began skimming the paragraphs just to get through. I have never done this with any other Anne Rice book. I cringe whenever anyone asks me what I thought of this book and quickly refer them to The Witching Hour, Blackwood Farm, Blood and Gold, Interview with the Vampire, etc. as those books are where Anne writes a wonderfully absorbing tales. Don't bother with Memnoch. Future stories do refer back to ideas and scences in this book but it is just not worth spending the time to struggle through this book for the minor mentions in other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me empty","review":"I'm seeing a severe decline in the quality of Rice's novels. In the past, I would jump at one of her books on the bookstore shelf, now, I wait for it at the library and skim through it before I borrow! If you thought \\"Cry to Heaven\\" was bad, read this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very interesting . . .","review":"This book took me by surprise. I expected a continuation of the Vampire Chronicles; instead, I got a fascinating alternative viewpoint on Biblical theology. Being well versed in these matters, the book was especially interesting for me because Anne has clearly done her homework down to the last detail. But if you are not a Bible buff, do not despair: the book is as riveting and as gutsy as its predecessors. If you're in the mood to bite off a bit more than you can chew, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"controversial, maybe, but definitely a page turner","review":"Ms. Rice has done it again. She has drawn us into her \\"vividly, wild imagination\\" world and left us (me anyways) spellbound. This book is one of my favorites. Co-workers and friends alike agree that this is one of Rice's best novels. Not only does it draw suspense and a little action, but keeps you wondering if Good will prevail Evil. I know some people will find this absolutely horrific, maybe even sacreligious, but remember fiction novels get the best out of your imagination. It may not be true, but it's fun to pretend. I know of a few people that are reading the chronicles out of order. I don't know why, or how they are keeping up, but I strongly recommend reading this before attempting the last of the chronicles, or the New Vampire Tales. Very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice has my admiration again","review":"After the horrific disappointment after reading Queen of the Damned, I tried Memnoch the Devil and was delighted. Who else has the guts (besides Dante) to set a main portion of the action of a book in Heaven and Hell. I thought she wove the different times and places very well. I'm not usually surprised by anthing in her books, but something that happened early on in the book was really unexpected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Cashes In On an Old Reputation","review":"Simply put, if Anne Rice wasn't the author, this book would not have been published. It is plodding , wordy refuse, overflowing with sophomoric logic. The potential of finding the reason for the devil's fall and his dialogue with God holds much promise but this molasses ball levels out with Memnoch arguing absolutely any point poor,stupid old God, tries to make. It would take an omniscient, all-patient entity to 1) not immediately thunderbolt both Memnoch and Anne Rice's respective, annoying asses and 2) comprehend this twisted web of horseshit.Other than the foregoing, it's a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It took me over a month to finish this book. If I like a book, it usually takes me less than a week. I kept putting it down for almost any reason... Even for (Ugh!) television. I read Servant of the Bones and couldn't put it down. The same with the other Lestat books. What happened to this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This book is absolutey dreadful. I'm working my way through The Vampire Chronicles and had enjoyed all the books up until this one. I now have reservations about reading any of the others considering how bad this one is. The book started out fairly well with the mixture of Lestat's pursuit of Roger and the mysterious being that is stalking Lestat. Unfortunately, the book quickly becomes a ridiculous history of religion as seen through Rice's eyes. A pity. The beginning of the book could have led to so many interesting plots. Why Rice chose the \\"plot\\" she did is beyond me. This is a book to avoid. The books leading up to this one are all worth checking out (even the somewhat less successful The Body Thief is pretty good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining.","review":"I must say this is Anne Rice's best novel. It was very interesting to read that Lestat was afraid of Something or Someone for once! I thought Rice's(or shall we say Lestat's or Memnoch's) depictions of Heaven and Hell, and the Creation were interesting. Sure, if we attended Sunday school or practice Christianity we heard this a million times. But this is different. It has a twist to it. It is from the Devil's point of view, and Rice makes the Devil seem, well, not as evil as we think he is.This book makes you think about your views on Christianity, or any religion involving any god. On a whole, this book was wonderful, and I reccomend this book to anyone, especially Anne Rice fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly A Worthy Exit For Lestat","review":"Let me first say that I love Anne Rice's novels. But that is not blind love. I hated this book. First, it is badly paced. The whole story was too lose. Second, I didn't recognize Lestat at all. This is not the Lestat I have come to know. Thirdly, I had to hack through the pretentions in this book with a machete. I know that Mrs. Rice has a flourish style to her prose, but it makes me wonder whether if she is getting her money's worth out of her editor. It also makes me wonder if all that overly elborate prose was used to cover up the fact that there was no true story here. Finally, (and most importantly) this book was flat and boring. If any of you want to read Anne Rice at her best, go back to the first two books of the Vampire Chronicles. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"Memnoch the Devil was nothing like what I was expecting as the next installment of The Vampire Chronicles. Absolutely drenched in theological argument, Memonch the Devil is not for anyone who dislikes religion in their fiction.Only two things happened in this entire book. Lestat stalked a victim for the first third of the book. He then spent the last two thirds of the book talking to the devil (and occasionally God). It was written as what appeared to be an extremely long-winded interview (think Interview with the Vampire with Lestat as the interviewer).The basic premise of the novel and especially the detail with which Memnoch described the creation of Earth could have been enjoyable if Lestat didn't interrupt constantly with annoying and mostly pointless questions, as though reminding readers he was still there. Memnoch the Devil was dry reading and dragged along slowly. It was imaginative, but the way the story was told was extremely dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow and a bad ending","review":"This is a bad follow up to the previous novel 'The of the Body Thief.' 'Devil' has Lestat basically seeing ghosts and follows the Devil through Heaven and Hell in order to decide if he's going to be the right hand of the Devil in Hell. This book is incredibly slow and deals way too much with religion and things that don't really pertain to anything. The cutaway chapters with David Talbot and Armand are actually the best parts of the book. If you liked the other Vampire books, then I recommend skipping this one, though stuff does happen that will affect the next book, so you may want to mutter through it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing Vampire Chronicle","review":"The best adjective I could use to sum up this book is \\"boring.\\" All of Anne's other Vampire Chronicles are wonderfully entertaining, but not \\"Memnoch.\\" It drones on and on with creation theories, about 200 pages of it. The only ok parts in it are when Daniel, Armand, Louis and Marharet have cameos."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil and This Book","review":"Of all of Anne Rice's books this is the one I like the least. I fact, I did not finish it, so I will review only what I read of it. It does not have the charisma of the other books. You really don't care much about what Lestat is doing. While all her books flirt with being a little sacrilegious, this one goes to bed with it. To me it's not so much an entertaining book as maybe one that is dealing with Anne's own questions of religion. That may be fine with some people, but I just want to read about the vampires, not religious conviction. It had a typical great beginning that draws you in, but the more I read, the more I got distracted by my own morals and ethics involved with what was happening to Lestat. I don't need that in my reading world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increible libro de Anne Rice","review":"En realidad pienso que este libro vale mucho la pena, y la verdad el precio es increible en mexico este libro cuesta al rededor de $500 pesos asi que esta super barato."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best yet","review":"This book is one of Anne's best. The plot with heaven and hell, God and satan are realistic. It kinda makes you wonder if that is not what is really going on in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" for a 90s audience","review":"Anne Rice did a true work in turning out her version of Paradise Lost. She made the devil a character so interesting that it intrigued her most mischievious of creations, Lestat. And I say she does a work because it is an experience so traumatizing to Lestat that he takes a two book vacation from ther Vampire Chronicles, a series which before this novel has obsessed over this blonde haired vampire. Although I don't believe this book has the absolute energy that some of her other books had, I think that it is a good read and interesting read. And as I have heard somewhere before, this book is not for those \\"weak in mind.\\" It definitely challenges some of the mainstream ideals many of us hold in today's society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed reading this book. In my opinion, the plot was a veiled attempt to hide the true nature of the book, a place for Anne Rice to put forth her own theological views. I dont read the Vampire Chronicles for that reason. I read them to see what trouble Lestat is in this time. Though the storyline to this book was good, it would have taken away half the pages of the book if she had not put the theological theories. in"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as readable as her best but nonetheless awesome","review":"Anyone who does not consider this a valid Vampire Chronicle needs to go back and reread their books. \\"Memnoch'\\" meshes very organically and thematically with the other books in the series. The devil is mentioned so much in the these books that he was practically already a character before this book was published.That being said, this is not my favorite Rice novel by far. I would lump it in as one of her \\"problem' novels with \\"Servant of the Bones\\" and \\"Vioin.\\" Like those novels it is rather abstract and loosely plotted, as Rice might say, \\"More spirit than flesh.\\" Ultimately less enjoyable and readable than many of her other novels. I don't treasure \\"Memnoch\\" but nonetheless it is an awesome and challenging book if only for the sheer power and audacity of its ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stairway to heaven","review":"With Memnoch being the first of the Vampire Chronicals, I actually read in sequence. I was prepared for a (forgive the pun) devil of a good time. Shockes,such as David Talbot fearing for Lestat's life, Lestat taking Christ's blood, Lestat's eye being ripped out, Armand's apparent suicide, Memnoch the Devil read like a freight train. through hades."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blade is better at creating smoke than cutting","review":"This blade works ok in that it cuts wood, but for resawing anything more than 4\\" thick it isn't very good. (I used it in a 16\\" bandsaw with a 2HP motor)In resawing Cherry and Walnut it tended to bind and heat up in the kerf, and it burned in Cedar. The Woodslicer 3-4 variable tpi resaw blades aren't much more expensive and provide a much cleaner cut. I've relegated this blade to cutting things that might have nails in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Lincoln lies & myths","review":"This book is one of the biggest liberal lies concerning Lincoln that I have ever read. It is a waste of time & money. If anyone reads this trash than they should get \\"The Real Lincoln\\" by Thomas Dilorenzo. His book will give you a more truthful description of Lincoln, and the reason we have big government violating the Constitution to this very day. The only freedom gained from the Lincoln administration is the freedom of Federal Government to walk all over the rights of the states, and the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lincoln, Constitution Usurper","review":"Why must readers suffer through yet another hagiographic Lincoln tome from Jaffa? He thoroughly understands the source material, but consistently comes to the wrong conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Premises","review":"It's so easy to wrap Lincoln in the dogma of a Liberator. But, was he a liberator and a freedom fighter and a defender of the Constitution when he arrested the entire Maryland Legislature? The mayor and police chief of Baltimore? When he sent Fed troops into states that had not secceeded?Like a true politician, Lincoln said all the right things, while doing all the wrong things"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow/Awesome/that's what I call music","review":"Exquisitely beautiful dance inducing dark penetrating music.I bought this unheard (though I had heard a few 30 second clips of another Helium Vola CD), thanks partially to the two previous reviewers.I loved The Inhabitants of the Sun (I am sorry, I do not have the CD with me, and I cannot remember how to spell it), but the entire album is gorgeous. It surges and swells and dips - it reminds me of a thick, dark slow moving, perhaps, liquid.It is intense and enters you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Citroen 2cv , The Complete Story","review":"This book should be titled by the author \\"The UNCOMPLETE story\\",due to a lot of missing information such as , The production of the 2cv,3cv,3cv \\"Prestige\\",3cv \\"M28\\",Mehari,AK400 & the \\"IES\\" 3cv America all this models produced in Argentina,the plant in Tunicia ,Cambodia,Spain,etc,etc.I really found this book pretty uncomplete it does not contain more information that I can find over the Internet.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"its pretty good","review":"I looked at 3 books on the 2CV (the Reynolds book, the Essential Buyers Guide, and this one) before deciding that this was the best of the three. Not to say the P. Rivas is wrong in his review, but he doesnt point out that there arent many books available on the 2CV, and this one is the best of the three I mentioned. If I am able to actually buy a 2CV someday, I'll pay the extra $$$ for the Lindsey Porter book, but to read and imagine driving one, this one is about as good as it gets at this point. It covers model changes, has lots of B &W photos scattered throughout, and 8 pages of color photos in the middle. It was written by a guy who has driven them, and I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a terrific toy!","review":"This was a terrific buy! We actually bought it for my son's third birthday. He has loved it and used it over and over again. The terrific part? He was in the bedroom for nap with his older brother and I thought older brother was playing with it...turned out...the 3 year old was playing with it and getting all his sounds right! I couldn't have been more estatic. He has learned his letter sounds simply by playing with this toy.Additionally, I cannot speak enough to how great it is to have something with all the pieces enclosed. We are famous for losing the pieces at our house...with this, those worries are gone! Oh, and there is a volume control on this game...so it will keep parents from pulling their hair out! Overall, a terrific, terrific buy. I would buy this again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetition is good ... sometimes","review":"I think the repetition used for these tapes is a good thing. It helps us learn the words and phrases better. The thing I don't like, from a teacher's point of view, is that there are only two drinks used in the examples...up to lesson 8 so far, anyway, ... and they could have chosen different drinks for each tape, helping us learn more words. It's not that hard to learn the two they used being they are almost the same as in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last... colors that are ALIVE!","review":"Are you tired of shuffling and comparing paint sample cards and agonizing over coordinating a palette, finally selecting what looks like the closest match only to find the colors you selected look positively DEAD on your walls?This book will explain why. The concepts behind Kaufman's color palettes really open up a whole new world of color. If you never took an art class (or even if you did), you'll treasure this book because it explains very simply the basic problem with off-the-shelf paint colors and why, no matter what you choose, they have no life to them. There is even a chapter at the end of the book that shows how to mix and select your OWN palettes.Anyone wanting a refreshing outlook on using color in home decorating will find this book essential reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet but dated...","review":"In 2006 this book looks quite dated.

Voynick started as a neophyte andstarted at the Climax Mine in Colorado (he has written a very good book on thismine). He's a fine writer, and you get a good sense of what it's like--the heat,danger, mechanical equipment, etc. A glossary would have been helpful--there werea few times (not many of these) where I had to pause and think about what was meantby a term.For an excellent contrast--try Frank Crampton's classic Deep Enough, which is aboutWestern hardrock mining in the early decades of the 1900's--little if any mechanicalequipment--single-jacking and double-jacking were the norm, and you'll learn whyyou used wooden spoons to clean out shot holes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"<kinda sad that he didn't like what he did","review":"A good book overall. Good description of the work and the dangers etc. I have 30 years underground and think that his description is pretty reasonable. My only complaint is that he simply did not like the work and it simply was a money maker out of desperation. This is true for many people, but, believe it or not, a whole lot of us like it.I found his descriptions of the equipment and the processes as that described by someone that really doesn't like it but has to take it. A bit like a root canal. Well, since we are pricing ourselves out of the world market, the desperate , doomed men will no longer roam the depths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just aweful....","review":"I couldn't even finish this movie, it was just aweful, please avoid this. I found myself skipping through the chapters waiting for things to happen..."},{"rating":"1","title":"They say alcohol kills brain cells, this movie does it faster...","review":"A movie's introduction is key to setting mood or introducing characters, environment, etc. Remember how in the beginning of Saving Private Ryan the introduction scene was so fast paced and helped set the tone for the rest of the movie? Well, in utter disappointment, the intro to this BTK Killer DVD belongs more in a 'Faces of Death' DVD than anything else. For some reason, this type of horror clips were also spliced with unrelated scenes throughout the movie. For example, why show clips of a cow dying when he's shoving a rat in this lady's mouth? I dunno. But seriously, I think a couple of buddies of mine with a cell phone camera and a porn style plot could have made a better film. Even the re-enacted scenes from TV's 'Unsolved Mysteries' seemed decades ahead in production quality. I would recommend watching paint dry at least that would cost less."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete work of fiction","review":"When the movie says \\"Based on actual events\\" it means that loosely. BTK killed his first victim in 1974, not the sixties. He didn't have two sons but a son and a daughter. He never had a ponytail. He didn't kill his victims in the way the movie would have you believe. The actual events were dramatic enough without some screenwriters turning history into a cheap B-movie. If you are buying this movie expecting to see a documentary forget it, it's about as historical as a Troma movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Motion Picture I have rented this year!!!","review":"This movie is shot on video and looks like it. Poor acting, shoty camera work and cheezy post production editing. I would be shocked if there was actually a script for this movie. Just montage after montage of Satanic rituals with victims, and cattle slaughter house scenes. This movie is a total piece of garbage. Was it shot by a high school kid with a trust fund? Don't bother buying or renting this movie. Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BTK","review":"First of all, I live in Kansas where this all actually happened. I wasn't even born when the BTK killer was on his spree. Infact, I didn't know anything about him until he resurfaced in 2005 and was all over the news. My whole problem with this movie (besides it sucking), is that it wasn't factual. They didn't have time and dates right or even how many people he had killed. He started killing in 74' and his last was in 77' or 78' and he killed 2 men and 8 women. It was just lame overall and not accurate. I would give no stars but you can't do that so I gave it one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicit Animal Cruelity","review":"You know, this director must be STOPPED!!!

In reality, this was not even a B movie... is there such thing as an \\"F\\" movie.I do not think real film was used to for this movie... just cheap Beta tapes and a video camera 1981. Furthermore, the only accurate \\"fact\\" in this movie was the name of the killer. Dear Ulli, BTK did NOT carry around a picnic basket full of scorpions, tarantulas and rats to the crime scenes. And when the \\"Nancy\\" character said \\"I know you... You're the dog catcher\\" I thought I was about to fall off my seat. Dear lord in heaven, please do not rent, buy, borrow or steal this pathetic movie.

After watching at least 2 mins of the other ones, I went to get baptized by Jesus himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I think more money was invested in packaging than in any other part of this movie. The camera had to be a piece of crap, the lighting was atrocious (shadows were everywhere...especially where they shouldnt be), and the script was probably written in under 2 hours. And where did they get those terrible actors? You could almost see them reading q-cards taped to the wall. Ive seen better actors in local car dealership commercials. And the constant footage of animal slaughter added nothing to the movie, except for making it impossible for your stomach to accept any type of snack while watching this lame excuse for a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Save your money! I have sat through some terrible movies, but this one takes the cake. There is no plot. It is a below-low budget movie that looks as if it was recorded on a cell phone. The character on the movie basically repeats the exact same thing with three or four different victims, and the whole time we are subjected to slaughterhouse footage. There is no way to really even know what is being done in the scene at hand. Even the Henry movie, and Dahmer look like 5 star movies compared to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I expected.","review":"After seeing Lommel's \\"Zodiac Killer\\", which I actually thought was a pretty good film as long as you disregard the cheap looking picture quality, I didn't think \\"BTK Killer\\" would be as bad as most other reviewers said it was. Unfortunately, while \\"Zodiac Killer\\" had a plot, this \\"BTK Killer\\" does not. It consists of a number of bad murder scenes with lots of padding in between them.Ulli Lommel has made some good films and some bad ones, so you never quite know what to expect. Take my word for it; this is not one of the good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucks!","review":"I rented this DVD because as others have said, the cover looks pretty decent, but that is the best you are getting from this DVD....

I think I only watched the whole thing because I was in shock that something sucked as bad as this movie.The movie opens with something that you won't want to watch, even if you like gore-porn. The rest of the movie shows either BTK at home talking about nothing interesting with his wife, writing retarded poetry in junkyards, or some stupid journalist type stuff.This is all presented with the worse editing ever... ever!

I know what he is talking about (I'm a bodyworker psychotherapist who works in trauma), and his map is not exactly accurate. He says that the pain body wants to fight. I don't think that is true.

It's a comprehensive collection of the heart of Tolle's teachings.

Most of us probably won't experience realization the way Tolle did, in one spectacular flash. For me it's a process of daily meditation, getting caught up in my ego again, and remembering again to come back, day after day. Still, I trust in the depth of what Tolle has seen; his words are inspiring and point me right back to what I know to be true.

That said, this is a poorly written, repetitive, rip-off of a book. Its scant 54 pages contain the poem/teaching noted in another's review 3 times. The premise of the book can be stated in a simple paragraph.Simplicity is a hallmark of TNH's style. And there are other texts written by him which are clear, gorgeously-written and inspiring. I highly recommend \\"The Path of Emancipation.\\" Read slowly, it is bound to put you in a meditative state.\\"Our Appointment with Life\\" is not a bad book. It is just very thin and more of a disappointment than an appointment for it's $9.95 cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Fooled","review":"This is maybe not what you think.

He says, that the most important reasons were these: to obtain captives (mainly to replace dead), get honor, preserve security or to revenge. Very important thesis of this book is, that economic motivation (i. e. obtain furs) played only minor (and in many cases no) role in Iroquois decisions to go to war. Brandao says, that so called \\"Beaver wars\\" did not in fact exist, especially in 30's and 40's of 17th century. His argumentation is often very good but not (in some cases) absolutely persuasive, because of limitation of primary sources. I think, that book is very usefull reading for all interested in history of North America in the colonial period"},{"rating":"1","title":"There was no real plot","review":"This was just a short encounter in a cafe.

No I have not read this book, but I am very knowledgeable when it comes to probability, and can tell you for a FACT that it is mathematically impossible to win long-term. You literally have a MUCH better chance winning the Powerball lottery! (Not that you should go investing in lottery tickets either.)Someone else made a key point-- the author's experiment was not long-term enough. Also, how do we know his experiment didn't fail 1000 times before he got lucky and succeeded once? Just so he can legally say that he succeeded.Play for fun if it's fun for you, but don't play thinking it'll be a source of income.

Information imparted here is horribly outdated and doesn't appear to have revised since at least the early 80s. It bothers me that Allen pretends to be either a nurse or a doctor in the section on resident health issues when he is in fact neither. I am also confused as to why so much of the chapters on government regulation focus on ADA while there is virtually nothing on the CMS survey process. This book teaches you nothing needed to actually practice as an administrator. The only foreseeable reason I can think of to get this book is to prepare for the NAB test, which is also horribly outdated and seems to be based on this book. The best way to change the culture of a nursing home is to burn this book and scatter the ashes, then never look back."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BOTHER","review":"As stated in the other reviews, I found this book totaly out dated. Numerous typos, organization in some areas > what a mess.

If you have a 9-speed drivetrain, and a flat-bar or other type of handlebar that necessitates using mountain bike type shifters, and you have a road-type crankset with around 52 teeth on the large chainring, this is the front derailleur you need. This configuration is typically found on flat bar road bikes and recumbent bikes. The spring in this derailleur isn't as strong as the spring in other road bike front derailleurs, so the shifting isn't as decisive. On the other hand, if you set this derailleur up properly, you get good, essentialy trouble free performance - just what one would expect from Shimano's mid-range products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Authority","review":"This book and CD ROM is the ultimate authority on all US politics and statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Liszt: The Artist As Romantic Hero by Eleanor Perenyi","review":"This book is simply superb! As a reader of books for over 60 years, I can't think of one better written with its lively style, brilliant insight, and impeccable wit. Eleanor Perenyi more than does justice to Liszt the man, she makes him come alive in all his many-sided, musical genius, and in his generosity of soul. That he was a towering figure of 19th century music is abundantly clear from her book. Alan Walker has more detail, is more scholarly, which is to be expected from a three-volume work. But Ms. Perenyi clearly is the more evocative writer, and brings Liszt to life in a way that I have not found in any other biography. If you can find her book, get it, for it is a gem of writing, and of biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is really old-school electronica from the post-punk age like they do not make it anymore. Robert Rental and Thomas Leer were clearly pioneers of the genre and this CD shows their art at its best. It is remniscent of others such as Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle, but in more melodic and also more electronic. Very hypnotic and bautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good- but is compiled of exerpts from manual for interior souls","review":"This book is good but I didn't realize that it was created by taking certain chapters from Manual for Interior Souls by the same author.

This is one of those albums for me, and the last random trance album purchase I made.Both discs have the uncanny effect of causing me to grit my teeth with an overwhelming urge to pull my hair out. One good thing though. It did help to clarify what not to buy when it comes to electronica. Firstly, if an album cover says \\"Trance Anthems\\" on the front, and Secondly, if there are 20 tracks on each disc...chances are the compilation is going to be pretty dire.Disc 1 gets 2/5 stars, and Disc 2, 1.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mix from the best trance of 2001","review":"This cd has it all.

Easy to get that loose sock feeling, unless you adjust it throughout the foot, to keep the stretch to a minimum at each part. They don't keep my feet that dry/cool either, the area right under the toes gets quite warm/moist---whereas my normal run of the mill white goldtoe socks do not do this. I bought these cause I had recently tried some coolmax type socks, that were really thin and kept my feet a lot cooler. Was hoping for the same experience with these.I would have just given these a rating of three, but actually keeping part of my feet warmer than the generic socks that come in 6 pairs, for a price less than these, at the club_membership style store makes me give it a two.Thinking I should have just gone with the thinner style socks for bikers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Stone","review":"Great for everyday tuning of that edge.

The pad adds enough bulk to the belt that it is visible under clothes and affects how clothes fit, making the clothes themselves uncomfortably tight. The pad also leaves a permanent crease in the non-skid under surface of the belt. It will probably cause damage if used for very long.

Listen now, or forever hold your peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty, Beautiful","review":"Pavement's early sound is every bit as stunning as their later sound, albeit much darker and less polished. The songs here have such a dirty, gritty sound that you might wonder if they weren't recorded beneath 30 feet of quick sand... In other words, this album goes way beyond lo-fi; it's more like subterranean-fi.There are several songs here that are easy to love because they have such a discernably Pavement quality to them... songs like Box Elder, Debris Slide, Summer Babe (of course), and My First Mine. The others, though, are much more alien, and will probably require repeated listens...Once you discover it's raw glory, you'll be mesmirized... as long as you don't mind getting your ears a bit dirty in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible album","review":"I'm with that one guy.

Out of the thirty or so songs on this album, only maybe five are fully fleshed out, the rest is just Pavement f'ing around.Let me be clear-Pavement was a really cool and fun band, but this is not meant to be casually enjoyed. I mean, if you think this music speaks to you or describes anything around you, you are likely in need of shock therapy. Or you're 19 and don't know any better yet.

The only people who claim to like this album claim to like it because everyone who is honest hates it.

It lulls you into believing this is going to be a classic western.A British woman (Inge Rademeyer) travels out west to live with her uncle. In route she is kidnapped by a quiet gun slinging murdering cowboy (Cohen Holloway) who attempts to rape her, but realizes he is not functional. The cowboy drags her around the countryside seeking a cure for his \\"broken\\" manhood.Our woman who is refined and educated provides a stark contrast to the overly stereotyped slow talking dim witted cowboys. As the two characters get to know each other we expect the predictable Stockholm Syndrome to set in when things take a slight twist. It is an interesting and unconventional western. It has action, drama, and humor. Clever, but not spectacular.PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, no sex, rape-like scenes, male rear nudity (Cohen Holloway)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good movie","review":"Starts off slow and stays slow.

Missy Elliots new LP is the best she's done I think yet this is clearly Timbalands worst...he's been giving his best work over to others. Of course, most of the lyrics are banal and hopeless but thats not why you listen to this stuff. Jay-Z stands out amongst a bunch of banal and uninspiring performances. Truly mediocre. I'm not losing complete faith in his work, but he's right to make this his last release as clearly his best work he does with other artists.I like the track 'Serious' and 1 or 2 others...if they were out 3 years ago I'd have been even more excited."},{"rating":"2","title":"why oh why does he keep hurtin nigkas","review":"yo yo this be dat nigka name davo from da chi u know andone thing i have to say is timbaland is da man know bodydoes beats like he he's the one who gave u hey papi timabalandis the best man in producing yesterday today and tomorrow know bodyhas a sound like him he's seperated from da crowed u knowthis album is not the best but its damn good from da intro to iam music which is the last track on the plate"},{"rating":"2","title":"the indecent proposal was too nice","review":"when timberland went to the studio to put these beats together he had a evil genius thing goin on.cuz each song has an unbelievable beat. just straight fire"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I tried to listen to this album without being dissapointed but I just can't help it.

You would think he would put more effort into his own album but that's not the case here.

Merlinnus (more commonly known as Merlin), the castle mage, knows this is dangerous, so he secretly makes a sword in a stone. He lets everyone in the kingdom know that whoever pulls the sword out of the stone will be king. With a little magic he thinks he will help Arthur pull it out. But when the time comes, it doesn't work it out the way Arthur and Merlinnus expect.Not only was this book well-written, but it also had an awesome plot! I liked how Arthur and Merlinnus always had to be on the lookout, because anyone could be a spy, or worse, an assassin. I also liked the ending because there were lots of surprises. The one thing I didn't like was that one of the big \\"mysteries\\" was solved too quickly.I would recommend this book for both boys and girls ages 10-14. If you like this book, Jane Yolen has also written more than 200 books for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one reads the review if the reviewer gives 4 stars.","review":"This book was very entertaining, and surprising. I love books about King Arthur, I mean the legend is just so cool! Or is it history? HA-HA! Jane Yolen's book had a different twist to the King Arthur story. She had all the main parts of the legend--the sword in the stone, Merlin, Arthur as the Bear, the Round Table--but she had little details that made her story...more original in a way. There wasn't a whole lot of action, but it was still an interesting story. Gawen travels to King Arthur's court at the time Merlin is devising a plan to get Arthur's popluarity up and going. So us readers are kind of in the backstage of \\"Escalibur\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"More development could have been useful","review":"Although I figured out less than halfway through who Gawen was, this was an enjoyable book for the most part. There were some parts that could have been developed a bit more, though.

It just drags on and on, and nothing ever changes, Arthur justs moans about how he doesn't want to be king, we hear from Gawaine and his mom ocasionally, and Merlin's mysterious not-quit-an-aprentice. Yes, they are interesting characters, but all they ever do is talk and occasionally travel, they don't DO anything!!!! This story could have been pretty good if Yolen had added a few twists or even just more action for our characters, too bad she didn't. I will give her credit for the end though, it's pretty neat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Book","review":"I thought this was a rather good book. I am very fasinated with King Arthur and I like to read all different books about him. My favorite authors for king arthur books are Marion Zimmer Bradley and Mary Stewart. And now I'm adding Jane Yolen to the collection for and exceptionaly good book. This book was based a little while before Guenevere and Arthur marry. It's all about Merlinnus and Arthur trying to figure out who Morgause's assasin is. Also, Arthur is trying to win the love of his people and with Merlinnus's help he just might do that. Merlinnus creates a sword in the stone and makes sure that everyone knows that whoever pulls the sword will rule England. They make sure that every knight of arthurs every son of morgause's and any other who wished to try to pulls the sword. Well it might have worked out... if someone didn't pull it out first..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting take on a favorite legend","review":"A slightly different interpretation of the story of the sword in the stone told mostly from the view of Merlin.

This novel will want you to keep reading and not want to put it down. The beginning is a LITTLE shaky, and hard to follow, but after about page 20 or so, all the peices fall together and you understand it clearly. The surprise is that a character is actually the opposite gender, and well, that is a surprise. The book presents all of the characters in a creative way, and cleary shows their character.

No more being late..... And the price here was excellent - I saved hundreds of dollars....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine is a Dud -- May not be worth the risk","review":"I got this watch in March. By April, it was no longer keeping time accurately. I always set my watch 5 minutes ahead of time. I went to bed one night and woke up the next morning, and this watch was 7 minutes behind time. I reset the watch, and a month later, same problem.The worst part is that I am not able to reach the Amazon.com warranty department to discuss this issue.I have had an authentic, from the store, Citizen watch for the past 12 years and have never had a problem with it, and certainly not a problem with it keeping time.Other buyers may want to consider the value of purchasing a watch from a retailer with a physical location so that if you have problems with it (who would have expected a TAG to not be able to keep time), you can take it in and have it handled professionally.This will obviously be my last purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Swiss Quality","review":"Of course you can get a watch that keeps time as well as a Swiss watch at a much cheaper price but you can tell the difference in quality. Tag Heuer and this watch has a quality comparable to Omega. It really is an elegant watch and the right balance of not too big but not too small. Elegant but not glitzy a la Palm Springs. It looks in place dining or everyday and will last a long time. If you can get this at Amazon (when available and not always) you will get the best price. The Tag Heuer web site has stated:\\"TAG Heuer does not sell authentic TAG Heuer watches on the Web. Therefore, a watch purchased on the Web from any other retailer may be counterfeit, damaged, tampered with, or contain inferior parts.\\"However, because of this Amazon does offer a 2 year warrenty since the Tag Heuer warrenty card is missing when you get the watch (gray market).

My friend loves it. (This is his first rowing machine, and we have had it for about two weeks, so take our recommendation with that grain of salt.) Although it is true that it doesn't really fold very much for storage, its lighter weight and shorter length to begin with makes it easy to store. The assembly instructions are poorly written; more of an assembly part reference than detailed instructions. However, everything was there and the machine works very well. Assembly is easy if you are patient and verify your steps before you tighten everything down. I certainly recommend it for beginners. Based on the warnings about worn parts (seat \\"wheels\\" and shocks), I have saved the instructions to order replacement parts later, if necessary. Moving parts wear out. Deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Delivery. Durable. Quiet. 90min to assemble. Feels good.","review":"Weighs about 48lbs. I can stand it up agst the wall - no problem. Previously I had the $125 TracGlider 1050. I had to weld one of the arms about 2.5 years into it. It lasted about 3 years then the frame gave way. I was pleased with it but Stamina 1205 has a 5 year warranty and is a little heavier (about 10 lbs) which I hope equals durability. Took me about 60-75 minutes to assemble it. It feels sturdier than the TracGlider and I like it better. The foot rests work better. Quiet. I feel the workout more than the TrackGlider. For the extra $25 you get better durability which is reflected in the 5 yr warranty. The 'action' feels smoother. I think I will be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable piece of junk","review":"This is the first and only product I have ever bought through Amazon that I have had to return. This rowing machine is a huge waste of time and energy as the pistons are so poorly calibrated that it is unusable.After assembling the rower, one piston was so tight that it took every bit of my effort to get it to move on the lowest setting. No amount of calibration was going to make the machine usable in the least.I know other reviewers mentioned that the pistons wear out quickly. However, potential buyers need to know that the pistons may not even work to begin with. If you are determined to get a Stamina rower, the lower priced model works much, much better. However, it too will wear out after a few months of daily use. But, that is months more use than I got from ordering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Someone gave me a Stamina rower as a gift. I used it twice and the wheel broke. Fairly simple to fix right? I called the company and they were extremely hard to get through to and they constantly transferred me to the department that was supposedly going to help me get a replacement wheel. Then, EVERY TIME they transferred me I never got through to this department that supposedly existed to replace the wheel- the line always hung up. I've never received a replacement and called for weeks. I thought I might try to balance on the one wheel but the squeaks were too much. Oiling is necessary and I only used it a few times. The upkeep on the machine and the horrible service from the company were ridiculous. I am not sure if the rower I got was the same as this one but it looks the same and it doesn't matter- the company is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap shocks","review":"One of the shocks broke at the weld the third time I used it. While I was waiting for the company to send me a new pair of shocks my husband replaced the shock with a 25 year old scwinn brand rower shock. Then the other shock broke and hubby put the other scwinn on. I've been happily rowing on it for over a month now and it does have a comfortable seat but I hope the scwinn shocks last because the replacements that the company sent me don't look any better than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good economical machine","review":"For the money, this rower is pretty good. After a month, however, it started to squeak where the arms join the shocks. The seat runs very smoothly and so quietly along the 'runners' (which I really like), and is cushioned nicely. There is a big difference in tension between the first (lowest) setting and the second setting, especially at first; but after rowing for several minutes, the shocks seem to 'loosen up' a bit, and become easier. The foot braces are a bit large for my feet, without shoes, so the average person may want to wear shoes. The padding on the handle bars was worn away in places within the first month; this is with 4-5 days/week use. I have never used any other kind of rowing machine, so I have nothing else to compare it to. Perhaps a little more money spent on a more expensive rower would be worth it, however, for my budget, this rower works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY THIS URELIABLE PRODUCT","review":"I bought this rower new 8 months ago and typically use it 4 times a week for 30 minutes. So far, it's gone through 4 pairs of failed shocks. Some leaked hydraulic oil and eventually their lost resistance and some just lost their resistance without leaking. Some took up to 3 months to fail and a couple of them failed immediately right out of the box.Initially Stamina was pretty good about replacing them but now when I call, since it's out of warranty, I'm essentially told to go pound sand. During one of my calls their customer service reps actually told me that \\"it's not meant to be used every day\\". I find this just unbelievable!

Trying to be a good citizen, I called Stamina first and was told that they would send me new higher quality rollers at once. After about 10 business days, (they had told me 5-7) I called back. The parts are on back order.The roller only got worse, and now is unusable.So I have a useless rower in the basement. Unbeatable sales will not take it back, and 3 weeks later i still do not have replacement rollers.I know it is my fault for not figuring out the issue (during return period) before I had to leave the country, but obviously I had a few things on my mind at the time.Stamina needs to get it's part supplies figured out, and I would not order from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stamina 1205 - Heavyduty frame, otherwise poor reliability.","review":"This rower has a very well built frame...but that's where it stops...!!

Machine took about an hour to set up, my husband and I tried to row the first right after it was set up and we could barely pull back the arms. The shocks were so tight. My husband ways 240 and he could barely pulls the handle bars back on resistance level 1. We called the company, they sent out another pair of replacement shocks. The replacement shocks had the same problem, too tight.

Would not recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest resistance a joke","review":"The rower is sturdy, and im 5'1 and it was a great fit. It wasn't difficult to put together but the problem is its impossible to use even on the lowest resistance setting. The hydraulic shocks were impossible to move at the lowest tension setting, and if I did get them back it wasn't an even pull back for both arms. I didn't even want to bother getting replacements since every review I've read about the replacements are just as pathetic as much as dealing with the ones it came with.

Personally, I would not recommend it for use by anyone near 200 pounds. Perhaps 170 is a better maximum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This machine doesn't take up a lot of room. It will really give you a workout! I've had it for about 1 month & use it twice a week on my non-running days to get a workout but let my legs rest. Very happy wih my purchase :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good money's worth","review":"I purchased this rower because my knees won't allow me to run anymore.....I'm pushing sixty......the stamina 1205 is just what I needed. I have had several rowers in the last thirty years, and this one is, by far, the best. Putting it together was fairly straight forward, and took less than an hour. You might as well be lifting weights if you set this thing on a difficult setting.....I put it at about 25 percent difficulty and use it for cardio. I am up to 800 rows, and this takes about twenty minutes. My goal is 1000/day, five times weekly...then maybe.....maybe.....I will increase the difficulty levels. I feel I get an excellent workout, I am losing weight and gaining tone, and I feel better than I did before I started. I think the construction of the stamina 1205 is excellent, and I would have given the unit five stars, except I feel like I am going to wear the wheels out on the seat........but it hasn't happened yet. If is does, I will just replace them...this is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of $$ - better quality has to be out there.","review":"We bought this machine about 9 months ago. The pistons were always squeeky. We used it very lightly and then stoppped using it for the past 6 months and then tried to use it again tonight. The \\"shock\\" # 11 piece that is welded to the knob (attached to the Hex Bold (# 29) broke and fell off tonight. I am so dissappointed because it is not part of the frame and is thus not covered under the warranty. For as little as we used this piece of equipment, it is ridiculous that a piece fell off. It is really a shame because we were excited by this affordable piece of exercise equipment. Goes to show that you should pay a little more for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter didn't enjoy this!","review":"My daughter has had trouble with her \\"tummy time\\" since day one. She always cries whenever I try to put her on her tummy. I thought that if I could make it fun for her, that she might begin to enjoy herself. I received this product, and from her first try until her 10th try she absolutely hated it. She kept reaching down and grabbing at the mat, this prevented her from using her hands to push herself around in a circle. I think that laying on that swivel hurt her stomach, too. I gave it away just a couple weeks after receiving it. It didn't work for my daughter, but it might work for someone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good toy","review":"my kid hated tummy time so i got this. he hates this even more. my friends' kid, who likes tummy time hates it also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but product could use some improvements","review":"The mat is too small and is not rigid enough. Unless your baby is on the small side for the recommended age range of the product, they will soon outgrow the mat. Also, the mat is soft and doesn't stay put when in use causing for constant adjustments during play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter waste of money","review":"After great experiences with smaller Lamaze toys for my infant (especially the sensory cube) and after a remark by the pediatrician that my infant was a bit behind with rolling over and such due to GERD issues that limited time on her tummy or flat on her back, I bought this item. While it's attractive, it did nothing more than what and ordinary Boppy or even a blanket on the floor would have done for her. In fact, concentrating pressure on her torso shifted her reflux into overdrive.What a waste of money for us. However, the mat will make a nice wall decoration in the nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my child","review":"I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore for my daughtet, when it got to my home I opened it and set it up which was really easy. When it was all put together it didn't look like something I wanted to put my daughter on. I was afraid it was going to tip over. It didn't look like it would suppport her. If she wasn't on it just right it looked like it would tip over. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tummy time life saver","review":"I read about this product in a parenting magazine and immediately decided to purchase it. I looked on several web sites and read many reviews before coming to Amazon to buy. This is one of the top 3 purchases I've made for my child!!! Before this little item came along my daughter would scream in frustration during tummy time and become almost inconsolable if we tried it for more than 2 minutes. I did every conceivable thing to make tummy time better for her with no luck. The moment I put her on the spinner she was interested and alert, NO CRYING!Naturally we started slowly with 5 minute intervals and have been working our time up but the fact that there are no more tears of frustration makes this thing worth it's weight in gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and uncomfortable","review":"My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help for tummy time","review":"I bought this hoping it would help the little one enjoy tummy time more. He hated being on his tummy and face planted whenever we tried. Because he has a mild case of torticollis, the pediatrician emphasized how important tummy time was so he could strengthen and stretch his neck. This item has made tummy time easier on him and has help strength his neck quite a bit. It's nice because he is up a little higher and is forced to lift his head. The only draw back, which is noted in almost every review, is the fact that the mat doesn't stay put. While on it, he will grab the toys or mat itself which will cause it to scrunch up. Overall, I think it was a great buy since it's helped so much with his neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on the baby","review":"The usefulness of this product really depends on the baby. My daughter HATED tummy time and this product made no difference. I wouldn't pay full price for this again without trying it out first. It's a great concept, but doesn't hold up in reality. And it would only be useful for a month or two. Maybe the mat would be fun later without the lady bug in the middle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My granddaughter cried everytime we put her on it, she's 5 months","review":"We had hoped this would make tummy time a happy time, instead it seemed to make her so mad and uncomfortable, I just put it back in the box after 3 tries even adding padding for her stomach. I do not recommend this for any baby, not if they have the same reaction like my granddaughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"22 lb weight limit","review":"This item seems like a great idea only my son has almost reached the weight limit of 22 lbs. at only 5 months old. This is about the time a baby would only start to enjoy such a toy. And the flower part is not big enough all the way around for him to be able to see everything on it. You also have to make sure you don't feed the baby right before putting them on this because they will spit up as it pushes on their tummies too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my money","review":"My son was/is not interested in this product. He may tolerate it for a minute or 2, but that's not worth $40 to me. I was really excited about this, in hopes that he would enjoy his tummy time more, but that just was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"I bought this playmat for my 8 week old and she hated it. Everytime I put her on it, she would get uncomfortable and cry. I guess it would work better with babies who have already developed enough neck support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interested","review":"I bought this for my daughter and she never liked it. She hated the base that you rest on. She did like the mat with all the various sounds. I wouldn't suggest this for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamaze spinner","review":"I liked the piece of equipment,but the baby was a bit too old for it - 5 mos. I'm not sure a baby younger than that would do much with the product. Suggest they make it a bit larger, so larger babies can use.

I simply want to draw readers' attention to the fact that this DVD was edited terribly. In short, there is no proper ending!What a huge disappointment--and waste of money. After watching Polly Purebred get into a scrape in a haunted house, and calling for Under Dog, my 7 yo and I (with nostalgic anticipation) waited for Under Dog to break out of his cell to save the day. Instead, Polly shouting for Under Dog was the END of the cartoon!Since Under Dog doesn't save the day, I suggest you save your money and buy something with an ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended and well done.","review":"Spot on, just as I remember.

I am extrememly disappointed and since it's been a while, there's nothing I can do about it and no one to complain to but blogging here.

It's been so long since I read this book and not being from California or even a big fan of the state I can honestly say that if you'll stick with reading this book cover to cover you will be amazed and astounded at the information contained in this oddly titled book. Originally purchased back in the late eighties (a first edition copy) as apart of research into the JFK assassination, the insight gained by reading this book was really remarkable and well worth the time. I highly recommend this book if for no other reason than ya might like to learn of Audie Murphy's background and interest in death of JFK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 9MM","review":"I love the version of this that I use for my 38 specials but I'm not a fan of this one. It should not advertise \\"9MM\\". 9MM fits extremely sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it is a good box","review":"It is a plastic box, what can you really say about it. It works as advertised but 9MM cartridges are just a little bit loose in there. It is still a long shot better than a torn up cardboard box in the bottom of my range bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"On time good price","review":"Love this product. Good way to take ammo to range.

As I use both 9 mm Luger and 9X18 Mak, boxes that store both are a premium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds ammo but not a snug fit","review":"Have to agree with MKMS on this one. Very sloppy fit for the 9mm. In a bullet up position, it fits fine. Great box for the money but must be designed for a larger caliber.Box closes and locks just fine and saves a lot of room in my ammo box. I will rate it with 5 stars because it really has no major flaws.I must also add that after I received the boxes, I did find them in a privately owned gun store for $1.00 less but no big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little case","review":"If you buy bulk ammo (like I do), this is a perfect storage container for the range or locker. I bought 5 because I buy my 9mm in 500's. I will be buying more for other ammo calibers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice .380 ACP Ammo Box","review":"I bought this for my .380 auto to carry ammo to the range and spent brass back home for reloading.

A good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds the ammo, but not how I wanted it to.","review":"The ammo case is well made and is sturdy to hold the ammo. I gave it 4 stars because the case wasn't able to hold the ammo bullet down. When you placed the bullet like that. It would be slant and wiggle in the hole. But other than, its a good buy. Just make sure you have the bullet right side up so it wont move. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice Ammo Box for 9mm Luger","review":"MTM make the best ammo boxes out there, I also bought 4 of them, and they look good, durable, and useful, plus very reasonable prices!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job of a box quite well.","review":"My only complaint about this particular item is the noise that is made by the shells once they are in it. Because you are talking about plastic on metal, you have to either dampen each individual round or the whole box with a cloth over the tops of the rounds to reduce noise. If you are only using these to get rid of the multitude of cardboard ammo boxes, you are in luck as it works flawlessly. I really would suggest getting some cloth squares for sound dampening though. Old blankets and towels work great for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTM 100 round flip top ammo case","review":"I bought this to store 100 round boxes of ammo for my 9mm. The 100 round Winchester box comes loose so the bullets just roll around inside the box. This little box is perfect to hold them in place and keep them from banging together. The case has good clasps to keep it shut and it is very sturdy. I also like the fact that it is made in the USA. I would have given 5 stars if I could put the bullets in upside down. The case only allows you to put the bullet in top up. This makes it a little more difficult to get the rounds out. Otherwise, good product for a good price. Fits well in small range bags as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Purchased this item to hold my 9mm ammo. Box is lightweight, yet very strong/supportive. 9mm ammo barely moves around the lid closes securely. Overall, many other products are out there that are more expensive but have negative reviews due to breakages in the latch system. So far, after 1 mo of frequent use, I see no stress signs in the plastic and will likely be ordering the same item if I ever require more bullet storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"product was as described. very rugged material and put together well. much better than cheaper (and ever more expensive) similar boxes. get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"I have purchased 2 so far and will be getting more.

Seriously?","review":"After reading the mostly positive reviews of this film my family and I decided to check it out for ourselves. This first half of the movie is awfully slow and we almost turned it off. A woman(Mira Sorvino) goes to a secluded cabin for some alone time, but there is a ghost(Shane West) trying to communicate with her. Will it try to harm her of help her? Another ghost shows up later in the movie with a gift for gab, but the primary ghost doesn't mutter a word until the very end of the movie. West's ghost character walks around with an angst-ridden look on his face for 1 and 1/2 hours and then let's out a moan and two words at the conclusion. We stuck with it, and by the end it became more interesting - I like the idea of ghosts whispering things into people's ears, giving them strange ideas. Overall, it was worth watching but far from the great movie that many have claimed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting and scenery","review":"The main actors and the scenery are great, but I never did get the point of this story, who these ghosts were, what they were trying to accomplish, what they whispered in people's ears, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I could not agree more with the other 1 star critics the movie is all bad I through it away after an hour or so of viewing.......What crap!!!!

It had no plot and it didnt tell you who anyone was. I am so angry that i spent a dollar at the red box to see it. Seriously I will bet that everyone the rated this movie is an art student. Horrible film, your better off just sending me a dollar and I will burn it for you so you dont waste your life on this. Id have to say the best part about it was that it was only an hour and 20 minutes, even tho it shouldn't have gone longer then the title screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Warfare...","review":"THE PRESENCE is either a supernatural thriller or the story of a woman's mental disorder. Regardless of which, this movie tells its story in a fascinating way. Mira Sorvino (MIMIC) plays the woman who stays at an isolated cabin, haunted by what appears to be a silent spectre. There is no dialogue for the first 17 minutes, allowing the dreary images and spooky happenings to unfold quietly. Soon, the woman is joined by both human (the boyfriend) and spiritual (hallucinatory?) visitors. She is driven to near madness and must combat the author of the voices she \\"hears\\". I'm still not certain what is real and what could be imaginary. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Laughable.

This was a really good movie, one of the best scary/suspense movies that we've seen in a long time. Sorvino is a great actress, this is the second movie that I've seen her in within the last year or so and both I was really impressed with her acting. Lots to like about this movie, the story was very interesting, good music, the scenery was beautiful, it felt original, it kept us interested all the way through. They didn't resort to typical cliches, they didn't cheese it up with nudity or oops it's started raining and the actress just happens to have a white tank on with no bra type scenes...they kept it strictly above board and authentic feeling and I'm impressed with the movie. The ending was satisfying too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Gothic ghost story w/ some very original twists","review":"I love movies like The Haunting (original) and The Innocents, so when I caught this movie at a preview screening, I was in love. The online trailer doesn't represent this one properly -- it's a real thinking man's ghost story, with a ton of atmosphere and a really original way of drawing the audience into the story. Beautifully shot & cut, solid performances, intelligent writing, full of romantic and spiritual undercurrents, this one really sticks with you. A true gem of a thriller, The Presence is well worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I'm very happy with this book.

I was rather concerned when it arrived flattened and in a bag rather than upright in a box, but my fears were for nothing. The hat popped right up and was in perfect condition.

Even for summer trash reading, this book is a zero. The subtitle of it being about the FBI is a joke, unless you want to believe that the agency is nothing but a bunch of paper pushers with one dangerous agent they can't keep under control, yet he consistently saves the day.

Now bluetooth application was more difficult to figure out. I have two desktop and two laptops and I was able to achieve sync via bluetooth only to my new Mac G5. I found sync via bluetooth on window based computer to be almost impossible. Also, although the ads promise ability to connect to sony ericsson phones via bluetooth easily, I found it impossible.

Its layout, done by the author, is a bit quirky...but it's all part of the fun. What a magnificent effort.

My biggest criticism of this book is the fact that it repeatedly talks about the fact that price movements are more often than not difficult to fit into Elliott theory. The author fails to actually show what we should be looking at in the charts to apply the theory to practice. He shows us a number of simple theoretical charts of possible price movements but it would have been a lot more helpful to go through wave analysis for an index in practice showing us the pitfalls to watch out for. Granted, price action is always unique but such examples would allow the reader the opportunity to understand the application of the theory. The writing style is also somewhat superior which started to grate on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Book, Somewhat Dated","review":"An interesting introduction to Elliott Wave theory. The book is somewhat dated (published in 1995), and I'd recommend getting something published more recently, or perhaps the book by Elliott himself \\"Nature's Law,\\" although an old book, at least you'd be getting the theory from the inventor of the theory!The book is filled with opinions about what was happenning in the stock market in the early 90's, and many of his forcasts turned out to be wrong, making the book difficult to read. I really enjoyed the first few chapters, but got irritated as he went into more detail about the theory and made his forecasts.Who is R. Beckman anyway? In the 80's he believed we were in for a second depression. He hasn't written anything since \\"Elliott Wave Explained.\\" If you look for him on the Net, he is nowhere to be found. In the book he talks about what a wonderful investor he is, but can that be verified? He's not even mentioned in Wikipedia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice selection","review":"There are a lot of Irakere compilations out there, and most of them are very different from each other.This one is not very comprehensive regarding the different stages of the group, but it is comprehensive in the sense of reflecting the band styles perfectly.There's a lot that has been said about this cuban supergroup describing their sound as a mixture of cuban traditional with jazz and classical. The CBS compilation The Best of Irakere gives more importance to their cuban-latin roots more than anything, but \\"Toda Cuba baila con... Irakere\\" gives a much better perspective on the band featuring a version of Scott Joplin's \\"The entertainer\\", \\"Estela va estallar\\" (by the way, one of the very best compositions by Chucho Vald��s) , variations on a Beethoven opera and a Mozart Adagio, and of course their best known piece \\"Misa Negra\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely follows the series","review":"Long long ago in the 70's when I was a kid I got to watch Danger: UXB on PBS with my mom. Feeling a little nostalgic I decided to pick up the TV series again to see if it was as good as I remembered. While ordering the DVD I saw there was a book from the series and decided to order it. While the story telling is a little flat and impersonal, like an off-stage person describing a play or tv show, there are some excellent descriptions that elaborate on things the TV series didn't show as well. I'm rating this one 4 stars mainly because the author was very true to the series. I was hoping for more elaboration on the TV series plot but really this mainly followed the series and you don't get as much of Sgt.

Also, when Jesus asks her for the image, she was overwhelmed and concerned; the demeanor the protagonist displays in this movie is not in line with the disposition of a saint.

There are a few others like this, but it doesn't really take much away from the educational value of the game so long as someone realizes that the alleged answer is incorrect.

There was no way to walk away early and keep say 500,000 dollars, and if you lost you didn't get 25,000 as long as you'd made it that far, like in the show. This combined with the fact that one person goes at a time makes it barely a competition at all.There is no reason why this game should cost more than 5 dollars.

Routinely my cat sits on the enclosure and watches my turtle and occasionally will pounce on the glass, startling the turtle and send him back into the water.We placed the scat mat right over the window so our cat would not sit on it or peer through it. Our cat learned his lesson and just moves the mat to the side by touching the points that are not electrified.I'm not sure if my cat is especially bright or if this is a common occurrence. The mat now sits in a closet, useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scatmat for pets","review":"Works well and my dog has stopped jumping up on the counters. The small size is still pretty big.

I tested this mat out on myself first with the high setting, I decided to keep the shock to medium/ low setting for my cat as she is a petite 12 lb cat. Kitty likes to hop on the counter then on the top of the fridge then on top of the cabnites near the ceiling, I don't need paw prints on my counter thank you very much, much less the germs from the litter box or walking round on the floor where I prepare food. Well to test the mat I put the setting on medium and put the mat in a doorway I prefer my cat not use, she jumped two feet in the air and ran so fast I could not help but laugh, needless to say she has not used that doorway since then. I will leave this on the kitchen counter for a few days(I'll be sure to clear the area) to ensure kitty learns to stay off the counter. I also bought the power adapter...need to teach kitty to stay of some furniture i'll be getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received it!","review":"I ordered this thing about a month ago and STILL haven't received it.

The authors rightly point to the convergence of the bias of funders and nonprofit leaders to only invest in programs and not organizational performance improvement. They present a well-researched case that this mono-focus on investing in new programs and not the structural needs of nonprofits results in less than desireable outcomes. Our intention at the Center for Excellence in Nonprofits is to use this book to help educate the philanthropic community and nonprofit leaders in the need to better balance the altruistic urge to use every penny for client service with the need to develop the internal capacity of these organizations to continously improve their deliver systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Performance Nonprofit Organizations: Managing Upstream for Greater Impact","review":"Good coverage of the topic. An easy-to-read format with good examples to illustrate the principles and/or concepts.The authors are american and are writing from an american perspective with all the examples based in the US.

I don't care who you are, you won't convince me otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb album","review":"This album is just absolutly superb. The closest listening experience I''ve had is when I first listened to The Velvet Underground and Niko. A wonderfull almost creapy feeling came over me. Some people have complained about vocals? It seems to me that a lot of people have had these fake auto-tuned Brittney Spears-like voices drummed into their heads and they think that that's what vocals should sound like. Buy this album. You WILL NOT regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Words Describe?","review":"Jeff Mangum sings the things most of us don't dare say aloud, both beautifully, and tragically.

It may not appeal to everyone's tastes, but not everyone has good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled","review":"WOW! This is one of the most touching records I have heard in a very long time. The production of the record is so unconventional and strikingly beautiful. While at times there is a lot going on, each song is bathed in pure pop genius which is well complemented by a strong foundation, with sometimes humorous, often ironic, and always very moving lyrics. If you are tired of the sameness of conventional pop records, fret not; the overall sound of this record and of the songs themselves make this album stand out in a way few others can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre, Lovely, Haunting, Weird, Unique....","review":"Wow, what a CD! And how do you explain over 370 reviews for a CD that no one has ever heard of? I only came across NMH because I was looking for another CD, and then I read about this other CD, which recommend NMH....etc.....I think everyone else has said it in previous reviews, but I just want to add that Holland, 1945 is one song which I just can't get out of my mind...and that's a good thing!Anyone interested in alternative, eclectic, original music really need to check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Great sound and refreshingly enough, a bit different from the usual tripe. Never would have thought I'd have enjoyed the melodies produced by some of the instruments they use (some sounding strangely akin to bagpipes on one track) so much. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"it broke the glass off my monitor, get singing lessons!","review":"I really think singing lessons are a path in which this artist needs to travel. Although I really do not believe the lessons will help that much. As for the music it should be recorded at a higher volume to cover up the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!","review":"sorry to burst any bubbles here... but I guess we all critique ability & passion differently. This album NEVER grew on me like it did so many here. I find it to be a painful listening, not beautiful one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece?? WHAT?! Seriously???","review":"First off, I'm a musician... I like abstract music... So after hearing a bunch of people rave about this LP, I had to pick it up. Sounded like it'd be right up my alley! So I put the CD on... One word, TERRIBLE! I've tried to listen to this album numerous times but the off key whiney vocals and amateur songwriting put me off. Seriously, do people say this is a masterpiece just to be cool? It cant be because of the music.. OK, let me be fair, maybe there is 5 minutes worth of music on this disc that is remotely enjoyable. Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy something good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL VOCAL TUNE","review":"granted they make the most interesting and innovative music... but really when it comes to an actual song... you know the part where you have a good vocal melody... COMPLETELY LACKING.its almost tiring... now if they took away his vocals from the music... it might make a great instrumental album. there's no merit in his vocal tune at all.a lot of indie bands suffer from this... great instrumentals but unimaginative vocal melodies. i mean really thats what makes a good song a good song. it has to be the whole package. good lyrics and good backing music does not equal a good song unless there is a good vocal melody. sigh c'mon guys you can do better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrgggh, that voice!","review":"I like Jeff Magnum's interesting (albeit twisted and inscrutable) musical ideas for the most part. The songwriting is good.It's just that the execution is lousy. It really leaves a LOT to be desired. I mean, sometimes I can live with a lead singer that doesn't have a great voice. I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to music, and if a band isn't really technically great but is still doing something interesting, then usually I'll like it -- great voice or not. But boy oh boy, Magnum's voice just busts through that tolerance threshold like a wrecking ball. This guy's voice is HORRIBLE with a capital H. It's so far off key most of the time that all I can do is cringe and punch the \\"off\\" button on my stereo. My musically-trained ears just can't take it.It's too bad, really, because I wanted to like this band. I like warped psychedelic stuff that takes musical ideas and twists them into something strange and interesting. But the guy just can't sing, and that ends it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the?","review":"Manic wailing and barely-in-tune strumming do not equal genius, no matter what. I've heard coffee-shop bards that sound better than this dude."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"How did this guy get an album? Perhaps he created it since it sounds like it was made in a trash can. The vocals are horrible and every other word in the thesaurus for horrible. Maybe someone in india would like it. So send all copies of this cd on an aeroplane over the sea..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's swell.","review":"I have no idea what this CD is about. Most of the songs are full of nonsense lyrics. It reminded me of GBV. I still like it. The songs are a litte rusty sounding, but most of them are catchy. I listen to it often in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"proceed with caution","review":"I first listened to this album a few years ago and wasn't very impressed. Every now and then I give it a spin since so many people seem to think it's godly. To this day I still can't get into it. I can see why someone might though. They have a cool sound here with lush acoustics and marchingband trumpets and a few nice woshes and such adding texture to the songs. Unfortuanety it can't hide the bland, dull arrangements and cliched melodies that plague most of the album. I give it two stars though because there are a few gems(the first one and Communist Daughter stick out), but not enough to make up for headache inducing, dull as a rock type of songs like Oh, Comely, Two Headed Boy, and Hollad, 1945. If all the hype has you curious, proceed with caution. Download a few songs first before forking over the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not for everyone...","review":"The sweeping scope of words used in reviews to describe the sounds of Neutral Milk Hotel certainly mislead the average listener. Neutral Milk Hotel is interesting, complex, and off the beaten path. However, one would definitely put this album and artist into the \\"acquired taste\\" file. This by no means detracts from the artist, but \\"hypnotic, psychadelic, melodic, greatest\\" etc.- these adjectives should not be used lightly- and are probably not the most appropriate for this album. Listen to samples before you buy to see if it is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals make this an unpleasant experience.","review":"This album was recommended to me by several different sources, including Amazon and my local record store, which had \\"mandatory indie classic\\" in a sticker on the disc. I tried it out a couple of times and Mangum's voice just takes away from everything else for me. I just could not get into this \\"experience\\" and traded the disc back in. I agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody. If you can get over the vocals, by all means enjoy this album. As for me, the vocals were just too much, or maybe not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album ever","review":"This is obviously an incredibly personal album for NMH frontman Jeff Mangum. Somehow, in spite of it's inwardness, or maybe because of it, I've gained the same personal attachment to the album. I don't want to give the impression that this is some kind of \\"emo\\" album... Rather than whining about lost girlfriends, Jeff Mangum fills his songs with surrealist, Barrett-esque imagery that may or may not be about Anne Frank. How can a voice so nasal, folky acoustic guitars, horns and fuzz be so catchy? I don't know. But there is a special part of my brain reserved for this album, just for playing it in my head. Simply perfect. \\"The only girl I ever loved was born with roses in her eyes but then they buried her alive one evening 1945 with just her sister at her side...\\" Beauty. I love this album. How can anyone with a soul not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pain, the Pleasure","review":"I had the absolute privilege of hearing Jeff play several of these songs live, it is one of those out-of-body experienced when you forget to breathe. although the album cannot reproduce the beauty of the live show, it is a suitable replacement. this album is not so much a collection of songs as much as a cohesive body of work, almost theatrical in its range and emotion. A great, rainy day, melancholy, album with bursts of elation and poetry to run you through the gamut. a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty, Oh so pretty","review":"If you're looking for new summer music, look no further. Catchy tunes, acoustic guitar and a guy playing the saw. I'm leaving out a lot of other stuff of course. Think the 90's equivalent of the Violent Femmes. Check out the sound samples of the first three songs. If you like it, you probably should buy it.I say again, great summer music."},{"rating":"1","title":"all style/ no substance","review":"bought this per amazons recommendations...this was the cd that made me go buy a new computer, one with the capacity to download music samples. while i've made my mark buying on intuition and research(1000+ LP&CDs)this was the worst, and i won't make that mistake again...way overhyped.."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. No, no, no, no.","review":"The lesson to be learned here is \\"that which is bizarre is not necessarily brilliant.\\" Nor is it indicative of talent.\\" Use your money for something far more rewarding - take your mom out to lunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Unique and Quirky(tm)","review":"Absurdism is such a lost art in popular music that once the public gets their first taste of it, they're ready to declare their discovery the holy grail. Unfortunately this music is far too shallow and twee to justify the supreme heavy-handedness of sexual lyrics about Anne Frank, among other transparent attempts at \\"twisted\\" \\"whimsy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong......","review":"Sorry. I just don't get. His nasally voice makes me cringe and at times the music seems one dimensional and boring. I was extremely disappointed with an album that had phenomenal praise from a myriad of qualified sources. However to be fair, I have not given it more than three listenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the hipsters fool you","review":"This is the most painfully pretentious pile of dreck ever produced. I know quite a few people who swear that Neutral Milk Hotel are the greatest thing since Oreos, but the off-key singing, overwrought lyrics that try REALLY hard to be deep and touching and the headache inducing lo-fi production make this one of the least impressive widely loved albums. Actually, It's a mystery to me why people like this band so much. I mean... I understand that you have to like some things to be considered hip, but Neutral Milk Hotel cover up talentless bass playing by layering so much fuzz on the bass that there is a low-end buzz through the whole album that makes my teeth hurt. Do yourself a favor, listen to the song \\"Demented Man\\" from Warrior on the Edge of Time by Hawkwind. Every Neutral Milk Hotel song is an attempt by a sad hipster to duplicate this rad tune from the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! THIS ALBUM STINKS! KEEP AWAY!","review":"I read the reviews here and thought this must be a great album. Boy, was I mislead. I like experimenting with new music more than most, and can easily buy 100 CDs a year. But this one is an easy miss. The lead singer wails in a tone that is nearly unlistenable. The music is not catchy nor very revolutionary. All in all, I was thoroughly disappointed and left wondering who in the world would have written a positive review. My only guess is that the band members were able to coax some friends into sending in positive reviews. Use your money more wisely - light a cigar with a ten spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals make entire album unlistenable...","review":"Sorry, I can't give a proper review of this album because the vocals are so entirely unlistenable. After hearing Olivia Tremor Control's brilliant \\"Dust At Cubist Castle\\", I was lead to believe that The Elephant Six group was on to something big. Not so -- after buying this terrible album, and The Apples (In Stereo)'s mediocre \\"Fun Trick Noisemaker\\", I am staying away from any other Elephant Six music... I'll stick with The Olivia Tremor Control... one of the best bands since the 60's. Buy \\"Dust At Cubist Castle\\", and \\"Black Foliage\\" instead of this album. Jeff Magnum is only riding on OTC's success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD for the Tone-Deaf","review":"I eagerly anticipated this CD based on the many favourable reviews listed here, but I was sorely disappointed. The vocals are horribly off-key and remind me of raking finger nails on a chalk-board.It appears that people feel passionately about this CD -- they either love it or hate it. Not for music-lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THE BEST, but worth it.","review":"Songs 3, 4 and 5 are crucial. They are only songs that I consider worth owning the album over. Scratch that; these three songs are so good, I don't mind paying $15 for the other eight as well.The other songs aren't bad, but they don't stand out to me as much. Who knows, you might love those songs as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I just don't get it","review":"I had bought other Elephant 6 releases from the Apples and OTC, so I thought this was worth a try, based on the reviews. I've listened and listened, and have come to some conclusions about it:First, some of the songs are pretty imaginative and have good, unique melodies. Mangum has songwriting talent. He also writes very weird, skewed, abstract lyrics that I can't figure out at all -- which according to most reviewers here, is a good thing, I guess...The thing that ruins it for me, though, is his voice. I can't get past it. I tried to like it more, but I can't. Unconventional voices are fine with me -- I like Bob Dylan, for instance -- but I just wince at Mangum's \\"attempts.\\" OUCH!There's some talent here, definitely. The ideas are good. But the album, taken as a whole, is just not something I can listen to without wishing that the execution were better than it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blah blah blah... great","review":"[...] I do believe that it is awesome. The songs are catchy... And the lyrics don't make sense... which is what is fun about them. They are buried so deeply in metaphor that half of what is great about listen to them is figuring out what the hell he is saying. And even if you can't figure exactly what he means, you still get the feeling behind his voice. And yes, he can't sing entirely well. Not that he is bad, he's just so different and insane sounding that it isn't the traditional \\"good\\" singing that we expect.

If you have any qualms about this one, listen to the title track or Holland, 1945. You'll (hopefully) be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album... for the right listener","review":"This is probably one of my 10 favorite albums ever released; there is nothing revolutionary about it & all the songs are based on very simple chord combinations, but it is beautiful none-the-less. The lyrics have a dreamlike quality to them. Still I imagine some people would hear this album and be turned off by it immediately. Vocalist Jeff Mangum can hold a tune, but his voice is rough and I imagine some listeners would find it quite grating. Still, this is probably one of the best Indie rock albums ever produced (and one of the shining jewels of the Elephant Six collective). For anyone into indie rock this album will probably be a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":".... One Of THOSE Albums","review":"If you can't already tell from reading these reviews, people have very strong opinions about this record. Neutral Milk Hotel have created a work - to me, a piece of art - without the high production quality and targeted marketing of so many hot new bands' \\"classic\\" albums. No, this album's appeal lies in the sweet earnesty of the lead singer's yelping and wailing. It lies in an eclectic mix of rock, punk, Syd Barrett, and a streetwalking brass band. It lies in a surreal story involving Anne Frank and childhood trama.Every band has strengths and weaknesses. NMH might not appeal to you, and this album may be too fanciful or raw. But, I would take the chance. The feeling that \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" gives me is something like pure joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!!!","review":"I absolutely love this album! A Great concept album with unparalelled emotion. Mangums voice takes you into his mind and won't let you escape. It's a real shame he stopped right after this. I would pay $50 for a new album by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this band","review":"Quirky, catchy and just plain interesting. I love these two albums... I've had them both for years and they rotate in and out of my regular rotation constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"a whirlwind montage of beauty and profound sadness...","review":"I'm normally not one to review a c.d online like this even though music is one of my greatest passions, but I believe in giving credit where it is due. Since NMH is not exactly in main stream music I think it is necessary that their small cult following give them a lot of appreciation. I personally think that NMH has had a very profound effect on the way that I view the music of today. There are very few bands for our generation that can actually make a completely original recording that has the potential of becoming a cult classic. I only wish that other bands would follow their lead to try to change the clone boy-band (Nsync, backstreet boys..etc..) face of pop culture music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music doesn't get any better...","review":"Simply remarkable. This CD changed the way I evaluate music. I've been reading CD reviews for a while, and perferences being what they are (so very personal) it is always hard to tell if you're going to like the music, even if everyone else loves it, and many \\"alternative\\" reviewers seem fixated on mellow, boneless music..the kind that reminds you you need to visit your grandmother in the nursing home and feed her some tapioca. But this CD lives up to the hype. The music is insistent, and urgent in a soul-deep, biorythmic way that is very hard to explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this album after reading all the reviews on here saying that its a masterpiece. I dont really hear much of this in the music, in fact i find it to be quite bland if not irritating. There are few good songs, but the singer's voice kills them. It's like the band is trying to hard to be something they cant be. Musically it is very simple. If I were you I'd pass on getting this album and check out other bands like the microphones or olivia tremor control. I spent 12 bucks on this album that I'll probably only listen to a couple more times. All the songs sound alot alike and they lack complexity. It's like the quitarist only knows how to do cheesy chords. i dont consider it to be very emotional at all like alot of people who reviewed it. It's really just a bunch of badly written songs with a singer who is painfull to listen to. if this is what you look for in music than by all means buy the album. one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for being \\"trippy\\"","review":"Not really any good or memorable songs and the clever, distorted alt-folk cliches really wear thin quickly.

These guys were all the rage a few years ago, so I was sent out to a concert to get the inside scoop. I hated the show. The guy is talentless: he can neither sing nor play the guitar. The lyrics are strained and mock-absurdist. The guy is visibly aching for attention--\\"Don't you people think I'm weird?\\" When I interviewed them after the show I felt like pissing the whole time so I was extra-irritated by things I would normally overlook--i.e., the guy kept scratching his hair like some eccentric and I was on the verge of spitting in his face. So, lucky me: I was asked to review this album by the station. . . you can imagine the long harangue I launched against this godawful band. But nobody seems to mind me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 265th review should settle this....","review":"First off this record aint no good! 2nd if you are into bad warbly out of tune voices set against some vaugely interesting music then this might be for you 3rd if you're a fan of the Elephant 6 label just stick with early Apples in Stereo... 4th I have no idea what the appeal is here but this record is clearly overrated.Instead try the new disc by The Tyde called \\"twice\\" plenty of melody set against some interesting gritty psych twang. CHEERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysterious whimsy or egotistical ranting?","review":"The instrumentation is minimal on this album - there is a strong acoustic feel mixed with some unbalanced synthesised horns that immediately start alarms ringing for the quality of this album. The singer/songwriter so-called genius thinks that subconscious ramblings, amateur melodic writing and crazy vocal slides make a cult album. He's wrong. His lyrics are resolutely abstract and leave most listeners cold - or even wondering whether he is just plain mad. It isn't clever existentialism but just outpourings of an average mind. And the singing is bizarrely uncontrolled, rough-edged, overly mournful and often just ordinary shouting. The melodies could be written by a schoolboy and the production shows no artistic effort to overcome the cheap facilities that were clearly used. If you like bad singing, bad production, repetitive guitar riffs and inane melodies then you may like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoooaaa!","review":"Hey World,Guess I'm the minority here, possibly out of my element? Just cant stand his over pushed voice and the repetative strums. Lastly, and most important his sick demented lyrics about little boys! Who would back this album???

I believe this album is as important to the evolution of music as Nirvana's Never mind, Pixies Doolittle, or Jeff Buckley's Grace album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"\\"Magnificent.\\" I cannot think of a better word or a better use for that word. Aeroplane is crazy, inspired and transcendent. It is an exercise in reorientation, an alien voice from an all-too real world. At first your ears and your head will reel from the carnivalesque dissonance that seems at once intimate and threatening, and that denies you any comfortable point of reference ro repose. And there you are, adrift in a sea of sounds foreign and familiar, and you have no choice but to float and puzzle your way out of the din of sound and poetry...and when you do, when you finally feel the edges of this album's space you can only cry...and smile. And that is what I do each and every time I listen to this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Magnum is God...","review":"That is all there is to it. See the title for my review. There will never be a singer/songwriter like him again. His lyrics are so emotional and vivid, his singing so raw and heartfelt...there is really nothing more I can say. This is one of the 3 or 4 albums I've ever heard where I cannot really put into words how important and beautiful this record is to me. I just hope if you are reading this review, you have also read the others and can judge for yourself that this is a album to own. I don't know anybody who kind of likes this album. You are either completely devoted and in love with it or you hate it. I also recommend \\"On Avery Island\\", an equally brilliant album that is just as good but hated on by many NMH fans for some odd reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone should listen to this album","review":"jeff magnum evokes a magical quality that is missing from the vast majority of music these days. normally i go for more \\"noisier\\" music, but i think that anyone who listens to this album with an open mind will find themselves touched by it (if not completely blown away)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How interesting","review":"to read the near-irrational hatred some people feel towards this disc. Personally, I haven't been affected by a record like this in a long while...it shimmers and falls, leaps and shines. The music and lyrics create a world fundamental and warped both at once. Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers float by like ghosts from a half-forgotten dream. The overarching theme is loss...if you've ever lost someone close to you, especially a family member, you may end in tears. Everything here is remembered, nothing lasts, nothing is present for this left-behind boy, drowned in formaldehyde at some anguished sideshow thousands of years removed from some wondrous childhood --\\"wrapped in gold silver sleeves left beneath Christmas trees in the snow\\" -- heart breaking, lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Treasure","review":"I heard this by pure luck in a record store and was instantly captivated. By the fourth song I had to have it. Wacky whimsical lyrics, great tight beats, short but oh so sweet, big thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the Narrative","review":"It seems that the narrative aspect of Aeroplane is being missed. At the first few listenings it isn't obvious, but once you really delve into the lyrics it is more apparent. And no, it isn't a tight knit story, so that makes it harder to hear too. It seems that it is about a boy who falls in love with a Jewish girl who is then killed by the Nazis. Of course this is just my theory, but I think that it makes sense. It ties the weirder lyrics together, and it also gives the \\"I love you Jesus Christ\\" line real meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do not understand why this album is so great...","review":"This album consistently resonates with me in ways that no other album has in a long, long time, and I don't understand it. Yes, Jeff Magnum does not have the greatest voice. Yes, the band is competent, but hardly spectacular. Yes, the lyrics seem either over-thought or under-thought depending on how you approach the album, but in the end, this album gets it. It hits the right notes. It resonates. It touches. And I find myself pouring a glass of beer or wine, and cranking this up. Because it is so ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"i have the vinyl version. classic cover, classic album.jeff magnum is genius.your collection will look lame without it. don't let that happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl, WOW!","review":"I have heard this album before but never like this. I can now see why the vinyl version is so popular. The first time the bass kicks in on King of Carrot Flowers, I was shocked! It sounds so full and natural. If you're a fan of some of the songs, do yourself a favor and get the vinyl version."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense physical listening experience","review":"When I listen to this album it's hard to do anything else. The blasts of intense guitar strumming and simply amazing vocals feel like a physical force pressing against my body. It's hard to express how great this album is, especially to others who \\"don't get it\\". This is powerful beautiful stuff, and definitely one of my favorite albums of the close to 600 that I own..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is perfection.","review":"or perhaps it's more accurate to say that this album is the most hearbreakingly beautiful, charmingly awkward, and oddly poetic imperfection i have ever heard.everyone must own this album, and if you don't like it right off, patience somehow lands you right in the middle of jeff mangum's landscapes, watching planes fly over oceans with him from anne frank's backyard.honestly, i am in love. there's just no other way to say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem, nonetheless","review":"This album had a major impact in my life at the time I bought it. Nowadays it's a bit left aside, but every once in a while I unearth it anew and remember what a wonder it is. Highly recommended. Try to find the beauty in the lyrics and in Jeff Mangum's voice. If you can't, just listen to it as a good, cleverly produced rock album. I challenge you not to rock out on the untitled tenth track. Some people say that the lyrics are childish or that the vocals are just plain awful, but it's undeniable that this album has an utter integrity, from the cover to the sleeve art to the music. Do give this a try. You'll either love it or hate it, but it will certainly be a remarkable experience, and that's what this record was made to be, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awful.........ly great!","review":"Sure, I consider myself enlightened and open-minded. I listened to the samples and didn't get it. But one review struck me: \\"accept it on it's own terms.\\" So I bought it.When I popped it into my home stereo and heard the grating voice of Jeff Magnum, especially on the second song, I had to quickly turn the volume down in embarrassment. Awful.A day later I played it for my 14 year-old son saying \\"so I missed on this one...isn't it awful?\\"The next day I listened to it in my car. Still awful, but there was something...A couple of listens later it clicked. And it became the most exquisite CD I've ever heard.It's been about two years since then, and it has become my most cherished musical treasure. And the funny thing is, my three kids -- 16, 14 and 12 years old have all downloaded it on to their iPOD's. They feel it too.I'm just very glad that I \\"get it\\" and that I've passed it on to another generation. Truly a \\"life-changing\\" musical maseterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is truly worth every penny! Jeff Mangum writes his best work ever, every song is spectacular. Though the CD may take a few people a while to get used to because of the wierdness of the lyrics, and jeff's passion in his singing. But if you are already a NMH fan or an E6 faithful this album is a must, the best band E6 has to offer. Highlights of the CD are: the first song \\"king of carrot flowers pt1\\", the title track, and \\"holand 1945\\", the CD is a great mix with folk and indie rock and psychodelia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandaddy","review":"May I strongly suggest that anybody who likes NMH should get hold of Grandaddy's latest offering. More simple, honest music."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as new folk","review":"I forget why I bought this CD. Maybe I read a review in Q magazine. Certainly I had never heard them, or for that matter heard of them, before. What a fantastic surprise! New folk better than Beck. Well, maybe not that good, but really good. Weird, looping lyrics. Normal guitar sounds supplemented by CB radio static. Humor, intelligence. Have you ever heard of the Incredible String Band? Probably too young. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best music albuns, ever!","review":"I have listened this album at least 20 times in the next 2 days after the delivery.It's just one of the most complete music albuns of all time! Lyrics, melody, rhythm, arrangements, voice, tone, everything is just in complete harmony and balance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top indie-rock of 1998","review":"Unlike anything else you've heard in the last 5 years, In The Aeroplane Over The Sea is truly a unique and exceptional record. The songs basically come in two flavors with either the singer worrbeling and straining over an acoustic guitar or a full band, horn section included, blasting away. The songs are only a little more depressing than they are up-lifting, pushing the boundries of pop music with chord progressions that leave the listener both confused but strangely satisfied. By far the best part or at least the part which leaves the greatest impression, are the lyrics. In the first song, arguable the best song, he croones, \\"And Dad would think of all the different ways to die, each one a little more than he would dare to try.\\" I love this album and so will you, greedy American."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And One Day We Will Die\\"","review":"This is one of the best CD's that I have ever spend my money on. THe way that Jeff Magnum sings is so thoroughly depressing that is is absolutely gorgeous. The lyrics on this album are amazing. If you consider yourself to have good taste in music, and you dont like this CD, you do not have taste at all.The Cd starts strong with \\"King of Carrot Flowers pt. 1\\" which ends with magnum singing \\"Dad would dream of all the different ways to die, each one a little more than he could dare to try\\". It then flows into the next song, pt. 2&3. That is one thing that I like about it is its flow. All the songs seem to weave together into a tapestry that is so amazingly beautiful. BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK I'm amazed....","review":"I had no idea that this album could be as great as it is. Its separate elements I have heard on other albums (folk. lo-fi, old timey oddities & historical references, horns not unlike Dylan's Rainy Day Woman #12 and 35, quirky but appropriate vocals) but nothing together quite like it. It's fueled by a beautiful passion and vision maybe just a little bit north of bipolar tendencies and/or schizophrenia. Mangum sings like this might be his last shot to have the world listen and maybe he was right. I can't get this music out of my head and I'm glad its there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - but niche","review":"I absolutely love this album. I realize this album is not for everyone - most people I play it for don't like it. Jeff Mangum's vocals are filled with such intensity and emotion, they punch me right in the heart. Both NMH albums are amazing works - get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the disc that everyone's been raving about?","review":"I've just purchased \\"In The Aeroplane...\\" and must confess to more than a little disappointment. Jeff Mangum's vocals are so out of tune on many (most? - all?) of the tracks that attention is diverted from what seems to be a fine batch of catchy, adventurous, eccentric Southern pop tunes. So, while that opinion has been formed solely on the basis of a single listening, and thus is subject to change, I must admit to a strong preference for The Apples (in stereo)'s comparatively well-sung \\"Tone Soul Evolution\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing..","review":"What's going on here? I must have missed something in a big way. I read the reviews, saw the comparisons to Sparklehorse (one of my favourite bands), heard it was the greatest 'lo-fi' (isn't everything these days..) loveliness in ages, so I bought it and...it was really bad! What am I missing! The songs don't hang together, the instrumentation is stark and unfriendly, the guy's voice is NOT great at all..I can get into most stuff after a while but this really troubled my ears. Anyway, I got my money back.."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the best 90's cd's? Yeah right....","review":"I know when someone posts a one star review to a really highly praised album, its immediately followed by angry responses. but here me out when I say that this is highly overrated. Now there are some good moments here and there on this disc, but they are not worthy of all the praise. This is a mediocre cd at best by a mediocre band with a pretentious name. What exactly is a neutral milk hotel? Anyways, the point being that there are plenty of other cd's that deserve this kind of recognition that are relatively unknown still, such as: ink and dagger's self titled, soul coughing's irresistible bliss, and arcwelder's pull.... I could go on, but I think you get the point. Its dissapointing that mediocre stuff like this gets all the hype but real quality stuff goes largely unnoticed. Oh well.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most moving album of the 90's","review":"Inspired by the diaries of Anne Frank, In The Aeroplane Over The Sea shows Mangum mixing his own inner demons into the story of the holocaust; Add a great love of 60's pop (The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Zombies), 70's folk, and 80's indie, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.In The Aeroplane Over The Sea starts with a very innocent feeling, which gradually morphs into sheer despair on \\"Oh, Comely\\". The afformention track, along with the finale \\"Two-Headed Boy part 2\\" are two of the most heart breaking songs I've heard.If you don't own Aeroplane...I strongly recommend it. Stop buying White Stripes albums, and check out a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the sound of the acoustic guitars","review":"I like the sound of the acoustic guitars. I am bored with all my loud cd's, so I wanted something quieter. There is a nice mix of instruments so the songs all have a different sound.\\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" is the song I like best on this album. I will say though the voice takes a while to get used to, at first I hated it, but after a while I can not imagine any one else singing these songs.I am going to look into some of the other music they have. There are a lot of interesting song topics on this album, which is what makes it special for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiny, spastic and whiny","review":"Without wasting too much breath... this album has nothing original or inspiring to offer.. Remember in that movie 'Deliverance' when the hillbilly says \\"squeal like a pig\\"?? I think the vocals of Neutral Milk Hotel (whatever that is supposed to mean/aside from random word association) SQUEAL. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really that good","review":"Alot of people want and like to say this album/band are really good, but the truth is, it/they are not really that good. It is a very bland album. Basically a modern version of The Beatles entire catalogue, only without all the genius that those songwriters had. People really need to stop saying albums are good just because the \\"style\\" is good. This songwriting is just not that good. It's an album just like all the other albums it is comparable to, by the bands they are comparable to. Albums by the shins, and apples in stereo: boring albums that sound sort of like modern kids influenced by a mix of The Beatles and Punk Rock, with a couple good pop songs somewhere on the record. Much, much better pop and rock records have been made over the last 40 years that people should by before ever buying anything like this. sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"The only song I really enjoy on the album is \\"Untitled\\"...because Magnum finally shuts the hell up.Yeah, \\"Fool\\" is an instrumental, too, but it's pretty boring.Very annoying overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I recieved a copy of this book about a week ago.

An overall fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real Air Force life","review":"As an Air Force spouse, I hope nobody uses this as their only view of military life. I shuddered at some of the generalizations. The characters are drawn broadly, and are stereotypes. The slutty secretary and female pilot, the drunken wife, the overbearing general's wives, the wives without a life beyond the air force - what sad, limited lives these authors must lead as military spouses. There is no \\"typical\\" Air Force wife, and this book reinforces the negative stereotype of officers' wives that so many people \\"buy into\\". The mystery itself is okay, it was a fun read in that respect. IT IS NOT A WINDOW INTO AIR FORCE BASE LIFE!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"Very very disappointed!

It was so good, I searched out and bought the CD. This CD is loaded with great writing (with the exception of \\"Everyday War,\\" which is your standard and seemingly obligatory anti-war song [and even it sounds good if you ignore the banal lyrics]}as well as great singing. At least half the songs here are even better than \\"Trouble Can Last,\\" including \\"Banished\\" and \\"Devil's on the Rise,\\" which are particularly strong.

On the other hand, the remainder of these spot bulbs, which we have all over the kitchen/ dining area, have lasted 3 or more years with daily use, so I am torn.

We anxiously awaited its release as it was touted as having a new Snow White cartoon. Instead of creating a brand new cartoon, Disney used excerpts from the Snow White movie and rearranged them along with narration to create a new story. At times, the characters are pictured talking on screen in still shots with no mouth movements. There are some interactive features in the Snow White story which ask the child to make selections with the remote. My daughter is 4 1/2 and doesn't use the remote. I helped her make the choices, but she found it to be frustrating. The Jasmine cartoon is one that Disney still shows in The Aladdin cartoon series reruns. The Little Mermaid cartoon is also from the Little Mermaid cartoon series that still runs on Disney. My daughter had seen the Aladdin and Little Mermaid cartoons on television previously. This was a disappointing waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy product from Disney","review":"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said. The Snow White cartoon is nothing more than a few still frames thrown together to form a semi-interactive story about making pies. The other two cartoons are full motion, but they feel even flatter than the Snow White slide show. These look like the typical dribble of afternoon cartoons being cranked out by writers who lack the time, talent, or inspiration to put a decent story together.

Though the food is geared towards crowds (most recipes serve 6-8 people, so they're definitely going to be leftovers in our house when I make them).

I called Tag Heuer and they told me only Tag's Service Center is authorized to change the battery and they refused to tell me how much until I shipped it to them. They weren't too concerned about my dilemma. By some stroke of luck, they told me that I could send it back under the 2 year warranty and they would change the battery at no charge.

There is a previous model which has a Black Face and it looks rather cheap. Amazon had the best price I could find and my other Tag Heuer has been sitting in its case since I love my new watch more even though it was 1/6th the price.

The bracelet is very comfortable and is lightly brushed giving it an elegant appearance. I intended to spend a lot more than this much on a watch to replace a 7 year old Cartier. But when I looked around no quartz from Omega or Breitling really did it for me. Other Tags are nice - like the Link Chrono and black face Aquaracer - but this one hits the mark better for me personally.Many watch afficianado's dislike quartz but I can't live with a watch that loses 15 minutes every 6 months. And some will say Tag is more about marketing (Tiger Woods, etc.) than excellent timekeeping. That's OK with me. This piece has the great looks and finish a quality timepiece should. And the only time I have to reset it is when I change timezones or for daylight savings time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's John Simm?","review":"The only reason I watched this movie was because I thoroughly enjoyed John Simm's reading of the audiobook.

The movie revolves around soccer, but in so doing the movie taps into the basic human motives, such as revenge and greed. One man is on a mission to show another man, who made him feel small, that is every bit as good at what he does as the other man. In the process, we are left with the turmoil that results from pursuing these emotions to their fullest. We are left with failure and agony. This movie reflects this with great ease as it shows how this process unfolds through strong writing and great acting. Get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I saw this movie at the local Redbox. I thought it might ba a movie about Man Utd, and there was noting else to rent. It was a great movie. I really enjoyed it. The overview claims it is about ego. I felt it was more about the relationship between the two men. I am sad, the movie was not promoted more, I would have enjoyed it at the theatre. Pick it up, you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Wesley - Another Good Album","review":"Once again Wesley puts out a very nice album of singer / songwriter style rock with in depth lyrics and nicely done music. I don't like this one quite as well as \\"Red And White Sky\\", but I can't really put my finger on why. The album seems slightly more commercial, but that is not really a criticism. Wes has a way with words and his lyrics here are all thought provoking. As in past works he tends to wear his heart on his sleeve and make no doubt as to where he is coming from on these tracks. Wesley remains an underrated talent and his albums should get a lot more notice than they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and to change","review":"The product arrived as promised...

I have found other texts failed to show key mathematical derivations, or to explore the subtleties of what the maths imply.The book covers a plethora of topics from simple gradient descent through second order techniques and conjugate gradient, through to the use of 'bayesian techniques' (basically confidence intervals on network outputs), monte carlo techniques etc. Similarly error functions, non-linearities (sigmoids, softmax etc.) and data preparation are all treated.The extensive bibliography also provides excellent references for further study, (a whos who of the field, as well as actual titles).

Needless to say I lost the fish.I recently sent the rod to LAME-iglas and they said the rod only had a one year warranty and they wanted to charge me $45 for the repair.After speaking to their \\"customer service\\" representative he advised me that LAME-iglas rods are made in CHINA.

You have to take turns placing a piece of cheese on top of the lid, which is balanced on a piece of round wood. Very easy to topple over, which makes the game a fun challenge. It's a cute-looking toy, teaches him patience, how to take turns, and introduces him to the idea of balance. Just be careful not to lose the little pieces (actually, mine came with an extra piece of cheese). Also a great toy, is the one with the rabbits and carrots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Pace with the Process","review":"Barry Beckham has kept pace with the rapidly changing process of choosing a college.

It seems obvious after reading this book that the author was just playing at readers' emotions in the pursuit of delving into our pocketbooks. The author scribbles a never ending ramble of events which have little or no relation to one another.

About the 4th time it happened, it never came back on, and could not be repaired so it was replaced with the same phone. It was then that I learned that all my keepsake photos and videos on the phone were lost forever in addition to all my ringtones and contacts.

It does have a good (not great) camera, the MP3 player plays MP3s, and the micro SD card is nice. My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it. We went back to the store, thinking it was defective. After trying 5 others, we realized it was not just hers. Mine was actually the exception - and even then, the sound was not great, more like \\"barely intelligible\\". We were upgrading from a Motorola V276, which sounded WAYYY better, no contest, just didn't have the bells and whistles.

Marilyn Horne is still excellent after some twenty plus years in the role, other performers leave a great deal to be desired (I expected more from the Met and was disappointed). The 1965/6 Sutherland/Horne recording is still the gold standard only because of the two of then.

I do not care how beautiful her voice is...and to make matters worse she is the long lost son of her love interest...come on she is old enough to be the mother of her love interest. The MET did the same with Price in Verdi's Forces of Destiny. It is extremely annoying. I see no reason why these young male roles cannot be sung by young attractive tenors. Only in opera is everyone oblivious to the absurd in miscasting it seems.

Jane Anderson's singing is still bloody awful. I had thought, well, MAYBE she used to be somebody. Nope. She never way. Bel canto? You've GOT to be kidding. Okay, so I listened to the familiar overture, then found no English, then zipped to No. 19 to see if Anderson was better than I remembered.Hah!And THAT was after listening with great satisfaction to Bryn and Cecilia from Glyndboune.

You have saved me the frustration of wasting my money on worthless combs. I sincerely hope the Ace company will soon realize that quantity (the pack of six) will never be a substitute for quality.

These are a poor substitute.","review":"These new versions of the Ace Classic comb are not manufactured like they used to be.

The plastic is brittle and just by keeping them in my back hip pocket of my pants, (even dress pants) I find broken teeth all over the place all the time.

The accompanying text also specifically says \\"Has both fine and medium teeth for all hair types\\". Nonetheless, the combs shipped have nothing but fine teeth. This seller does not ship the product advertised and if that's what you want, you should find it somewhere else. As others have noted, they are no longer marked or labeled \\"Unbreakable\\" and most certainly are not. In fairness, however, none of the descriptive text suggests that they are either unbreakable or made of the old hard rubber material.Amazon seems to have a lot of sellers like this. I think there should be a way for Amazon customers to post an obvious \\"Liar\\" or \\"Fraud\\" badge on the pages of sellers like this.

I read it when I was six, and it became one of those iconic reading experiences that forms an integral part of one's personality. The plot? Doesn't really matter, but Liz Renay is born to Bible thumpers in Mesa, Arizona, runs around with men, has a lot of sex, cozies up to gangsters, lies to protect Micky Cohen, goes to jail, and gets married six times. It's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Talkin, Liz!","review":"If you \\"get\\" Liz Renay, get this book. it's hysterical! She's like a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Penelope Pitstop! Danger seems to lurk around every corner for Ms Renay in her search for stardom--and if it isn't getting her, it's getting her kids! They fall out of second story windows, get attacked attempting to visit her in prison, and even end up stripping with her. Through all her trashy tales though, Liz manages to emerge as a lovable eccentric: a warm-hearted optimist, which saves 'My Face...\\" from ever becoming the maudlin \\"could-have-been\\" saga that it might have been. On a par with Mamie Van Doren, only more entertaining, Liz's quirky narrative entertains from start to pulpy finish. Oddly inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Face For The World To See","review":"I read this book about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it.

The camp value is definitely there and your hooked after the first paragraph - read between the lines and you'll connect with a woman who's happiness has been put to the test. Her belief in loving herself and to love others (as simple as it is) is an emotional level few people in life actually reach. Have fun reading this book - I sure did. Now, if only John Waters will make a movie version!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Not the most well written book, but is VERY interesting.

The poignant, tragic love story emphasized how difficult it is for cultures to come together, but it also emphasized that it can be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Western","review":"\\"Broken Arrow\\" is a classic western based on fact. Many of the events portrayed in this film are based on history. There actually was a Tom Jeffords (James Stewart) and a Cochise (Jeff Chandler), but some literary license is taken.

I was glad to see this out on DVD and is a purchase that I will never regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pathetic Time in History","review":"Product arrived on-time and in condition advertised.

Jimmy Stewart, still young and electrifying, plays the sympathetic \\"Indian lover\\" who makes peace with the Apaches possible.

The battery was at the end of it's lifespan but everything else seems to be fine. I don't like how this particular model leaks so much air into the dust cup around the edges rather than pulling all the air through the brushroll area. The model I purchased has a flat, slide-out filter. I think later models have been redesigned and perhaps they seal better.Now for the \\"don't try this at home\\" section... I hooked up a cord to this with a cigarette lighter plug like is used in cars, and ran it on 12 volts rather than 6 volts. That's double the voltage! I made sure to get the polarity correct. This thing draws a lot of amps at 12 volts and the cord needs to be fairly heavy. But you should see the vacuuming performance! It's still not too loud, at 12 volts. I could see using this as a vacuum in an RV, or in a cabin with a 12 volt solar power system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primo Early Smog...meet Strawberry Rash","review":"Bill Callahan is a genius. You will not like Julius Caesar at first. I promise. Why? Well, at first it just seems annoying. You feel like asking yourself what the hell this guy was thinking when he made this. You had better have some tolerance for lo-fi. From all that I've heard, Callahan recorded this album at home on a four-track, and it sounds like it. But once you get used to that (unless you love lo-fi, like me) you find some songs that are just wonderful.

My only critique is the writing style can get confusing at times and ...I did get lost now and then. I think it's his way of trying to spell things like the characters are saying them at all times. Normally I can adapt to this quickly but the problems start to hit when there are 3 or more characters all talking at the same time in different dialects back and forth. It just gets all too much and actually served to pull me out of the story and \\"break the spell\\" instead of drawing me in. Aside from having to remove a star for that it was still a really awesome book. Not a top 10 author but definitely a top 25 in the sci-fi genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Bad","review":"Fascinating that a product this incredibly bad made it to marketplace.

If i wanted to see a bunch of naked girls with no plot line, there are millions of websites to see that, so these movies are crap. After Erik and Tracy supposedly fall in love at the end of the naked mile, she runs away with Trent in beta house. It just doesn't make any sense.

It has some serious flaws in its use of the Internet Explorer web browser and claims that Microsoft would have fixed it in the IE 5 version. This is very mis-leading mainly because they don't tell you this until you read the fine print that comes with the CD. They even encourage you to use Netscape which does not have any problems when using this CD. I think that they, as the author of this CD owe a responsiblity to the consumer to make this fact known before purchase and not to bundle such information with its installation instrcutions.

Even with any cuts that may have been made, this DVD set still retains the charm and humor of my childhood hero. I cant seem to find Underdog on any of the cartoon networks, merchandise & collectables are sadly too limited, and it's scary to think that the only exposure to Underdog for today's youngsters is the hella-lame Disney live-action movie.

What were the people involved in the making of this thinking?!. Christina has stated that she wants to get even naughtier and push the envelope. She has no idea at all on what to do. This is a ridiculous and sleazy song. The title of the thing pretty much says it all. It's trashy and has no catch, beat, or any redeeming value to the listener or to any die hard Christina fan. It is clearly the product of an artist who is so desperate to be adult and edgy, that she forget that you have to actually grow up first. This is going in the wrong direction for Christina and her career. It will only bring the wrong kind of attention and will seriously effect her and her career.

It sounds like almost every other song on the radio these days, with one major exception- that voice. Christina is definately one of the most talented artists of our time and frankly it's a bit of a shame to see her waste her immense vocal talent on something like this.Well, if you feel like I do, there's hope- the b-side \\"I Will Be.\\" It's a gorgeous ballad- very personal, not over-the-top, and showcases her powerful pipes.

It appears that she really has come into her own now, whatever her puritanical detractors may say, this track has all the hallmarks of a sincere artistic statement. In a world of bland homogenised Pop, Soul and R&B;, the stir this track has generated is a welcome one.I haven't checked out the 'Stripped' album yet, but I shall.

Unlike most Linux drivers, the driver for this product is maintained outside of the kernel and is far behind. Because it is outside of the kernel, it isn't included in any Linux distributions. We're not even talking RAID support here -- you can't even access your disks individually. Even if you don't mind installing the driver yourself, good luck if you are running any recent version of Linux. The driver page ([...]) hasn't been updated since 2009. The last 5 versions of Fedora are completely unsupported by the driver, and the last 3 don't even work if you manually compile the driver. Even the latest version of RedHat Enterprise Linux is completely unsupported.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good RAID Controller","review":"The only issue I encountered was trying to boot my computer up for the first time with the raid controller and all my new hard drives plugged in.

I'm not too fond of the first Palace Brothers LP. But this one, it has a completely different atmosphere. The songwriting is completely different, the chord progressions are very haunting at points. This album somewhat makes me think of his Joya release. Production-wise, they seem to share similar ties. Musically, not necessarily. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes really simple, earthy sounding folk music.Oh, and to the guy who gave this album one star, I don't think you were listening for the right things. Sometimes two or three chords sounds better than a song with ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"palace days always a constant companion","review":"This is a bit misleading as the CD is \\"Days in the Wake\\" and the LP is simply Palace brothers which I was listening to the former first.

As I started to read the book, I was pleasantly surprised in the way Jose weaves together bits from his life story, lessons from his teachers and different techniques to pray (or connect with the Great Spirit). There are prayers for almost every situation you can imagine - happiness, health, wealth, well-being, sleep, sorrow, pain, men, women, and many more.The most powerful aspect of the book has been the sense of peace it has brought me personally. I noticed almost right away that when I went to sleep, I was sleeping more deeply and peacefully if I had been reading the book just before going to bed. A few times since then, I've had trouble going to sleep initially and tried the prayer techniques in the book and magically, sleep came within minutes.This is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of faith or religion and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praying with Power is amazing!","review":"This is an amazing little book. It is a perfect balance of commentary and prayer-suggestions and clearly written by someone who understands the struggles and challenges each of us faces in our daily lives.

Dr. Stevens has given humanity a tremendous gift with this book and it quickly became the only book on spirituality that I will ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book with Heart & Wisdom","review":"A highly recommended purchase, this wonderful book is a fine addition to any true seeker's spiritual arsenal. Jose speaks and projects truth from the heart, weaving effective techniques for powerful prayer with the wisdom and insight of many indigenous teachings and perspectives. \\"Praying With Power\\" acted as a catalyst for my partner and I, creating a fresh and much needed renaissance of prayer in our lives.

Book is very academic, and a bit dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining, with quotes from real books","review":"This is neither an actual analysis of systems nor a humorous review, not that it does not try to be both. It is pretentious whining about why Things Don't Work, peppered with quotes from other authors (Lawrence Peter, Eric Berne, etc.), often out of their original context.The author smugly defines systems and their goals in terms that justifies his cynicism. He quotes no statistics or complete case studies, and uses endless anecdotal (and anonymous) \\"events\\" to support his simplistic condescension.In truth, most things are complicated and have no easy answers. The most important attribute of leadership, in my opinion, is the willingness to realize failure and try something else. This, unfortunately, requires patience on the part of stockholders and electorate, who seem to share Mr. Gall's impatient and intellectually lazy outlook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I have never written a review - but I had to when I read the one preceeding this. I am a student at SCAD, and we gave input on this book (being students, I think that was smart). We wanted the 'don't go theres', because books often don't tell you common mistakes that happen when you try a new procedure. The don't go theres in this book help you through the common mistakes and how to get out of them, something other books don't do.

However, I had the book for a few days and pages began falling out of it. Not one or two but a lot. I never had a book do this before. The second complaint is that there seems to be a step left out of the tutorials here and there.

To set the tone of how it is written, I will give an example: Most books have little hints, tips and so on through out to stress important information, this book uses the words \\"Don't go there!\\" on every other page, taking up most of the book.

The author clearly states thatthis bookis not for the novice programmer but for those experienced in C/C++ and Windows programming. However, after reading this book, I fail to find how this book can be of benefit to any programmer, novice or otherwise. The book is primarily fluff, without any satisfying explanation of the concepts presented. The explanation of the MFC classes are a prime example of what is wrong with this book. There are samples of MFC coding generated from the AppWizard, but little clarity in explaining the \\"nuts and bolts\\" behind the code. True, a seasoned MFC programmer would understand the material presented, but then again, a seasoned MFC programmer would find little in this book that he does not already know.

At this, Chet is an undisputed master. I listened to Carribbean Guitar when I was a kid, and still haven't heard another guitar album with this clear, pure sound. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chet Atkins is so versatile!","review":"My first Chet Atkins album was Teensville back in the early 60's. Chet's cover of Don Gibson's hit \\"Oh Lonesome Me!\\" was sheer musical joy. White Silver Sands, with a solo by Boots Randolph, was also a favorite from Teensville. I enjoy old-time country music, but none of Chet's country-flavored covers of country hits appealed to me much, although I always appreciated his virtuosity and talent.

The end that connects to your iPhone or iPod is wider and thicker than the factory standard one your iPhone/iPod ships with. I don't care how cheap it is, it's poorly designed, considering the substantial percentage of people who keep their iPhones and iPods in cases to prevent damage. Also, the holes the cable is fed through on each side are larger than need be, allowing for the cable to easily twist and potentially tangle during retraction. So, 2 stars, and it's only 2 because it actually functions upon delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This cable works great. I have been using it for over a year and no problems.

The construction seemed solid enough at first, but apparently it wasn't up to the stresses of daily use. (I only ever used it at my desk.

I quickly notice that they \\"double\\" the shipping fee even you put two items on the same order. It make no sense to me since double the weight should not affect the shipping fee at all. It's a tiny, light item. Suddenly I understand the seller is playing a trick that shift the price to the shipping & \\"handling\\". I pay identical price for shipping a \\"heavy book\\" in standard speed. Thus, I think obviously that they are making money through the \\"handling\\" part.

If I unplug it several times I can force it to charge my phone, but when I think about it I probably shouldn't do that anymore since the cord is clearly not supported (safe) for iPhone usage.The retractable cord works well.

I contacted the seller multiple times in order to get it resolved. Their only response was that they had contacted USPS to find my package. We all know how well that goes. I didn't hear from them after that. I followed up two times after that with no response. I had to file a claim with Amazon regarding this. A few days after I filed the claim ClearAV contacted me offering to ship new cables if I dropped my claim. Too bad I already ordered elsewhere.Buyer beware of this company.

I then saw a difference. Last summer I took him entirely off them & other items as he was itching a lot and we thought it may be something in them that he was allergic to. However, after a couple of weeks off the green-ums the lawn burnt spots were so large they were very unsightly. I once again gave him the green-ums, the itching did not come back, and my lawn once again had much smaller and less severely burnt spots. I would highly recommend this product.

After trying to read this book for five minutes, however, I put it down in frustration over the horrendous quality of writing. It is clear that this book was written by a non-native English speaker, and was not edited prior to release.

It is not only very complete, but information is presented in a very structured way, making it easy to read through the book very fast and efficiently and making it possible to skip parts, which may be of interest at a later stage. The book is written in a way that a layman is able to get up to speed without explaining trivial topics. More advanced readers will profit from the in-depth explanations, by placing a particular business case or technology into the overall solution. Internet business seems easy but has many caveats, which are explained in this book and solutions are presented to overcome these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor communication skills obscure message","review":"I bought this book because it seemed more complete than any of the other books I could find on e-commerce. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to read because of the author's poor command of English, or perhaps of writing, and the patent lack of editing in the book. I found myself getting distracted by the writer's and editor's errors.

A second part is a documentary that followed the ensemble through their excursions, rehearsals, and performances in the project.Though hardly music critics, we can only relate how excited we are when watching the performance in the main track and being broght along in their tour by the documentary.

The people that created this monster of a movie just didn't know what they were doing. I just dont know how to corelate words to convey the horror that is this film. I think going to the dentist would be a better time spent than rewatching this really bad movie. What ever you do. Do not watch the movie. Do not own the movie. Do not rent the movie. Please.

I went in with little expectations and was not surprised at the film's ineptness. Had it added a little more humor (even though the ping from the frying pan when the girl attacks the killer is hilarious), this movie might have been campy enough to be fun. However, it's the same old story of a group of young people (they can't be teenagers, they look too old) who \\"borrow\\" one of the guy's parents' RV and head off to the mountains for a camping adventure. I've often wondered why these guys do this---when they get there, all they do is sit around, drink beer, smoke pot and get laid---the same thing they do at home!

Many parts in the film dont seem to make sense, such as when one of the women is tied up to the back of the Rv out of nowhere. And how a person being dragged behind an Rv makes it out alive and well. None of the killings, gore, acting, or action come anywhere near close to alright. If you look at the cover of the dvd it shows a chainsaw on it, and clearly when you watch there is not a single chainsaw in it.

While there are some pretty hot chicks to gawk at in this low-budget flick, sitting through an hour and a half of the cheesy acting is not worth it. There is a good truck driving song and one funny scene where the blonde pulls a big, thick knife out of a nerd's pocket. This is really bad low-budget filmmaking.

These so called \\"actors\\" are a pathedic excuse for talent. How dare they claim this is a legitimate piece of film. The film industry is an idustry of art; This is a talentless mockery of what true film making is. I honestly hope these actors have a day job. Don't quite it people!I almost feel sorry for them, I hope they do not think this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination! DO Not rent, see, or even waste any moment in time to watch it, it is worthless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a lazy effort all around","review":"Nobody involved in this film seemed to put forth any real attempt to make it remotely worthwhile. The acting was done by people who looked bored with the whole thing and the editing department just took a pass on this film. What is with the guy wearing the vest and tie while inside the motor home and then not wearing them outside, and then agains appearing inside and wearing the damn vest and tie again. So this guy took the time to put the tie and vest back on each time he went back into the motor home? There is just poor work ethic by everyone involved to say the least. Nobody involved in this movie will ever be seen or heard from again, not that this movies counts as a legitimate job in the entertainment industry anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of the year","review":"Come on people, who gave this movie a good review.

The Writer/Director - Allen Wilbanks should really think about doing something else. You really would have to be a retard to like this movie and to be part of it as well.

Dont get this unless you like low budget movies and being bored out of your mind!Some of the funny things are in the begining a girl is killed in a tent.

I wasn't sure if it was their intention to be as cheesy and cliched as they were, but the \\"acting\\" on the Simple Life totally outdoes the acting here. There was little consistency; in one scene \\"the nerd\\" is wearing a button down dress shirt, and then when he climbs aboard the RV, he has on a sweater vest. The tagline on the back is even wrong!

I'm sure you've never heard of this movie and some of the people here probably rented or bought the movie like I did based on the cover. That's all it is a scary cover, nothing more.

But this will be an exception. I read the preview in the back and felt it would be somewhat good. Even if the scary things happened in the last half hour, I would have liked it. But you know what? The scary stuff did not happen. The preview said torture and the only torture I saw was on myself for watching this crap. Thankfully, I bought it at a supermarket for 3.99 and felt bad that a supermarket has to sell a movie of this calibur or lack of to make a buck. It was by the medicine aisle and deservingly so because it is capable of making people sick.

Then I compared the new mix to the old mix. The new mix had constant levels (thank you, compression) and good distinct frequency eq allocations for the various instruments.

But as far as any practical help on mixing there is nothing here. Not one detail description of one single mix. Help me Spock! How about telling me how you would mix a guitar, hard right? Middle? Reverb? With what effects? Can you give me something I can use?

However, his idea that creative process is what gives something intrinsic value seems wrong to me. The value of some of the things that Dworkin says have intrinsic value seems to be value that can be explained otherwise. Dworkin claims that the flag has intrinsic value, but its value can be explained by instrumental alone--the U.S. flag serves the purpose of representing a country. However, Dworkin's argument is interesting--the idea he has as to how to arrive at intrinsic value through unexplained intuitions is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not advised","review":"I was actually looking forward to reading this book.

But this 1988 followup is surprisingly bland for the most part. While Tiffany does have a good voice, it's the music on here that falls flat. All This Time is okay. But the album suffers from too many limp numbers, formulaic songs, bland ballads, corny songwriting and a few dance numbers that aren't all that danceable. It made me doze off to sleep after the 6th song. Celine Dion could have done these songs better since she's so good at these kinds of power ballads. Teen pop was not meant to sound like this and this is the most forgettable album of 1988 to me. The one star is very deserving."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOSTLY BORING!","review":"I didn't get to hear Tiffany's 2nd album until 1992. I'm surprised I didn't. This album is BORING! I couldn't believe it! Follow up a multiplatinum debut from '87 with this boring set of songs from late '88? Too many bland, pointless ballads that sound like \\"All This Time\\" or \\"Could've Been.\\" As I listened to the album, I dozed off to sleep during the second half. That's how dull it sounded with such flat music with too many sappy lyrics. The pressure to follow a very successful debut might have been hard. But Tiffany sounds directionless and mediocre on a lot of this album. I came off a little disappointed after hearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This album is filled with songs that I can relate to!!\\"","review":"This album is just incredible when it comes to music that I can say, \\"Hey, I know what this is like to have a broken heart,\\" but she's got ways of describing this through upbeat music to ease your mind, body, and soul. She was my best friend through the hard times, 'cause anytime I thought things got really bad, her music gave me hope. My fave song was \\"All this Time,\\" because it's a song confessing to all that after all this time, no matter how long we've been apart, I still love you just as much as the first time we met.

Some of my most fond memories are about the time spent at these hill stations as a boy. So we do need a writer to communicate this magic to the wide world. Unfortunately, Crossette is not this writer. She doesn't approach the places with any sympathy, let alone the reverence they deserve. Crossette is too eager to peddle her political and social theories about the divide between the highlands and the lowlands, races and religions.

It's a typical classic fantasy, with grandiose, stilted sentence structure, lots of thees and thous, and backwards-running sentences. Protagonist gets magical thingamabob and has to return it to its rightful place, joins up with stalwart traveling companions along the way, and so on.I was surprised, however, by how violent and gory this book really was. Definitely not for smaller kids. Characters go to their deaths screaming, characters get skinned, eaten, ripped apart, blood showers down, decapitated heads show up on more than one occasion. This is perhaps the most violent kid's book I've ever encountered, and I don't typically have a problem with violence. And after all of that, it ends tragically.The stilted language keeps you at a slight distance from the characters, so you don't really care that much about their fates. But still ... the book was dark, bloody, and ultimately pretty depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting - You can feel Lenore's pain","review":"This novel, this thriller exposes the medical implant controversy in a real and telling manner.

It was refreshing to see a real and deep story as opposed to the same plot offered by Hollywood mainstream films. The lead actress portrayed her pain and suffering in such a subtle way.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"I happened to stumble across this film completely by chance through a series of Tweets and I am so happy that I did.Like a lot of indie films it leaves you with something to think about afterwards which I love about it but as a general whole I think this films causes you to really think, it's well scripted, well put together and if you like dark dramas that you pretty much won't find anywhere else I would highly recommend this film.NoRestrictions seems to make a lot of thought provoking films and I love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of One Hour Fantasy Girl","review":"I saw One Hour Fantasy Girl at a Bradley University screening a few months back.

I know she's not trying to be sexy because sex isn't what she was hired for. But she didn't have to walk like a tom boy. I just think with that body she can move better.I also think she is boring to watch for so long. She can't smile for anything. I know she is trying to let you know she is unhappy with life. But why didn't she smile when she got the job with the real estate guy. That was something she wanted to do. He was happy to give her the job. Talking about all of the money they will be making. But she couldn't even crack a little smile. She is SO boring to watch.The only thing I liked about her is how caring she is.

I was blown away by the show and by this new material - this is definitely the best stuff he's done since his classic 'tropicalia' period. His new young band has definitely absorbed a lot of 'non-Brazilian' music (garage, new wave, prog, post-punk) and the only thing really 'Brazilian' about this album is Caetano's vocals.

In this series there may be old magic in the hills, and in the memory; there may be mystery in the bones of the earth or the bright eyes of unusual birds; the fog may bring passing enchantment with it on particular nights; but this is not wand waving magic.These books are moody, indirect and ambiguous, like the old tales themselves.

The book reads like the author had never been there, and in fact, it appears that her time there seems to have been merely a few short trips.So as a book purporting to be about a place, it's about as useful as any other book about a place which the author clearly doesn't know. Any tourist to the Vineyard could have written as good, which is to say as bad, a book. Frankly, any tourist to anywhere could have written this, as long as they were armed with a vineyard map.Hopefully someone will one day write the book this could have been. For now, this belongs in the fiction category, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"next best thing to being there","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I needed a vacation, but couldn't take one - so this book transported me to the island of Martha's Vineyard for the week.

I actually bought it at Tower books based on the title alone. Anyone who has experienced the frustration of every history of the Celts simply parroting Julius Caesar (like listening to George Custer explain Native American culture), and ignoring the extant evidence from the Celtic world itself will understand the allure of this title. I refer to Peter wells as part of the \\"New Celtic Scholarship\\" and I use this book as a reference often. It's a bit academic to read, but for any serious lover of Celtic history and culture, this is a must have for your library! I only hope more archeologists will have the integrity and courage to follow in his footsteps and get real about Celtic research.Michael R. Gorman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snobbish and academic","review":"Wells is one of these post-modern deconstructionist types who thinks everything and anything Western is by very definition decadent and wrong. Rather than helping the reader understand the German and Celtic peoples who lived north of the Roman empire, he basically recasts them as Third World nations subjugated by the imperialists - the noble savage as perpetual victim. Worst of all, he can't write to save his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke!!","review":"I've spent over 40 years visiting the wildest areas of North America still left. Mr. Zaidle's book is based simply on sensationalism and propogates a fear of the wild that seems to have always been inherent in the human condition. I feel much more comfortable sleeping out of doors in the wilderness of Alaska or Idaho (where predators still abound), than I ever feel walking through places such as Central Park (surrounded by the urban predators). I feel Mr. Zaidle has done a great disservice to his readers by instilling a false sense of fear, when our few wild areas left should be approached with a sense of reverance and awe. Please stick with your day job Mr. Zaidle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your domestic animal could be dangerous too!","review":"Think those wild animals are the only dangerous things out there? Check out your cat. That's right, your own cat! I escaped serious injury when my cat turned on me, for no reason at all! All I did was rub it hard and fast, making noises like \\"Woowoowoowoo, Blllllll, tiziziziziz\\" then tried to flip it on it's back. Then it made growling noises at me. Then I asked it, \\"What are you going to do? Cute me to death?\\" Then I blew into its face, grabbed its tail and tried to crank it like a car! After rubbing its stomach furiously, the animal tried to take a swing at me with claws outstreched! It missed, but the injury it could have caused... Sometimes animals will attack for no apparent reason, like my cat did. So be wary.

What could be more sensational than the subject matter itself? I've read many books of this genre, and Mr. Zaidle's humorous writing style definitely takes the edge off of some pretty gruesome stuff. I read this type of book to educate myself because I,personally, enjoy surviving. I've seen people in my town shove their young child toward antlered deer with an apple in their hand. I've seen toddlers and Rottweilers playing in the same yard. What people don't know can hurt them,and their loved ones. What people, like these unenlightened parents, could learn from this book could save them a lot of grief. No, not all animals are killers,but, they can be. If you put a bicycle helmet on your kid, there are other precautions you could take as well. Enjoyable book to read.

I watched it on repeat viewings in several other countries and for a while I would pull it out on VHS, after finally buying it, and view it at least once a year. To be honest though I'd usually stop watching once the Robert Vaughn bit began. Nothing against old Napoleon Solo but I wasn't as interested in modern day shenanigans, and I've always been a David Janssen fan growing up with \\"The Fugitive\\" in the '60's. But those final episodes didn't do anything for me. But I digress, you will love this series and if you're one of the many who've never seen this fantastic novel on celluloid, you're in for a real treat!

The story is uniquely American, the cinematography makes the landscape another character in the tale, and the cast is like a necklace of many shining pearls.

True to James Michener's style of writing in depth, this story begins way back before the Indians and comes forward to modern day hustle-bustle living. My only real disappointment was that the jacket says there is bonus footage of interviews with the actors, but it is nowhere to be found on any of the six disks. Also I suspect the book contains many more details than the film does. For example, on the last two video chapters I had the feeling they missed something. Some of the characters just slip away and they strain to bring everything to a quick conclusion.

We have many fond memories of discussing the characters and their trials and triumphs. I was happy to find it on DVD and at such a reasonable price. I bought copies for my children for Christmas. My wife and I are almost through watching it for the first time on DVD and I could not ask for better quality. Just as good as the original in my opinion. It really helps one see how our country has changed and how quickly it has changed and how quickly it will continue to change. It also puts the issue of illegal aliens in a different perspective and how immigrants have played such an ongoing role in our society. There have always been those who have resented them and there have always been those who have welcomed them warmly. Amazingly it all occurred without the aid of federally sponsored diversity programs, how remarkable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Wort Watching","review":"Although the Centennial Series is over twenty years old it is still worth watching.

Ten minutes in I started worrying, by 30 minutes in I was apolgizing to my husband and by 45 we gave up. I had to come back and see if I had correctly read the reviews. It is slowly paced, ridiculously acted and I'm sorry but terribly implausible. I completely enjoy historical and in particular western themed movies but this was not watchable. I say this as someone who doesn't purchase a lot of media and considered this a splurge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"After watching the first disc of the series I could not beleive that money was spent to tell this story. While the story itself would have been interesting as well as educational, the writing was absolutely terrible and that of a beginner, the adaptation from the book for TV was awful, and direction left more than enough to be desired. If the book by Wilder was anything like its protrayed on the screen I'm glad I haven't read any of Wilders other books if he's written any. I can't beleive I paid money for this series. I've seen better writing to tell a story from a middle school student than what was written for the screen here. It's a shame also because this story of Colorado could have been very educational if it had the proper mechanics to tell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great old movie","review":"I had seen bits and pieces of this over the years, but was thrilled to be able to see this from beginning to end.

It is by far one of the best, if not the best mini series to air on television. I have watched this mini series countless times and have my personal VHS recording of it. I was ecstatic at the announcement that finally Centennial was to be released on DVD. I am, however, very disappointed that Universal left out so much of the original version ... the prayer Lame Beaver's father taught him, Levi's rescue by Lucinda, their marriage and McKeag's death, and Lucinda's education in St Louis to mention a few. To my disappointment, at least 2 hours were omitted. I am happy to have the DVD copy, but I will burn my VHS to a DVD in order to have the COMPLETE mini series as it aired.

I vaguely remembered that while I liked it, I was disappointed in the ending. After viewing the DVD's, that feeling was definitely reaffirmed. That is the problem with trying to include current day events in a presentation of what was otherwise a story of past events. It's not that I necessarily disagree with the political point of view presented -- it's just that it was so blatantly out of place with the rest of the story.

This was the most well done of any of the mini-series. I worked evenings in a hopital then, and we'd all find reasons to visit the patients--and their TV's. We'd wait until the next show aired to watch the story unfold. These characters were very well acted and developed. I wish the oncoming adaptations would have been as well done. I bought the book later and was pleasantly surprised how well the series had stayed true to the book in detail. I had seen it air again several years later and was just as impressed the second time as the first. I only recently found this was available and it is certainly now on my list to buy. The attention paid to the story makes this timeless. I'd encourage anyone who hasn't seen this one to watch it.

They are not. The finish on the wood is absolutely horrible and the bristles are mediocre at best. I purchased two of them and one has a crack running about 3/4 the length of the handle that you can tell was there before it was finished, but they passed it on through like that. Unfortunately, it would be more effort than its worth to go through a return so I'll simply add some screws to draw the crack closed.Overall I'd say these are worth about three dollars each and no where near the twenty I paid.Not recommended- look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Tasty!","review":"I love the Yerba Mate Pure Empower Mint tea.

I drink this tea every morning in place of my usual cup of coffee and feel energized and focused for the entire morning. The mint flavor isn't overpowering at all, and with a teaspoon of honey, this tea is perfectly sweet and refreshing. It tastes much lighter than other teas, and I truly enjoy it every morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Recommendation By Dr. OZ","review":"I only purchased this because Dr. Oz promoted it on his show.

It tasted fine but I didn't notice any energy change at all. To be honest, I'll stick with Earl Grey if I want an energy boost, or Irish Tea.How ever much caffeine is in this tea is not enough to produce an energy boost.

Bush's foreign policy or--alternatively--John Kerry's \\"multilateral\\" version of the same thing.None of them question the right of the USA to police the world. During the 1980s Berman backed the Nicaraguan contras. In the 1990s he defended NATO bombing in the Balkans. His latest crusade against Moslems angered at Western oil companies bleeding their countries dry is obviously to be expected.Todd Gitlin is well-known for his attacks on 1960s radicals who refused to back Hubert Humphrey for President. Such a proclivity for warmaking Democrats would lead one to question whether he truly understands the meaning of patriotism. Peace and noninterference are far more patriotic than flag-waving and war-whooping.Kanan Makiya is an Iraqi intellectual who was on the front lines urging war in Iraq. And so on.This book is not worth the paper it is written on."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Grimms Make you Grin!","review":"This is one classic that will put a grin on your face over and over. It's a delightful collection, and not just for kids, but for anyone who wants a little light escapism. Much is made of the violence, but it is so cartoonishly over the top and karmically justified that I doubt it seriously disturbing to even children, who can see worse on t.v. in an hour's time anytime. What is amazing to me is how much of the basis this book is for Disney's classics and other animated films. This is a book that has truly lived in various forms on screen and other entertainments for ages. Nice to read something that is just plain fun, full of little twists and turns. As classics go, it is timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad translation","review":"I bought this for a course on German Fairy Tales. Several people in the class had this edition, although it was not the one specified by the professor.The professor was continually surprised by the poor quality of the translation (he is a native german speaker and studies these stories).As just one example, Rapunzel is named after the variety of lettuce that her parents stole. For some reason this book decided to translate that plant into \\"radishes\\" without changing her name.There are other stories too, that are just... missing something.The stories are great, but you can find better translations of them (even for free online).

I found many of the stories contained throughout the book to be similar. Three brothers, princesses, people turned into animals, after a while everything blended together. After you've read the first five stories you can just stop, because everything else is very repetitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once upon a time...","review":"Unlike Hans Christian Anderson, the Brothers Grimm did not invent new fairy tales but collected old ones, with the intention of preserving the oral tradition of the German peasantry. Whether in fact they fulfilled that intention has been questioned. Their tales do afford a glimpse of a world of castles and forests, nobles and peasants, superstitious beliefs and primitive practices that suggest origins at least as old as feudal Europe, and often much older. Some of the tales have been traced back through the centuries by way of earlier versions until they disappear into prehistoric times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Just Listen To An Album??","review":"Don't get me wrong folks, I absolutely love thrash. However, I guess I think thrash should be more than repetitive, boring riffs that seem patched together randomly without any sense of grandeur or purpose beyond pretending to be angry. As a result I must say that I think this is a pretty poor album. I've listened to it several times through, and it's over before I know it, not only because of the scant material, but because it just sounds like a big wall of boring noise. Absolutely nothing stood out to me. Maybe I've just reached a point where I need more out of my thrash than this gives, but frankly I really think it just is not a good album. Maybe their newer material is better...see for yourself I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of baloons for a small price","review":"It's just baloons, the colors are nice they are strong and they are perfectly good enough for a good party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone forgot to shuffle the deck","review":"On the left side of the rainbow (approximate, counting through the package which I haven't opened so I am missing some):3 red6 pink6 orange12 yellow10 whiteOn the right side of the rainbow:5 green1 blue (one of 50, really? come on!)Since I bought it for a boy's birthday party, this was an unfortunate uneven distribution of colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unnecessary enterprise","review":"This book is, I regret to say, more or less an attempt by Wesleyan University Press to artificially expand their catalog of Cage's works.

Jill Barnett's humor and love are in all of them. Clio and Merrick are such delightful characters with strength and great shared love. I love Cyclops, the parrot that loved to swing upside down on her braid, and best of all Thud and Thwack who are also continued in another book. In all of them and her story Ms Barnett's own real love comes through. I am looking forward to reading every book she has or will write.

The plot is contrived in the extreme and the characters are cartoonish at best. If I'm suppose to be charmed by the heroine's lack of common sense it must have passed me by. My guess would be that this book should be labeled a write by the numbers effort of an otherwise competent author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read by Ms. Barnett","review":"I bought this book after reading another book by Ms. Barnett, and I wasn't disappointed. Clio was quite funny as were a few other characters in the book. I really thought it was a sweet love story that had heart tugging moments. I do agree with another reviewer and thought that the ending was a little abrupt for me. I felt like I needed something more after that last situation. There is an epilogue that sort of gives you a look into the future years, but I sort of felt a bit cheated, and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. However, very enjoyable, and I really couldn't put it down. I'm on the lookout for my next Jill Barnett book.

The plot might have been decent, but the characters just were not very deep. Esspecially Merrick, who bored me out of my mind. I finished it... but only because I didn't want the book in the back of my mind.I read \\"Bewitching\\" by Jill Barnette and found it appealing. After reading about so many give-em-hell heroines, Jill's sweet, simple stories with the original and exciting love scenes were refreshing. I would not, however, deem them \\"witty\\". The best book I've read in that aspect is \\"Whitney, My Love\\" by Judith McNaught...I have read it about five times and it is still my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story, Historical Romance","review":"-Read on Kindle-I really enjoyed this one. It is actually the first of three stories with overlapping characters.

He takes two years longer than he intended and she sits waiting for 6 years.When they meet again, they both like each other, but she is mad at being left for so long and is naive and a bit immature from living in a convent. Her character develops throughout the book and she learns and grows and becomes a person you can identify with. Her husband-to-be realizes that there is more to women then just doing what they're told and he learns how to handle her personality and enjoy her quirks.Worth the $2 price tag, could have used one more time editing I think, just a little rough in places.

On my personal list of all time greatest movies only The Unforgiven is a better film. Wayne is splendid as a dying man, an anachronism, which is a fair description of his personal life as well as the life of the character he plays, J.B. Books. In the film, as one suspects Wayne is telling us about his life, the hero is unapolgetic; proud and still capable, soaring above the petty concerns of his inferiors who do not understand him or his times. Harry Morgan has a memorable part as a sheriff of the new age dawning at the beginning of the 20th century. Morgan's characterization makes one long for more romantic times when humans were revered not for their conformity, but rather for their ability to ascend beyond mere humanity and into legend.

The dialogue was more like a stage play--very stilted and unrealistic. Harry Morgan's Marshall character was an over the top joke.The timeline was a joke too--it takes place over 5 days, and by day 3, everyone is completely attached to the Duke's character.The blood in the gunfight scenes looked like melted pink taffy--it was awful.I don't know why everyone gave this 5 stars--sentimentality for John Wayne I suppose, which I can understand.

The main character is not exactly interesting, although he isn't boring...well not much. But the writing style seems to be more for young children than adults.

What a disappointment! I never developed empathy for this self-centered and incredibly insecure character. As woman, I am embarrassed that some of us might actually be like this!

I have seen him in many other movies and love his acting; but in this movie, although he was very good the story line and most of the other actors were very poor. Boring. The review states that this movie was as good as the previous movie with Pedro Infante- - - NOT True; at least in the previous film the music was very good, and the actors made you feel their heartbreak. The Father, Grandmother, and the priest were very believable, a real tearjerker, and the movie was far more believable and interesting. This movie like so many other remakes, the acting feels like the actors just mimic their parts, making it feel very artificial and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin settles into the role of idiosyncratic, soft rock songwriter.","review":"After the perceived disappointment of \\"Sweet Deceiver\\", Kevin seems to be comfortable with himself as a matured, off-beat, soft rock composer on his follow-up release. As usual, the performances of his session players are top-notch on \\"Yes, We Have No Mananas\\" and the songwriting is typical, lovable Kevin. One does miss the experimental element of his earlier work, but having said that, an Ayers pop tune is experimental in lyrical substance to start. Highlights include his remake of \\"Falling In Love Again\\", the ultra-accessible \\"Star\\", the transcendental \\"Blue\\" (with an amazing Ollie Halsall guitar solo) and the oft-maligned but wonderful \\"The Owl\\". \\"Yes, We Have No Mananas\\" is an accessible, tuneful record, if not as exciting as Kevin's earlier psychedelic/progressive work."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS AT ONCE","review":"\\"You just can't find music like this any more\\" is what an old girlfriend told me as she put this LP into my arms back in the day.

It was very poorly produced on an apparent very low budget because the sound and pictures all looked sub-standard. But the content was just as inferior because there was more than just a couple inaccuracies. And why did they have to put an older picture of Joan and a younger picture of Bette Davis on the cover? I would have loved to see a picture of Miss Crawford from the 30's because this was when she was at her most photogenic, but Joan was always very beautiful, at any age! If you're interested in watching a quality documentary about Joan, I recommend the A&E biography which is often shown on Bio Classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love movie trailers, okay.

Each segment clocks in at twenty-five minutes, and tells us nothing more than the average fan of either woman would probably already know. There's no real discussion of the well-known rivalry between the two women, and no in-depth commentary or footage that might raise this DVD into the worth-the-money category.If you want to spend a lot of money watching trailers for their movies, go on ahead, it won't disappoint you on that level.

You just cannot escape a cloying garage-level experimentation with these guys. The key has always been drowning that stuff out with enough noise that somehow it becomes meditative, a hard to find compromise FSA rarely strike in my opinion.

The 14 ways include such things as put a map of Italy on your wall at home, watch a movie about Italy, or listen to Italian music, etc. At best, these suggestions might be good if the book was titled \\"14 waysto get your grade school kids excited about Italy\\".

The pictures are beautiful but they only do so much;the organization of the text leaves much to be desired. I've had a lot of experience in cooking and baking and found this book very difficult to use. I will probably return it. If you are looking for a dessert book I'm sure you could find a lot better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"revised rating and additional comments","review":"I knew the photos in this book looked familiar - they're from the DK Press cookbooks (especially Ultimate Cakes).The Cordon Bleu editors spliced in photos and sections of the DK Press technique explanations. That's why the recipe instructions are disjointed and some techniques are never explained - the section in the DK cookbook(s) they're taken from has not been included in the Cordon Bleu book. It's a cheaper production method, but it's unfair to an unsuspecting buyer. I'm very disappointed with the Cordon Bleu.If you really want to learn about desserts, pastries and cakes, buy one of the DK Press books - to make sure you get ALL the pictures - and refer to Rose Levy Beranbaum, Nick Malgieri, Maida Heatter, Julia Child, et al for instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"The book is filled with great pictures, but the techniques are poorly described, and sometimes are not described at all. I've tried several recipes and all of them have been missing steps that the book assumes you already know. My sponge cake for example could have been used for a spare tire, not sure what happened there! I've used some of the ideas in the book, but have gone to other cookbooks for the actual recipes! This book was not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Its been awhile since I made this purchase but it was helpful. I just wanted to write a review for you.

This piece reads like prose and flows with a natural lucidity from beginning to end. The Protagonist has a lot of depth and takes on all adversaries in a stylish and believable manner, with a great portrayal of inner conflict. All characters are expertly developed and only accent the vividly complicated plot. Great read over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic","review":"Only memorable for its ordinariness. Yet again our hero has been accused of a crime he didn't committ. Fine for a one-hour drama set on Earth, but out in space anything can happen. Anything.

It needs a decent ending, one that measures up to the promise of the first 2 in the series.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A necessary read but a sleeper","review":"I have very much enjoyed reading Kage Bakers' Company books. However, I must say... this one's a real sleeper. It's a necessary read because it has valuable information (very little...) and insight for the next book, \\"The Graveyard Game\\", but I snored thru it.Especially the chapter on Babylon. I was tempted several times to skip the whole thing, but kept thinking I would miss information I would need later on. NOT!However, don't let this book turn you off to reading the rest of the series. \\"The Graveyard Game\\" is fantastic. I couldn't put it down. I hope the author is busy writing the next ( and hopefully answering *all* my questions!) book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mendoza asleep","review":"Mendoza is normally pretty sharp but in this yawn Kage Baker is too busy setting up the background some larger tome to follow that she doesn't bother to include a plot in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in space","review":"The author as well as the character are totally lost. Certainly the idea of Dr. Zeus and his immortals is interesting. For goodness sake's this is the third I have bought and read. But it is like a bad joke that goes on and on. I keep hoping for some interesting point or switch but we suffer AIMLESSLY with Menoza who is suffering for 300 years for 5/6th the book until we meet her new love, and then he is dead 40 pages later and she and the reader is endlessly punished. Get a new idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mendoza matures","review":"Another very satisfying \\"Company\\" novel. What struck me (apart from the usual fine characterisation and description) is the evolution of Mendoza's character. The first novel brought her to heights and then to exquisitely painful lows, and the second showed her wallowing. The third one portrays her finally getting over her lost love and beginning to mature and rejoin \\"human\\" society.\\"Mendoza in Hollywood\\" gave only a little space to the subplots that appeared in the second novel; I trust we'll see more of them in the next \\"Company\\" novel. But I didn't feel they were really missed; the time was spent on showing how Mendoza changed into a more mature and better person. And we the readers are the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best so far","review":"i liked the first book and was let down a bit by the second. thought i'd give this one a try before giving up on the series. so, now, i have ordered the 4th, in hardback yet and used to boot, just so i can follow mendoza's adventures in time. i'm not much of a critic, i just like to be entertained. kage baker is taking her place among my favorite writers, who include connie willis, dana stabenow, kathleen taylor, and nevada barr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun read!","review":"Continuing with the adventures of Mendoza, Kage Baker doesn't disappoint us with her motley cast of characters as they caper through time on their appointments for the Company. I don't like to give away too much information in reviews, telling too much plotline... but if you liked the first or second of this series, I'm sure you'll like this one, too! Lots of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Mendoza, you'll be begging to die halfway through","review":"Mendoza in Hollywood is a great disappointment. It lacks the wit of In the Garden of Iden. Of course, the 19th-century American west is never my favorite time period, and there's way too much traditional Anglo American history (a la Frederick Jackson Turner).Imarte (the anthropologist gathering information as a frontier whore) is the best part of the book.Far too much time is spent in film descriptions, in cyborg film buffs mapping \\"homes of the stars\\" onto 1864 California, and in slapping together conspiracy theories from the Company's data.What is brilliant about In the Garden of Iden is only a third-sequel re-hashing in Mendoza in Hollywood.But don't take my word for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Hard to believe this is by the same author who wrote the first two. She wastes the whole first half of this book in being \\"cute\\" -- a forced kind of whimsy that goes nowhere. The really interesting developments that appear in midpoint are never followed up on (maybe in the next book?) The whole recapping of the plot of \\"Intolerance\\" seems barely germane to the plot of the book. Big chunks of the book are taken up by philosophizing thinly disguised as dialogue. The romantic part of the story was one step away from being a gothic bodice-ripper. I still think the whole concept of the Company is terrific. I know Baker can write with keen humor and sharp insight (\\"Sky Coyote\\"). Let's hope her inspiration returns for the next books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for your child","review":"This book is fun to read -- it's more like an interactive experience for your child.The sparkling decals are fun to put on to the dancers and then fun to peel off again -- remember colorforms?And you'll learn about dancers and cultures from around the world.. a good way for your child to learn that we're all different, but all still the same.BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked from day 1","review":"I wanted to get my son a child friendly cd player he could tote around for the summer.

The clever rythmic patterns in their original songs were infectious.

This book would be best for a high school age girl. Far too much information for a pre-teen to absorb or fully understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre Teen Bible for Girls","review":"An informative and excellent book that I gave my pre teen daughter.

This book is too mature for girls that age. I heard my daughter reading the book and could not believe that this was the book I had bought for her. She then had this look upon her face that told me I had alot of answering to do. The book just put more questions in her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read great reviews about this stuff; I shouldn't have paid attention. Avant-garde ? Experimental music ? Just a total lack of ideas, senseless noise, a totally boring achievement. Listen to me, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Gastr del Sol release","review":"This is the best gastr album out. Although Camofleur is good it gets rid of the sounds and minimalism that make Upgrade and Afterlife so enjoyable. There are slow acoustic guitar marches, bizarre static interludes, some horns and organs, and all done with taste and restraint. Almost totally indescribable, but certainly worthwhile for the post-rock thrill-seeker. Also worth getting is Jim O'Rourke's solo record Bad Timing, which is absolutely gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I had heard about Gastr Del Sol from an avant garde friend. When I picked up the CD, I really didn't know what to expect. What I got was nothing short of a masterpiece. UPGRADE AND AFTERLIFE incorporates electronic noises, delicate piano, and acoustic guitar, plus a plethora of unidentifiable sounds. The seven tracks are unique and wonderful. \\"Our exqusite Replica of 'Eternity'\\" begins with a delicate piano, veers off into noise hell, and ends quietly. \\"Rebecca Sylvester\\" uses vocals, acoustic guitar, and some drone to create a beautiful song. \\"The Sea Incertain\\" is an instrumental track which incorporates some steam noises. \\"Hello Spiral\\" begins with a butchered sound collage, then starts off on a piano. \\"The Relay\\" and \\"Crappie Tactics\\" both use eerie piano and synths. The final song, \\"Dry Bones....\\", is a wonderful and trancey cover. If you like avant garde experimental music, buy this Gastr album. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"of course it's gone now","review":"This worked so well that I came back for more. To find it gone. Had it's on internal power supply and fan.

Sometimes it recovers within a fraction of a second, sometimes it never recovers until I switch the TV to a different input and back. This is between a Samsung PN63A650 TV and a Sony BDP-S350 Blu-ray player. The problem also happens between the TV and a TiVo HD XL. It usually happens in 1080p@60Hz mode, rarely (maybe never) in 1080p@24Hz mode.I later bought a cable from monoprice.com (10ft, 28AWG, with ferrite cores) and it works fine in all modes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all HDMI cables are equal","review":"I moved the new TV to the other room and the problem went away. At that point I realized that the cable company��s HDMI cable was much thicker that these that I had purchased here. I swapped HDMI cables, replacing the one I purchased with the cable company��s thicker HDMI cable, and made the problem go away altogether.The upshot is that not all HDMI cables are equal.

Here's a quick review: If it were up to Nostradamus, schoolchildren would be taught reading, 'riting, and racism. Nostradamus's precepts represent a backward step of hundreds of years, a backward step into a chasm with no bottom save the endless darkness of death. I once told Nostradamus that even Nostradamus must concede that learning the truth can be a painful experience, especially for it. How did it respond to that? It proceeded to curse me off using a number of colorful expletives not befitting this letter, which serves only to show that I have some advice for Nostradamus. It should keep its mouth shut until it stops being such an odious riffraff and starts being at least one of informative, agreeable, creative, or entertaining.

I feel the storyline was very boring and the little middle \\"romantic\\" situations were nothing too entertaining nor too graphic. Easily a G rated series for younger kids to watch. I do not think some older Elementary kids would enjoy this series nor older people unless they are really into Piano music. Without deriving meaning from the Piano music, you may as well kiss your interpretation of the series goodbye!

Later on, however, D.W. makes a surprising discovery about what happened. Will it change her feelings for Blankie?I really like the illustrations in this book. I enjoy the pink stripes on D.W.'s outfit in the books (that aren't on the TV show) and this book takes it a step further on the cover by adding a blue speckle pattern to her pink jumpsuit.

The guitars are not turned up to their maximum legal crunchiness here, and there's less keyboard, but otherwise the sound is very similar. Some of the rhythms have been done before--for example, \\"On the Table\\" sounds a lot like \\"The Electric Version\\". But overall, the songs are still catchier than they have any right to be. My favorites are \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Drink to Me, Babe, Then\\", \\"Come Crash\\", and \\"The Town Halo\\".

We were thoroughly unimpressed. We didn't have much trouble setting it up, but our son doesn't like it at all. Waiting around for the narrator to say \\"press a button\\" and then having a significant delay between pushing the button and the \\"game\\" (I use that term lightly...) continue just isn't fun. He doesn't understand that he's supposed to wait and he doesn't understand that once he does get to push the button it's actually making something happen. We played the sample games and the games on the First Steps disc. There was nothing that he was interested in at all.When we bought this system, we thought it would be much more interactive and much more educational. It's really just a DVD that needs a button pushed every once in a while to continue. Completely not worth the money in my opinion.

BORING!!!!!!!! This game is so dumb after watching a really boring cartoon, if your child is still paying attention to the T.V they just ask you to press a button, once you press the button there is a big delay before the video continues, so it isn't even obvious to the child that he has interacted with the T.V. My son sits and watches elmos world and baby einstein, so it isn't like he doesn't have the attention span, this game is horrible. I set it up in 5 minutes though with playstation 2.

The games are slow for an adult but for my kids they love it even my 4 year old son loves playing and helping his little sister. We have not bought any of the other games yet just the game that came with. I recommend that you buy a few extra games because it only comes with three. We will be going and getting some soon.It is building confidence and new learning concepts. I home school and it is a fun way to reinforce some of the lessons that I do with out making it feel like work.

After waiting for the Xmas rush to subside, I called Funtastic (the distributor in Australia) and they gave me 24 generic codes to try. These, again did NOT work after much frustration. Their explanation is that almost all DVD players nowdays are made up of differing components. Mine is a Sansui with built in hard drive.

It is all original tunes and shows a variety of influences from the 60s and 70s, most noticeably Pink Floyd, but also some Abbey Road-era Beatles. \\"Here to Greet the End\\" is a stand-out track.The band had considerable talent and consisted of:Robert Wade - vocals, keys, rhythm guitarPatrick King - vocals, lead guitars, keysMatt Johns - percussionBlaine Hillan - bass, vocalsPete Schwartz - keysThe song list:1.

Even I learned a lot from this book. I think anyone who is interested in mummies, anthropology, or Egyptology but still doesn't know much about it, should pick up this book as a good basic starting point.

I went with the more expensive pad because of the description the company gave it, but I would have been better off purchasing a pad for 20.00 and then if it broke, I would purchase another and still not be at what I paid for the ignition pad.

It came with broken up and down arrows. The zipper on the side for sticking the foam in is also weak because the teeth won't stay in place properly. They tend to get knocked out of place and I'm concerned those things will fall off after minor amounts of zipping/unzipping. Had it come in proper condition it may have made an alright pad but it's construction seems inferior toEnergy's Foam Dance Padanyway so I recommend saving yourself the hassle and getting that instead.

Sadly, when I tested these pads on standard and heavy songs, the back button started malfunctioning, responding to any slight pressure on the pad, no matter where it was pressed. It sometimes wouldn't register and then fire off automatically. The pad is virtually useless now, try to find a different pad, the 2.0 pad was far superior but the 3.0's problem is the raised buttons, when those get bent in any fashion, the sensors get screwy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck buttons","review":"I've own 2 RedOctane 3.0 dance pads for a little over half a year.

At first only 1 pad would malfunction and the down arrow would sometimes not respond while other times automatically repeat itself. A week later, the 2nd pad started to have the same problem, but with the right arrow.I'm a little pissed considering I paid almost $100 for each of these pads, when I could've gotten a generic foam pad for a quarter of the price. Even if those pads aren't as reliable, I could have 4 for each RedOctane pad and I'm pretty sure those would last at least 1.5 months each.All in all, I'm rather dissatisfied with the product.

Worse still, these particular reproductions generally eliminate the sepia, blue-ish, or silvery tones of the original works and consequently misrepresent the artist's intent.

When she interviews a descendant of Serena's, she becomes involved in a murder mystery, when the woman dies unexpectedly, leaving Karen her papers in order so that a center for women's studies may be founded, she also puts Karen as a suspect. Meanwhile, tensions are heating up over a student who is harassing another one of Karen's students. When she gives the boy a bad paper grade, his father, a college trustee threatens to sue. With Detective Piotrowski's help, she turns to solving the mystery. The author is clearly having fun poking fun at the pomposities of college life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am using this book and need to understand it better","review":"I find this book to be a bit structured and I need to understand the content clearer.

Dr. Alice Towne, Harrison's first female physician is puzzled by her decline. Could it be that the gathered relatives are not as solicitous as they seem? Is the loyal housekeeper really so loyal? Is Mrs. Burnham's relationship with her handsome son-in-law all it should be? This book is an intriguing combination of medical thriller and classic whodunit with a gothic twist.Mrs. Disney's plot is ingenious. As always, her characters are believable and well drawn. Unfortunately, the outdated medical terminology made it hard for this twenty-first century reader to pick up key clues. The ending was very abrupt with the denoument left entirely to the reader's imagination.Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny As It Gets","review":"...

This time Juanes rushed too soon making this cd, making some of the songs sound very childish and not meaniingful. His previous album is 100 times better than this new one.

What can I say except, nada valgo...okay, not really.But seriously, Juanes impressed me with most of his songs. My very favorite is, of course, \\"Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor.\\" I understand Spanish fairly well, and the beautiful lyrics of this song entranced me. Not to mention the catchy beat.

His music back then, as well as in his last two albums, was excellent, quality work.I decided not to purchase this album because the songs sounded rushed, mediocre, and over-produced. Obviously he is selling lots of albums, but for those who have followed his musical career, it seems as though we agree this album is not good. It was actually a turn off for me to his music.I would suggest FIJATE BIEN or Ekhymosis albums instead of this one for anyone interested in Juanes, as well as unique, quality music. These productions hands down are way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ay Juanes!","review":"Well, my opinion is that nothing surpasses\\" Un dia normal\\", but this album nonetheless is enjoyable and well-written.

Este hombre de rockero no le queda nada mas que el look y la imagen con la que se muestra. La camisa negra es una cancion tonta y me causa risa que la hayan censurado en un pais.

If you haven't heard Bloodrock I'd suggest you'd buy their first or third album first. Or if you can afford it, get them all, they're all great. There's only one song on here which i don't like and that is Abracadaver. But the rest is good with Magic Man, American Burn, Promises and Rock & Roll Candy Man being the strongest.

And Point At The Mountain' (Drag City)","review":"At least as good as their 'Tenth Corner' effort (see my review). Again, well crafted space rock / Avant Garde from this Wisconsin band. Eight tunes, each of the songs are title-less. Best cuts are the almost Hawkwind-like (at times) nineteen-minute track no. 3, sixteen-minute track number 5 and cut no. 6. Personnel-Richard Franecki-guitar, noise & electronics, Greg S.-digital transfers, John Helwing-bass, guitar & digital tranfers and Jan Schober-bass, drums & electronic devices. If you like bands like F/i, Architectural Metaphor, Farflung and say....Melting Euphoria then you should get as much out of this CD as I did. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car Camping - Works Great","review":"This twin bed worked well and fit nicely in our 2009 Subaru Outback.

I ended up using an exacto knife and razor to do most of the work and then used the Dremel for the fine tuning.

It stopped his grumbling straight away, and he smiled at it more than us! Now he is 4 months and it is still by far his favourite toy - he particularly loves the squeaking and rustling sounds - and he can now chew and cuddle it.Other reviewers have said that the musical part doesn't work, or that the song is too short, but I haven't had that problem at all - in fact, our baby sets off the music just by chewing on the worm's head. I'm not sure if having toys that continually play tinny music is such a desirable thing, anyway. We bought this DESPITE the fact that it was musical, not because of it. Perhaps if you're looking for music, you should buy a CD.I would highly recommend this for young babies, and I can see it remaining a favourite for a while to come.

They are usually wonderful baby and toddler toys, but this particular one disappointed me slightly. First of all, the music is very quiet and electronic sounding. It sounds like the music you might get from a cheap toy at the dollar store. There is also no way to replace the battery, so when it stops it's done for good. The textures and rattles are great, but other toys have these as well. I would recommend a different Lamaze toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"so perfect!","review":"My son is 10 weeks old and is so happy to lay and clutch this toy.

My Mom bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. Her favorite thing was finding the crinkly sound that two of the sections of the worm makes. Each section is different,one has a rattle, one squeeks, and if you push the head, it plays a little song. My daughter is 1 1/2 now, and doesn't play with this much anymore...she's into baby dolls now, but I would defenatley reccommend this item for a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely boring","review":"My 15 month old daughter has absolutely no interest in this toy. We bought this for her when she was around 6 months old or so and she has never played with it. It doesn't do anything. I think there is one spot that will play a little bit of music when you squeeze it, but that's about it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"To call it musical is a stretch. The music is extremely quite and not exciting. The worm itself is nice and vibrant but the description and picture make the worm seem a lot bigger than it really is. We have purchased a few other Lamaze items and have loved all of them but not impressed with this item at all. I ended up returning it to purchase a real musical toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what is this toy supposed to do?","review":"I know not every toy is supposed to be entertaining or stimulating, but this toy was a let-down. We initially bought the worm, thinking our son would like the large size, explore the different body sections, and react to the music. Unfortunately, the music when you squeeze the head is so soft, it took my husband and I a second to realize it was coming from the toy. After presenting it to our 5 month old, he lost interest in it very quickly and never wanted to play with it again. Now, it just sits in his room, neglected, and will be dontated to a charity very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for both my kids!","review":"I have both a 2 year old and a 6 month old and both kids love this toy. My oldest loves it because of its colors; he likes to announce them in Spanish. My littlest loves it because of the rattle and the brightness and textures of the colors. I love it for the price. My only complaint is that the music is tinny and insubstantial...it's two steps above a dog whistle in my opinion. Otherwise, it proves to be interesting to kids of various ages and it is undoubtedly cute and inoffensive (as far as obnoxious noise or music). This would make a great baby shower gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"No interest","review":"I got this when my son was five months old. He had little interest in it.

It has all the crinkly stuff that our baby loves, and on the bottom it has measurements in both inches and centimeters so we can see how much the baby has grown.We've found it to be extremely useful as a mini bumper-guard. It is extremely effective and keeping the baby's hands and legs away from the crib's bars while he's asleep without using an actual guard that would block airflow.The only downside to this toy is that it's not really musical. It plays one tune, fairly mechanically, and requires a hard press of the worm's mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure why he loves it, but he does.","review":"My son loves this toy, it doesn't do much, and the \\"music\\" is hard to activate (you've got to squeeze the tongue very hard to get it to play), but he squeals whenever he sees it and will spend quite a while playing with it. Gund has a very similar product, but I do think this one is cuter and its significantly bigger, which may be half the appeal to a kid whose only 27 inches long himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for it's different textures!","review":"Not only does the inchworm play music (it's just one song though), you can also see how long your baby is (only goes to 25 inches).

She's discovering her hands right now and she likes the feel and the noise that some of the material on the inchworm makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"We played with this toy some. All the different noices and rattles, I guess, are supposed to be educational, I don't see much value in it from educational standpoint. OK, the inchworm parts make different sounds, but why? They all look the same other than the color variation which has nothing to do with the sounds. And the music is cute hence the two stars, but it is only one song and soon becomes boring. Impossible for a baby, even young toddler to turn it on. I eventually tought my son to whack it on the floor hard to turn the music on. Not too good solution. I do NOT recommend this toy, unless you get it given. It does some, but not worth the money to my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely Colorful. And forget about \\"music\\"","review":"I think this toy is very cute and colorful and that's about it. As others have said, it's pretty boring and the baby ends up mostly hugging it or mouthing it (but he mouths anything). Each worm segment has something inside, but the worm is so plush you have to press pretty hard. He much prefers his other toys and i suspect this worm will soon become just a room decoration. Oh, and the music is very tinny and ANNOYING-it's not loud but it's high pitched, which is the worst combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"inchworm","review":"It was a requested gift and while it hasn't been played with yet, I am certain Anna will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I was excited to buy this toy for my son, for Christmas. Although he hasn't gotten to play with it yet, I can already tell that it's not going to be his favorite.

From the opening notes to \\"Castle of Thoughts\\" to the mighty crescendos of the trio \\"Cheater\\", \\"jessica\\" and \\"Gotta Find a Way\\", this is a power album. The vocals are muddy, but the music employs the rousing bass guitar and the sloppy almost out of control lead guitar which dominates some of the best rock of this genre. This groups bridges that fine line between heading for out of control to being out of control (as exhibited by some of the more unihibited acts of the time, such as the MC5 and the \\"old\\" Alice Cooper group).

It makes me surmize that the group was already in turmoil, had broken up, and needed a 'product' to suave the fans AND their contract w/Capitol. Plus the delivery of 'Breach of Lease' 'DOA' and even 'Jessica' is routine'rouser rock.' Most of these songs were performed way too much in a GFR vein.

But seeing it for real is the difference and 365 Starry Nights provides a wonderful set of instructions for finding constellations, planets and annual celestial events quite simply.We're now saving up for astronomical binoculars and/or a good personal telescope, in the meantime, we'll view from the local observator and just keep looking up ;-) I'd recommend this book to beginners to experts alike!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to looking at the night sky","review":"This is a great book. Full of fascinating facts. This is the best Astronomy 101 text I have read. It is easy to just go to the paragraph you need, it is all very self contained and very accessible. Great illustrations! My only qualms with this book is that it says nothing of the planets. It recommend the software Pocket Star PC as a companion product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complete but with rough spots.","review":"This is a somewhat disorganized, but very good beginners volume. Suffers from inconsistent provision of star and constellation pronunciations in last few months, occasional lapses of continuity between dated text and figures, lots of repetition - the latter not all bad for beginners. Cygnus figures far overdone in quantity - appeared on 14 of the 17 pages for August . October month section contains outstanding explanation and illustrations of celestial sphere and stellar movements with respect to observers location, and extremely useful and lucid graphic and textual explanation of RA, declination, azimuth and elevation relationships. Best I have seen in other volumes, mostly of much higher price. Got the impression Ramo got tired of the project along about September when things started going a bit downhill on pronunciations and content. Altogether a good buy for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner's Book","review":"I was pleased with the easy to follow format and the interesting facts mixed with the narrative.

The book is divided into 365 segments to give a clear picture of the sky every night of the year. This is an Excellent book to learn the sky and constellations. The main focus of the book is naked eye astronomy, but would also be useful for binocular and small telescope observers. The book is full of hundreds of charts, drawings, and maps that help in explaining the night sky. Rather than sitting down and reading this book from cover to cover, I enjoy reading this book throughout the year. 365 Starry Nights would be a good book for a beginner astronomer, or anyone who enjoys the night skies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, literate, informative, and fun","review":"This is a book that's hard to put down.

What distinguishes this movie is the unbelievable portrayal that K.H. gives us. That she would spend 30 days or more with a highly professional student of Artur Rubenstein, not only learning the intracacies of playing the piano (as a retired orchestra conductor/pianist myself of more than sixty years, I think it fair to say that I know whereof I speak), but being able to communicate them so well that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that she was doing all of the playing herself, is beyond any reasonable expectation.For this, and this alone, I would say that Clara is by far the finest portrayal that Hepburn ever gave in a most distinguished career.Lest this be a one woman encomium, let it be said that Robert Walker, Paul Henreid and the picture's wonderful director should share in the kudos.Herbert Grossman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Cardiology News, June/ July 2002","review":"\\"This covers all of the major issues in excersice testing in a commendably small volume...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement Burners","review":"Product is appropriate for my DSC unit.

The first problem was that it arrived a week after the Roku player, but not the biggest deal. In the interim I used my HDMI wire from my upconverting DVD player since I would be streaming much of what I watched now.When I finally connected the newly arrived HDMI wire, the picture showed static. Though it played, the screen itself showed static (black and white or green dots) all over the picture. Knowing a little bit about TV's and connections it was easy to deduce something was wrong with the connection. I flipped the wires, changed the ports, disconnected everything to reconnect, reconnected only the Roku with that HDMI wire and even swapped the wire in different devices. Same problem.

I was using them to connect to my Denon AVR-788 Home Theater and I was constantly getting static noise through the cables. It was bad enough to cause the audio to completely drop out altogether. I replaced them with some better shielded cables with ferrite cores and the problem went away. I got the cables [...], but the cables from the HDMI King look similar. They weren't that much more expensive either (I payed $[...] or a pair).The one positive for these cables is that when I use them without the Denon home theater, they work fine. Perhaps the Denon is just more sensitive to noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung LN 52A650 and PS3 don't like this cable...","review":"Bought two of these cables to connect my Motorola (Comcast) cable box and my PS3 to my Samsung LN-52A650.

I ordered four cables at the same time from the same seller and they arrived in one envelope, yet I was charged shipping for each individual cable for a total of $11.92. Combined shipping for all four together should have been at least half as much. The problem lies in Amazon shipping polices. I am not happy when people achive their profits in this round-about manner. Amazon refused my initial request to reduce the shipping charge. Only after I submitted negative feedback to the seller on this issue did Amazon grant me a $2.98 refund on the shipping. At the same time Amazon granted the refund, they asked me to pull down my feedback.

I'm a broadcast engineer. I do know that the less you pay for gear with equally good performance, the smarter you are. This holds true for speaker cables also. I laugh at those who say that one cable of a certain gauge is any better than another with the same gauge. Yes, speaker cables may require larger gauges for longer distances or for larger power consuming speakers. Rest assured, however, the major improvement(s) you think you're hearing with those ridiculously expensive speaker cables is the same crap the guy at the local audio video shop spews about his $80 HDMI cables."},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior quality cable","review":"Stay away from this piece of junk product.

I googled the precise error message, and found that it is almost always associated with bad cables.Rather than spend $25 at Radio Shack for a second cable, I hooked up the DVD player with some spare component video and audio cables that I had lying around.

Do yourself a favor and buy a cable that is certified 1.3 and states clearly that it is capable of delivering 1080p. This particular cable is so cheap that it would cost me more to return it than it's worth. With shipping charges, it's $5 down the toilet. Once again, my mistake for not reading thoroughly.

HDMI cables can cost upwards of 50 bucks at electronics stores like best buy, radio shack etc. Do not waste your money at any of those retailers, purchase this cable instead. For less than 4 bucks including shipping, you get a cable that does the same exact thing for a fraction of the price. The difference in quality from this cable to a \\"high end\\" cable is minimal at best. I personally see no difference at all, and would recommend this cable to anyone.

However, upon plugging one of them into our brand new vizio 1080 p tv for playstation 3, the picture was horrible. There were strange colors flashing across the bottom of our tv, and at one point the whole tv was a blur of static, odd colors and weird chapes. The sound was scratchy and loud.

It's the exact same quality as any other cable out there. The one downside, however, is that it does not support copyright protection. I've tried watching Netflix via my Xbox and other devices and the screen flickers, the audio goes in and out, and the experience is rendered useless. It doesn't bother me too much, but it should be noted. If you plan on using this on some sort of home entertainment system, be warned.

The difference in price is astounding - a few dollars to a few hundred dollars. I'm not going to pay for more for a cable than a Blu-ray player unless it does something like bring me beer and pizza while I watch a movie.I was really surprised when I got the cable. Instead of something that I thought would be cheap-looking and flimsy, the cable was thick and pretty solid.

Simply separate the cords causing interference and YOUR PROBLEM IS SOLVED.POSITIVE - You will most likely notice no difference between these cables and expensive cables in terms of quality.

So I bought a few. Then I told my husband and he made me buy a few more! :)We got the cables really quickly and when we plugged them in - my husband was super excited!

That's what I thought too. Folks, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a really low-end hdmi cable to last you 30 days then this is the cable for you. But if you like quality and uninterrupted sound from your tv or stereo then go ahead and spend a few more dollars for something of higher quality.

This is a great cable for home use mostly because of its price. It gets the job done without being ultra-fancy and still gives a quality image.

Found this at great low price. Quality of picture is about 85% of my premium cable when used on the large TV. Occasional frames of static or blurred edges when compared to premium cable. It is smaller guage (about half the thickness) compared to my premium cable. However for smaller TVs, it is excellent value for the money at 1/10 the price. Will buy again for accessory TVs."},{"rating":"1","title":"feels like something you buy from a local 99 cent store!","review":"bought three of these thinking that it would be a great deal with all the positive reviews but the wire is low guage and I do not think that this product has all the attributes that the seller claims. this hdmi wire feels like something you would buy from a local 99 cent store. I paid like $3 for each cable but I think that it is worth paying an extra $2-3 for another better quality cable from amazon.

This cable does the job but also has a lot of side effects. Causes major interference with my wireless internet and phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable failed after ~10 months of use","review":"I purchased this cable for use with my PS3. It functioned properly (i.e., output video and audio) for about 6 months. At that point, about four months ago, the cable would require increasing amounts of poking and prodding to successfully transmit data. So, in the beginning, if I tapped the connection point at the back of the PS3, it would work. Then, I had to wiggle the cable more until it would work. Finally, no amount of wiggling (or disconnecting/reconnecting, swapping cable connections) would work.I replaced the cable and things worked perfectly, which leads me to conclude that something in the cable simply failed after about 10 months of usage. Here, 'usage' means 'sitting still at all times connecting console and TV'. So, I'm not impressed by this particular cable, and will not purchase it again.That said, buying a $3 cable every ten months is a much better proposition than buying one Monster cable for hundreds of dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month","review":"I bought this cable and it worked fine at first but after a while it started giving a shoddy signal. White specs would appear all over my screen and I would have to adjust the cable until they went away. Most of the time I would get no picture at all. I treat my electronics with care so it most likely wasn't my fault. Perhaps I just got a poorly constructed cable. Remember that you're taking that risk when you buy this extremely cheap cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Bought this cable to connect my cable box to my Toshiba HD TV.

The Amazon basics cable worked immediately when I hooked it up to my Blue-Ray. I'm not sure why my cable did not work when so many others had sucess with their cables.

I just bought three 6 foot cables from Cmple and all three are cheap Chinese junk. Connecting to my DVD player and doing an A/B test with a good cable, all three failed. The first cable provided video and audio but excessive noise snow on the screen. The next two cables not only had noise but scrambled yellow and greeen horizontal bars, no video or audio. I compared all 3 through the same ports and setup against an inexpensive cable I knew to be good and determined the new HDMI cables were all defective.I am still of the belief that as long as the cable will carry a signal and not pick up interference you should not pay excessive ampounts for HDMI.

This cable is far superior to the other cable in a few ways:-It has the cylindrical shaped data cleansing areas at either end of the cable (forgive me, I forget the technical name for it).-Cable is thicker and seems of better quality and durability than the other cable.-Gold connectors!Don't waste money on brand name (i.e., Monster) HDMI cables. It is a digital signal that is being sent through this cable, so differences in analog quality do not matter.On a side note, I bought this cable through Abacus24-7, rather than the default seller that came up when I viewed the product.

I sent an email to the shipper through Amazon asking for assistance (Amazon sent me a confirmation of my sent message), and I never received a reply from the shipper.

I am unable to get sound out of it, just video. I tried hooking my laptop up to my TV with this cable and I only got a picture, no sound. When I tried with a different (more expensive and better made) cable, it worked perfectly.If this truly is a lifetime warranty I would like a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"Worse cables every. I am sorry that I purchased them. Purchased cables for DVR and could never get them to work. The TV has no picture (snow) and no sound.
