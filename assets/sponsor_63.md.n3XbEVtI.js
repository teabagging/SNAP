It challenges me: what can I do to help?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The fourth season of the Wire is another great one in this series. With the focus on the schools and the group of four friends trying to survie in the Baltimore projects - it is more similar to season two than the first and third in feel. The rise of Marlo is a nice added element and the end of the season leaves you wanting more.This is by far one of the best television programs that I have ever seen. The violence and brutality are very realistic and its great because they aren't afraid to kill off a good character.A piece of advice: Don't start out with the fourth season.

This created a gap that they tried to fill with the mayoral election and attempting to educate street kids. Neither of these story lines were very compelling, although they continued to be well written and acted.

Each season so far has been a different theme. Season 1, The Street...Season 2, The Ports...Season 3, Reform..and Season 4 was everything plus the Schools. Don't buy this unless you've seen all the other 3 seasons...you'll have no clue what the hell is going on besides what the 4 kids on the cover are doing (Randys, Dookie, Naymond, and Michael).

Worse, it's badly out of date by now.A much better bet is to read the online documentation for GnuPG, the free PGP clone, at www.gnupg.org. If you use UNIX, you should use GPG instead of PGP anyway: PGP has a wonderful interface under Windows, but has really stagnated for UNIX users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but useful nonetheless","review":"This book gives an excellent account of how encryption came into the hands of non-spooks (and I don't mean Clipper). But what really matters is the legacy information on how encryption works. This information hasn't changed since. It also gives the reader a solid base of understanding of what PGP is doing when you use it.The book is also quite simple to read, so much so that I felt guilty for \\"studying\\" a book that was so easy that I could blow through a chapter in twenty minutes. One final note of importance is that because the book is old (94), it is UNIX-centric, which is quite refreshing in today's environment of applications written exclusively for Windoze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zimmermann was the creator of PGP","review":"Several of these reviews are critical of the book, but they do not point out that the creator of PGP, Phil Zimmerman, was under investigation by the U.S Attorney General's office at the time that this book was published.

It doesn't disappoint. The storyline in Sacrifice of Angels follows the Federation's desperate attempt to halt the imminent arrival of Dominion reinforcements through the wormhole, and turn the tide of the war by retaking station Deep Space Nine. While stalwart Captain Benjamin Sisko and his crew aboard the Defiant lead the Federation's charge, Major Kira and her associates aboard DS9 carry on the fight in their own way. The characterization is good and the space battle sequences are top-notch. Diane Carey's second Deep Space Nine novelization is always entertaining, and acts as an excellent conclusion to the Dominion War series."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick!","review":"Horrible!

First of all let me say that this is a very poor recording from a technical standpoint. The microphone placement was extremely poor and there was little adjustment of levels by the engineer throughout. The piano is overwhelming the clarinet many times especially in the f minor sonata. In fact it the balance is just bad with the piano extremely loud.Secondly Harold Wright's playing on this CD is not what it was earlier in his career. This CD was made I believe a year or so before his untimely death. If you are purchasing this CD as your only copy of the Brahms clarinet sonatas, there are much better recordings out there, especially in regard to recording quality. This CD is valuable if you want to hear Wright's playing but you must get past the poor quality of recording, which I found difficult to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"well satisified","review":"I purchased this watch many years ago.

After being underused on Saturday Night Live and then appearing on In Living Color only to see the show go off the air afterwards, Chris came back in a big way with this CD. I remember my friend getting it and the two of us laughing our heads off over the CHeap Pete skits and the stand-up routines.The great thing about Chris is that, as someone once told me, he tells it like it is. He cites people such as Eddie Murphy as his influences, but I also see streaks of George Carlin in his delivery and subject matter. He puts the ignorant in their place and always gives insightful views that make you think once you've stopped laughing.

But \\"Roll With the New\\" is little more than select excerpts from \\"Bring the Pain\\" with a few sophomoric Ren & Stimpy style toss-ins, which really aren't up to Chris Rock's normal level. Somebody at Dreamworks figured they could make a boat load of extra money by tossing in 20% original though mediocre content with regurgitations of the best parts of BTP.Do yourself a favor: Save your money and get more laughs by buying \\"Bring the Pain\\" and \\"Bigger and Blacker\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I think Chris Rock is one of the funniest stand-up comics today.......but this cd contains very little stand-up!

The only remotely redeeming parts of it are the couple of recycled bits from older albums that he included. The rest of it is a mish-mash of poorly done comedy skits and musical bits, most of which do not even involve Chris Rock as a performer. Seriously, there are several bits about crickets having a dialog about what shows they left and at what point. I guess Chris feels he has made a big enough name for himself that he doesn't have to do actual comedy anymore, and can focus on his \\"vision\\" and political statements. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste money on this piece of crap. Spend it on one of Chris' earlier albums instead, and you will be a lot happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad State","review":"LP's are far and away better than cd format for one reason...people KEEP LP's!

I believe it had to make Paul Simon smile when he heard it for the first time. \\"Her Song\\" comes back on the newly released Patrick Williams CD with a new title, but I still like this one best. Just when you think you have heard it all in this superb effort, along comes the surprise, \\"Mull of Kintyre\\" which I had heard on a McCartney disc. This is one \\"OTW\\" closure.

While it is a bit dated (2nd edition published in 1994) Dr. Popkin's discussion of \\"low-information rationality\\" helps explain voter's behavior even today.With the explosion of electronic communities on the Internet and the impact of 24 hour news channels, an updated 3rd edition would be most welcome. Indeed, during my entire time reading I constantly wondered how Dr. Popkin would view these two recent phenomenon's.While The Reasoning Voter might be too dry a text for the average reader, any student of political science and some hard core political junkies will find this edition worthwhile. I found chapter 6, on primaries, to be especially informative and chapters 7 thru 9 (plus 11 in the 2nd edition) on the primaries of 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1992 to be significant from a historical sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Is The Gov't Doing? Let Me Check The Dow First!!!!!","review":"Popkin argues that the public is not as uninformed as we are lead to believe. The media would have us think that Joe Sixpack is more familiar with Joe Camel than Joe Biden. That might be, but that does not mean that they cannot reach smart decisions. They can reach decisions that would be similar to those that they would reach had they been fully informed. They can do this through the use of shortcuts. A shortcut could be the movement of the DOW or their price of gas, but what must happen is that the shortcut must be relevant for the person's life. The shortcut must be something they can link to politics based on their experience. These shortcuts can be misguided, but more often than not they work to advance the interests of those using the shortcut.

So get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Largely overrated work of political science.

And the magical expressions of ferret feelings are brought to life in these amazing calendar photos captured by talented photographer, Jeanne Carley.Every month turns over a delightful depiction of ferrets posing in lifelike animation. The expressions conveyed by these little pets are adorable -- and they wear the coolest outfits!This, in my opinion, is the Finest Ferret calendar available. I can't wait until the next month to turn over a new ferret scene, each one cuter than the last. Your ferret would want you to order this calendar..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ferret 2004 Calendar by Jeanne Carley","review":"Ms. Carley is outstanding with her annual ferret calendars, and has done it again! People who aren't owned by ferrets find the pictures charming, amusing, down right delightful! For those of us who are owned by ferrets, well, the pictures show these wonderful creatures in amusing situations that we know they probably imagine in their minds, and we know to be part of their fun loving nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2004 calendar does not disappoint!","review":"I recieved my 2004 calendar last week and had to go through it immediately, to see the cute ferret faces and unique poses. I was not disappointed. The faces are as cute as ever and the scenes clever. I just love the cover ferret. His expression is so human, as are the others. And Jeanne Carley is so good at not only catching the right expression, but in selecting the scenes and costumes. I enjoy the calendar every year and look forward to the next. Any ferret owner will love this calendar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2004 HAS to be a good year, with these weasels on the wall!!","review":"This calendar may be Jeanne Carley's best one yet! The photos are crisp and close (I'm particularly fond of May and December)... there is a good mix of \\"dressed-up\\" & \\"au naturel\\" ferrets (for those who, like me, are really skeeved out by animals dressed as people!)... and how DOES she get those ferrets to DO those things?!?!? For those owned by furries, this calendar is an absolute must-have... and for those poor, lonely, despairing folk who don't know the joy of ferrets in their lives, this calendar just might be the balm that eases their aching emptiness. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Amazing Calendar!","review":"I received my new calendar on 8/9 and couldn't wait to open it! The pictures are incredible. Great thought and creativity went into planning the 2004 calendar and it shows. It is as wonderful as all the previous years! The mini-calendar is a special addition and will hang well on a wall in an office. Now you can not only have the larger calendar at home, but you can enjoy the smaller one at work! The pictures are sure to bring a smile to your face! I recommend this calendar to all ferret owners and ferret lovers out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny (of Chris &)(of Storyhill) is BACK, baby","review":"Johnny Hermanson has created a wonderful CD here. His last offering was kind of odd and a little expiramental. Honestly, I didn't get it. But THIS .... THIS is the stuff. The lyrics mean something, and the tunes are singable. I mean, what more can you ask of a CD. Anyway ... This CD is sort of a thinking-man's pop rock (not in a boy band way). If you like new, independent, free-thinking artists ... try this. You won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for kids or adults!","review":"My three year old loves this item! She was able to figure out how to work it pretty quickly.

Easy to assemble, streamlined, fun to drive for my two-and four-year-old. Works best on smooth surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect gift!","review":"This car looks space age and strange at first blush. It didn't take long for my five year old daughter to get the hang of her \\"new ride\\" and buzz around the house Christmas Day. I cannot keep her off of this thing and even worse, cannot get her to quit chasing her dogs on her plasma car. My only regret is that I didn't buy a second one for her friends to use when they visit. Do not question this gift, it's terrific for boys and girls! Education value;learning the mechanics of this car and manipulating it appropriately increases coordination."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy.","review":"Great toy.

Fun, Fun, Fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroys hard wood floors","review":"My 2.5 and 4.5 year olds love to ride these cars. The problem is they destroy your wood floors. We have quarter sawn white oak floors. The front wheels leave long scratches when the vehicle is turned. The rear plastic wheels press tiny grooves into the wood, destroying the floors. The area that extends from my kitchen Island around the front stairs, down the hall and back now has more grooves than a phonograph record. We have lots of other riding toys in the house and have never had this problem. The vehicle is constructed well. The largest flaw is the low quality wheels. We have some 90mm rollerblade wheels on order and we'll attempt to replace the stock wheels. If this doesn't work, they'll be banished for basement only use."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kiddo Loves This Car!","review":"We bought this car for our little girl who just turned 5. She loves this car! It is super light weight so she can carry it around and move it if she gets stuck, and it doesn't use batteries so it doesn't have to be charged every 2 hours. It rides very smoothly and turns very easily. It doesnt leave marks on the floors, so it is ok for her to ride it In the house. Definitely recommend this to anyone with young children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is awesome.","review":"All 3 of my grandchildren have this car and they love it. Their neighbor's 4 kids all have them too. The age range of these kids is 2 to 11 years old. I have to admit, we adults take our turn also.

She is enjoying it, your service was great and it was simple to assemble. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Plasma Car","review":"The car I purchased was advertised as a Plasma car, but when it arrived, I knew it wasn't the real thing but instead a generic version called the Whrilly Roller. The actual Plasma car as enjoyed by the neighbor children, is much heavier and has a 2 tone appearance, with the seat being one color and the body a different color. The one I bought off Amazon was all one color and much lighter. It's not bad...it's just not what we expected and certainly not as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning itis a fake","review":"Do not buy this from here it is a fake. I read that the Plasma Car is the Canadian version of the Skitter. The car comes with plastic wheels when I went to upgrade the wheels to the polyurethane ones I had to modify the 2 back hubs by drilling certain parts of the hub. Just go buy the real one from the skitter website and a must to upgrade the wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed!","review":"Purchased for my grandaughter.

Occasionally requires a retighening which i feel indicates a very short life span as eventually the bolt will strip.My daughter likes it alot for now, so I think overall its good, but did not like how difficult it was to tighten it to proper strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart shopper","review":"Bought this for my niece's birthday. Very durable and easy to assemble.

You can use them as they were made, just move the handles right & left, etc., or use your legs to push yourself along. Their baby sister was patiently waiting until one of them would get off and then climb on. Although she didn't quite have the concept of how to operate it, pushing it along and just sitting on it made her happy. Their mother even gets on and rides - she is 5'8\\". Everyone LOVES it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment!","review":"I will start with the most important things about this car. My kids love it, and they haven't broken it yet. We don't have a paved driveway so we use it inside in our living room on the bamboo floor and it works great. It doesn't scratch the floor or anything. My three kids can ride on it all together or in twos which they think is super fun. I also have been known to give it a spin around the room, alone or with kid. Normally I don't like to spend so much money on a toy because kids can be so quick to lose interest but that hasn't happened yet. My daughter is 6 and can't ride a bike with out training wheels so I got her this so she wouldn't feel left out and it has done the trick. It's a great car and great investment. Putting it together was easy i was just concerned that I didn't have all the parts \\"seated\\" correctly but in the end it was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"We got this for our four-year-old's birthday and she loves it. She and her five-year-old brother have been fighting over it non-stop. And when they go to bed, my husband and I have been known to take it for a spin around the house because it's so much fun.We use it on our hardwood floors and had intended to keep it inside for that use. I think it would do OK on a sidewalk but not on a surface that has a lot of pebbles or other obstructions.It was quick and easy to put together, and it's a well-made and fun toy. The only downside for us is that we'll probably have to get a second one to eliminate arguments over whose turn it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car - not for low patience kids","review":"The car is very durable and a great toy. I bought it for my younger children who were fighting over tricycles and it is difficult for them to use the way it is intended. They lost interest in trying to make the car move by wiggling the steering back and forth. My 11 year old son has had a great time with it and can make it move properly and even up small inclines with a little extra effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Historically accurate non-fiction but reads like a novel!","review":"The Sun Danced at Fatima is an excellent account of the events that took place nearly one hundred years ago. Fr.

It is hard to put down once you pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE BEEF????","review":"I ordered this for my step MIL because online it looks like a full size gift box, and several of the other reviewers raved about how great it was so I thought I'd give it a try. The box is a little on the small side but is decent. Once you open the shrink wrapped box to get everything out it looks VERY skimpy. I paid almost $70 for it, and it looks like it might be worth $20 if that -- and that's only because of the box. The \\"truffles\\" and \\"english tea\\" as well as the \\"angel candles\\" all look like they're from the dollar store. I'm VERY disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy! picture is a lot better than the actual product","review":"I purchased this item for my company's Mother's Day raffle based upon pictures and positive reviews. I was running out of time, had no time to shop myself and so Amazon was the solution. The item arrived damaged, not enough padding in the box, actually there was no padding at all. The contents arrived all closed in the box too, not nicely displayed as in the picture. The items were cheap dollar store type items, not worth 49 bucks!I initially tried to return the item, only to get a response that this item is not eligible for return!! After calling Amazon, I learned I could still get a refund, but that they would not accept the product back since it contains some food items. I'm glad I got the credit back on my credit card, so I was able to get something else for this raffle instead. My recommendation, go to the local gift shop and check out your purchase directly. Do not get this item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!","review":"This was a fantastic gift basket. The box is a great size and the food packed inside was tasty. My daughter really likes it. Oh, and the clock works too. I would purchase from the company again. I thought the shipping was rather high, but the quality makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS DESCRIBED!","review":"Please dont be fooled into buying this item, as it cannot be returned! The box is beatiful the clock is for show does not work, and the items in the box can be found at your local dollar store, and are not as described. Most would think that a description of Victorian Lace Tea, would in fact include Tea, which shows both in the picture and in description..it does not! It also does not include a porceline picture frame described,and shown in picture but replaced by a plastic photo album. I buy everything from Amazon, and am shocked they would allow this to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had everything","review":"I purchased the chest for someone as a gift, so I didn't get to see it, but from what I hear, it was perfect. It had everything and it was true to the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"spoons received not spoons ordered","review":"When selecting grapefruit spoons to order, I looked at the details a little differently than most might. My focus was on the handle of the spoon. Yes, I wanted it to be attractive, yet a simple design. However, most important to me was the width of the handle. Due to issues that have developed with my right hand, I require a handle with a little width. These spoons appeared to meet my needs. However, the spoons I received are not the spoons in the picture. The spoons I received have a more narrow handle that is plain. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, basic set","review":"These are a good basic set of spoons. The spoons I got look different than the picture, mine have a yellow rubber handle on them. My only complaint, and maybe this is how all grapefruit spoons are, is they are a little short. It's hard to hold them well in your hand. For sure they are not uncomfortable nor am I unable to use them, they just could have a better fit with a longer handle. Otherwise, they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait & Switch!","review":"I ordered these spoons thinking that I was getting the ones pictured and the Norpro Brand as listed. I was sent a different set of spoons and a different brand. I am trying to match my existing spoons and that is why I ordered these spoons. I now have to jump through hoops to get these returned. The set that was sent to me is thinner metal and cheaper looking. I made the mistake of not ordering items fulfilled by Amazon but Amazon needs to take some responsibility for people and companies that sell through their website. Don't order these spoons if you are expecting to get the Norpro spoons pictured with the design at the end of the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sharp","review":"Purchased a set of 4 spoons. Delivery was prompt. Spoons however do not work very well as they are not sharp enough to easily cut a grapefruit that we tried eating. We have an old set of \\"Florigold\\" spoons that work much better but wanted to get another set for a summer home. These are not going to make it and we still need to continue searching.The Florigolds have a very fine and sharp cutting while these are very coarse and not sharp enough to easily get the job done.Still searching.Tim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for the money","review":"I am very pleased with these grapefruit spoons. They are of very good quality. I would definately recommend them to a friend or anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great but work fine","review":"These spoons are not as nice as the other ones from Norpro (if you get the real ones). I have had a Norpro set for 10 years and they have a great design, just right edges and good weight. This non-brand I am reviewing here are thinner but they do work. The shape is a bit pointy. Note that the packaging is silly. Each spoon comes bagged separately but the UPC sticker is actually on the back of the spoon. Therefore you have to soak them and scrape and soak and scrape to remove all the gunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for oranges too","review":"Does a great job cutting the juicy sections from grapefruit and also oranges.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Item.","review":"The shoes were sent back because the tongue was not attached to the sides. A feature that keeps dirt from getting in the shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most uncomfortable boot","review":"This is by far the most uncomfortable boot I've ever purchased. it has no arch support and feels like you are standing on a hard piece of concrete with no cushion. After wearing the boots for a month to try and break them in, they broke me in. I haven't worn them for a week and a half and my feet still hurt. I honestly believe they caused me to have plantar fasciitis. I would not recommend them and am strongly considering returning them and taking the 50% hit or whatever they charge for a returned pair of boots that were used for a month. I've got a pair of Dr Marten's on order (with another website due to availability) and have always had great luck with their comfort and durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"My red wings lasted nine months before the soles fell off. I have pieces of shoe all over my truck. I honestly thought I was buying a great product but it was a waste of $250.00. Only a cheap product will offer a 30 day warranty along with the limited 1 year warranty. I truly feel ripped off. The cheap Walmart boots lasted three times longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toe room, zero traction in wet/ oily areas","review":"I purchased these boots because of the oblique toe which provides more room in the toe section of the boot. To me these boots are very comfortable in the toe section but the first day wearing the boots at work, I slipped and fell because these boots have no traction at all in any kind of wet or oily enviroment. The soles have only shallow treads on the bottom that seem to do nothing to provide grip.These boots also seem to be made very wide in the area just below the lacing. I ordered a medium width but there seemed to be a lot of buckling right at the bottom of the laces when walking.Sending these boots back and the search continues for a comfortable boot with plenty of toe room and good grip in oily conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At least two puzzles (128 and 129) have ambiguous solutions, meaning that you waste time trying to find \\"the\\" solution only to discover that there isn't \\"one\\".

Also, the hardest level (4) is easier than it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't the good flavor one","review":"I really like Ritter Sport chocolates. A lot. But this particular flavor, while sounding exotic, is really, well, blah. It's the flavor of the last unwanted chocolate in a Whitmans sampler box, the one that you might find half a chocolate of, cuz' the person who bit it yesterday said \\"Bleh\\" and tossed the other half back in the box. Its just nasty. Go with the White Chocolate Hazelnut or Dark Chocolate Hazelnut instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie","review":"Great for children and adults.

Reading them in such well written prose was like talking at length to an old friend. Few of the 'serious' historical accounts of my hometown convey the feel of St. Augustine as well as this book. Nearly every shopkeeper in St. Augustine describes this as their 'best seller.' I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts of our Oldest City, St Augustine","review":"Published in 1997, this is a great collection of ghost stories of our nation's oldest city. One gets the flavor of this city, the Spanish quarter, the lighthouse, Flagler College, among the unique buildings and places reported to be haunted. Anyone who has ever walked the historic district at night can attest to the strong feeling of history and it certainly can make one wonder if they are really alone. A great little book, and a nice start to the library of anyone who travels... usually regional collections of ghost stories are available in many localities, and they make a unique remembrance of a trip. After reading this, perhaps you will be willing to brave a night in room 3A at the St. Francis Inn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little book about a very special place.","review":"Anyone that has an interest in hauntings and historical places will really enjoy this book! Although I have read all sorts of \\"serious\\" books regarding St. Augustine nothing reflects the local flavor as well as this book. St. Augustine is a wonderful resource of people, places, and things to do. The book does a great job of emphasizing this point. Take a litte time to read this special book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I bought the book hoping for some actual solid stories to help me with my research.

Van Gelder surveys the ways food appears in classical Arabic literature, including pre-Islamic poetry, the Qur'an, Islamic poetry and tales, the Thousand and One Nights, and popular genres such as the adab anthologies and satires. To show how food both forms and reveals aspects of Arab culture, he considers ban-quets and the prestige of prodigal hospitality; abstinence and piety versus satiety and sin; smorgasbords and rich literary diction; and food and parody. Focusing more on dishes than ingredients, the author is concerned with how food is depicted, as well as how literary texts are shaped by the theme of food. His command of the sources is magisterial, and he has a gift for unexpected conjunctions and deft phrasing that illuminate both literature and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice visor clip","review":"This visor clip was the perfect size for it's intended usage.

The way that Ibuka uesd to motivated his people with his brave new idea resulted the invention of Walkman, CD player, and tritron, and they bravely moved into the American market. However, as Sony became a huge company, it somewhat lost something. thier executives liked money more than to make sony a place for engineers, and because of that, the second half of the book became very very boring, however, it tells you how much internal trobles a company can have after they got big.BUt it's a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A modest Biography of Sony","review":"This is a book that will go down as a greek tragedy. Mr Nathan implies in the introduction that this is a work independent of Sony involvement but the more I read on it seemed that he was protecting the company and information is scarce.

It does not talk about company's structure or the kind of people working in Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into the Corporate Giant Sony!","review":"I found this to be a great read as far as the history of S-O-N-Y Corporation. It takes the reader from the family heritage of a well renowned Sake producer to breaking Japanese tradition and starting an electronics supplier business all the way to the late nineties. The book focuses on the relationships that existed within the high ranks of Sony America and the power related to positions held by Americans. Very interesting look into the Japanese business culture and how they adapted to deal in the U.S. market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, But for total beginners","review":"I was not impressed with this video at all. It lacks instruction, although it features a variety of Swing moves and styles. The instructions are too fast and they're quite hard to follow.

The characters are sixth graders, but the reading level is about third grade or younger.We've read most of the series, and I think my favorite is \\"From Bad to Verse\\". Almost every book in the series shows kids acting irreverantly toward parents/authority and disrespectfully toward one another.Plenty of underpants humor.

They shredded up our drywall, leaving huge, ugly holes, so we had no choice but to continue to hang the shelves to cover up the mess. Thankfully when they are hanging you don't notice, but the quality of the product is awful. The shelves look cheap, and feel cheaper. With decorations on them, it is less noticeable. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the money","review":"These shelves are nice for the money. They are supposed to look like the higher end Pottery Barn shelves but for 1/2 the price. I have them in my finished basement and they look fine there with picture frames on them. My husband says they are easier to put up than the PB ones too. They don't look like they would hold more than light weight items though. Fine for us b/c like I said, we just have picture frames on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shelves","review":"These were really nice shelves and they were a good size. Not too big or small.

First thing I noticed is that they aren't real wood but some sort of faux wood look alike. I could deal with that so I kept going. I got the first large shelf mounted *they do not suck up to the wall well and are a bit wobbly*Then I got to the small and medium shelves I realized that I had an abundance of nails but was short 4 of the large anchor screws that are supposed to be included. So it appears now that, after paying a decent amount of money for an item that was supposed to include everything I am going to have to go to a hardware store and try to find something that will work and spend even more money! I am not impressed with this! I would not recommend this product to anyone! It is not worth the price and extra effort/cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Shelfs","review":"Great concept - impressed with the apparent simplicity. Quality workmanship on the shelves themselves. Only one problem - they do not secure to the wall. After firmly fastening the level-line bracket, the shelf itself does not adequately secure to the bracket, sliding back and forth, and with plenty of give up and down to make anyone think this is a ineffective, temporary and unsatisfactory way of placing a shelf. As long as you do not disturb it in the future, it would probably be okay. But, if wobbly shelves are not your desire, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy","review":"I bought these shelves to put above my baby's changing table for keeping wipes, lotions, etc. If that's what you need, don't buy these! They wobble and are not meant for daily use. They would probably do fine keeping light knick-knacks that were never touched. Also, they are supposed to be put in the wall with several nails that are hammered in at an angle. Very bad idea! When I tried to move the shelf to another room, the nails were very hard to remove and took huge chunks of the wall with them. Overall, I am very disappointed and will be making my own shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"After reading John Copeland's action novel Retribution I feel I must recommend his novel to every American.

The book was full of attitude, anti-gun control rant, and unrelated opinion. I don't think this guy had an editor...if he did, I hope he didn't pay him. This was a disorganized bunch of topics mostly about rebuilding Garands from parts kits? He often references his previous book on the same subject so thankfully I know to avoid it too. There was actually very little technical information, the pictures were dark, and the book didn't even explain how to field strip the M1.

Perfect for the beginner and essential for all sailors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, well-written, and nicely illustrated","review":"John Rousmaniere has created a comprehensive text on the sport of sailing and seamanship which is enjoyable to read and very authoritative. By their nature, sailors have strongly held opinions on most subjects, but virtually every sailor I know of who has read John's book holds it in very high regard. The illustrations are clear and not too busy to get in the way of showing the frequently complicated topics which are inherent in the sport. I also find that Seamanship is not just a repeat of tired old sailing methods of 30 years ago, but rather integrates the classic techniques (storm tactics, navigation) with the modern (Crew Overboard Recovery, modern anchors and electronics).I highly recommend this book, and encourage anyone to buy it if they want to improve their sailing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"This book isnt just eductational but really enjoyable if you like sailing and are interested in learning more about it.

Heat the pan, melt a \\"pat\\" of butter, slice the bagel, put the exposed surfaces of the bagel face down in the pan and set the Bacon Press on top.

It enumerates some of the ways by which the British legal system into the 1920s either excluded or oppressed the poorer clases. Parry dwells at tedious length with the debacle that was debtors' prison, but has no solution but a belief that time will somehow mediate not only the problem of debtors' prison but all other legal inequities.What Parry expressed (repeatedly) could have been thoroughly covered in about 10 pages. Alas, his book was far longer than that.Only Parry's ability to cite from just about any text written after 1789 makes this book tolerable. I admittedly was amused at the succession of characters Parry inserted into his book. Unfortunately, if you are not extremely well-versed in Victorian history and literature, you'll miss much: Parry draws on the very obscure as often as he does on the famous. For me it was a hoot only because Victorian history is my field.The Kindle download is free; don't waste your money purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute!","review":"this little book has great ideas for spicing up mealtime for preschoolers and up. i'm buying a few as gifts for other moms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huttersfield Does It Again","review":"This is the second Hymns record by the Huttersfield Choir in my collection.

Its easy to get into tight spaces and will work in a pinch for a framing nailer, especially when you need a compressor on top of some staging or on the top of a roof.This year it was getting a little tired and would not reach shut off pressure so I had to rebuild it which was a pleasent surprise. A new non-lube piston and valve assembly was about $20 and only took a few minutes to replace. It was and easy job with no special tools required. Its back running like new again.

This is light duty compressor that will take care of something like putting trim around a door frame. It is not an all day compressor because even attatching a tool will make this compressor start to cycle (ony 1 gallon means you lose a lot of air quickly.) If you have a lot of work to do that requires a compressor, stick to larger one. However I have had no problems with it so far and it gets small jobs done. The mini senco is not bad for a side kick and it's very quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need to buy another one","review":"I don't know if it can run a framing nailer, but for finish nailing you can't beat it. It is only slightly louder than a refrigerator and that is great when you are trying to keep nice with the neighbors. I thought it was going to be a joke because it is so small and light, but it is never in the shop when I need it, one carpenter or another has it on a jobsite, they even prefer it over the shop compressor because it is so quiet.

There are many references to bearers of the tradition he has met or whose music he has admired over the years from Ireland, USA and England, such as Josie Mc Dermott, Marcas Ó Murchú, Paddy O'Brien, Kevin Burke,Brendan Mulhaire, Tony Mc Mahon and many more.

It's just another sugared-up pop song desperate to go mainstream. Her voice sounds much like her brother, Aaron- only whinier. She sings surprisingly worse than Britney Spears and it is obvious that she is just as digitally manipulated as the Pop Princess. \\"It's True\\" was better than \\"Like Wow,\\" but if you're trying to find meaning in those songs, you won't find it.

What a missed opportunity!The brunt of the blame, in my opinion, goes to the writer/director, who couldn't decide if he was writing/directing a drama, a comedy, a dramady or a gay Thelma and Louise. So what we get is disjointed film filled with a hodge-podge of stale ideas, actors who seem lost most of the time (Arquette, a fine gay indie actor, is totally wasted in this film!) and badly contructed scenes that never manage to be sad or funny or anything at all, for that matter.Sad, sad, sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying high, but reaching poor","review":"I purchased \\"The Trip\\" based on a trailer on another TLS release.

In addition it tries to be sad at times, madly comic at times, and light-heartedly humorous at times, achieving nothing but a weird unevenness. The only theme that could remotely be considered unifying is the ridiculously simplistic portrayal of nearly every (...), fire-breathing, hate mongers. Come on, surely we can do better then that!

Body, yeah pretty good.Some nice footage in the film from seventies rallies. Some funny lines too, nothing side splitting though.The end is kind of good though, not least because the actors take off those bad wigs but also because there's the first genuine display of synergy between these two blokes.The film is corny and the actors are not convincing lovers, until the end.

It had dialogue that didn't make you wince, actors who could actually act (and very well at that), and direction that almost bordered on professional. Most importantly though, the film was actually romantic in it's own sort of way. However, this isn't a romantic comedy; rather, it's a travelogue of sorts concerning two young men and how the politics of the early 70's through mid 80's affected their relationship. It has plenty of serious moments along with a surprising amount of humorous moments, and it's the uneven balance of these two that is really the only flaw in the film (well, that and a rushed ending).

The fact that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" became the 'mainstream' gay film upsets me. I did not like those characters and I did not like the way gay men were depicted. The characters in \\"The Trip\\" felt more authentic and more realistic. You could tell they were in head-over-heels in love with each other and although they were flawed and the results were tragic, you saw and witnessed their love.

It is not a movie I would readily recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative Drivel","review":"Like others below, I got this movie based on the many positive reviews. It wasn't even CLOSE to good, and it left me feeling ashamed for gay cinema that something like this garners high praise. Then again, if your only experience of gay culture is \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\\" maybe this is your cup of tea. The movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, and end up a jumble of so many other films and themes that just don't connect (and what a ripoff of Greg Araki's work...not to mention the glaringly obvious yet meaningless Thelma and Louise nods). Character motivation doesn't make any sense; there are obviously scenes left out; and most of the writing is merely two characters discussing what has happened in their lives (far be it from the moviemaker to actually SHOW us some of these pivotal and probably far more interesting scenes). All in all, a dismal disappointment.

This is love you can touch, feel and hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie touched my heart","review":"Being a straight woman with gay friends, I know that falling in love is the same in any relationship. This movie touched my heart, it is a romantic first-love story. We all know how that feels. Some say that the ending is a \\"gay cliche\\", but I remember 1984, and how many people were dying of AIDS. Back then we didn't know what we know now. It was understandable why Tommy kissed Alan on the forehead instead of the mouth in a scene in the car in Mexico. That moment brought back memories. This is a romantic and touching love story for gay and straight alike.

It doesn't have skin and the characters won't be going to any \\"white party\\"'s anytime soon but this movie had spirit, heart, values and it was just really heartwarming. I cried at the end.I agree with all the reviews that bring in their own lives. This totally shows how two people who love each other can overcome all obstacles.

There was enough talent in front of the camera to produce a decent film. The two main actors are appealing, and they are backed up by some solid character actors, who seem to be having fun. But the script is just not very good, and the direction could have been better.The central relationship, thanks to the depth invested in it by the two leads, holds the attention, but the script doesn't know what to do with it. Everything seems contrived, and nothing seems real. The supposed climax of the film, the trip itself, is aimless and doesn't give any emotional payoff.A missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad","review":"I don't want to give the impression that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't. I do, however, want to say that I do not think that it is deserving of all the praise it has recieved. The character development was rather poor, and the plot was threadbare, but it did provide some enjoyment. It was light, and full of laughter, and obviously did not take itself too serriously. I would recomend renting or watching this movie on pay-per-view before purchasing it. The major complaint I have with this movie is that it did not build the relationshi between the characters, and it is impossible to understand some of the actions done by the characters without some type of development. I think there was potential there, but not a lot of follow through. More like a last minute effort at throwing things together. All in all I think it's not a horrible movie, but it isn't worth having in a collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits Right Home","review":"The story had the development of two peoples lives who were from two different worlds(or so it appeared) who found love when they least expected it. It was really great as it demonstrated the growth and development of a relationship and all the benefits that can be derived.It was mixed with disapponintment and deceit that rocks the whole world right now. It also shows how two men really in love will go a very far way to accomodate each other for the cause of a sustainable relationship.Never really liked how the end went as it is my belief that the stereo typing of a gay man dying with AIDS is too cliche. We hardly have happy endings!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Love Story.","review":"The relationship that develops between Tommy and Alan is magical. From their turbulent first \\"date\\" at Alan's apartment to the end of the road trip; their love survives through richer and poorer, sickness and health. Each contributes in his own way, despite the interference of jealousy, to ensure the happiness of the other. I especially liked the dance on the car hood in the desert of Mexico! An excellent movie that is not about sex but is about the deep and lasting love one human being can share with another. I would recommend to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but refreshing and poignant","review":"This one is worth watching for the fact that this isn't another glossy soft core gay porn movie. the director and screenweriter actually took time to develop the protaganist as fully developed human beings complete with personality flaws and political ideologies. I would have given the picture a higher rating but it does a huge flaw in it. The flaw being that there is a superflous character played by Alexis Arquette which borders on tasteless stereotypical parody and worst of all the character is pointless and doesn't move the story forward.Otherwise the two leads give charming performances and the film has a lot of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trip","review":"I'm a big fan of gay love stories, but this one, although it starts off with great promise, is the victim of a low budget. The acting is pretty good--Larry Sullivan is particularly good. The movie is far too short to emcompass the scope of what the film sets out to accomplish, which is an epic of gay life and the way two men see themselves through the turbulent early 70's till the mid-80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not overdone!","review":"This script was great the actors good looking.This story really is a great film that every gay man should have or at least watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in this film which felt forced and artificial. The leads are great and fun, and the story isn't too bad, but the execution of the movie made me feel like I was watching a gay \\"That 70's Show.\\" I wasn't sure whether to laugh or not. The last third of the movie becomes a scorching \\"Thelma and Louise\\" road trip which doesn't feel authentic either. I'm all for artistic license, but the whole thing wasn't very believable and not that interesting, either. Okay overall, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"the trip","review":"for me the story was a little too flip and choppy. I think I would have rented it instead.

You will fall in love with the two main characters. I wish the budget had been bigger,it surly deserved to be told without restraint. Perhaps someday it will be re-done with a bigger budget. I love the way they did the time period transitions from the 1960's to the 1980's. The big bonus was that all the great music was original. It's 0400 A.M. and I've just finished watching it.

And the nitpicking about wigs and whatnot. Some of the negative comments I've seen are more about egotripping than they are about the film's basic energy. I would even go to say that if you don't like this film, there might be something wrong with you. The Trip is like a shot in the arm. Hats off to Miles Swain for his first production. The interaction between the actors is excellent, especially the main characters Alan and Tommy. Actors Sirena Irwin and Jill St. John are excellent. I've seen this film 10 times and 3 times with running commentary. I'm no film piker. I like Speilberg, Fellini, Soderbergh, Forman, Schlesinger and many other directors. A film doesn't have to be great to be enormously entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie about true love","review":"I have to write a review for this movie because my best friend is gay and had a hard time.

Our 25+ year old scoops are still bright and shiny-- and solid stainless steel, very heavy. Also, there is no name inscribed in the actual scoops. The newer \\"real\\" scoops used today have a serrated edge. But the operation of the scoop can't be beat-it is the best designed scoop there is. But this resale item is merely a cheaper version of the real thing (which currently costs over $25 from the only approved smallwares supplier BR has and can only sell to BR stores!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst scooper I've ever used","review":"After reading several great reviews, I thought this would be the perfect replacement for a lost (cheaper) ice cream scooper. Unfortunately, I found it sorely lacking in several areas. First, the scoop head itsself is rather thin. Thus, it turns cold immediately and the ice cream sticks to it - even after rinsing in hot water. Second, the shape of the head is a half-sphere, which doesn't form balls as well as the more saddle-shaped heads. Third, the push-out lever is a pain to use and clean - with better-shaped heads, getting the ball out is not an issue - with this one, it often doesn't work and gets gunked up pretty quickly. Finally, as another review pointed out the finish looks awful after one wash in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to clean","review":"I thought it was stainless steel and after a trip through the dishwasher it looks just awful....like splotchy discolored zinc. I hope it's safe to be in contact with food but it looks very unappealing. Also, you must have VERY STRONG FINGERS to remove and then reinstall the push-button spring in order to clean it properly. It's a good design idea but needs to be better made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dishwasher safe","review":"I am not positive but I thought this was dishwasher safe.

It leaves you feeling energetic and invigorated. Kristin McGee hosts 3 other MTV fitness series videos including MTV Yoga, MTV Pilates, and MTV Pilates Mix. I highly recommend all of these videos, they provide an intense workout while still offering variations for different levels of expertise.I will warn you though that Power Yoga is difficult and challenging. It moves at a rapid pace, especially through the beginning Sun Salutations. You must have a working knowledge of Yoga poses before attempting this video otherwise you will get extremely frustrated with the instruction. I would recommend doing MTV Yoga first where Kristin provides much more instruction and a slower pace. Or, watch the video through a couple times before even attempting to do it.Overall, it is one of my favorite Yoga videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic workout","review":"Challenging, it actually provides me with great back relief.

The warm up is not even a warm-up, the music doesn't make sense with the flow of the movements and there is very little instruction.

I do Bryan Kest's original series & Baron Baptiste's original series (from the '90s) often and enjoy the challenges they present. This was a waste of time, and it screwed up my lower back to boot.

However most routines were repeated so after a couple of times I could get the swing of things and expect to be able to really excel when I go back again.

The code didn't always work, the samples don't work, constant errors that it can't find the database. When in doubt of the code I entered I would copy the authors code and still it wouldn't work. It felt like there were a couple steps missing here and there. This is very frustrating to me. Also, the example code should work when loaded from the disc, when it doesn't it's more frustrating. The SQL section is ok, again seems a bit vague to me. I have since moved onto Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Step by Step by Michael Halvorson and am having no trouble at all, not feeling lost anymore.

Unfortunately the chinese who put these together didn't seal the inside with epoxy so it's just a wash on them all. We made it work as long as we could and finally threw them away when the tines started to come out of the handle and fall in our batters. :( I might actually buy a new set and take it apart and seal it with epoxy myself.

I brought this set July 2011 and used it at least once a month. I always washed it after using it and drying it before putting it away. After the first few months, I noticed that when I use it, water would drip out of the handle- I thought it didn't dry \\"enough\\". In the past 6 months, the water is now brown colored but I didn't really notice or thought about it, I had to wrap a tissue by the handle so the water doesn't get into the food. Just yesterday the handle came off and I saw that it was rusted all inside the handle. There was no sign of rusting outside of the handle. I always thought Norpro was a great brand, since my brother in law has the same set.Good whisk, but disappointing because the handle rusted inside and fell off."},{"rating":"2","title":"whisk set","review":"the norpro 3 piece stainless steel balloon whisk set is a great buy. i like the handles for ease of handling the whisk. they wash nicely as well as dry with no rust. the product whisks well in a short amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small","review":"When I opened the package I laughed my head off.

Rather inconvenient but worse - disappointed in the product manufacture or quality control. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like these","review":"Whisks are something I have a lot of since I use them all the time. These are my least favorite and I almost never use them. The handle is too fat for my liking. This is likely a personal thing as I have really small hands and the thickness of the handle might not bother someone with a regular size hand but for the other women out there with petit hands - I don't think you'll like these very much. They are just not comfortable to hold. The whisk itself is also very stiff - there is virtually no give in there. Using one of these whisks is no different from using a fork and I would probably choose a fork over one of these whisks since I would at least be able to get a good, quick motion going with a fork. Meh.....

What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful -- sharp edges!","review":"These whisks are very nice, actually, and they feel good. They are not flimsy or anything, but I can't give them more than two stars because I actually cut myself with the medium sized one. The metal that is close to the ballooning wires is very sharp and it nicked my thumb when I pulled it out of the package. I imagine that most of them are not like that, due to the other reviews, but I am sad that I'll have to throw that one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whisks Filled with Sand","review":"When I purchased this item I read the reviews first and the positive outweighed the negative. But my experience falls on the negative side. When I used the biggest whisk the first time the end cap fell off and SAND fell into my food. That's right, the handles are filled with sand to give them weight. I emptied the sand and put the cap back on. Then I threw it in the dishwasher and when I pulled it out the whisk head came off and was instantly rusted. I have since thrown these items out. Don't buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent whisks!","review":"These are great! Sleek looking but very sturdy. The seal where the wires attach to the handles are very tight, so you don't have to worry about dumping the water out or anything falling apart. The different sizes allow me to perform a wide variety of tasks in the kitchen. These whisks are not flimsy and the handles and wires will not bend even if you're dealing with thick materials in your mixing bowls. Super easy to clean (everything just rinses off with hot water!) PLUS they are dishwasher safe, for those extra difficult jobs. GREAT purchase, WELL worth the price, I am extremely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent whisks","review":"This set is an excellent value. I have had them for a few months now with extensive use. They clean easily in the sink or the dishwasher. There is not a trace of rust on the stainless steel. The handles are big enough to grip easily, and though they are hollow they have never had any water in them. They are whisks, and they do their job well.The smallest of these whisks has a handle that is approximately 3\\" long, with the wire part being about 3-1/2\\". While I find the handle just fine for the small jobs that I use this whisk for, it may be difficult for some hands to hold on to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Set","review":"For the price, this is a great set of three. I like how they feel in my hand. They seem to be the right size around to give my hand something to grip onto and yet they are not too fat that my hand gets sore holding/using these for any length of time. These are as easy to clean as any other whisk. They have held up well to my use and to being in a drawer and dropped countless times.Well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to be useful","review":"I suppose the smallest one could be given to a child.Even the largest of the three is small with too few wires to effectively whip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and inexpensive","review":"This is a great set for a great price.

When I went to push it in, I noticed that I couldn't, because it was blocked by something. I pulled it out to look inside, and much to my dismay, SAND started pouring out of it onto my counter-top! Apparently they fill them with sand for the weight, because they are completely hollow otherwise (I expected thick, heavy duty metal, by the looks of them from the outside).I will try to post a picture of this to the item.Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver","review":"I used to dread making batters until these whisks.

Other than that issue, please know that this canner will last a lifetime. Wanna keep buying canned goods from foreign countries around world, or from canneries where the packing process is \\"questionable?\\" Or do you wanna just go ahead and can your own fresh stuff? To me it is a no-brainer. Don't be scared to use this canner. It looks big and bad, but it runs like a baby if you follow the instructions. Worth the purchase, for sure!

You can decide which is which.First, as a young boy on the verge of becoming a teenager and getting VERY curious about girls, I often watched the Lawrence Welk Show in the 70's just for the many pretty women that were on the program. Needless to say, I had more than one or two male friends the same age, as well as a couple of adults, who thought I had gone over the rainbow. Second, I genuinely liked the music. At least most of it. And one of the highlights was watching, and hearing, Jo Ann pound away on her ragtime piano. Many of her classics are here, but some like 'Humoresque' are mysteriously absent. A personal favorite of mine, 'Maple Leaf Rag' by Joplin, will immediately be familiar with younger folks as a tune featured in the Paul Newman/Robert Shaw film, \\"The Sting\\".

I have read that Seth MacFarlane doesn't believe that 16:9 is needed for his or any other show, but come on. At least make an attempt to stretch this. I would rather have a slightly, not as impressive picture, than to waste about 5 inches each side of my TV. (I know about the scan option, but it cuts off most of the picture on my television). I think Fox should at least try to explore added a widescreen version of Family Guy DVDs. I get this same thing on XBOX Live and it's just disappointing.

They had a certain 'edge' to them that was refreshing and funny. The show got cancelled and then it came back worse than it was. I think Family Guy has run it's course. Like another reviewer stated, all that's left of the show it seems are a series of pop culture references and bawdy humor that more often than not, isn't funny. There doesn't seem to be much of a story to any of the episodes anymore. It's usually a thin premise to have stupid jokes and offensive physical 'humor.' There are a couple of episodes that are enjoyable in this set, but most are just the same old, tired formula.And I think Matt Groening needs to watch a few because some of the storylines and jokes seem lifted right out of past Simpson's episodes. I enjoy watching reruns of the earliest Family Guy seasons, but the newest ones just do nothing for me. My advice is to check out 'American Dad' where there are actual stories to be had and laughs abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked for me","review":"Used during our family reunion as a PA, and to get the attention of those 3/400 feet away.

This is not true, the Strega of old Italy practiced withcraft (Strega/Stregone= Female witch/Male witch) called Stregheria (Italian Witchcraft), which was being practiced for years, long before Gardener, and the first book on modern day witchcraft was created by Charles Godfrey Leland in the 1800's. Anyways, dont say that until Wicca, there was no previous groups practicing witchcraft, contarary to populaur belief, Gerald Gardener did NOT create Wicca off of old celtic folk tradtions, but actually from Stregheria and Lelands book, he took old family Strega traditions and turned them into his own little religion, (not saying Wicca isnt valid in practice, but its plagarized in belief and tradition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with previous reviewer","review":"too much dross and not enough wisdom -- the first rule of herbal arts is: if one can cure, two can kill.

He has a doctorate in psychology and decades of experience as a priest, vicar of clergy, and seminary rector. What he has given us is a courageous and unblinking analysis of the crises of the American priesthood. The tone is consistently respectful and by no means is this to be understood as an attack on the Church. He never engages in hopelessness and hand-wringing or in bitter critique of the hierarchy. Each presentation of the problems facing the priesthood (the identify confusion, psychological/developmental problems, sexual misconduct) is accompanied by hopeful commentary on how to address these problems. Every priest, every bishop, and every serious Catholic should read this fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Troubling Truth -- A Great Service to the Church","review":"In Changing Face of the Priesthood,Father Cozzens has does the church and thoughful readers an immense service. In many ways he is the spiritually healthy priest he depicts in his book. He is his own man and a man of the church. Sadly, with this warts-and-all assessment, he has kissed good-bye any chance of ecclesiastical advancement. A pity.

The old school was predominently heterosexual, and for the most part, predominently celibate. Today, approximately 40% of Catholic priests are gay and 55% of the seminarians are gay. According to the author, this has created a gay subculture in our seminaries and throughout the Church starting with priests and extending through the bishops' and cardinals' ranks. This is a subculure that is so entrenched that Church higher ups wonder if it can ever be purged from the Catholic Church.

Who in the world would give his life for the soporific slogans we dole out from the pulpit and in our CCD classes?This is a work of sheer denial."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the armchair","review":"The author is clearly a good person: concerned about the decline of the number of priests, charitable with priestly failures, open to the fact that people who disagree with him are not demons.But the Mr. Rogers niceness of the author is exactly the problem. Stuck in a pyschological take on the crisis of the priesthood, he cannot go deeper to the real theological crisis. Just why do you need a priest for Mass? How is a priest's preaching different from a good religious talk by a layman? What about the priest as confessor? What about the obvious fact that the crisis is about a group of American clergy and laity who simply do not believe in what the Catholic Church teaches? And we're far beyond dissent on birth control here.The psychological jargon only masks the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful and Relevant!","review":"This is an absolute must-read for any seminarian, priest or religious - I am not kidding. While the demographic directly addressed is that of the diocesan priest, as a religious I found much of what Cozzens addressed to be very relevant to my personal experience as well. While I certainly do not agree with everything he says, Cozzens does a wonderful job presenting information and applicable examples and statistics to support his findings. His observations are generally dead-on and help to articulate many issues that priests and religious encounter today. His focus on identity and integration throughout the book is well done and lends to his concern for the future generations of priests and their formation in the modern world.A significant book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shooting Straight to the Top","review":"I am delighted to find that Rick Blechta has now succesfully consolidated his own unique writing style with this latest crime thriller.

The usual trio of Jones, Wendell Marshall on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums opens on \\"Little Girl Blue,\\" but then others start to drop-in including Herbie Mann, Donald Byrd, Jerome Richardson, Joe Wilder, Matty Dice and even Eddie Jones doubling up on bass for a few tracks. This is a typical 1950s Savoy blowing seesion, though the fact that it wasn't a one-nighter in the studio shows that a bit more care than usual was taken on these dates.

Not only can you hear the music, but you feel it pulsing through the room, and well... it makes you move. Crank it up and this cd captures that feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with those who say the quality is lacking","review":"I received my bamboo steamer today, and everything the more critical reviews state is true. The pieces do not fit together well, and the bamboo is rather flimsy and rough. Also, my particular set has dark spots all over one of the trays already. I could imagine how bad this would get after using it as a steamer. The only reason I'm not returning this item is because I've decided to use the unspotted tray to store garlic, shallots, and other small onions. Otherwise, this would have been the first item I'd ever had to send back to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I use this product often.

The bamboo steamer allows foods to retain their natural flavors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Used to Shabby Items from China","review":"Warped trays overlap to the point there is not complete coverage on one \\"side\\" (no matter how you position the trays). Any more you just do not see good scores for cheap made items from China. This is no exception. American made craftsmanship died in the early 1980's. We pay the price for corporate greed in more ways than one. Sad, sad, sad . . .I gave it two stars because it is functional, but cheaply made and OVER PRICED. It pains me to think that someone in China got paid a wooden token to make this. It should have cost mo more than $9.99 tops! I buy American made when I can, but some items just are not made in America. This is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product but directions needed","review":"real nice product, works great but only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it should include basic instructions and some recipes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bamboo Steamer","review":"It works very well, BUT...

My husband loves the steamed food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic bamboo steamer","review":"It looks fine and it does well, stacks nicely - a good product for the price. No problems at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"L-O-V-E it!","review":"I haven't stopped using this product since it showed up at my door. In looking for a way to cook delicious food without turning my oven on during the hotter months, I turned to the steamer. It is incredibly simple and easy to use. I can cook all my courses in this vessel while only turning on one burner in my house. Fish, vegetables, and any kind of dumpling you can imagine fit easily within the layers. I use parchment paper when cooking things that I imagine would stick and that has made clean up a breeze. The only concern I had was storage as I have limited space in my cupboards, but I have found that separating the pieces have made it that much more storage friendly. So far it seems to be durable after fairly heavy use. A quality product that no kitchen should be without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is a bit lacking...","review":"I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the quality of this steamer. For example, the walls (which are made of thin layers of bamboo bonded together) are a bit rough and unevenly bonded, and fastened into their circular shape with copper wire. Thin strips of bamboo are interwoven to form the base of each of the steamer sections. Today, I bought a Typhoon brand one (8\\" diameter), which, by contrast, is really nicely made of all natural materials, has a base made of thicker pieces of bamboo rather than thin strips, and cost less. Of course, the Norpro one will do the job and if you need a larger steamer, it should work just fine--I am just overall happier with the Typhoon product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality, diameter is 25 cm (9.8 in) not 26.5 cm (10.5 in) ...","review":"I bought this because the review was good, and it's the only one I found with the right diameter for my cooker. I need a 26.5 cm/10.5 in steamer to fit my cooker. But I was really disappointed after receiving it. The size is not as described on the website. The diameter is 25cm not 26.5 cm. The quality is poor and I don't think it can last long. The 3-piece set doesn't stack well and steam/heat will leak while cooking. So, overall, it's not a steamer with good quality and the size doesn't fit the description. I rarely return things I order online, but I have to return this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This \\"Fire\\" is cool!","review":"It would be all too easy to dismiss this Boston-based quintet as a \\"derivative\\" offshoot of the Rolling Stones (circa the \\"Let it Bleed\\" era) or as a kind of rootsy Television clone. Lead singer David Wildman does a great imitation of Mick Jagger on some songs and Tom Verlaine on others. (Toss in a bit of Bob Dylan to boot.) But these guys aren't merely clones. \\"Fire\\" has something to say and it says it in a style that borrows from the greats (Don't all bands do that?) and rearranges those elements in a way that is truly different.If you're a fan of what Gram Parsons called \\"Cosmic American Music\\" with a sharp edge (and an occasionally literary reference added to the mix to show your friends you didn't sleep through your college classes) you owe it to your ears - and your head - to buy this disc.And speaking as a Connecticut Yankee, if you're from New England you're letting your people down if you don't act now!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"My friend Molly borowed this book as soon as it arrived and called later blaming me for her night-spent-reading.

I had also brought home from the library a second book by Owens, The Schooling of Claybird Catts. I started reading it and quickly lost interest because it goes over the same ground as My Brother Michael, but from a different point of view. Then I noticed that there's a third book, Myra Simms, which again is another point of view of the same story. That's a bit much of the Catts family. I'd like to read something fresh from this author. I see she has another book, American Ghost. I'll give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read!","review":"Janis Owens has crafted a moving tale of sibling rivalry, love, guilt and forgiveness set in the rural south. Raised in the rural south myself, I found the sense of place Janis Owens has achieved familiar and true. The character, Myra Sims, with her unique combination of strength and vulnerability was especially intriguing. If you enjoy Southern Fiction or character driven novels, I highly reccomend that you read this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You've Lost Your Belief in True Love","review":"If you've lost your belief in true love this book is for you. No matter how cynical you are you will fall in love with My Brother Michael. What a beautifully written, sad, funny, romantic book. These are people you can care about. Age-old themes: money, poverty, incest, sibling rivalry, a brother's mistake, a son's fury, a mother's love. You've known these people before, just not the inside story of what has really gone on in their lives. Brilliantly written. Boldly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you buy !","review":"I've been a PSB fan for all my life, but this time I was very disappointed.

As one of the few straight men to rave about the PSB, I felt extremely disappointed in the material as well as the clipped audio in many songs.

Prepare to put it on a drift off ...zzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Weak","review":"I love the Pet Shop Boys...I mean how could you not. Release, PSB eighth full length studio album, is disappointing and weak. Instead of making trends, they are following them. Instead of their brand of tongue-in-cheek pop/dance music they lean more toward glam rock. Most of it is boring and outdated. PSB have been slipping on quality releases since the half baked NIGHTLIFE release. But unlike that release, there isn't any songs on here that are worth walking across a street for. US edition features a bonus disc of remixes and b-sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Release Me!","review":"Pet Shop Boys used to burn up the dance floors of every club I worked in and frequented during the 80's and early 90's. And what fantastic re-mixes were spun off from their work.When you first hear HOME AND DRY you think you are in for an enlightened new groove that will carry you away like before. Sadly,they never get off the ground and the tracks get more clouded and more mushy as we listen. Sorry folks, but after the anthem \\"GO WEST\\" the Pet Shop Boys got lost.Clever packaging is not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst PSB Album","review":"Before \\"Release\\", there had been no PSB album that I didn't like. I'm not sure what the boys were trying to do here, but it fails on all levels. There is not one song on here that screams \\"stand-out\\". In fact, \\"Alternative\\" (their collection of B-Sides) is much more listenable than anything on \\"Release\\". The only song I do like on the album is \\"You Choose\\". After the great 1999 release, \\"Nightlife\\", and I can't believe the boys went in this direction. I understand they needed to experiment with less production and more guitars (with Johnny Marr), but the song writing is not on par with their past efforts either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Being a Pet Shop Boys fan, I have to say that I did not like the way of his last work 'Release'.

Just sit back and listen\\"Great lyrics, Great melodies. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!","review":"Having been a PSB fan since the mid-eighties, I was terribly disappointed with this. I waited with anxiety at the door of my favorite store for this. I bought the 2-cd special edition and there are only 2 good songs on both disks combined \\"Home & Dry\\" and \\"Sexy Northerner\\". They stared going down hill on their last effort \\"Nightlife\\" with badly written cliche tunes about closeted homosexuality. That album started off fantastic and ended horribly, while this continues the horrible pattern. It is great Neil & Chris are exploring their many talents with softer acoustic music, but the lyrics are juvenile at best. They were on a great roll with Behavior, Very, Bilingual and stopped short there. I do look forward to their second greatest hits collection to hit later this year. Maybe the singles from this album will sound better mixed amongst classic treasures from Very, Bilingual and Nightlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home and Dry!","review":"I love the Pet Shop Boys. They're sassy and provide an eclectic sound to today's music that seems long forgotten. I love Home and Dry, Birthday Boy, and other songs on this compact disc. I found this of all places in the Pathmark bargain bin of music. It doesn't belong there. The music today can't compare to what we experienced in the 1980s with groups like the Pet Shop Boys and the British invasion. Still, I'm glad they're making even now. When I hear Home and Dry, I keep thinking of the families and friends of the Pan Am 103 flight who was expected to pick them up at JFK airport. Even after all these years, that day is quite haunting because it was so preventable. I'm glad that the Pet Shop Boys are still around making music for us who grew up in the 1980s with MTV bursting on the stage changing television forever. Now MTV is nothing more than the reality based channel. Music is not shown on it if ever. The Pet Shop Boys are still around making music and that's fine with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubba Raw but still a ways from well done!","review":"If you're a Bubba fan as I am you have to like this DVD. Yet in the back of your mind you have to weigh 18 bills is a little high for a DVD with a limited running time, in fact it's not mentioned on the disc or case. For me the highlight was Spice Boy's intros & commentary during the bits, radio gold as they say. They even managed to shoehorn Ned in the bonus material. Hot Babes, shocking content, wild situations, in fact all the stuff we love about the show but no better in my opinion then the first DVD. In fact a roundtable intro or look back retro communtary by the whole BRN crew on each bit would have added the minutes & boosted the product to where it needed to be. A BRN Poster inside the case I would have loved to see as well.

I bought this in my size, according to the size chart. It was a tad too small (meaning my breasts semi came out the top, but not by much). I wear a 34H, so I have a regular size band, but a large cup. This bra gives zero support! Nothing. Nada. I may as well just wear a tank top to bed instead, and save the money.Back to the drawing board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small.","review":"This bra is very small. I wear a small size, and got this in a medium. Even a medium size was a bit too tight and uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!","review":"I bought this bra relying on the good reputation of Medela and was very disappointed. It is uncomfortable, unadjustable, and the shoulder straps ride up very high, making your already limited choice of outfits even more so. As the model in the picture isn't wearing any breast pads, you can't see how this bra does an extremely poor job at concealing them from the public. I also found that, because it must go on over your head, it was difficult putting it on. I am a 36B and the large was uncomfortably tight. It's like a complicated sports bra, without the support. It was even more difficult to refasten the hooks. Don't waste your money! Go to ... and order a catalog, they have a huge selection. I recommend the \\"sleep-bra\\" with crossover design for it's easy access design, comfort, and light but perfect support!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Support, Maximum Comfort","review":"Though I really liked Bravado! bras for my nursing my first baby, I decided to try these with my second. The fabric is very soft, stretchy and comfortable and washes well. The packaging for this one says you can put it in the dryer and so far (4 months) it's faired well. It's great for sleeping in during the early weeks when you really need something to hold yourself and the breastpads in. But if you're over a B or C cup, it's probably not your best choice for daywear except around the house. Try Medelas other bras for that. If your at the top end of the range for your size, go ahead and get the next size up as they do run a little small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great bra for the price","review":"This bra was just perfect for right after delivery, but a few days later when my milk came in, this bra offered zero in terms of support.

Very disappointed in these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is all wrong!","review":"I ordered the size that not only covered my present cup size (at nine months along), but also showed to be big enough for when I am nursing. This was NOT an accurate description of cup size. I read reviews where women stated that the size wasn't accurate, but assumed that since I was ordering a Large- which covered up to a DD, and I am presently a C, it wouldn't be a problem. This bra JUST fits (albeit a little snugly) right now. It definitely won't work when I am nursing.Trying to return it without paying shipping wouldn't work- incorrect size makes it sounds like I made a mistake in ordering, and I was going to have to pay the shipping. I decided to purchase other nursing bras AFTER trying them on first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the well endowed","review":"There is nothing wrong with the bra per say, but it isn't a good choice for the well-endowed. It is over all too thin and weak to even sleep in."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support... No space in between!","review":"As a 34D pre-pregnancy and a 34DD post-pregnancy... This bra offers no support. In addition to offering no support, it doesn't make your chest look attractive. It gives you a droopy, extraordinarily large, one-hump appearance. If that weren't bad enough, this one-hump image comes with a price. Your boobs are unable to breathe because they're being squished together by this terrible bra. For me, this made me uncomfortably itchy. I had an odor I'd never had before after wearing this bra for less than an hour. I hate it and will never wear it again. It should be burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for sleeping in","review":"I am a 34DD size and find this has minimal support because of the thin material. That said, I love to sleep in it.

But it was perfect while it lasted...and great for sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough support","review":"This is a very soft bra, but at 38E once my milk came in, it wasn't enough support at the band.

The company was helpful when I called with a problem. The only complaint I have is that the straps are close to your neck, so the straps show if your neckline's not fairly close to your neck. Because it changes size with you, it's a good one for the hospital, although you might consider a nighttime bra for that in case you feel especially tender, as this can exert a little more pressure than is comfortable (until your body gets used to breastfeeding-a few weeks maybe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"medela nursing bra","review":"This bra runs very small and is not manufactured in larger sizes.

The snaps are not one-hand accessible at all and when you're learning how to nurse, it's too complicated to try and stay covered and snap them back up with two hands. And the pieces underneath the top panel make your whole bust area look an unnatural shape. It's weird. There isn't any support at all, so for non-supportive nursing bras, I prefer the ones without any snaps that you just pull open from the middle. They don't have any support either, but at least you don't look like you're all lumpy up front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy One Size Larger","review":"I purchased a black one in a size small from Amazon and a white one in a medium from my lactation consultant (because I had a coupon and medium was the smallest size they had). I usually wear a size 32A and I would have to say that the medium is definitely the most comfortable, so when you order it's best to go up a size from what is on the sizing chart. Its funny, because that's what my lactation consultant recommended as well.The bra is very supportive and looks attractive even when I wear it under clothes that reveal it a little bit, like v-necks or tanktops. I would recommend air-drying though because little lint balls get stuck on it after drying in the dryer.You do need two hands to snap it back together, but I have sometimes been able to do it with one hand when i'm groggy. It's great though to be able to just snap it off when you're breastfeeding, especially in the middle of the night or when you are lying down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is totally off!","review":"I am a 38B and according to the size chart I should be a Large.

Most importantly, it is hard to close the snaps back into place with one hand after nursing ...you definitely want to be able to do that if you're still holding the baby. Then, instead of two separate cups this bra only has one front panel, so that if you unhook just one side, the other breast is semi-exposed as well. If you're anything above a B-Cup, this bra does not give you a whole lot of support. It is comfortable enough, but shrinks in the wash and is then difficult to put on, since you have to pull if over the head.It would help if Medela Bras didn't come in sealed boxes and you could see it and try it on before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the first weeks after delivery!","review":"I have been using the bra for a week now, and it is very comfortable. I really like the way the front of it comes down for feedings. I have been able to open it with one hand but it is harder to close with one hand.I would not recommend this product if you are hoping to have enough support for normal daily wear. It has been great for the beginning weeks at home with the baby. I bought three!!I have washed it twice and it is still in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order a size larger!","review":"Very comfortable, nice stretchy & high quality fabric. However -- be sure to order a size larger (!), even if you follow the sizing chart. I fell between small/medium, ordered a medium, and way too small.

Comfortable to sleep in and enough support for daily wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for big breast","review":"First of all, the size chart doesn't represent correct fitting. According to this chart I needed size L, but it was way too small, so I had to get size XL.This bra looked like a great bra, but after wearing it for a few days I realized that it actually doesn't support my breast and my back was hearting a lot because of that. It's very thin too, so I cannot imagine wearing it outside the house.Even though the material feels soft and nice, it's so difficult to put on (if you have nails it's even harder!).I don't recommend this bra for women with big breast, and I think it way overpriced too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size and...stains?","review":"I followed all the websites advice on this and bought the size I was during pregnancy a 36D/Large.

It's been 6 months and despite everyone saying my boobs would shrink back into oblivion after my milk settled I'm still huge. Needless to say this bra is WAY too small now. Still I had many issues with it from the beginning. For one it is a raging pain to get on. A lot of twisting and pulling. I would definitely prefer a bra with hooks. The biggest thing was one night I leaked all over this beast. I washed it immediately but the milk stained the bra. Something like a grease stain . I have no idea why but there it is.

I can not support his album for the simple fact he beat up Karrine and abandon his son Naiim! Yeah, I used to listen to his music until I read Karrine's book and if you look at the last picture where she and her son took together you can tell that damn fool had beat her ass!!!! I was in a domestic dispute before, but damn! I can't support this man, if someone is going to hit and nobody didn't hit his moms ( Rip Mrs. Wilson). So why rate his music when he did all of this and don't take care of himself? The reason I said it because this fool thought about a luscious lifestyle instead of his health. Kool have seizures folks! Instead of all that money he was spending he shoulda took care of himself a little better, instead of Karrine!

Shipped quickly, installation was easy, fit was great, and it matched the stock light perfectly.The only issue I had was that the bulb assembly snapped into the housing rather loosely to the point that I was concerned that the bulb may eventually come unlocked and fall out if I hit any rough bumps. I took a little liquid silicone and ran a bead across the lock to sort of glue it in place, and all is well.Overall, well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugrats all-grown up","review":"I am a big fan of the Rugrats and when they came out with them grown up I couldn't wait.

It's truly unfortunate that Cherubini has not achieved the same fame and respect as his fellow composer to the north. There simply are not enough recordings of this great composer as this recording truly shows the genius and quality of his music. The structure, scoring, inventiveness and inspiration of this symphony rivals anything that Beethoven ever wrote. Instead of making another recording of Beethoven's 9th, record companies should seriously consider looking towards Southern Europe for some truly great symphonic music. Northern-European based symphonies and record companies as well as Amercian symphonic societies need to realize that Italian composers did more that just write opera in the 19th century!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disintegrated","review":"I bought this for my Mom for xmas last year and within days of using it it began to lose pages. the entire english section of the book is now a collection of loose pages which makes it very hard to use and keep track of.

I tried mounting it on the shady side of a cedar fence board but the sun hitting the board from the back raised the temp over 10 degrees. At night, it works fine. I use the probe for the hot tub but it is consistantly 5 degrees to high (when compared to an NIST calibrated thermometer, and the built in hot tub sensor). Swaped out all three units and got the same result. As far as the signal transmission part is concerned, the only way to get near the 100' claim is to have them in line-of-sight (NO obstructions), otherwise don't expect more than about 20/25 feet.

Some of my most cherished memories as a child are brought back listening to the Noel CD. It's too bad the other Christmas albums have not yet been remade. Songs like Christmas Island and the Little Drummer Boy. Those are classics, but this album is excellent on it's own merit.

The bonus disc is definitely great,love the trance version 2 for \\"Home and dry\\".The singles for \\"Home and dry\\" part 1/2 and the DVD single release is also amazing. I had to order the DVD single through amazon UK though. I think it's a great idea for the company to release all their singles on DVD format from now on. It would be also helpful and profitable fo them to market it North America for all fans.I'm hoping I can buy some of their merchandise DVDs/CD singles/Release materials from their upcoming concert in Toronto on May 26,2002 at Massey Hall.I can't wait for their next single release from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued brilliance","review":"Pet Shop Boys continue their brilliant opus of material with this excellent CD + bonus. The use of guitar and drums only add to the already stellar synths. Having Johnny Marr on the guitar makes for a completely gratifying experience.

Release is unlike any album the Pet Shop Boys has ever done and do not do it well. I thought the Pet Shop Boys was one group who can never let me down was I wrong. I listened to it several times giving it the benefit of the doubt and couldnt go through the pain any longer. I can honestly say I did not like one song on this CD. I was forced to give the CD 1 star because I couldnt pick no stars. I would like to release this CD. Such a talented group gone to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy","review":"\\"Home and Dry,\\" \\"The Samurai In Autumn,\\" and \\"Here\\" are immediate grabbers. Everything else requires a bit of patience, but it's very much worth it. \\"I Get Along\\" is the track a lot of people are saying sounds like Oasis. Only very slightly, I say. Anyway, it's better than anything Oasis have managed to come up with in years. \\"The Night I Fell In Love\\" is a sly, but sweet poke at Eminem. A song titled \\"E-mail\\" might come off as trite and predictable in somebody elses hands, but not so with PSB...There are some lesser moments on the bonus disc (\\"Nightlife\\" \\"Break 4 Love\\"), but the ambient mix of \\"Home and Dry\\" is stunning, as is the alternate version of \\"Closer To Heaven.\\"All in all, another terrific outing from one of the best songwriting duos since Lennon and McCartney."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So CDs","review":"I wish I could hear what it is on this album that makes so many other people flip for it. I think it's mostly dated and boring. You'd never know it was recorded this century. There are 3 good, hummable songs. Thank goodness for the bonus CD, which offers a few more good tracks and makes the package worth the money. Love the Johnny Marr guitar, but where's the pulse and energy? The often lovely lyrics and beautiful sentiments aren't enough; they're robbed of their power by unmelodic, dreary music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but not bad","review":"I guess it is expecting too much to get yet another album of classic upbeat dance music. The fact that the Boys want to take time out and get a little mellow should not be held against them. I just wish they had not shoved every downbeat track they had on here. After a while it gets hard to tell which song is which, a problem I have never had with other PSB albums. \\"Home and Dry\\" is great, but like others I found myself liking the material on the bonus CD much more.But, when all is said and done, I think that this one willgrow on me over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt and entertaining","review":"This book was engaging from beginning to end. The story line of this historical family drama wasn't what I completely expected based on what I had read before I ordered it, but I wasn't disappointed at all.

This helped me connect with each of them and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Would love to read another novel by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, Entertaining and Stimulating Read","review":"When I picked up this book I was hooked from the first page. Ms. Lustbader's style of writing transported me onto the page and into the heart and soul of every character. I was enthralled, in love and enticed by certain characters, and loathed others - which of course, for me, allows me to travel into another world. The author also very coyly and inteligently inserts strategically placed \\"life lessons\\" which serve to kindle enlightening and entertainingly inspirational motivation. Mysterious, inspiring, flowing, entertaining and definitely a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I could not put this book down. Literally. I became so immersed in the lives of all of the characters and plot lines, that I found myself walking down the street feeling that I might run into some of them!

A MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the mark","review":"While I applaud Ms. Lustbader's attempts on her first novel, I have to admit that the story was completely flat. Although filled with several well-thought-out characters, not one of them was lovable in any way, leaving the reader with no one to sympathise with. An arrogant social climber, an overbearing mother, a wimpy son with no mind of his own, a broken woman, a cold father, a guilt-tripping abandoned sister... I would think that at least one of them would have had some soul.

All action plot line and you really believe that these characters have come off the screen into the book - in other words John Vormholt writes about the people we got to know in 7 years of TNG and this isn't true of all the authors who write TNG books. A twist to the normal, the Captain stays on the ship story line, gives Picard the action while Riker gets the ship repaired by becoming romaticaly entangled with the woman in command of the repairs - that is the part of the plot which meant, in my opinion, that the book was not worth 5 stars. The book is a good read - it doesn't deal with new theories about space, but it does give the definitive story about how Picard saved the Federation. What else would you expect from the best Captain in Starfleet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All the hype about it wasn't true","review":"Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek series, and I've watched all of them, even that pathetic Voyager series. So when I heard they were going to make a novel series about the Dominion War, I was excited. When I read the first story, Behind Enemy Lines, I thought it wasn't very good. I was hoping for a lot of action, and there is, but there are some strange things. Such as: why does the Enterprise lower its shields every time it fires? It never had to before. And the Jem'Hadar ships are way too powerful. If it was a battleship, I'd undestand. But you don't see those alot in the Dominion fleet. So one Jem'Hadar ship couldn't possibly destroy an Ambassador-class starship, unless it was a battleship. Besides that, it's an average book. The beginning is excellent, then it degenerates into just another book. The real highlight besides the beginning is the Corzanium. That's a real original idea. But no matter what, I wish L.A.

Knowing that putting lateral pressure on the disks would probably destroy them, I worked very carefully trying to keep the disk exactly in the saw cut.However, the metal collar that the mandrel slips through kept tearing through the side of the disks rendering them useless. None of them lasted more than a few seconds. After that the metal collar was practically impossible to remove from the mandrel. This idea looked good on paper but at least the batch that I got was of very poor quality.What did work were the smaller fiberglass-reinforced Dremel cutoff wheels.

That comes through in the book as glaringly as it does over the air. Whining and griping, Grant jumps from one subject to the next without offering any intelligent solutions to the issues presented. No wonder mature conservatives are embarrassed by Grant. Grant hurts himself in his book. He sketches an unflattering self-portrait of an effeminate aristocrat who never really worked in his life, toughed out military service, or cared about genuine abuses endured by minorities. We see a hypocrite whose heart never \\"went out\\" to the victims' families in the O.J. Simpson case. Grant's boring book reveals the narcissism of a fake \\"conservative\\" whose heart is centered on himself -- a kid who belongs in junior high school, not on radio.

What's worse is that his show comes under the guise of a forum of free speech, when in actuality it is entirely one-sided. For all his distaste with the mainstream media, I think if he sat back for a minute and consulted with liberals he would find an equal amount of disgust with what so many conservatives dub the \\"liberal media.\\"While I enjoy some conservative commentators, Grant is an unapologetic Republican sycophant that make him hard to stomache and difficult to take seriously.I'd love to discuss this topic with anyone who's willing at cdgprince@netscape.net, send me a note."},{"rating":"1","title":"RACIST YAHOO","review":"Bob Grant is a racist.

So they are not to blame for the current mess America is in? You tell me. If Africans were living in Africa, they would not be creating holes in the ozone, or pressuring their youths with making money, to the point of suicide.

They tend to be a touch larger in the waist [for me, at least: I got the 31Wx32L and 30Wx32L might have been a better fit] so if you are on the fence, I suggest you go for the smaller size.Edit: After about a month of wear...and especially after working on my leaking water heater...these pants really hold up!

Because this method involves fewer assumptions than traditional and somewhat impressionistic paleontologic reconstruction, it is narrower but more powerful. Gee emphasizes how cladistic methods have put paleontology on a scientific footing and emphasizes equally the limitations of this method and the ultimate limitations of our ability to reconstruct the history of life. This book is also a nice story about how science is done and how change occurs in scientific communities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fred-istics","review":"The author is besotted with his cat, a cat named Fred. No chance of dropping Fred's name onto a page is missed. Gee seemingly cannot speak of a chordate, or a tetrapod, without adding a parenthesis (\\"you, me, Fred the cat\\"), just to make sure the reader grasps the concept. The book needs illustrations beyond the few rudimentary cladograms, all attributed to a mysterious Mr. Xeridat. A few good ideas are introduced in the opening chapter, namely, the concept of parsimony, in selecting conflicting possible relationships between species. But then we get back to Fred the Cat. Gee states that the Megatherium (an extinct ground sloth) was twice as heavy as a bull African elephant. From what I can find on websites, the masses are indeeed in a ratio of two to one, but in favor of the elephant, about three tons to seven. The only reason I looked this up is that it seemed so unreasonable an assertion. I urge caution in accepting all that Gee says here."},{"rating":"2","title":"In search of a better ending","review":"I liked most of the book. It held my attention and I did read all of it.

Menno Simons was the 16th century Dutch Anabaptist leader from whom modern day Mennonites derive their name. Menno's work is doctrinal and theologically apologetic, as he generally was writing in defense of Mennonite thought against other Reformation era groups. This book would be one of the foundational books for Mennonite and Amish groups today, particularly those of a more conservative bent.

Lots of stuff in here begs the question, \\"Who Cares???\\" A better editor would have done this book wonders. Regarding the research, I find it highly disconcerting that EVERY ONE of his guinea pigs were huge into drugs. There was not a single person who was not a regular user of some kind of drug, and what's more, had done acid or 'shrooms hundreds of times.

There simply isn't. Had I different expectations, I might have enjoyed the book more.The trip stories are very cool.

I don't know what I was expecting, but Dr. Strassman is truly a professional.Not only does he give an incredible insight into how the medical testing process works, but also gives a wealth of information on an otherwise hard to research psychedelic. His theories are great, and he has a very introspective way about him.For those of us out there that take an interest in a world that is not supposed to be known, Dr. Rick Strassman is a great guide and source of knowledge.

The connections that a naturally produced psychedelic drug in the brain has with Buddhism, the Pineal Gland, and human gestation is mind-blowing to the extreme.

Hirsch uses a fortepiano that is equal to the task and his artistry is of the highest order. The music itself is deceptively simple, but listen closely - or closer - to the slow movement of the F Major to behold a masterpiece in all its glory; after all, Haydn dedicated this cycle to his patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy the Magnificent (arguably the most important patron in the history of music).

It turned out that two buttons are quitre sufficient - one for start/+1 minutes, the other one for stop/cancel. Actually, I wish there is a cancel button inside so you can canel the settings w/o having to close and re-open the door.I was also skeptical about the sensor cooking. It turned out the sensor cooking works pretty well.

Very pleased. It is a little bigger than I expected, and is a little on the noisy side, but overall I have had no complaints using it. I barely glanced at the manual and decided to \\"wing it\\", and most of the buttons are pretty self-explanatory. I was not overly pleased with the sensor-cook, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 (I did not find it entirely accurate and often had to continue to reheat after the sensor said it was finished), but overall anything I put in there defrosts and/or cooks very evenly.

The inside portion, (battry & filter cavities, and motor & filters area) fill up with ashes, creating a mess to clean up.

Following suit of \\"Sit Tibi Terra Levis\\", otherworldly and organic sounds permeate the strange atmosphere. Although there is no real \\"beat\\" to any of the music, Alio Die's use of looped samples create their own rhythms through repetition. I have never heard a better use of sampled loops than those Alio Die uses. Strange sounds. Organic and earthy, yet sometimes not of this earth... Thick and foggy, murky and deep are terms I would use to describe this release. Just plain weird but oh so enjoyable! This cd can induce some serious panic and fright if you plan to put the lights out and headphones on.

Tightly constructed and enthralling. Burke blends the macho of Hemingway, the sensitivity of Fitzgerald, the plot of a J.M. Cain, and the off-beat characters of Elmore Leonard. I reread all the DR series before Jazzfest every year, and I see each subsequent novel after Neon Rain as just a little less polished.

It baffles me how anyone as prone to stupid forays into violence as Dave Robicheaux could be considered a sympathetic protagonist. I read this one and started the next in the series, Heaven's Prisoners, but Robicheaux seems to going down the same mindless, violent path in the second book. No matter how much I love the writing, it's hard to keep reading books about a character who I find to have absolutely no redeeming values. I think I'm done with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read, Read, Read","review":"It's hard to review James Lee Burke, because his books are always so chock-full of atmosphere and characterization and thought. Each of the Dave Robicheaux series is a stand-alone, but I really recommend that you read them in order and listen to them on UNabridged audiobook as well. The sequence will give you the thread of the Robicheaux and other close characters saga, and the audio will give you the accent if you are not from Louisiana - all of which adds a great deal of depth to your reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time Reading Robicheaux","review":"Started at the beginning of this series and I'm glad I did. This book is simply outstanding. Burke introduces a strong, deep and complex character and surrounds him with a great story and a load of other folks that draw the reader's interest.

But I decided to give it a try and started with the first in the series (Neon Rain). I almost couldn't get through it. This is a poorly written cop story, set in New Orleans, where Robicheaux is a drunken homicide Lt. It has none of the charm or style of the books that follow. Fortunately, Robicheaux decides to move to New Iberia in the second book, and the series really takes off and starts scoring strikes.

A Vietnam vet, functioning alcoholic with signs of PTSD, and New Orleans police detective, Dave Robicheaux's life story is cleanly laid out and defined. It is important to understand the gritty layers of this character in order to understand why he acts and reacts the way he does. He is more complicated than my other all time favorite tarnished knight, John D. McDonald's Travis McGee, but that also makes the Robicheaux character that much more appealing. This is a great introduction to a genuine man's man and a great platform to launch into the full series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning this book","review":"This book did not come with a dustcover even though it is a hardback edition.

The dynamics of Deaf and hearing actors, students and theatre professionals make a riveting story. Mr. Rigney's inside view of the production makes this a truly personal piece - readers get to know the players personally and become almost as attached to the outcome as the cast and production team.

The blades are very sharp, but even then, the pressure necessary to grate cheddar from a block is too much for this gadget. Press too lightly, you get nothing; press too heavily, and the blade simply stops. Maybe there's some technique that can be learned with time, but using this contraption shouldn't require that kind of effort. It needs a stronger motor, and/or a better way to convert the circular motion of the motor to the up-and-down movement necessary for grating to occur. All I can say to Black and Decker is try again, and get it RIGHT.Edit as of 12 Apr 2007 - finally threw this thing out; I think I might have used it a half-dozen times, and it wasn't doing anything more than taking up space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I bought this to replace my broken salad shooter (primarily used to grate large amounts of cheese) because it costs less. I charged it the full time as the directions stated. The directions also advised not to put pressure on it because it would work better if the food was just lightly held against the grater. I tried it with cheddar cheese, and it didn't work at all. I then put just a little pressure on it. I got maybe a tablespoon of grated cheese (thinking the whole time it would be easier to do this by hand), and then it quit working. Plugging it in and recharging it made no difference. When I returned it to the store, the customer service person advised me not to get another one because so many had been returned. It's worth it to me to spend more and get a new salad shooter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gizmo? Shizmo!","review":"This thing is terrible! I wanted a nice shredder/grater since I lost my Salad Shooter and could not find a new one in a local store. My mom got me the Gizmo Grater for my birthday and it is horrible! It hardly grates and I could do a better job using my old silver hand grater! But, that aside, it is almost impossible to clean the metal graters after you are done--and cheese does get stuck.

Even when fully charged, it didn't have enough power to grate my semi-soft cheddar cheese like my good old hand held grater. It made an awful squealing sound when you put a little too much pressure on it and it would only grate a very small amount (1 tsp.) after what seemed to be about 1 min. of grating.

It was difficult to grip and use properly - the cheese kept moving with the moving blade. It did not hold its charge very long even when it was new. 1.5 years later it does not hold a charge long enough for one serving. I have started using it as an old fashioned grater with no power! I am getting a Delonghi since my daughter has had no problem with hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it for a refund","review":"I'm a big Black & Decker fan so I thought this grater would be perfect--on the commercials it made grating look so easy. Well, not so. Since the grater itself is held in one hand with your thumb constantly pressing on a slider to activate the motor and the item to be grated is held in the other hand, trying to keep the food item steadily against the moving grater became a major upper body workout and bits of food went flying all over the place. Trying to grate anything harder than mozzerella cheese made the blades come loose from the housing (the lid holding the blades in place didn't secure well enough and easily popped open) which became extremely dangerous. We weren't able to grate any food that we normally use without pulling out the old hand grater or Cuisinart so this grater very quickly became a useless machine taking up precious storage space--so we returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called: 'GIMICK CHEESE LESSOR'","review":"Okay here is a lesson in Physics. Let's look at Newton's Third Law of Motion: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.So if you are holding the GIMO in your left hand and the cheese in your right hand the FORCE it takes to hold the cheese against the moving grader is at lest as much as it takes to grad cheese with a regular grader. This thing makes grading cheese no easier. In fact as the GIZMO has more mass that a regular grader it takes more energy to get the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't press too hard!!","review":"A lot of people have been giving this grater bad reviews. It works very well for me. I grate cheese with it for my macaroni and cheese, and other pasta dishes. We are used to holding and pushing very hard with the cheese in the traditional grating process. The trick to this one is to NOT PUSH TOO HARD. The grater is very very sharp and will do the work for you if you get the technique down pat. Hold it lightly against the grater, and it will grate just fine. Battery power is fine for me, never slows down. Maybe the grater body could be a little wider so the cheese would come down easier, but there is even a technique for that which works, bang it on the side of your hand, or use a table knife to push it out. I guess I kind of like gadgets, and since this one works. I can't see why it is being dissed so badly. Come on lighten up!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another product","review":"Everything I read by other is true, this does not work on cheddar cheese! A product that does work is the salad shooter.

It didn't work well at all with cheddar cheese (what we use most of), so I put it away, thinking I must be doing something wrong.Recently I dragged it out again. I reviewed the instructions, recharged it the requisite time, managed to get it put together, and tried again with cheddar cheese. Again, nothing. Would not grate - basically just produces a few random crumbs. I tried more pressure, but if you put a little pressure on it, it stops entirely.I suppose I will try to find SOMETHING it will grate before throwing it away. But I have to tell you, I have never bought a product before that absolutely did not do what it was supposedly made to do.

It doesn't work good at all on chedder. The cheese is constantly getting stuck behind the blade instead of just falling out the bottom, and this happens right away. You can't shread for more than 10 seconds before the cheese build's up. Then you have to stop and shake the unit until the cheese comes out, and it doesn't come out very easy. Something hard and dry like Romano comes out the bottom just fine but it takes too long. If you press the cheese too firmly against the blade it stops, and that's with a full charge. This product definitely needs improvements like a bigger barrrel for the cheese to fall through and more power. In the mean time get out your old hand shredded it works better and faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grater it's not!","review":"Oh...where to begin. First, you have to use a block of cheese the size of Mt. Everest. As you rest it against the grater while it moves back/forth, you have to push quite hard. However, if you push too hard, it sssslllllooooowwwws down. What cheese you do manage to grate gets stuck in the middle and a knife must be used to push it through. Finally, the top/bottom of the grater is very sharp, making it nearly impossible to clean without cutting yourself. Stick with the traditional version and do it yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"What a waste of money, time and energy! It doesn't cut the cheese!

There is no way that any one of them could have possibly tested this made in China piece of crap. It makes a lot of noise and then binds up as soon as anything touches the blade.

Getting the device to grate cheese is actually HARDER than a normal old fashioned cheese grater, since you have to hold the device steady relative to the cheese while the blades are bouncing up and down. If you do manage to get it to grate some cheese, the cheese quickly gets trapped between the blades and the device itself, and you have to use a knife or something to poke the cheese out.

It was interesting to see Long John Silver as both a loving father and a grieving husband while still getting up to his old tricks, and the love story with Jim and Silver's daughter was interesting. The movie also does a great job dealing with the concept of slavery because it deals with it in an accurate, heartfelt way.

When packing up each room I just made sure that color tape was on all sides of the box so they would know what room each box went into. When there is at least one box in each room there is no confusion what else goes in there.

It's VHS quality, which is to be expected, but the sound was not good, either. Somewhere in the chain from original recording to the DVD there was a device which had a motor with inconstant speed, so there is a pitch undulation superimposded on the sound track. Adding that to the stilted acting and poorly done lighting makes this a video that, for me, was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"Purchased this DVD as I had seen the movie many years ago, unfortunately the colours were all faded which was disappointing. This is my favourite G&S Operetta and after seeing the original movie and the D'Oly Carte production here in Melbourne the lack of colour was a shame the music and performances are still very good so if you like G&S you may want to find a copy that is more up to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality of Great Music","review":"This DVD recording of the Mikado has poor quality to the point of not being able to hear and understand the words on good speaker systems.

This one brings it to life. Compared to the 1939 version I've seen on film, this one is fresh, less stagy and Koko doesn't run over all the other actors. It was refreshing to hear everyone who was supposed to sing certain songs actually perform them. I still like the 1939 version for the lovely old tenor voices (and Katasha is a real dragon in that one!), but I prefer this one to listen to for purity of tone, good voices throughout and clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can people like this DVD?","review":"Gilbert & Sullivan musicals are enjoyable. The Mikado music is wonderful. BUT, the technical aspects of this DVD are terrible! If I hear and see one more fan being opened and snapped shut I think I will scream. And while I am listening for the snapping I won't be bothered by the dialogue and lyrics because I can't hear them well enough to tell what they are saying. There is a definite mushiness about the audio that makes it extremely difficult to understand anything. The audio is not well synced with the video. This is especially noticeable in close-ups. The graininess of the picture makes me think that this DVD was made from a copy of the original that was photocopied 27 times before I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banda Tierra Blanca","review":"I have to admit, I probably listen to this CD too much. It's fun, the music is great and I like nearly every song. Although the music is banda, the group seems to try everything from banda, traditional, salsa, etc. The songs all have their very own distinct sounds (unlike a lot of Norteno/regional music, they don't all sound the same) and the they really know how to play.Maybe someday I'll actually speak Spanish and understand what they're singing about. Until then, I'll just hope they aren't singing about gringos."},{"rating":"2","title":"When bad days turn good","review":"I liked the book because it was funny and it teaches kids that bad days can be really good days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for the Chicago Outfit","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit.

I felt as if I were swept back in time when I was younger, spending time with my grandmother. Ms. Fields has a way of relating the incidents in this book to times in my life that I can remember. I would often hear my grandmother interject pieces of her childhood in daily things we would do. When I was little, I would just absorb her advice temporarily; now I keep thinking of her advice with more meaning! Ms. Fields takes two generations and two different time periods and unites them into a common understanding. She doesn't hold back on the vivid details as she ploughs through her rural setting and makes the reader truly believe he/she is there. I believe more books like this that capture your attention and make you evaluate your path in life, need to be written. Ms. Fields, I look forward to more of your novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Tape For a Blue Girl - This Lush Garden Within","review":"This release is just too quiet, seriously, there was nothing behind this recording. Too many lulls in music, too much silence. This CD put me to sleep, which isn't a good thing when I'm driving. From what I could hear the music was beautiful, but there were too many dead spots, much of time there was nothing of significance going on. I found this release to be choppy and aggravating, switching from an ethereal soundscape to complete nothingness.

Good source of information for school projects/ self study activities on telecommunication system design....covers some basic maths, C algorithm, and a bit of explanation on communication system, so readers must refer to other texts to complement this book (for further studies). The programme is written specifically for floating point DSP (texas instrument) so some adjustment is needed if we want to implement it on fixed point DSP or other DSP...additional comments: A bit outdated for the choice of the processor, but the fundamental is still there.Should include implementation on fixed point.This book should include some explanations on how to convert floating point calculation to fixed point, design considerations and pitfalls/ traps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I find this music pretentious and affected.

I have just spent close to $600, between parts and service to fix a stupid plastic component of the machine. Their warranty was only for two years.

Fine for boys and girls alike, but definitely for those under 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"See ya!","review":"Since it's inception, X-Treme X-Men has had it's share of up's and down's. Even though it's been scripted by legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont, this title really showed his flaws as a writer, and the flaws within the X-Men mythos that Claremont himself is and was responsible for to begin with. Prisoner of Fire, the final collected arc of the series, finds Storm, Shadowcat, Gambit, Rogue, Bishop, Sage, and the rest of the crew on the trail of a genericly written villain that naturally leaves the door open for another encounter. Igor Kordey's art looks more improved than what we have seen on his various stints on New X-Men, but it doesn't have long to impress since this TPB comes to an end rather quickly. Since X-Treme X-Men has come to an end, Claremont has returned to writing Uncanny X-Men and is also the scribe of the newly launched Excalibur book, both of which are currently faring better than almost anything to be found in the entire X-Treme X-Men series."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-Tremely Tired Ends","review":"X-Treme X-Men comes to a close with plenty of loose ends. The bad guy gets away (again). As per usual with X-Treme, the villains are forgettable and hardly credible threats to the X-Men (who are only threatened by mind-controlled members of their own team).While Kordey finally hit his stride in the book after a painful time growing into it, he doesn't get the chance to show some of the vicious tough action and strong acting evident in his better work (X-Treme X-Men: Storm The Arena and Cable).This is not a great book. If you want to find some interesting X-Men or Kitty Pryde, try Astonishing X-Men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I was introduced to this line in a spa and have loved it ever since!

It is poorly-written and amateurish, and the story-telling is not at all compelling. I would read 20-page blocks of this book and then forget about it for a month. The description of people and events is extremely thin, and it's obvious that little research was put into it. That might be forgivable if, as I said, the writing wasn't of such low quality.

My bulb blew at 312 hours. Wasn't under warranty and cost me another $400+ to replace. Panasonic service online and on-phone are terrible. Then had same problem with cycle-on and cycle-off. Took it in person to nearest Panasonic authorized service center (75 miles away) and they told me it was just dusty and charged $120 for the evaluation and cleaning. Came home and it still does the same thing. Service center now out of business and Panasonic wants me to ship it to Kansas. Judging from all the online info this is a lemon and Panasonic knows it. The bulb life is a joke and the power supply is faulty. Will not go with Panasonic again. Now I am looking for a good replacement as fixing this one will likely run hundreds. My current bulb is at 295 hours so even after it is fixed I am afraid it will blow soon and another $400+ will be needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulbs blow at less than 500 hours","review":"I have been a proud owner of this projector for a short while over a year.

I can only hope panasonic will do the right thing and replace my bulb at no cost.

Listening to it now on CD, it sounds hokey. In fact, it is downright annoying.The musicianship is excellent, the arrangements flawless. Sadly, the tracks suffer from the addition of a click track, an effect added in an attempt to make the music sound modern and contemporary. Sadly, what may have been interesting in the early 1980s sounds positively hideous today.As an early example of electronic percussion, this particular click track (it actually is meant to sound like clapping) is not nuanced at all, and would sound far more in place with a New Wave title.And every track on this album has this annoying click track! The same effect on every tune.If this material were to ever be remastered, even if they simply removed the effect and did nothing else, the album would rate a 5 in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Swing from Amazon.com","review":"This CD takes the Swing music that you enjoy so much and gives it a driving beat.It really gets you moving.No regrets here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective CD","review":"I received this CD \\"Hooked on Swing\\" promptly after ordering, but when I try to play it, my CD player will not load it.

But I'm glad I did.If you're looking for a bag to organize small items, look elsewhere. There are a few small compartments but most of the bag consists of two \\"large\\" compartments, plus the one to hold a cell phone (or a brick).

WAY too many buttons. It took me forever to figure out and I'm usually really good with electronics. The only reason I kept it was because I really liked the picture quality. Eventually everything had a blue cast and was very light. A friend who is a professional photographer tried to use the settings to balance this, it still wouldn't be \\"normal.\\" Had to send it back to Samsung to be fixed when the lens wouldn't retract. As time went on the picture quality deteriorated. I have had this for approximately 2.5 years and it finally went. Magenta and yellow splotches on all pictures. Very dark pictures with shadows.

So we'll see how they do when they are washed and used on the t-shirts. They are lots of fun to use and are pretty colors though. It's a good baby shower activity and good fun. They do get a little gloopy if you're trying to make intricate designs, and can get a little messy in that way. But if you keep the designs simple they look good. If you're working with artists who have low self confidence, you might want to just get the crayola fabric markers which are easy to use and more familiar for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Soundtrack","review":"Macheads is an interesting premise not all that well executed. It wants to examine the history of Apple owners who have been and still are besotted by their computers. I'm one of them so was anticipating an interesting little documentary. Unfortunately it is mainly ruined by a deafeningly loud instant-migraine techno-thump soundtrack that often comes near to drowning out what the interviewees are saying.One Mac woman who lives in a caravan in what looks like a peaceful forest is barely audible above noise that sounds like party night at the local hiphop club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a biased celebration of Mac users rather than an informative and intuitive look at the Machead culture.

It is difficult thing to use. It has very fragile tips and doesn't get very high up in temperature. Use solder that's too thick and it doesn't melt. Solder too thin, and you'll have a hell of a time connecting the electrodes on the tips. A simple solder job on a guitar cable turned into a hour long battle of will and determination to get the electrodes at the right angle to operate. Don't believe me, go borrow one and try it out. It all looks good on paper; the price, the technology, even the design. The Cold Heat tool is just not very practical, or functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"I was never able to get enough heat out of it to melt a solder joint, even on small leads with very little metal. On a long lead, or soldering to any metal with large surface area - forget it. I know it was working, because when I make contact across the points, the red light comes on to show it is heating. Also I was able to get nice sparks when moving it around, and some heat, but never melted a solder joint. I thought it might work on very light printed circuit board work, but no. I used brand new batteries that I tested before installing to insure that I had full power, so I know that was not the problem. The unit just does not provide enough heat to be of any use.

I used it for the first time today, and I now know why it was so cheap: it doesn't work and was an exercise in total frustration (I was replacing a thermal fuse in an appliance and couldn't even get the cold heat unit to melt the old solder).This tool might be useful if you were working on a printed circuit board, were very experienced, and had a very steady hand, but for anything else I give it a big thumbs down.

It was not. It was very sticky, seemed messier (thinner consistency, maybe), and caused hairs to break off instead of pulling out at the root. It also left a lot of stray hairs behind. Because of the breakage, I had between 10 and 30 ingrown hairs surfacing daily for the next two weeks. Some of those became infected and left scars. The breakout was so bad it actually hurt to wear underwear or jeans.The wax also left my skin very irritated, as the stickiness pulled and battered the top layer than the regular Honee Wax does.I have been waxing for 20 years, so am not inexperienced.

THEY HAVE FORCED ME TO DISCARD A COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL COMPACT BECAUSE THE NEW EYE SHADOWS WILL NOT FIT.In my opinion, this is not eccologically sound at all, and it is a dirty trick that companies commonly pull to get customers to purchase more unneeded things.

Soft water is about the same (since the softener is just replacing ions). My RO runs around 6. A few months ago the number started to climb, so I replaced the main RO filter and it's back down to 6. This could save quite a bit of money since the main RO filter is expensive and you're told to replace it every 3 years. Since I don't use much water, I was hoping it would last longer and it did.I use a water glass to do the test. I found I have to wash out the glass several times with the test water otherwise the stuff in my \\"clean\\" glass causes an elevation in reading. The sensitivity is amazing!Highly recommended.

The only way to prove it is working, other than taste, is to use a Total Dissolved Solids meter.I tested the tap water which read 263 ppm. Then I read the output of the reverse osmosis system: 14 ppm. A super obvious reduction in mineral content. It would probably be lower if this house had a water softener, but alas the owner would not put one in.I checked the water coming out of the in-door water spigot of the refrigerator after installing a new filter: 243 ppm. It is, after all, only a charcoal filter designed for chlorine and taste, but it did reduce particulates by 20 ppm. If I could, I would run a line over to the fridge, but that would entail crawling in the attic, etc. When I have my own house to tinker with that is what I will do.In summary, this meter arrived intact; works as advertised; and I would recommend it to anyone that needs such a meter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Deck","review":"This is a truly beautiful deck that clicks instantly for interpetation.

It provides a swivel base and a quick-release bar clamp. Upon mounting on a table, it does seem to provide a very verstatile way to hold various objects. However, two problems soon become evident. First, the whole system has a lot of play in it, so it is not really designed for any activity that would exert more than moderate force (such as hack-sawing) on the object. Secondly, there is a defect in the design that when you clamp the system onto a table, the release on the bar clamp is practically touching the table, which makes it rather cumbersome and hard to swivel the clamp or tighten or loosen the clamp.

Admittedly, I was one of the only women laughing, but most women need to lighten up... it's just a movie!My only complaint about the video is that the coloration and sound didn't translate very well. This movie was utterly gorgeous on the big screen. It had fabulous club scenes. Whoever edited it did a superb job. I'm glad there were so many other positive reviews. I too would love to see a sequel. Andrew Dice Clay has gone on to make fairly mediocre movies since then, and I have hardly heard of him. Someone said Lauren Holly was unnoticed.

I was able to quickly suck the fluid out of the reservoir. It had great suction, didn't really have a problem with it dripping at all. It was also super easy to clean, threw it in the sink under some water with a little soap and it was like brand new.

His lovely and thankfully not gushy tribute to his mum 'The Woman In My Life, is another sweet, but fully professional recording. Hard to believe his IS only twelve on this album, as he sings with a maturity way beyond his years.I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the dulcet tones of a young male artist, and he could well convert anyone to country style music to whom this might not normally appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deduct one for the producers/choice of songs","review":"Grant, below, has it dead right.

All the songs on this CD are great, to name a few, my favorites, Elizabeth, I've Got To Make It To Summer, My Time On Earth, God's Alive And Well, The Woman In My Life, and one that really shows Billy's genius, the tongue twister, You Don't You Won't, I recommend this CD to all music lovers that are searching for music that stirs the soul. This youngster has succeded in bringing them to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say?","review":"If you haven't listened to the clips above, DO SO! IF you need convincing, Billy's voice will do it without the aid of reviews! Astounding control, well placed inflection, professional insertion of vocal emotion, a strong unwavering voice, clear as a bell tones. . . Billy Gilman is not just another child artist. He stands out with his ability to actually SING, truly SING, and far from playing it safe, he tackles tough songs and adult endeavors with gusto and success. A real winner. I'm not a fan of ballads, but Some Things I Know could not do a better job showcasing his beautiful voice. You Dont You Wont shows better breathing control than most adults have mastered, and Elisabeth & The Woman In My Life are sweetly touching. I personally really enjoyed Almost Love and She's Everything You Want. Our First Kiss may appear to just be a cute song, but listen close and hear the strength in his voice, and the careful control of each note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this CD expecting so hear good songs, but what i heard made me feel like kicking my CD player. 7 out of 12 songs were tweenie love songs! i mean, maybe one or two would be ok but...7! haven't billy's producers ever heard of moderation? having bought the CD, i might as well give my 2 cents worth...to billy's producers: please use his beautiful voice to HIS advantage and focus on good songs, not image. it is possible to be a pop star (if that's the aim) and have credibility. thank goodness Borders have a 14 day return policy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A ANOTHER GREAT ONE","review":"A ANOTHER GREAT ONE.THIS CD IS AWSOME AND OUTSTANDING .THIS BILLY GILMAN AT HIS BEST"},{"rating":"1","title":"After Listening to This CD...","review":"I'm reminded of the saying, \\"If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.\\"End of review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy tool","review":"I use the dremel around the house for light odd jobs.

He raves about it.I enjoyed it too, before wrapping it as a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another lovely book featuring trees outside UK","review":"This book features more beautiful photographs of old, remarkable trees along with just the right amount of text on their history. The difference between this and the previous \\"Meetings with Remarkable Trees\\" book is that the previous book featured trees located in the British Isles, while this book features trees from all over the world. Given the great variation in tree species and habitat, the photographs and tree shapes are more varied than in \\"Meetings\\", making the look of the book a little bit different. You don't get as much of a sense of fairyland from all of these trees; they evoke varied and different moods. Also, as someone else mentioned, flowering trees seem to be absent. However, the book is still very nicely done so I gave it five stars, even though my preference is for the previous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"A very nice book, with remarkable trees, however, from the cover I suppose I wrongly assumed they would be beautiful trees. Quite a lot of the book is spent on African trees of a very strange nature, and to my husband's suprise, very little was done on the banyan tree. I was looking forward to large, ancient trees myself. All in all, it is still a wonderful book, it just wasn't what we were expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Love the information on trees world wide and especially the large, magnificent photographs.

This was the first Sweet Valley book I actually ever bought, I was like 10 when it came out. It changed my life forever. Yes from that day forward I was obsessed with those perfect blonde twins and their mindnumbing adventures.It is the twins first middle school dance and everyone is waay excited. Little do they know that a) everything ends up going wrong and b) they will have like a school dance just about every week in the Sweet Valley High series. But anyway Jessica hooks up with the hottie Bruce, Elizabeth makes out with Jessica's date and Amy is made over by Kimberly and Lila. It wacky, it's cheesy...it's sadly one of my favorite books. Also be sure to read the following book Jessica The Thief for more evil Veronica action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing the Mississippi River to life........","review":"Old Glory tells the tale of Raban's solo journey by boat down the Mississippi from Minneapolis to New Orleans. Along the way, he visits the great cities and backwater towns that dot this legendary American wonder. Raban demonstrates that the Mississippi is, in myriad ways, much more than a river. He records the life-altering relationships between people and place and brings us the history and experience of this ultimate American artery. I have crossed the Mississippi by bridge and plane countless times and, with a cursory glance, acknowledged it as a major American marker. Raban, however, brings a soul to the Mississippi that, at once, uncovers a latent reverence, inspires a profound understanding, and rekindles a vicarious sense of spirit and adventure in the American citizen for \\"our\\" river and it's lore. This is an excellent book that deserves, and will certainly earn, your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent voyage through the American soul","review":"As An European, I have travelled quite frequently through the US and know many of the locations along The Mississippi. Jonathan Raban very carefully observes the unique way of living along the main artery of the USA in a critical but frequently very funny way (at least when not being American - this also explains the 1-star rating of a fellow reader who must be an American that cannot accept observations from outside; they will be in the minority when reading the excellent book by Raban, I believe); great that it appeared as a paperback in 1998 - it took me two years to find a hardcover version)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Twain, Not","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Raban's 'Bad Land,' I really looked forward to reading this book. Bad Land is all about pure unadulterated misery, but somehow the inhabitants of that god-forsaken place are shown to be decent souls with human dignity.Raban's just now clearing Lock 6 at Trempealeaw, and I'm abandoning ship before we've even left Minnesota. I can journey no farther south with this contemptible ass. His misanthropic disdain for people who show nothing but kindness to him is quite appalling. I'm no flag-waving provincialist; I'm something of a cynic myself. But, I've journeyed all over the world, and have never felt compelled to straight-arm a local's accent, clothing, mannerisms, dietary habits, housing, or the width of his neck.There are many other books available that document voyages down the Mississippi, usually in a craft much less river-worthy than a 16-foot speedboat. Try \\"Paddle to the Amazon\\" for a starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance on the river!","review":"The author showed nothing but disdain and arrogance throughout this book. His attitude of superiority for virtually everyone he met on his voyage was very disappointing. The observations he made of the river and the people living along it are hard to take seriously since it was all so colored by his patronizing manner. He also showed little respect and almost no gratitude for his hosts' openness and kindness in bringing him into their homes. They simply became more fodder for him to mercilessly mock. I learned little from this book and enjoyed it less. He seemed to enjoy: making fun of the people from Minnesota; ridiculing Buffalo, Iowa; derided St. Louis as a garbage dump and the arch as a \\"practical joke\\", and continued his litany of contempt and scorn down through Baton Rouge right to the end at Morgan City. I'm just not sure what the point of his trip was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Glorious about Old Glory","review":"I have to admit I was thrilled to join Raban on his journey down the \\"mighty mac,\\" but after he left the locks south of Red Wing he was on his own. The book appealed to my sense of adventure, but I guess I'm too happy a guy to identify with this damp Englishman. His observations were continually pessimistic and cynical. I only envied his thirst for smalltown beer and peanuts.

The story revolves around Ramona Montoya. She rediscovers herself and her roots as a result of an accident where she finds herself the adopted mother of her nephew Jose. There is a sort of a haunting, but only of the best kind because Ramona finds assistance from her dead grandparents and others who come to remind her who she really is. It's a wonderful story meant to be read again and again. In my book, Collignon's gift of story telling is beyond compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and amusing","review":"This well-crafted story set in New Mexico was a treat: Marquez-esque arrivals of the dearly departed; wives with complusive tortilla making disorders; and lots and lots of family and family troubles.

Their heart poured out of their sincerity in the only song they co-wrote Lucky to Be Here. But without a doubt the song the duo has entitled \\".308\\" written by Jim Rushing is the pick-me-up of the album. This album is more of who and what the group really is, and they'll tell you about themselves inside each song. I also want to say Brian and Joanna are absolutely the best people I know on the face of the earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from 'ol MG","review":"This is yet again another great CD from MG. Sticking with the southern values it packs the good upbeat stuff that most country listeners would like to hear more often. My favorite on the CD would have to be \\"Cold One Comin' On\\". Other good songs would have to be \\"While the World Goes Down the Drain\\" and \\"Black Jack Fletcher and Mississippi Sam\\". The thing I like about this CD is the fact that MG isnt afraid to go their own way with the way they sing, and although some songs on this CD are similar in form to those on \\"My Town\\" they still sound unique and have a great beat to them. I still would recommend \\"My Town\\" for a first buy for this group but either this CD or \\"You Do Your Thing\\" would be next, followed by \\"Tattoos and Scars\\" if you feel like getting more CDs from this band (which im sure you will)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk","review":"The cover was broken when I recieved this \\"case\\". although it was packaged very well.

The music drags, it has a depressing pull. The singing works for a little while and then it doesn't because it lacks polish and maturity and energy.

I don't know exactly why they are my favorite, and maybe that's why. I've played this CD over and over, which I cannot say about many of the CD's I've heard.They are a Contemporary Christian band though they don't use much specifically Christian language. They are sometimes classified in print as Modern Rock Alternative, but they don't sound a lot like others in that category. I think of their music as love songs to God in the tradition of Christian mysticism. I like their production values, also. There is solid musicianship with an occasional turn of expression that sounds like a veneer of pop covering a deeper esthetic. There are unexpected effects, but they are not gratuitous."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my personal favorites....","review":"It is truelly sad that Chasing Furies did not recieve the radio play and attention they deserved on this CD. Being a promoter of Alt/Rock bands in Southern OR for some time, I find it hard to believe that this CD did not take off. Instead Chasing Furies is a name that very few are familiar with, and since it has been many years sine the release of this their final CD, I assume they are no more. Amazingly beautiful harmonies. Chasing furies where tearing apart our souls and minds, long before Evenesence, was even on the radio.

But I loved the sound so I bought it anyway. But since I've had it in my own possesion, I've had the chance to study the lyrics more closely, and I must say, the extra study has been very beneficial. (this is kind of a no-brainer, I know-- we should always study the lyrics, but sometimes, the ol' noggin is thick) I love the expression of abandon and longing and yearning for God to be a part of our every breath and move. There are songs for so many 'stages' of the Christian life-- the vibrant, the dry, the broken, the lover, the beggar, the seeker. Buy it for the sound, love it for the message.

At 42mm, this is larger than the traditional Hamilton Khaki, but as it is not overly heavy, and lies flat on the wrist, you will not be reminded that you are wearing it. Hamilton provides probably the best cost to value ratio of automatic watches available, and this model shows off the traditional stylings, unlike some newer designs, which seem like they are attempting to show off by being unusual.

It is important that the number one ingredient is a protein source and in this case it is chicken which is good. Don't be put off by the second ingredient corn meal. For some reason people get caught up in thinking corn meal is not so easily digestible but that thought is unjustified. Corn meal is a completely acceptable source of carbohydrates just like rice and will be easily digestible to your dog. Also the omega 3 fatty acids this food contains is good to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"While certainly not the worst dog food on the market, this is also not the best. Any dog food that lists corn, corn meal, or rice (dark/dirty or white,) as the number one or number two ingredient means it is predominantly just filler. Your dog will eat more because they cannot digest rice or corn and the food will pass through their system quickly, they will defecate more often, and because the food does not stay in their system too long, they do not get as many vital nutrients as they should. This one does say chicken as the number one ingredient, but corn meal is number two. It then goes on to list whole grains and chicken by-products (i.e. chicken livers, hearts, feet, everything you would never touch.) While the chicken is healthy, none of the rest is for a dog, and they are all the top ingredients. The nutritional value is not what they claim it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your research","review":"I had bad luck with this dog food (my dog had loose stools all the time).

If you don't keep dancing, you forget a lot of what used to come naturally. Their specialty seems to be Latin dances - swing is not their forte. All steps from discs 1 and 2 are reviewed in disc 3 and that is all I really needed to buy. The pace is slow and repetitive for experienced dancers, but might be just fine for real beginners. Since they cover so many styles the cd set can't go much beyond the basics. The instruction is pretty clear and the camera shots are good enough to learn the steps. If you are a total beginner you might want to start with disc 1; if you are brushing up or adding a couple of styles disc 2 covers all the steps in disc 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a view if you liked the game.","review":"This is a prequel to the game, and it seems like it was a prequel conceived AFTER the game had come out.

If anything, watch for the adorable scenes of Puppy Repede."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indifferent film that ties poorly to the game","review":"While this seems like a good idea at first glance, this movie was a fundamentally uninteresting side-story with a lot of inconsistancies when compared against the game it is supposed to be leading into; Concepts like Aer and Blastia are presented as working in completely different ways than they do in the game, and many details regarding Yuri and Flynn do not reconcile well with the game either. Other characters are presented essentially as cameo appearances.This could have been a really interesting undertaking, but it's actually fairly bland and doesn't connect well to the game under any sort of thoughtful scrutiny.

Now less than two years later the same problem is happening and it's no longer under warranty. I won't waste my time getting it fixed when it will probably cost the same amount of money to buy a new one.

This microwave looks great, but beyond that it's worthless. I paid for an oven that was supposed to have several power levels.....and it DOESN'T! It has one...and only one. It has 10 power settings, but only one power level. If you set the machine for 30% power you don't get 30% power, you get 30% full power, then 70% dormant time. This cooks totally different than a constant 30% power level. Be sure when you are buying your next microwave that you do not mistake \\"power settings\\" for \\"power levels\\". Believe me, it makes a big difference. I would never buy this product again. I am very dissatisfied.

It also included annotated biographies of the principle members of the Li Imperial family of the Cheng-Han state. Highly recommended, but be warned- Chinese historical biographies can be confusing and somewhat tedious- read those if you are a true history buff- otherwise, you can use the preceding part of the book, (the first 70%), as a great reference.Also, there is a great translation of titles/ranks, a heavy use of Chinese characters for names and titles (as well as explanations if there is possible confusion between two texts), and a fabu index.

To all indications, it is pure quality. I last set it (by NIST time) about six weeks ago (when the battery was replaced). Since then, it has gained exactly ONE second. This makes it easily the most accurate watch I have ever owned--certainly including my Rolex GMT-Master and DateJust. Something else that favorably impresses me about it is that the second hand pauses exactly on the hash marks (not in between like a lot of watches), reflecting attention to detail. The case is solid stainless (not metal coated plastic as on another \\"Swiss Army\\" watch I used to own) and the finish is flawless. The date magnifier is a big help and the color and subtle pattern of the \\"Champagne\\" face are an attractive touch. The band is comfortable with a wide range of adjustments.

She went out to investigate and tried to pick up the iron but the handle was too hot. Upon touching the hot handle, she dropped it onto our insulated ironing board pad causing an immediate burn in the pad. This iron's safety shutoff device was clearly not working. By the time she got the iron unplugged, the iron was smoking, smelled of burnt wiring and the handle so hot that she had to get a towel to put it in a non-flammable area to cool off. It only took the iron less than 3 minutes to get to those extreme temperatures and surley if she was not there to hear the beeping, we could have easily burnt down our house due to the fact that the iron would not shut off.We're going back to a Rowenta despite it costing twice as much.

We could've lived with that, though. I'm giving it 2 stars because after its first cleaning (there is a rather cumbersome process for doing this which I followed to the letter), its little computer went haywire and it wouldn't heat anymore. I called the company - they were nice and are sending us another iron - but in the meantime we had to go get another and were steered toward a Panasonic, which turns out to be a much better design.

I asked for another digital iron and was told they were on back order, with no date expected.What kind of warranty is that?

Also, the water fill intake latch cover is poorly designed and could be torn off quite easily; you have to handle very carefully when refilling the iron with water.

On the minus side, at precisely the two-year mark, both irons had their temperatures regulators go bad, and they overheated to the point of burning out. When this happens, the iron starts beeping continuously and won't quit until it's unplugged.

Maybe I got a lemon, but it should have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"This iron didn't work very well when it did work, but it stopped heating after a few months. We bought a panasonic (with the nickel coating) which is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped producing steam after 2 months","review":"Very strange. My iron D2020 also stopped producing steam after 5 months. I bought the iron over a year ago but couldn't use it due to a move. I called customer service and they told me that the warranty ran out. They said that they have a complementary price for a new iron for customers such as I. The iron supposed to be a newer model for $37.99 (including shipping and handling). I received the new iron today and was very dissapointed. It was not a newer model (D2000) which I can purchase at WalMart for $39.99. What a great price they offered me. :( My older iron also had a much longer cord.Many reviews say that their iron stopped producing steam after 5 months or had some other types of flaws. This is very strange. Black & Decker, I believe, should be aware of this by now but customer service acts as if it's something new. Very upsetting.I will never ever by another Black & Decker iron again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"This iron has changed ironing for me into something I don't mind doing. It is just wonderful. It holds an amazing amount of water so I don't have to refull it too often, the amount of steam it puts out is fantastic. The very best thing about it is that it never ever leaks water. I've never had an iron that is so good at never leaking or spitting water. I will always buy this iron from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like This Iron-BUT","review":"First I purchased D2000, the auto-turn off didn't work. When you pressed the button for 2 seconds to turn it off manually, well that didn't work either. I called cust. serv. They don't even have the model listed, but she did have the same manual that comes with the iron. So I got the D2020. Well it has the same problem. Since CS was of no help, does anyone know what I might be doing wrong? As for the iron, it is the best I have owned except for having to unplug it to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed prematurely","review":"I purchased this iron within the last 3 or 4 years and I have used it only used occassionally.

After a few months, the spray button began to stick, which was annoying but manageable to work with. Then in the past couple of weeks the iron has begun to overheat (keep in mind that I am usually ironing maybe 2-3 items of clothing every day or two -- not heavy use by any stretch). It would overheat within about two minutes of plugging it in, giving off a burning smell and beeping constantly until unplugged. Thankfully I purchased mine at a local dept store that was willing to exchange it for another brand. I strongly recommend holding onto your receipt if you purchase this product. For what its worth, I thought the iron worked wonderfully while it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This iron received thumbs up from the consumer testing world.

I lifted the iron off my shirt to discover a dark scorch mark ON MY BRAND NEW SHIRT!I do NOT recommend this iron -- you risk burning your clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron failed after 2 years use","review":"We have used the Black and Decker D2020 for two years and it suddenly failed yesterday. The iron no longer gets hot even though the AC on light is lit and the digital display functions normally, There are no troubleshooting instructions to diagnose the problem in the manual or online. The iron has not been damaged in any way by us. This is either a poorly manufactured product or a poor product design.

The steam works great and presses clothes with little effort. Although, this iron seems a little heavy. Can't really compare the weight to a top of the line iron anyway--never had one. Can't imagine spending more on a iron that can do better than this one. Very Happy whis this purchase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it!","review":"I researched steam irons on Consumer Reports before buying (because I was tired of irons that didn't heat up or didn't steam well). This was top rated, and was cheaper than many other lower-rated irons with big names. I love it! It has an abundance of steam which is easily controlled. It beeps when it has reached the appropriate temperature (heating or cooling). It slides and glides very easily on the clothing, and the self-clean is very easy to use. It doesn't spit all over the clothes like my old iron did (which was also a Black and Decker, just a little cheaper model). I sew a fair bit, and it has been wonderful for pressing the seams, etc., whether using it steam or dry settings.We've had it a few months now and we have no complaints at all--I just wonder why it took me so long to go ahead and buy it! Definitely a good value for the price!**UPDATE 1/12/10**Would still highly recommend this iron and are using it exclusively years after purchasing it. No sign of it slowing down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"The D2020 I owned was purchased 04-05-2004. It stopped operating as a steam iron 09-09-2004. It was a great iron while it lasted. The stainless soleplate is better than any iron I have ever used. However the latch that covers the port where you fill the iron is very cheaply made, and if you're not careful it will break off. The iron on occasion even after cleaning each month,will drop staining droplets of water onto your clothing. You must be very careful when ironing white or light clothing. Also, I find it difficult to use the dial while cleaning. A person with weak hands will not be able to use this feature. I have read other reviews stating that this dial was very loose. My dial was stiff and hard to turn. And finally after just 5 months it stop giving steam. CS has offered to replace my 2020 with the 2000. I hope this is a better iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"best flatiron i've ever used","review":"My wife has R.Arthritis, she used to hate ironing, me too. Now I iron every morning before work.

Unfortunately it just stopped working after a few months (5 or 6) for no apparent reason. We liked it so much that we purchased another one sometime last July (04) and enjoyed it until it give up the ghost just a few days ago (that's two in a row). I suspect it has something to do with the Digital components. This was a good iron but it is useless if it doesn't work. Be prepared for a short product life / have a backup. I give it 1 star because it should last a lot longer for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 uses","review":"Very disappointed. Leaked water at first, but I could deal with that.

And then, one day, wile I was peacefully ironing my shirt, the electric charges started to appear inside the water container so that I had to disengage immediately to avoid electric shock. Eventually, after spreading the burning odor all over the iron died.

I have read at least 50 books on the Romanov's Russia, and lectured on \\"Romanov psychology\\", but I found this work a bore. Ms. Erickson revealed nothing new and cited (mostly) secondary and tertiary sources. I felt as though I was reading a Danielle Steele novel at times (with apologies to Ms. Steele...I wish I had one-one hundredth of her success as a writer!) H.I.M. the Tsarina was cast with Scarlett O'Hara-type melodrama, while every serious reader knows Alexandra was far more complex than most fictional heroines. I recommend Greg King's The Last Empress (far from perfect, but, in my view, better researched and written) or Robert Massie's legendary Nicholas and Alexandra. I'm sorry Ms. Erickson, I LOVE your Tudor series, but you really dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Fluff","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. There is so little valuable and insightful information about the Tsarina, and what information there is is simply fluff. This book barely skims the surface and leaves so much out, takes so little time to actually analyze information that it leaves more questions than it answers.If you are looking for a quick read, or an introductory book to Tsarina Alexandra this is it. Otherwise, I highly recommend \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" by Massie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read all other Carolly Erikson books and have, for the most part, enjoyed them. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. While there were some strong insights into the complexity of Alexandra, still, the character came across as bland. The book felt as thought it was not well-researched and hastily written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexandra The Last Tsarina by Carolly Erickson","review":"This was an excellent read on Alexanda. I have read nearly all the books available about the Romanov dynasty and there were several facts in this book I had not read prior. This book stayed focused on the Tsarina herself and doesn't stray too far from her even though the Tsarvich's illness is addressed. This book explored her relationship within the court and the power struggles with her mother-in-law, the former Empress. Alexandra had her flaws to be sure but comes across as so human in this particular book. The author's style is so good I am now reading The First Elizabeth and have purchased Josephine and The Great Catherine to read in the near future. This author knows her subjects and stays refreshingly focused on the personality she writes about rather than jumping around. A very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"There is nothing new here. Same old story of this stupid woman. She destroyed her weak husband, his government and the entire Imperial system. The book has the feel that all the research that was done was reading other people's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexandra - The Made for TV Movie in Book Form","review":"On the positive side, the narrative in 'Alexandra - the Last Tsarina' certainly offers a sense of high drama. But after a while, we get a very wooden impression of its characters - or is that caricatures? Nicholas II is very much a secondary figure here, served chiefly by the heterodox assertion that he was a weak ruler. The sentence 'She worried about Alexei' becomes an almost banal, repeated understatement.One wonders if this book was really meant to read like an historical novel produced for the mass market. It certainly does, and this may explain the factual errors, truncations of time, and elisions of events that make the text so difficult for admirers of the last Tsar and his family to read through without a growing disappointment. Granted, Robert Massie and his thorough treatment is a hard act to follow, but if the present book was fiction, why didn't someone say so?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, lots of history and facts, hard to read.","review":"This is a good book for information, but the story line is hard to follow - too many facts. Also, starts very detailed and then the end seems rushed through. It was very interesting to read, but it won't be one that I keep. Again, really good for facts about Russian history during this time and Russian royalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"When I saw this book at the bookstore I was quite anxious to read it. However, quite early on I found myself feeling although I was ready a cheap novel. A lot of the statements the author presents I have never heard of before. For example, the idea that Alexandra referred to her grandmother, Queen Victoria as \\"Gangan\\" was certainly new to me. There didn't seem to be a lot of hard facts. Instead, as I stated earlier, it simply read like a hastily written novel. While a suitable addition to the collection of any Romanov fan, I certainly would not regard it as a reliable source of information about this tragic woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute & durable!","review":"These scrubs are super cute and durable.

There is no denying that Walter is downright LOUD. As he tries really hard to master the skill of quiet, his big sis almost gives up. Will Walter ever learn? Donlon weaves her Tippee Toe tale softly, yet with a comic quality that makes it a great read aloud choice. Suhr's bright cartoon-like illustrations breathe life into this endearing brother-sister team. The book is accompanied by a music CD that contains the \\"Tiptoe\\" song, composed by Donlon and performed by herself and children. Be warned, the music is not for idle listeners!

I found him cocky and sure of himself, but wouldn't you have to be, to scam mobsters running casinos out of thousands of dollars? Soares justifies his cheating because these were the days when the casino was just as happy to cheat the customer if need be, before heavy gaming regulations. In fact, he started his life in the casinos as a crooked dealer, employed by the casino to bring down a player's winning streak if necessary.The tricks described herein relate to old reel-style machines and the days when you only had to fool the casino floorpeople, not the omnipresent \\"eye in the sky\\" video camera. Some of what Soares describes in his craps games could still be employed today, but it would be awfully risky.This is a fun read, and it might be embellished, but I enjoyed the glimpse inside a lifetime's worth of scams nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"baitmate indeed!","review":"as good as it gets! thats all i can say about it... i just receive it yesterday and today i try it in a spot i've been hitting for more than 10 years; always catch good catfishes but last night i caught 3 12+ pounders... coincidence... maybe, but as i said 10 years fishing the area and i had good 6 -7 pounders catfishes with straight bait and now those lunkers the first night i try the baitmate... i don't know... 10 years is quite some time!

It had a line \\" A mouse chawin' on the pantry door, when he gets thru he'll sure be sore, cause ther ain't a durn thing in ther.\\" A few years ago I tried to find it on the web, and only found references by other people who were also looking. A few weeks ago, I looked again, found that the composer and singer was Carson Robison, and discovered that a CD was just coming out featuring him and including my song. He is such an important early coutry/cowboy singer, I can't believe I never heard of him. I've never seen him included in any retropective of this music. Anyway, I love, love, love this CD, and enjoy so much hearing a favorite song of my youth. It has held up well thru the years. I enjoy it just as much now as I did then, and the knowledge of my years enriches it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"Just the motivation I need to make my runs and walks a little bit longer, a little bit faster.

I agree with other reviewer that gave 1 star that said this author just want the person to see a doctor and to call the few laboratories to ask what doctor can help me in my area. :/A big book with not good information. There are much better books than this one. I recommend better \\"The Yeast Syndrome\\" and \\"The Yeast Connection\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening reading","review":"Highly recommend this book for anyone struggling with a medical issue that conventional medical practice cannot get under control. Also, for people not taken seriously by their MDs this book can be a godsend. Those suffering from a variety of 'common' medical problems will benefit from reading this book as many symptoms not seen as related really are connected to a common cause.

This book really helped me to understand my body and get back to being healthy and feeling good again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best on the subject","review":"I would expect a book on Candida yeast to talk about the importance to probiotics. This book didn't even barely touch on the subject. There are things that people NEED to know (e.g. probiotics can help kill yeast, but can also make the problem worse initially due to the \\"die off effect\\").Also, I was trying to figure out if brewer's yeast is a problem with candida yeast, and only one place does it touch on it.

It does take more time to prepare the meals but the results will be worth it (lost 12 pounds in 1 week!). Miss some things (like coffee and wine) but will stick it out for 4 weeks. Wish us luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"tons of info, but very strict diet","review":"This book was written by knowledgable and caring authors and has tons of info, but the diet is so strict, i don't think I could follow it very well. Also the author(s) ban many foods just because they are common allergens. And they don't always specify why a food is being banned, whether because it encourages candida or if it is an allergen. If you have candida and lots of allergies, follow this book's diet. If you aren't an allergic person try a book such as \\"Back to Health\\" by Remington & Higa. Because this book doesn't have Candida or yeast in the title, many sufferers will miss it when doing searches. The \\"Back to Health\\" book has a liveable diet and it helped me years ago with my candida and I am about to do this program again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Top","review":"This book is in the catagory of information overload and treats Candida overgrowth in the same way as several other severe immunodeficient diseases are.

My taste in music has just gotten more and more exotic as time goes on, so this stuff fits my bill pretty dead-on. Here's where they come from, as I see it: where 'shoegazer' bands such as My Bloody Valentine use fairly traditional rock instrumentation, but with wildly processed and distorted guitar sounds and textures, llc takes just the textures and makes 'songs' out of them. Nothing else in the world sounds like they do. _Xuvetyn_ actually sounds more relaxed and serene to me than the more choppy _bloweyelashwish_, their previous release. There are so many beautiful, gorgeous pieces here, in such a unique and overwhelming brand of beauty. \\"blooded and blossom-blown\\", \\"flowered smother\\", and \\"ghosts that swirl\\" are absolutely breathtaking.

But this, their third album, reveals the quartet to be a band pushing the envelope of what a supposedly retro heavy rock band can do, not unlike Queens of the Stone Age. Sure, they can dig into a very Kyuss-like groove now and again (\\"Vipera Berus,\\" \\"K\\") but they're just as comfortable with acoustic psychedelia (\\"Aum\\") and even prog (\\"To Gloria,\\" \\"What Happened to Antioch?\\"). Guitarist Daniel Gustafsson is much more interested in feel and atmosphere than in fancy solos, though he can do that too; he also drops in mellotron and flute where he feels they're appropriate. Mammoth Volume doesn't beat the listener over the head with obvious riffs, but instead follows its own idiosyncratic path, trusting in the listener to follow.

It is extremely well put together, never had a problem with it. Every feature of this thing is beautiful save one, It didn't quite have enough volume for me. If you are playing for less then 200 people in a big room then this is fine volume wise, but it just doesn't have the power to match up against a Marshall half stack and a heavy handed drummer.On the other hand, if you are playing smaller shows; bars, coffee shops, churches, other small venues, look no further. This amp has excellent tone and if you need an amp to record with I would especially recommend this.Overall: Great amp all around, awesome tone and functions, a little weak on volume in loud situations.Solution if you still want this high quality product but need more volume, MAG 600 or ABM 575."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Body Comfrey & Fenugreek","review":"Excellent herbal formula for healing.

It has English subtitles with the original Japanese audio. Overall this is a pretty good anime series. The first 18 episodes are really well done but the pace seems to slow down after EP 18 and never really recover until the end. I would rate the first 18 EPs 4.5 to 5 stars. The story and character development are good and even sometimes quite touching. At times, I felt like watching an anime version of Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, after reaching the climax in EP18, it rushed to the end with a fairly predictable ending. I would rate EP19-26 good but not great. (3 stars) So overall I would give the seris 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"subtitled","review":"might be worth watching if they come ip with a dubbed version.

The story is great so far, but I have to give only 4 stars for two reasons. One is the artifacting on the solid colors throughout the animation. It usually isn't a big enough deal for me to write about it or give a lower rating, but it really shows on this particular blu-ray more than others I have watched recently. The only other thing that bugs me are the voice acting with face Irish accents. Words are not pronounced the same way consistently and it gets a little annoying. Both of those are minor complaints and nothing that would keep me from purchasing it had I known about them beforehand. I think regular accents would have been just fine since the story can hold its own and all of the non-accented voices are fine. If you like good characters and a good story, pick it up.

Loretta Young's acting is pretty good but Cary Grant is kind of dull - definitely not his best role. Some of the pre-code plot elements in this film include Loretta Young's unspecified \\"profession\\" and lifestyle that involves men and clothes and some of the rather risque shots of Loretta in her underwear. I think the release of this pre-code movie, which was previously unavailable, is to be applauded."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have kept this one on the vault shelf.....","review":"Someone should educate 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment about classic movies.

And this choir is unacceptable in this recording. I know that also a provincial theatre can bring splendid performances.

It was one of many that I could have chosen for this purpose, but I chose it because it appeared that it could illuminate in detail an area of Photoshop that I was interested in exploring in greater depth than I had previously been able to do. In general, I am satisfied with my choice, although there were some areas where I would have liked greater detail and explanation. This book is not for a newbie to Photoshop. It assumes a reasonable degree of familiarity with the program, and simply proceeds, without fanfare, to describe how to use the many filters and their settings. I recommend this book for a reasonably competent Photoshop user who wants to continue to increase his/her mastery over this wonderful and hugely flexible program."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Every Photoshop User","review":"For anyone who uses Photoshop in graphic design and or to correct or edit their precious photos, this book is a must have in your library of reference materials.

This is one fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having the best of filters","review":"As all the collection of this books it is good to have this in your personal library to check out how filters work with different kind of pictures, of coarse these books are directed to professional photos, but you can maybe experiment with your personal as well, I just wanted to point that out because in the book the examples given are for applying filters to pictures you maybe wanna show or give to a client.But as a reference book is just great, I mean someone took the time to write and visually show you all the filters in photoshop and as its name it is a real encyclopedia, where you can look every filter how is going to look like and then decide.Buy this it will always be useful"},{"rating":"1","title":"She should be ashamed of herself","review":"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. This \\"mother\\" should be ashamed of herself. So she didn't like being pregnant, so what. I saw her interviewed on a televisions how and she was saying how she hated being pregnant because she couldn't go out anymore and got fat and that \\"soon after\\" giving birth she started going out again to try to get her old life back. News flash, you'll never have your old life back, you're a mother now. Why have a baby (even if it was an accident) if you're just going to keep going out and get a nanny to watch the baby? How about talking about the joys your new baby has brought you? Has your new baby brought you no joy? What's the point of scaring other first time moms with your nonsense about how horrible it was being pregnant, but giving no real reasons why other than you got fat. WAH WAH WAH!

Her book may be considered funny by some, but I found it to be the ultimate in what our society has become. SELFISH! Her baby is nothing more than an inconvenience to her life. She even scheduled a C-Section for her delivery...not because of medical reasons, but because of HER SCHEDULE!

As a new mother, reading her newspaper column regarding pregnancy made me so incredulous that someone could actually be so unrealistic and lacking in any maternal fibre that I cancelled my subscription. This woman cannot write. She is incredibly vain, shallow and selfish to the point that she requires therapy (and not the retail kind). A total waste of time and money. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be less offensive if it was fiction...","review":"I think the amount of one-star reviews speak for themselves, but I wanted to address those leaving comments on one-star reviews saying, \\"come on, it's just satire! have a laugh!\\"If this were a fictitious novel, I would still be appalled and annoyed by this book, but I wouldn't feel absolutely disgusted. However, THIS IS NOT FICTION! This is a true story. It's a memoir of sorts. A true story about a pregnant woman who smokes and drinks. This isn't funny.

Call me old fashioned, but I'm not laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"This book is so awful. I seriously think the good reviews on here are written by the author's friends. The best comparison I can make is this must be what Britney Spears is like pregnant.

I have not been more sorry to have spent money on anything in a VERY long time. Had this book been fiction (as I orginally thought) it may have had some redeeming qualities. The fact that it is reality is abominable. To read about someone knowingly harming their unborn child in such blatant ways is terrible. I agree that no one should support this woman and feed into her vanity.

Whatever!! I am trying to conceive and I was looking for a feel good funny book about being pregnant--this is not it. This woman is so selfish and I cannot stand it. Throughout the whole book it was all about vanity instead of the joy of welcoming a new life into the world. If you are that kind of person, then this is your book. It is not a good book for those of us who view pregnancy and parenting as a gift and a privelage."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a funny book","review":"The author is definitely presenting a self absorbed picture of herself during her pregnancy, but that's what makes it hilarious. She is admitting to all of the insecurities and crazy urges that many of us have. Every pregnancy book doesn't have to be about people who are perfect and never do anything totally selfish or insane.

I'm also a new mother so I thought this might be timely and interesting. I could not be more wrong. Yes, Ms. Eckler can write, no doubt about that. But the reason I found this book a waste of time and money was that the main character (her) is a person who is vain, selfish and shallow. I think we are supposed to like and be sympathetic with her but by the end of the book I detested her. This is not a person I would want to be friends with. One thing is very clear - the size of her behind is more important to her than her child. Her Fiance, family, Cute single guy,her friends, nanny and night nurse exist only to serve her needs. Don't buy this book and stroke her ego and make it any larger than it is. I never write reviews but in this case I felt compelled to not let anyone waste their money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'll admit I laughed at one or two parts of this book but honestly it sucked.

After reading this book, you will be reassured that you cannot possibly be worse than her!

This woman clearly thinks she's Carrie from Sex and the City, and the book is about the equivalent of what would happen if this character got pregnant. Mr. Big, dubbed \\"the fiance\\" is all the father of her child is referred to as through the entire book.I spent most of the book wishing I could just punch this woman in the face.If you are looking for someone to relate to in a similar situation, i highly doubt this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!!","review":"I would also rate with less than one star.

Video quality is excellent, which is an iron-clad rule for ADV, and I hope that they will release the rest of the 52 episodes of this outstanding anime series before too long, as it is highly addictive, even to a 50-year-old guy who mostly likes Horror and Sci Fi titles...buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Gigster at his Finest","review":"What a thrill ride!

But they actually don't even try you will end up hating yourself if before you even finish watching. Personally myself i couldn't go thru the last cd the storyline was not intresting whatsoever. If you actually looking for kid's anime this might be it. Wait let me rephrase that if you looking for stupid anime that your kids may hate you for you might want to get this one. Even if you just curiously bored don't do it thats what i did. It made me not to be curious no more. If your looking for pointless anime i would suggest Azumanga diaoh or Ranma 1/2.

I even ordered it early, to get it as soon as it was released. The story starts off being readable and interesting, with quite a few sensual moments, but the ending is a huge let-down. It also does not have the usual images I've come to expect from a Bantock book. Some of them felt recycled from previous works and none of them had much to do with the story. They just sort of made the pages pretty, if you can even claim that. I'd much rather read The Venetian's Wife for the fifth time, than read this one (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"something different","review":"This is a departure from Nick Bantock's previous published work, in that the incredible images are drawn with words with only an intimation of artwork here. All the mystery and attention to detail is still present though, and the story has a different kind of depth and complexity, one that draws the reader in and evokes its pictures in the consciousness of the reader as the words unfold. This is a very lush, haunting, gorgeous story, a kind of hero's (heroine's) journey, beautifully written and quite inspiring. I do love Nick Bantock's artwork, and I also love his storytelling. This book shifts the balance toward the storytelling aspect and does so beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!!","review":"From the description of Windflower, I expected the same lush illustrations that we have come to expect from Nick Bantock. It said that there were 200 illustrations--what a misrepresentation. Anyone expecting to see Bantock's beautiful artwork will be hugely disappointed.The artwork is nothing of interest, and a lot of repeats. Instead we have a convoluted story, which I did not enjoy.

It is the second instalment from the seven very descriptive, interesting, adventureous, and action packed books that Emily Rodda has written. The book is about Leif, Barda and Jasmine and their very important mission to find the jewels scattered and stolen from the Belt of Deltora. In this book they look for the Ruby, which takes them through The Lake of Tears where dangerous monsters are as common as mice are, one of the monsters is the extreamly hideous Soldeen, it is a fish that can move out of water and also in water.

I urge you to buy it, and you'll see why Emily Rodda's my favoite author. So just buy it or read it if you already have the book. (I ther was a ten stars raiting, I'd pick it!)This should be every Deltorea Quest fan's favorite book, so I guess you can tell that I'm a Deltora Quest fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good story","review":"\\"Forests of Silence\\" was good enough to read more, and I am glad I did. There was enough good and evil battles, and those that had suffered from the evil that has befallen the land of Deltora were freed. So many in this book, that it boggled the mind how strong a hold the evil forces had in Deltora, and how strong only part of the magical Belt of Deltora can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Rip Off!","review":"Nathan East is an amazing bass player but I'm sorry to say this DVD is just one big commercial for his products.The interviews are really basic and hardly go into detail and the exercises he shows you are basic at best.It just doesn't live up to the professional level of video that it's cracked up to be.I honestly laughed during the interview he does with this blonde woman.She obviously knows close to nothingabout music and the questions she asks are pretty lame.The advertisement (oopse I mean interview) for his signature brand pre amp or whatever was also another comical highlight.\\"So basically it's like having your fingers in a box right?\\"don't buy this DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"NATHAN EAST: TThe Business of Bass","review":"This DVD never arrived from MusicMars.

They shipped a Nokia charger instead. Nice but useless. When I tried to straighten out, they insisted I ordered the wrong product. They would have a more convincing argument if Amazon prevented me from looking at my order. Amazon does and I verified I ordered the right product. Customer Service of Accessoryone was rude. After a couple of unpleasant exchanges, they did offer to refund the price I paid for the product. No offer to refund shipping or send the correct product.

Crisp clear LCD screen great picture quality, and stacks of built in RAM, with FLASHCARD slot for up to 64mb of picture space. The only downside I would say is the Macro lens button, a little flimsy, but the good far outweighs the bad in this excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This jacket comes with the hood. I didn't know this at the time and purchased a separate mesh hood. My brother summer garden is under very tall pine / oak trees and he is bothered by insects in the evening as he works in it. He was reduced to either applying insecticides to his skin, or wearing long sleeves in the heat, for years. I was happy to find this product for him to use instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"works for me!","review":"I'm a beekeeper and use this bug jacket instead of the hot heavy \\"spaceman suit\\". It provides ventilated loose protection as well as being much more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coghlan's Bug Jacket","review":"I am a mosquito and insect magnet and this jacket does what it is designed to do. I bought it for bird watching out in the forest and I did not get bitten. However, if you carry a backpack while wearing the jacket and the fabric becomes taut around the shoulder area you could get bit in that area -- as I did. Solution: avoid the backpack if possible. I even wear it when I mow the grass or do yard work and it works. The draw strings around the wrists and waist are also good features. I would recommend the bug jacket to anyone who does not like the discomfort of bug bites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Product!","review":"I am in the Adirondack mountains for most of black fly season and this bug jacket makes life bearable. It keeps out bloodthirsty insects and allows me to move about with comfort and ease. This product works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay product, but Amazon Shipping was much less than satisfactory","review":"Product works, but is weak at seams and zipper. Much more aggravating is that it failed to ship on time, did not arrive on time and we still ended up paying for next day shipping. Amazon really dropped the ball on this. Better off ordering from Bass Pro or similar source. Stay away from the Mom and Pop's you'll find at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I work out in the wilderness where the mosquito\`s are as large as birds.

Not my idea of cool stuff this fellow produced but I'm sure someone somewhere likes it... It's back up for sale on Amazon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tracks but rough in some spots...","review":"It seems that Sander's mixing is consistent with his NuBreed compliation- I was thoroughly blown away by NuBreed's first disc, with its fluid mixing and impecable track selection. Disc two however left much to be desired. The same can be said about Everybody as some moments are sheer brilliance while others seem mediocre. For instance, the second disc is mixed brilliantly mixed up until My Memory, which is an outstanding record but loses some of its luster after an unimpressive mix out of Therapy. Also, 2 Bags of Grass seems tacked on and out of place on the disc. Overall this is a phenomenal CD that really highlights his talent as a DJ and producer, despite the rough patches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Everybody...","review":"I am a huge fan of Sander's other works, but I was sorelydisappointed by this album. It pales in comparison tohis Essential Mix, as well as the Nu Breed release.This album seems to be a departure from the dreamy tranceand the tribal rhythm heard on previous offerings.It's almost as if Sander is trying to branch out toaccommodate a more American-styled fan base -- and, ironically,I say this as an American fan.Well, that said, this album is not awful. Just didn'tdo it for me. I am sure that somebody will love everytrack on this album, just not Everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the listen","review":"No, it's not quite as good as the essential mix, which is among my all-time favorite CDs. Nevertheless this is a great compliation effort, and exceedingly well mixed.As the other reviews have said, the first CD is nothing overly special, mostly some basic house tracks. It's the second CD that really hooked me, with deeper sounds and bass. The last couple of reviews have accurately described the sound, so I won't repeat it. The bottom line with this CD is this: no, it's not destined to be an essential \\"must have.\\" BUT it's still an excellent compilation that you will listen to if you like good electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix CD of the Year?","review":"I vote for it. So good. Fun, funky, then dark & banging. I've come to expect a lot from Sander, and this mix delivers. Just get it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful...","review":"I'd list my favorite tracks, but they already have the tracklist posted. This mix is THE best mix I've heard in almost 2 years. Beats Nick Warren's Reykjavik by a mile, it leaves Eargasm in the dust, makes Deep Dish's Toronto pale in comparison, puts Addictive Beats to shame, and blows Great Wall out of the water. The mixing in unreproachable, leaving nothing to be desired. All the tracks fit together perfectly, creating one of the best moods I have heard on any CD, including Sander's earlier mixes. I just started listening it to the second time as I write this, so it's all fresh in my head, and I think I'll listen to it a third time if my CD player batteries don't die on me.Bottom line, if this CD was any better, they couldn't sell it on earth, they'd just have to give you your copy at the pearly gates...and that's the only CD you'd need for the rest of eternity up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"great progessive concept","review":"sander kleinenberg present a great progressive house copilation........... thrive records is the worst thing.. the presentation in images quality, paper, print and packaging is very very very bad bad bad this situation makes lose the concept in design and artwork .......... terrible thrive, this are not seriously company"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as his previous two","review":"Nu breed was good, then came essential mix which was even better but the chosen tracks I felt were a somewhat boring on this compilation. Like stated above disc two is probably the best. A few good tracks here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Europeans try to mimic Hollywood","review":"This is an example of what happens when European filmmakers try to mimic an American family movie. The problem is they are so steeped in the European film tradition that they don't know the difference. They make a film centered around children, but they adopt their usual slo-o-ow pace, have no plot at all, and make a film in which there is nothing of consequence at stake and in which the only things that happen are trivial. Even the ghosts are neutralized within the first few minutes, since the little girl makes friends with them and they are merely boring thereafter as they dance and sing choral songs. Also, the movie is only 80 minutes long instead of the cannonical 96 minutes.If you're a screenwriter, you might study this as an example of how NOT to make a children's movie, or a family movie, or indeed any movie.Rates two stars for the good filming of scenes of Austria.Not worth even one viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"I thought this book provides a lot of handy information without having to carry around smaller texts with less explanations or larger heavier texts with too much info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date","review":"Copyright 1998.

Not a good accountant's reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided misconceptions","review":"Despite the growing need for flexible overviews of this part of the world, and, taking into account that the editor is an accomplished writer, this volume does not fill the need for even an undergraduate readership (let alone tourists!). It's poorly compiled and suffers from what must have been \\"old buddies\\" wanting in. A case in point is Trankell's paper. I've read it through twice and although I've spent two years of field work in the area (Trankell claims to have spent two weeks) I can't recognize any of the \\"data\\" she draws on to support point that escapes any sound mind. His paper is not the only bad one, but it does reflect badly on the entire composition of the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"I agree with the comments here- it's just physically hard to read and I had to move to better light and lay it down on a desk to get into it. I don't know what kind of writing would make that worth reading, but this is definitely not it. I read a couple of OK stories, then I decided to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very steamy","review":"A disappointment - not very steamy or interesting, and hard to hold and read. Most of the stories read like a writing class assignment to \\"Write about water, and try to make it sexy\\".

And when it finally came in the mail, I hurriedly opened the package, ran some water and dropped the book in the tub. Wow, it really is waterproof. Then I locked the door, poured in some bubbles and salts and got ready for what I thought would be sheer heaven in a book. The stories weren't as good as I hoped. But it was waterproof. I tried to get my Boyfriend to jump in the tub and share in the good times but the stories bored him. If it wasn't waterproof, it wouldn't have got a four. But i am so sick of dropping paperbacks in the tub, this remedies the problem. I see they have a second edition out, I'm hesitant to buy it. I'm also weak willed, so i probably will.

I couldn't resist the idea! But then I got home, stepped into a soothing bath and felt sick. The writing was soooo bad.

Aqua Erotica provides ample support for a contrary opinion. As a collection of short stories, there is quite possibly something for everyone. Some stories are more explicit than others, and some are more \\"hard core.\\" The stories are well-written, with well-drawn characters that readers can care about and identify with, real people with thoughts and feelings and not just sacks of overactive hormones. Some stories may shock or be a little tough to take, but shed a few inhibitions, and appreciate the storytelling for more than its erotic themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky & dull","review":"Stories you can't remember 10 minutes after you read them, which might by ok if they were sexy, but they're not.

A disappointment after the long wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Basically a little bit of story around graphic sex. If you've ever cybered before this isn't much better. The stories were mostly boring and were based on the subjects of adultery, group sex, gay sex, lesbianism, and a little torture thrown in for good measure.

This CD is short at just 6 tracks (including a remix of \\"Simple Man\\") but showcases the bands' musicianship and ability.

Overall, we enjoyed reading this book and looking at all the different recipes they offered. One of the first recipes in the book is for a country pate (which they extoll as being the greatest thing since sliced bread), and if you're into pate, it actually sounds quite tasty. Our BIGGEST concern with this recipe is that they sort of forget to tell you how much chicken liver you need to use for this recipe (although they are very specific about all the other ingredients). Sort of makes us worry about what's missing in the rest of the book. Other than that, it's a pretty neat reference. p.s. If anyone gets this book and figures out what the amount is, please let us know. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"a delicate, insightful read","review":"What I liked about this book was the insight into the heart of a faithful Catholic girl and her extended family and friends. Her thoughts and her prayers are delicately imagined. I'm not a Catholic so that view of the daily influence of religion and faith in a Massachusetts milltown after WWII was interesting. It was gripping to see the effect of large institutions of church, family, and war on average people in the mid-1940's. The effect of war on veterans and their families was especially poignant. It's a coming of age story of a courageous, beautiful girl.

Sure the Canon has slightly sharper pictures but is terrible in low light. The Kodak 4530 takes great pics under almost any conditions, simple to operate and I took it out of the drawer and am delighted to return to this terrific camera. Highly recommended for anyone and at a great price if you can still find one. My Canon A95 will just rot away in the drawer, I guess. My next camera will be a kodak, I'm pretty sure. PS I shake a lot when I take pics so I always use the \\"sport\\" mode for a faster shutter speed. Majority of pics are great and I can see the quality of the shot in the LCD. My Canon had an artificially enhanced LCD that makes every shot look good, so you have no idea if your shot was good or bad.

I must admit, I am an amatuer photographer and only use it for vacations, special occasions and my 3-year-old nephew but so far my pics have turned out great.This camera is extremely easy to use. I never even had to open the manual and was taking pictures immediately! The software is a breeze and I am very pleased with this camera over all.I will say the lens cap is a pain in the butt and Kodak should have made an automatic. The only other thing negative I have to say is that the green light is right by the viewfinder so its hard to see when taking picutres in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I purchased the dx4530 after reading review and research. It takes great pictures,if you have good light. In low light and what I would not consider low light the pictures are dark even with the flash. Took pictures at a wedding and all were too dark. You can with the software make them look alitte better but who wants to do that to every picture. It does have a low light setting but you have to hold very still and nothing can move in the picture or it will all be a blurr. I have kids so holding still is not an option for them. Kodak told me to use a tripod and low light setting, but you then have to carry that around.

This camera can be used right out of the box, with plainly labeled buttons and knobs. But I tried all the features too, like zoom, no flash, night photography, close-ups, mixed lighting. My results show that this camera has the right mix of technology and ease of use. The software to bring the pictures to my Mac was also simple. The video recording capability was fairly good - not tape quality but lots of fun. Be sure to buy a 256MB memory card to supplement the 32 MB installed. I can take 500 good quality photos with the one chip. My 8x10 prints were super! Let this be your next camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy!","review":"Before buying my digital camera, I did tons of research. I wanted an easy to use camera, easy to use software, without breaking the bank. My Kodak DX4530 did not disappoint me. I've had the camera for 3 months now and it's taken great pictures. It's so easy to use, my 12 yr.old uses it all the time. The one button delete and review is great. The software does an excellent job enhancing the photos and taking out red eye. All you do is plug it into your computer and the software quickly downloads all my photos. It doesn't get any easier than this Kodak! And with the one touch printing, it produces beautiful, detailed colored photos, using Kodak's Premium photo paper. If you want a camera that takes great photos, without having to be a technology wizard to operate; this camera's for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best point & shoot camera ever","review":"I have had one of these cameras for years and will put the picture quality up against my professional digital camera any day. For a point and shoot, I have never found one easier to use or that takes better images. After years of bumping around in soccer bags, pocket books, etc, mine finally lost the shutter motor. I have ordered another as a used model from Amazon and can't wait to continue taking quick and easy shots. If you can find one of these, get it.

However, knowing what I know now I would never buy another Kodak camera. Ever. I dropped the camera, and a little plastic piece broke off which keeps the battery pack in the camera. Not a big deal. But NOONE repairs Kodak cameras. Instead you HAVE to send it into their corporate repair center and they instead sell you on trading it in for a refurbished camera. So, I can send this one in and for $250 get a new refurbished camera. Whooppe! But it only sells for $50 more on amazon.com - and thats a new, non-refurbished one! Its a total crock. Just be forwarned.

But the evening pics are just disgusting, and dont even talk about the night pics, flash is useless if the subject is more than 15 feet away.My biggest problem is that this camera gives very very blurry pics if it is shaken even very slightly duing the pic. Sometimes it is blurry, and sometimes it is not.Easy of usability: Great.Internal memory: Great (32MB).Pixels 5MB: Great.Price: Great.But it cannot take great pics, why bother with all the other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the camera","review":"I found the camera so easy to use.

I agree. They are easy to use for everyone. This one was $279.99 when I purchased it and I couldn't be happier. It is quick, has great quality and I LOVE the features.

I sell items on ebay and the pictures I attempted to take of anything red came out very blurry. I read the entire manual and tried every combination of settings to try to improve the picture quality. The night vision also produces extremely blurry images. It is easy to use, and the software is easy, I liked the camera dock, but if you want good quality pictures, don't go with this camera.

SNK 2.Capcom fighting evolution is 10 times better than this.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"All I have to say is that this item is perfect.

Thought I'd take a chance on some Wigwam cotton and or synthetic socks for an option. These Volley socks, for me, are too elastic and binding on my leg (they compress and stay up well, I'm sure) but, at the end of the day, when I take my socks off, I don't want to see a circumferential ring of restricted circulation on my leg. So I'll stick with the Wigwam Wool Husky Athletic crew socks which are the best fitting socks that I have found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Socks","review":"I bought these for a hiking excursion and they didn't disappoint.

When I got them I discovered that an adhesive price sticker, apparently applied by Penguin, was on the back cover of each volume. Despite my efforts to carefully remove the sticker, some of the heat-stamped design lifted up with it in every case, some worse than others, but in all cases ruining the design. I contacted Penguin and I hope they have since rectified this problem, but please be forewarned. I ended up returning every volume to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Presentation, but prose? Really?","review":"If you're going for appearance, you might enjoy this version of Homer's Odyssey. However, if you're looking for a verse translation or value fidelity to the original work at all, this is probably not your first choice. Like many classics, the modern variation has been altered for easier consumption. This isn't always a good thing.I personally would suggest Lattimore's translation. There's a copy out which is equally pretty, but remarkably true to its source. It was first recommended to me by a Classics Professor at UC Berkeley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really awesome content, horrible Amazon service","review":"I've used the print editions of these titles at UCLA for my history and religious studies courses, and have always loved their depth of analysis and breadth of subject.

I heartily recommend IVP's Essential Reference Collection.On the other hand, I am immensely pissed at Amazon.com. They say it normally can be shipped within a few days, yet here I am (Jan 23, 2005) still waiting for them to even begin shipping it, when I ordered the software on December 9, 2004. That's ridiculous, and more than a little misleading, If I knew it would take more than 2 months to receive it, I'd suck up the extra costs and buy it from other Christian or internet distributors. So, again I recommend getting this software.

I don't think they really do anything. I could wipe the dog down with a wet paper towel and get the same results. The wipes are not that saturated to start with. I use clorox wipes all the time (not on the dog-just in general) and would have thought that they would have been just as wet but they are not--even huggies diaper wipes are wetter than these. So that is why I think these are not that effective.I use other nature's miracle products such as the stain and odor removal regularly and when I saw this I thought this would be great for getting the dirt of the dogs paws before I let her into the living room, and these can't even do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough and non-absorbent material","review":"The wipes are small, rough, and not absorbent. My impression of the material is that it felt like fabric softener sheets with a minor coat of Natural's miracle solution. When I wiped my dog's paws, it is mostly just wiping the dirt onto my floor/carpet.

While I'm wiping a paw or belly the dirt being removed falls from the wipe and onto the floor. I think I would have better luck just using a wet paper towel.

The budget's all there, but the plot is really dull - a group of teen vampires is sent to an exclusive school so that they can learn how to 'blend-in' with human society - to stop feeding frenzies so that they don't get caught - so because of this there's very little vampire action - aside from a couple of times they face off against each other baring their fangs.If you're after a film about vampires being vampires - this is not it.

Water escapes from it only by evaporation.

They are never afraid to experiment with different genres, often creating eclectic mixtures of avantgard, neoclassical, EBM, darkwave, ethereal... Originally released in 1991 on Relic this CD is still very much listenable and enjoyable in Y2K. Most of it is rather intense, dancy and dark (\\"Thin Red Line\\", \\"Scenario\\", \\"Right Hand Man\\") and then there's slower and more melodic stuff like \\"A girl called Harmony\\" or \\"Legitimate Sin\\".

Unfortunately, after just a couple of months, the enamel coating began to chip off--first along the bottom, then along the top edges. Which of course lets water in to rust the base metal.The round holes in the colander are slightly too big, so spaghetti can slide right out.Also, the 1.5-quart size is just a tad too small for, say, a bunch of greens or a pound of pasta.Good thing I didn't throw out or old workhorse, not-a-pretty-color colander!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding soundtrack","review":"Went to see the movie a couple of days ago and although, have to say, I am huge fan of actor Leo Di Caprio, I was really moved bu the film in itself. More than 2 hours of action, emotion, real-african-life-story, reality with a superb cast of interpreters (welcome back Jennifer Connelly!).But...what really kept me on the movie was the soundtrack! Composer Horner made a superb and brilliant work starting from the never-annoying lines of the title track...the score is excellent and really retrieves the essence of the movie. Well done! Haunting music when needed, action-music in some tracks (the Attack track is amazing). It really deserves more than a listening. Excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the movie?

Berlitz has some of the best teaching guides and they have some of the rest. This travel pack appears to cover some important language situations, but it does not do a good job. A traveler in Greece first needs to conquer the alphabet, and pronounce Greek letters properly. Those of us who learned our Greek pronounciations in an American college fraternity will be shocked to learn the Greeks do not say Beta, they say Veeta, and Phi is pronounced Fee, and so on. Secondly a visitor to Greece should learn how to read the Greek alphabet, so when you see a sign in Greek, or read something (a menu) in Greek, you could begin to translate.They could reduce the number of expressions and variations on the same message and do it more thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"This hat is not designed to look like you expect a baseball cap to look when you wear it.

This movie just drags on, and you tend to loose concentration in it. I'm sad to say, but I didn't even finish watching it. I've never done that with a Cary Grant movie before this one.Cary Grant is probably one of my all-time favorite actors...but this movie is just BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss them off","review":"I make it a habit to check out Cary Grant movies but the more I see the lesser known movies, the more I realize that Grant was a single-facetted actor. Mind you, that cool, suave delivery of his is a real show-stopper but the two or three dramatic (not romantic) scenes in \\"Kiss them for Me\\" were embarassingly forced indignation. I admit that when I read the plot before I saw the movie, I couldn't envision Cary Grant as part of a threesome that puts on a wild four-day party. And he didn't fit the role as he sort of wandered in and out of the hijinks. It may have been good acting to appear oblivious of the ever-present Jayne Mansfield but the suave act was out of place with most of this script.I'll still give Grant a chance to show his unique talent. However, the recent viewings of \\"Houseboat\\", \\"Walk, Don't Run\\", \\"Kiss Them for Me\\" and a couple other turkeys have shown me that his later years were spent making a lot of movies that he shouldn't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper than Ambien as a sleeping aid.....","review":"In his later years, Cary Grant wasn't so picky about what films he did, as long as the paycheck was there. This bomb is one reminder of Grant's many mis-fires, and one that will surely put you to sleep while watching it, as it is quite dull and boring. Although certain viewers can enjoy moments here to admire the physical attributes of Jayne Mansfield, most people will be downright bored by this dull movie. It was a failure when released to theaters, and remains so now.A DUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received My Product!","review":"Never received this product. please contact me to get this resolved.

This one was excellent for many weeks. Lots of nights staying up late until my back ached too much to continue. The puzzle is big. Too big for any roll-away puzzle carrier I've seen. I used six pieces of 1/4 inch wood, both so that I could put it away each night, and so that I could hang a couple inches off my table.

A guy gets kicked in the face and does a triple-whirl in the air before falling to the ground. The plot makes James Bond look intelligent and the action scenes are completely chaotic. I suppose the film's one saving grace is that it's much better than the first. A group of U.S. Seals (not Navy SEALS) is sent to an island to stop a megalomaniac from firing a missile. There is tons of violence that never stops to take a breath of air. The fight scenes, though well done, are completely ludicrous and highly unbelievable. It steps down into kung-fu territory, but still wants the viewer to believe it's an intelligent, Clancy-like thriller. It's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T SEE IT!!!!!","review":"(...) why this movie was made i dont know, but the man who was responsible for it should be considered a criminal. i only rented it because there were two rowes of it gone and only one left, only god knows why. and it was the worst 40 minutes ever, i couldnt make ot through any more than that. bottom line, dont see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This movie did have good action sequences, however it had almost nothing to do with Navy SEALs except for the fact that 2 SEALs (one who turned against the US) fought each other.If you just want to see action, then this still isn't a great choice but it does have a few good fight scenes.

I was surprised to find that these guys produced a pretty solid album. No question, they play loud and use a lot of percussion, but seem comfortable with a number of musical genres, including blues, ballads and of course, kick-ass rock.

From there it does it job smoothly and without a hitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"This game's graphics are quite good, and the action taking place on a rolling, wind & ocean swept freighter is novel. However, this game is completely ruined by the inability to move your character around via the mouse (you have to use the keyboard!) -- which means your character is moving around as if he were a main battle tank. And most of the action takes place in third person viewpoint, along with a moving camera at your back or your side. Painfully annoying!There are also no maps in the game, so expect to re-tread old ground a lot.You cannot save the game when and where you want -- and there are only so many save slots when you are actually permitted to save.The game is rather short, but you won't really care about that, because most people will not even wish to finish Cold Fear.This is one of those very poor ports from a game console, where the developers didn't care to get it right for the PC. They just didn't care at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your own opinion and play it.","review":"I played this game last year. This game in my opinion is very good. It has some of the old school gaming experience. Young people or people new in gaming may not enjoy it. I see complains about controls but this is nothing compared when games were all about keyboard. As most of the old games, stereoscopic compatibilty is extreamly good. I was shocked to see that also graphics and shaders were very good for an old game. The game is scary enough to keep you hooked and the difficulty present a good challenge for you to keep going to the end. I did not try eyefinity because I was so exicted about 3d that I completed the game with one monitor on stereoscopic mode. Good sound and music, decent voice acting, story is good. I hope you can enjoy it more than some of the reviewers. This is game is more worthy than its price ( I think that I got it for about $1.

I co-authored a real tourist-in-the-Yucatán book, the \\"Adventure Guide to the Yucatán.\\" It was fun to read about the locations that I know so well, through someone else's eyes. The fast paced plot whirls around the ancient Maya ruins and colonial Spanish cities on a peninsula that is a fabulous vacation destination. In fact the whole story begins on a trip to the ruins of Chichén Itzá.

Enjoyable, page turning excitement. Set on Mexico's Yukatan penninsula. This adventure novel keeps you interested until the end. The author obviosly has a great knowledge of the ancient Mayan culture and the geography that he describes so well. A quick plot with great characters, steamy sex and enough violence to keep you wondering \\"who done it?\\" Read it on the beach or warm up with it by the fire at the ski lodge, but read it! The only flaw the book carries are the errors in grammer and spelling, but don't let that keep you from buying the book and sharing the adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"I read all of the reviews of this book today, and I have some comments. I've read this book, and found it to be an interesting story line. I liked the Mayan connection, the artifacts, descriptions of mayan art & history, and the complex plot involving the U. S. Government. All of this required the author to do some work to bring it all together. I read a lot and can attest to the fact that there are many errors in grammar, spelling,& wrong word usage in all kinds of books today. Computers are wonderful, but If you have ever used a spell checker or a grammar program, you know what I mean. This book would have benefited by more editing, no doubt, but I think some of the complaints are sour grapes.

In their former incarnation they were a powerfully compelling and deeply spiritual gothic neo-pagan band which managed to transcend genre conventions. However on this release they fell victim to those conventions in a major way. Goth cliches come out of the woodwork (\\"The darkness in me is the darkness in you\\"? Give me a break!) as they abandoned precisely those elements which made their debut so special. I would pass on this unless you really love your goth laid on thick, and instead try to find their debut-if you can. Or try _Healingbow_ for an example of what kind of band they once were (tho this EP isn't half as good as _Gateway_...).John DiFool"},{"rating":"2","title":"psychodelic love songs","review":"To anyone thinking of buying this cd-do it! Fire and Rain by Eden contains some of the most perfect atmospheres. Tracks such as \\"darkness in me\\" have an acoustic edge, while songs like \\"hooveless horses\\" create an ambient suspension of pure lovelorn bliss. There are also exotic instumentals on this cd. The voice of Sean Bowley is powerful and conveys the themes perfectly. Fire and Rain is a ribbon that threads love, psychodelia, sensuality, and the evening sky. I anticipate a follow up release with enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 1/35 scale...Seller needs to pay attention","review":"This is advertised as 1/35 scale but it isn't even as large as 1/72.

These 20 stories give a perfect reflection of the classic detective noir genre that Hammett gives life to.What happens when the only choices to be made do not follow a moral path but are the choices made \\"between a rock and a hard place\\"? Hammett is what happens! His men are rough, tough and unyielding. His women are cold and calculating with no qualms about tears being shed to accomplish their desires. The dialogue is succinct. The brevity and clarity of each phrase are the hallmark of Hammett's work.The last tale, The Original Thin Man is the precursor to his novel The Thin Man which was made into a film that while following his basic work added a touch of levity with the stars William Powell and Myrna Loy.Hammett is the quintessential author of the classic detective story."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are back on top again Lanny","review":"Thanks Lanny, purchased this book for the grand children and they love it.

Stick with name brands when it comes to cameras like Olympus, Canon, Panasonic, Nikon, and Sony.

I actually bought it for my girlfriend, but have found myself toying around with it more than her!First of all, the Vivcam 3935 is extremely easy to operate. It's one of those cameras that you can pretty much pull out of the box, and effectively take photos right off the bat. A few pages of reading in the manual will turn you on to its other features, such as video recording, voice recording, and so on....This little beauty looks very nice, takes very high quality pictures, and it's very simple to upload the pictures to your PC. The only thing that I would consider complaining about would be the battery life. It seems to suck the batteries down but like most of you I am use to that by now from other devices. On the other hand, with quality like this, it's worth the trade-off.Overall I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who needs a high quality, yet affordable digital camera from a trusted name brand. Happy picture taking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries, totally unreliable in cool temperatures, does not save date.","review":"This little camera does fine in warm/hot temperatures and has great picture quality, but runs through batteries at an unbelievable pace. Also, you're lucky if you can get 3 or more pictures if the ambient temperature is below 40 degrees. Another annoying feature that I wish I had known about is that there is no memory battery, meaning that everytime you change the main batteries (which is quite frequently) the camera totally resets and you have to set the date all over again. This is a pain. All that being said, I took this camera on a trip to Taiwan recently and I was very pleased with the pictures it produced. It's not the best, and could be improved in several ways, but it's not the worst 5MP camera out there either, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to have it but there were pixelated problems on a number of discs","review":"What can I say- they don't air Dallas on tv anymore and I'm glad to have this.

Miles was joined by his then, classic quintet: John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.

Because it has 2 parts, one using small hand weights and the other using the stability ball and hand weights, I can split it into two 20 minute workouts if necessary.

If you are a beginner this is probably a better workout video for you. As for intermediate and advanced people I would not buy this video. It is way to slow and rather boring. I had no problem with denise's voice or attitude though so i don't know why people complain about that. Hope this is helpful :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"shrink your baby fat zones","review":"I used this video to lose weight after having my daughter. I am a single mom without much time for going to the gym. This video was perfect. It was simple and great for being a beginner. It did not take much time out of my day, and I was able to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight in no time (even a few pounds less)! I definitely recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"great addition to your excercise dvd collection","review":"Another great tape of Denise Austins! This video can be added to your regular workout. I like to add 20 minutes of this tape to my workout of pilates with weights and Denise's walking indoor tape segment with weights. \\"The more muscle cells you have the more calories you burn\\"! (Denise Austin) Yes Denise is a pretty perky person and yes sometimes it can get annoying but she is the only excercise diva in my collection. This tape is great if you want just a few minutes of toning or want to add to your other excercise routines. If you aren't used to using weights start small (1-2lb) and work your way up. Also if you are just starting out just do the first 20 minute segment till you feel strong enough to add the last 20 minutes. Video can be challenging but worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout Video","review":"I enjoy Denise Austin's style of instruction, as she is always very motivational and perky. This workout focuses on the problem areas for women, such as abs, arms, thighs, buns, and even \\"bra fat zones\\". I didn't expect the workout to be as challenging as it was, but I worked up a sweat even though it is toning and not cardio exercise. The first segment is a good stretch and then 20 minutes of toning for the female fat zones. The second segment uses the stability ball, which is the main reason I purchased the dvd. I found the exercises to be challenging (but fun), although I am a beginner with the ball - therefore for someone more advanced they may be easy. The ab section on the ball was killer - even though I do 10 minutes of abs everyday. I think doing them on the ball, adds an extra challenge that my muscles aren't used to. Overall, I would highly recommend this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results quite fast...","review":"(I am a 30 year old female)I tried the video and did about 1/2 - 3/4 of the total workout, and noticed within two weeks that indeed those zones were getting more toned. The stability ball exercizes feel great. The video is not boring, and very effective at increasing blood circulation. Denise is fun and entertaining to watch. I don't usually get into home workout videos (this is the only one I own) but I will try Denise Austin's other ones because it really did feel good to do the workout with her style. My mom who is 62 also does the video and feels like it is effective without being overly difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and effective workout","review":"This workout is really great -- it doesn't take a lot of time, it's not overly difficult and it's just plain fun; especially with the balance ball. This is a great muscle building workout to be used on alternate days; in between your aerobics routines -- b/c it's not aerobic at all and if you want to burn fat, you need to get your heart pumping! This is a fantastic workout though -- I actually look forward to doing this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Inexpensive Exercise Opportunity","review":"I was a little skeptical before purchasing this exercise video, but at the price I couldn't resist. As it turns out, this is one of the greatest bargains I have ever found! The video is easy to follow. The exercises are strenuous, but not torture. I like the way Denise Austin changes up the focus every few exercises, so one body area doesn't get too tired at once. A great overall workout! (P.S. - if you don't have an exercise ball or hand weights, you will need to get them; but it's worth it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems easy at first","review":"I just tried this one and found it so good. you realize when it's done that it really was a good work-out.and one I'll use alot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I ordered a DVD of Shrink your female fat zones and instead received a paperback copy of the book.

It has chapters 1-4, 5-7, etc. If you jump in at the stability ball point, there is no warmup. If you have 40 minutes to devote to a workout then this is a good one. Not great but good enough for me as a teacher who has the summer off and can do a longer workout June-Aug."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good workout for the entire body!","review":"I bought this video because of the blurb \\"two 20 minute workouts\\" on the cover; like many people, I have little time and was looking for quick workouts. This workout is divided into two 20-minutes segments, but they are certainly not two separate workouts! That aside, this tape works your entire body from your legs and buns to your arms. Austin alternates between upper body, abs and lower body exercises, using weights and a stability ball. I'm beginning to exercise again after a break, and I found this tape doable but a good challenge, although advanced exercisers may want a higher degree of difficulty.Austin and her on-air cast demonstrate exercises clearly and Ms. Austin is easy to follow. Her unending perkiness and enthuisiastic chatter could be a bit annoying (\\"Let's see your smiling face!\\"), but she deserves full credit for her dedication to her work. All in all, this is a good buy, and regular use will certainly produce results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, but her voice is very annoying","review":"Very good workout for upper and lower body as well as abs. I've seen results from my shoulder down.Here is the downside: I felt for some of the abs sections, she is out of beat and makes it difficult to follow. I do figure it out after several sessions. She is too chatty and her voice is kind of annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrink your female fat zones","review":"Not quite ready for this DVD--will work up to it and then have a better evaluation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast, her voice is irritating!","review":"This DVD is not helpful at all! It's too fast; you need to buy a ball that takes a lot of space otherwise you can't do the exercices. Denise is not motivating and her voice can irritate someone really fast.I have practiced aerobics for a long time and it's the first time I take no pleasure making exercise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality of Manufacturing","review":"When I received this DVD I played it and there were only 2 chapters recorded on it. I sent it back and replaced it. When I received the second DVD the same thing happened. I love Denise Austin and her workout videos. I was looking forward to this one as it had two smaller time frame workouts on it. Needless to say I was disappointed. I have since received my refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still haven't received","review":"I contacted the seller a week ago and was promised a replacement which hasn't arrived, I will give the seller some leeway since I know the USPS does not always deliver.

It really targets all the areas that women tend to gain weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this!","review":"To get right to the point, I hate this DVD. I've tried several different exercise DVDs, and this is definitely one I should have skipped. Denise has an incredibly annoying voice and I felt completely stupid trying to follow along with the motions. She moved very quickly, and I didn't feel like she held the stretches long enough to be effective. Also, I questioned the technique/form used in places. To be honest, I only got 5 minutes into the DVD before I stopped; maybe it picked up, but I consider it a bad sign that I couldn't stand it long enough to finish it even once. I have also used Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds DVDs - some reviewers felt that she was annoying, but Leslie is nothing compared to Denise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm addicted to this DVD!","review":"I have a entire cabinet of exercise videos and I can say this one is my favorite! I have been using this DVD for 6 weeks, 2-3 times a week. I walk/jog on the other days to get my cardio. This DVD is not too hard, nor too easy. I still find it challenging after 6 weeks. I look and feel more toned - more so than with any other DVD I've tried. My boyfriend has even noticed the results! Yes, Denise is on the chatty side, but she moves from one exercise to the next while explaining so you're always moving. There's not all the annoying lapses as with other videos. I also bought her Pilates DVD, but haven't tried it yet because I love this one so much. It was by far the best $$ I have ever spent on an exercise video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stability Ball and Hand Weights will Shrink Your Fat Zone in Six Weeks","review":"With the use of a stability ball and hand weights, you can reshape your body in 40 minutes. The DVD is broken down into two segments. Each segment targets areas that typcially store fat in women--triceps, stomach, saddlebags, etc. Denise Austin's chatty nature can be annoying but I always feel immediate results after using the DVD. This workout can be a challenge for the beginner or advanced beginner--it is up to the individual to increase the amount of weights used. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't the workout I was looking for, sadly","review":"It wasn't Denise's perky attitude that made me not really enjoy this work out dvd, it was the exercises. I was looking for a work out that focuses more on 'old school' exercises like Bicep curls and what have you. If you're looking to really tone up your arms (especially the flab on the back of your arms, bleh) and everything else without any fru-fru workout plans, then I recommend \\"The Science of Fitness with Tamilee - I Want That Body! by Tamilee Webb\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective workout for beginners","review":"I have been working out to this video 3-4 times a week for 4 weeks and have been cutting back on carbs. My jeans are fitting better and I have dropped 6 pounds. It definitely helps to use weights and an excercise ball as seen in the video as it helps give an extra push to the workout. Denise does tend to talk quite alot, sometimes annoying, but other times it keeps you on track by reminding you to keep proper form which is important. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good starter workout to get you motivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun workout!","review":"I really like Denise's video and this is one of her best! She is so upbeat and makes the workout fun, fun, fun!If you're looking for a difficult, sweaty workout this probably isn't for you. But if you want a good toning workout on lighter days, this is a great video for you bod and your head :o)This workout makes me happy and up beat! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I think this tape is great. I liked to exercises they were easy to follow. I could feel that I got a workout the next day.

It's excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good exercises. Had to turn off the sound.","review":"This is my first (and will be the last) Denise Austin's DVD. I read so many good reviews and have to try it. I had to turn off the sound and played my own music to do the workout. You gotta admit that her voice and non-stop talking could be really irritating. However, when you finally could focus on the TV screen, her image would be the next thing distracted you from the exercises. I personally felt that the way she bugged her eyes out all the time was scary to me.If you don't have strong feelings against the instructor and can follow through the whole sequence, the exercises can be very effective. They're the ones I also practice a lot in my gym classes. I think I'll just stick to my gym, since I don't wanna play this DVD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"Denise Austin provides a great workout. However, you need to have several pieces of equipment to make it happen: a mat, an exercise ball, and handweights. You can combine the 2 twenty-minute workouts into 1 forty-minute workout if you like. The only problem is that Denise talks too much and her voice becomes shrill after a while. If you can let that slide, this is a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good target areas","review":"I liked it. I felt the burn the day after so it must have worked something. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, but Denise is annoying","review":"I agree with what a lot of folks have been saying.

Denise Austin is so completely distracting, you can't watch or listen to her at all. Which is really hard to do since she does NOT STOP TALKING for more than 2 seconds. Add that to the fact that she has an odd voice and bugs her eyes out. The whole thing reminded me way too much of something I would see on SNL or MadTV. I had too stop it halfway through and don't know if I could put up with her for the entire program!

The story begins with the interesting premise of vacationing in France just after the war. The novel shows the tensions of the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\" between financially war torn France and the booming post war U.S. The Chateau serves to remind us of the graciousness of everyday life and the small luxuries afforded by simply being American. All of the American insecurities of traveling abroad crop up throughout the novel: (e.g. the gaucheness of being an American, the lack of a long history or the U.S's place in Western Culture). No one character is entirely lovable or wretched. That is precisely what makes it such a thought provoking novel. It is perfect for those who travel or have been to France on an extended trip. Enjoy the book and recommend it to a friend. The story can stand on its own but the writing remains the feast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life After Wartime","review":"Harold and Barbara Rhodes visit France in 1948; a country coming to terms with the aftermath of war and occupation and an uncertain Europe.They stay at Beausmesnil Chateau.

Or a hostility towards the American couple and the country they are from which is dictating the peace with the USSR in a shattered Europe entering a new age....On face value, this seems a dull tale or travelogue with little action or plot,but it is the quality of Maxwell's writing that gives dimension;of human and international relations;how complex or sinister meanings are given to things that ultimately have no gravity or bearing at all.Maxwell keeps the readers interest throughout and the characters have real human depth. A fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character driven book","review":"The Chateau is a character driven book. If you are looking for action you won't find it here.

The door gates (not this fence) are perfect, very sturdy, easy to operate and all the Richell products are very nice looking and will fit right into any well furnished home but....this fence has 90 degree ends to stabilize the fence which is a great idea and worked fine until my wife scooted one of the ends against a wall at a slight angle. We heard a wood cracking sound and when we pulled the fence back away from the wall we saw that the top hinge that braces the stand had only about 3/16th of an inch of wood from the edge to where screws were inserted. Well, that 3/16\\" wood sliver to which the top hinge was mounted had cracked away with only the slight pressure of my wife scooting the brace adjacent to a wall slightly off angle. Not well designed.

It looks much more like a piece of furniture than a typical dog gate. My only disappointment with the product is that it is rather heavy, making it somewhat difficult to move easily, which is something we need to do whenever we open the front door. (Our gate is intended to block our dog from entering the foyer.) I think I'll add felt strips over the rubber pieces on the feet to make it slide more easily.I am less satisfied with the supplier. Delivery took a month rather than a week, and there was no notification of the delay from the supplier. However, it did eventually arrive, and it was not damaged.

On top of that, this unit is easily adjustable, but solid once the 4 screws are tightened. Finally, the ends that swing to admit humans when desired are well-made; pass through and easily latch shut so puppy stays on the outside.Our growing lab puppy has rambunctiously tested this gate, and satisfied that it is a real barrier, now leaves it alone.

It is a thinly-veiled Christian allegory that the world could do just fine without. One of the more interesting (purely from a philosophical standpoint) parts is when an adulterer sees the error of his ways after reading \\"God's word,\\" which is especially ironic bearing in mind that the woman who now calls herself Anne Perry brutally beat a woman to death with a brick when she was younger.

I am very sorry that this was my first Anne Perry book for it has put me off her work forever, I'm afraid. It is pure preachment and succeeds only as a work of Christian propaganda. It turned me off, even with its display of wan tolerance towards other religious viewpoints, as it assumes a superiority of origin. I believe it is revealing and that Perry has written what, for her, represents something deeply personal and genuine, but which, for me, and I'm sure for others, represents something despotically religious. Ultimately, it fails as literature because it has a clear agenda behind the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No feeling of 'world'","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this book. Its the first book I have bought in a long time where I did not look at all the Amazon reviewers comments, and I regret that. It started well, but I only got 50 pages into it before I gave up. Character development is poor, you keep on feeling that you missed some important pages. Changing cultures on a daily basis gives it a cardboard feeling. I tried making excuses for it, but eventually I had to put it down. Not enjoyable at all. Unrealistic, trying to go through all the worlds religeons and philosophies in one story. A novel idea, but not a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"On-Par With Tolkien & Lewis","review":"This book is really on-par with the great fantasies, adventures, spiritual journeys done by Tolkien and Lewis. The religion is a little more overt than Tolkien, more in line with Lewis, but the epic reaches more towards Tolkien. The characterization is very good. I felt the pain and joy along with Tathea and felt the fear invoked by the evil in the book and the joy of the goodness. It is very much worth the time and money. A magnificent journey and transformation of a human life to a better being, more sublime. The politics, the religions, the ideas that shape a world, most enlightening. It is a book I will read again and again. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"The story in the first part of the book was interesting. However, I found the remainder of the book repetitive, and I had to force myself to finish. I kept thinking there would be more to the story and that it would take a different turn. The message the book gives, however, is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"multiplying melodramatic metaphors","review":"I enjoyed Craig's cover art, so I tried Ta-thea. I found the writing stilted and heavily melodramatic. (I also feel this novel does not fall within the fantasy genre.) A boating expedition represents the inward journey toward religious truth for Ta-thea's soul; she learns a new, unquestionable, higher truth every 18 pages; she discerns each new person's inmost nature by staring intently into their pupils. Gak! For a much better examination of good warring with evil within an individual, I recommend Friedman's Black Sun Rising."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have always loved books written by Mrs. Perry but Thatea was a disappointment... I agree with previous reviewers that it comes out as a big christian propaganda.I was expecting a work of fictionnal fantasy not a tormented spiritual journey,using a relativelly tortuous story line for endoctrinement. I will still read Mrs. Perry and will even \\"give a shot\\"to her next fantasy book. She is really a great writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned","review":"All I want to say is this book is misclassified. This is not a fantasy novel; this book is a work of Christian fiction. I am not commenting on how well or poorly written it is. Nor am I commenting on how enjoyable it may or may not be. I just want readers to know ahead of time that it is Christian fiction, not fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Anne Perry should go back to the Victorian novels which she does so well. Tathea, which I did not finish reading, is dull unless you are interested in descriptions of a fantasy land. Ursula le Guin, Sherry Stepper, and the author of the Dune series have already covered this territory in a much more intereesting manner. Perry's social descriptions of Victorian life in her other novels are so compelling that it is hard to see why she has taken off in this new direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"If I had known this would be a contemporary version of Pilgrim's Progress instead of a fantasy, I wouldn't have tried to read it. I didn't like the first Pilgrim's Progress and this book is worse. It is a grueling read and if you don't agree with the author's view of God and life before openingthis book, I doubt the \\"novel\\" will bring you around. This book is tedious and didactic -- not spiritual."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Christan fiction but this was something else","review":"I had to start this book twice it was just difficult. The theology wasn't hidden but that in itself doesn't bother me a great deal. I love Christian fiction, it gets me thinking about what I believe and why. Tathea however, was actually uncomfortable to read. I wanted to stop several times and plowed on. It had me thinking that maybe I just was uncomfortable because of some truth it had, like when I read difficult sections of the Bible. That is not why. The theology made me uncomfortable, I would rather read then Bible than this book. If I want Christian fiction I will read it, but this felt more like subtle brainwashing. Eh, the story resonated with me but the detractors are too great for me to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tathea by Anne Perry","review":"I'm normally not motivated to write book reviews, but this book was so bad I decided to say something. Like other naive buyers, I was seduced by the glowing reviews on the cover and the fact that I like Anne Perry's mysteries. Believe me, this book was nothing at all like her mysteries.The book is so much quasi-spiritual pap written in flowery language. There is no story. There is no plot to speak of. There are flat inhuman characters. There is, however, a great deal of lofty sermonizing.If you have converted to Mormonism like Anne Perry, you might like this book. Otherwise steer clear of it and spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change of Pace Falls Flat","review":"I have read and loved all of Anne Perry's books. Her characters are well drawn and fascinating. The story lines are always interesting and intriguing. Ta-thea is none of the above. Although the first few chapters were bearable, it was a battle to get through the rest of this lugubrious tome. The story of the \\"saint\\" and her travels was repetitious and flat. The ultimate insult-it was BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly veiled Christian apologetic","review":"A rather tedious book that effectively takes traditional (1900's) Christianity to another \\"world\\". Only vaguely readable, and not really worth the money. I would not even classify this as fantasy per se; it should have been characterized as christian fiction. Unfortunately, this genre is rather predictable, and the resulting story line is rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please--Back To Victorian England","review":"Ms. Perry should stick with her novels set in Victorian England. I have read all of them, so when I saw a new book by Anne Perry, I immediately purchased it. What a disappointment! Boring. The characters were so unlifelike. I love fantasy, but this was too far out for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"If you've read the inside cover of Tathea, you will be very disappointed by the actual book. Anne Perry's attempt at a religious lesson will quite simply bore you to tears. The opening of the book holds some promise, but after that things get stupid. Over and over again we hear the same message with a few different characters. Of course, none of these characters actually develop to the point where you would care about the message they are sending. The repetion of the book also becomes incredibly irritating. I couldn't count the times Perry wrote about the suffering and joy suffusing someone's face. In the end, I simply stopped caring what happened to anyone, least of all Tathea. I would not recommend Tathea to anyone. It was shallow, boring, and pretentious in the extreme. Perry should stick to writing mystery novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"There was an article about this book in the local paper and I became intrigued by the underlying religious tones and focus. I soon put this book on hold at the library. While I waited for this book, I read another one of Anne Perry's novels, which was actually entertaining and worth reading. However, when I finally began to read \\"Tathea\\", I soon found disappointment, no matter how hard I tried to like the novel (I did really want to like the novel). I must admit, I was unable to complete the novel. The beginning jumps around way too much and the author seems to be in some sort of hurry. She lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a guise!","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to break into the fantasy novel genre with something that wasn't ultra famous. In all reality, it is a fantasy novel for the Christian book genre readers, but it was disguised as a regular fantasy book novel. I didn't appreciate that very much. The strong religious undertones took away from the novel (I actually completed it) but the discriptions and the writing were terrible. Perry is too wordy with the language and almost nothing had a physical discription beyond the clothes one wore or the kind of stone at the locale.It is a good book for youths or people looking to buy different kinds of Christian novels, but it is not a fantasy book for fans of that genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious","review":"Tathea was not what I expected from a book billed as a fantasy novel. I bought it thinking that it would be a nice escape from reality not realizing that it is fact not a fantasy book so much as it a religious novel. For those of you who enjoy religious works, you may very well enjoy this book. However, if you do not, I strongly suggest finding another book. I have read one-half of the book and do not plan on completing it. I am disappointed that the back of the book was not more forthcoming on the nature of the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than pleasantly surprised","review":"I love Anne Perry mysteries but I am also a fantasy fan and to pick up a fantasy book written by one of my favourite mystery authors was a dream made in heaven. It was thoughtful and well written. I am not highly religious but it helped focus and articulate my feelings on what religion should be like. It made me think, which is all you can ask of a good book. Judging by the reviews it made other people think too, so whatever you think about the book, it succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Long Journey","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews before trying to plow my way through this book. I like fantasy, I like Anne Perry. But, I just could not finish this book. By the first fourth I really did not care what happened to Tathea (or anyone else for that matter). Very one deminsional. Not up to her usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment... Not the usual Anne Perry's book","review":"Even though I knew it would be a totally different book from the ones she usually writes I was very disspointed. I read all of her books in the \\"Pitt\\" and \\"Monk\\" series. She is my favorite author. But this time I did not even finish the book. At first, it seemed like it was going to be interesting, but then after about 80 pages or so, it became so boring that I finally stopped reading it. Even from a Mormon's point of view, this book is weird, and boring.BUT, I would like to tell people who said that it was their first \\"Anne Perry\\" book and were dissapointed to the point of not wanting to read any other book of hers, PLEASE, READ HER \\"PITT\\" AND \\"MONK\\" SERIES. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Ideas","review":"I tend to agree with the second review at the top that I times I felt Tathea got too preachy, but all in all, I do not feel the book was a waste of my time. I didn't like how Tathea extoled virtue and then was too touchy with Alexius, Eleni's husband. Regardless, the book is full of deep ideas that I feel that the religious world should confront. As I was reading this, I enjoyed it. It is both an exciting spiritual quest and a missionary journey set in a fantasy setting. The book kept me glued through both the plot and the ideas conveyed within. It is a religious allegory, yet it's worth reading into. Despite some of its flaws, I'm going to give it 5 out of 5 stars because I thourougly enjoyed it. If anything, pick it up from the library and be sure this is the type of book you want on your shelf. I hope that Perry can improve some of her flaws in the second installment, \\"Come Armageddon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Now...","review":"Preachy, meandering, and hard to follow are the descriptions that I would use to describe \\"Tathea\\". Some parts were interesting, but they kept being interrupted with long philosophical treatises on the Bible...er... \\"Book\\". I was hoping for something along the lines of Guy Gavriel Kay. Boy, was I wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo disapointing","review":"I got this book thinking I was about to dig into another great fantasy.I was wrong. I forced myself to read to page 300, but then i couldn't take it any more.I just dont think you can bring that much religion into fantasy and it still be a good book. The characters come and go way too fast. She seems to be attracted to all of them.Tathea is an embarresment to the whole world of fantsy. This is the first anne perry book i've read, and it will be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware all ye who enter into this book!","review":"I have always loved Ms. Perry's Victorian mysteries. As a scifi fan, I looked forward to her first foray into new worlds. Well, this ...I hesitate to call this mishmash a novel...publication is truly terrible. It lacks everything that makes good fantasy and has everything that makes bad fantasy and pretensious religion! This abomination should have a sign on it \\"for Mormons only.\\" A waste of time, a waste of money, and a waste of environmental resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cure for insomnia","review":"I'll be brief. I love Anne Perry's work. Although I'm a huge fan of William Monk and Hester and I love the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt myteries, this book was sleep inducing. There are 522 pages of religious ramblings that could have been condensed into 200. I'm sorry to say, reading this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading","review":"I am a big fan of Anne Perry and have read all of her mystery books. All of her books have been well researched and show Victorian England in gritty reality. For that reason I expected something of the same to be true of this book and was very badly disappointed.Readers were mislead for the beginning in being told that this is a fantasy book. This isn't fantasy, it's a spititual journey espousing one religion's teachings. If I had been told that this entire 500+ page book was a metaphor for the Morman religious teachings I would have saved my money. Even without the religious theme the story is boring and the characters are two demensional. Books today are too expensive to waste money on and readers should be given a true idea of what they are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a religious parable, not a novel","review":"Tathea is essentially a lengthy (over 500 page) Christian parable. Regardless of the merits of its message, this book should not be represented as a fantasy novel.The characters are undeveloped and uninteresting. The main character, Tathea, journeys from place to place with only the thinnest of plot devices to connect the various episodes. Supposedly, each of her adventures deepens her understanding of \\"The Book,\\" but in fact no such growth is evident in the character.I am surprised that the author, who has published dozens of books in the mystery genre, could produce somethng as poorly written as Tathea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Not great, but classic Grant","review":"Grant certainly made better movies (Philly Story, N by NW)but he is true to his form and craft. The style of his movements, the charm of his smile, his wry and witty banter, it's all there! And Jeanne Crain is easy on the eyes and sexy in a non-sexy way. If you like Cary, or Jeanne, buy it and enjoy. But, what I really want to know is, \\"What the heck is that car he drives?\\" No-one mentioned the beautiful car, is it Italian? Or a Packard, a Continental? I'm dying to know!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cary at his best.","review":"Love this movie. I am so glad I own it. I don't have to wait to stubble upon it on the Movie Channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll wish everyone was like this.","review":"I think this is one of Cary Grant's BEST movies and Jean Crain is absolutely wonderful! This movie is delightful and will make you wish not only that you knew a doctor like Dr Pretorious, but that you knew people like him in general,and you are very blessed if you do! This movie changed some of my ways of thinking for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick","review":"People will Talk is an amazing movie in a serio/comical, light entertainment style.Cary Grant is at his best and the rest of the cast is great as well.Too many great scenes to list. But I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the light humor style. There is not much of it these days.The funny thing is I have heard things like, that movie is old, or I don't like Cary Grant or Cary who?Good comedy or good stories are timeless. It is foolish to assume anything that has been is not good or that anything that is Now is in fact good just for that reason alone.This is silly logic and achieves nothing.See this movie! If you don't like it then you are not human.LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"People Will Talk","review":"Very nice movie, no flaws. The delivery was perfect, as it was a Valentine gift and it arrived that morning. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel-good nonsense, unfortunately.","review":"Avid Cary Grant fan. This is bar none the worst role he ever had to try to make sense out of. His speeches are delivered in a preachy, supercilious, sneeringly long-winded way that seems bitter against any other doctor. As someone who has had to deal with dozens of doctors and surgeons I do see the point that this film is trying to make, but there are a hell of a lot of doctors who have spent their lives - literally - saving the lives of others. Praetorious says a few things, too, that makes him sound like an utter quack. And giving out so much candy, I assume his brother is a dentist. Bottom line: Trying to do \\"Message\\" over \\"Story\\" is bad medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BRILLIANT COMEDY\\"? HA!","review":"On the back of this DVD is a review from the ASHVILLE MOUNTAIN XPRESS which includes the words 'BRILLIANT COMEDY'. All I can say is the reviewer must have been watching a different movie. If you are expecting a laugh-riot, you will be VERY disappointed. I would have been happy with a handful of chuckles, or even a warm smile or two.And while I have seen far worse Cary Grant movies (see, or rather DON'T see, THE AMAZING ADVENTURE) this one was rather strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cary Grant - Male Gynecologist","review":"Honestly? P.U.despite being a huge Cary Grant fan, I can't buy him in this role. both the character (selfless gynecologist to the down-trodden, amateur orchestra conductor, sensitive soul, all 'round renaissance man) and grant's performance (all over the map) are far too precious to be taken seriously. or even comically. which may be the problem w/ the film: the odd mixture of satire, moralizing, and cautionary anti-mccarthy tale just doesn't hang together well.I'd write this off as yet another retread of hollywood's ham-handed self-congratulatory liberalism. if you're looking for vintage mank, stick w/ \\"all about eve;\\" for classic cary, \\"north by northwest.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame movie","review":"Insipid, uninspired and Cary Grant is wasted in the role; not Jeanne Crain, though...you expect this kind of tripe with her in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"Among the worst movies I've ever seen, \\"People Will Talk\\" is a confused, pontificating, gassy mess. The direction is non-existent and the acting (with Hume Cronyn the only notable exception) awful. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this bomb really be from Joseph L. Mankiewicz","review":"I love Cary Grant films, and I love Makiewicz, but this film is a significant disappointment in both of their careers. Far from engaging, this is one of the low-points in both of their careers.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grant's strangest vehicles","review":"Though this video doesn't stint on Cary Grant's usual charm, it really isn't one of his typical star vehicles. Rather it's an odd story about an odder man and his unexpected (and perhaps unbelievable) tumble into love and marriage. Even with the mysteries of who Praetorius is and what's up with Mr. Shunderson solved by the last scene, questions remain, and in those questions lie much of the film's appeal. The weak link here is Jeanne Crain's mannered performance as a young, unwed mother. Crain seems to be acting in another film all together, and tends to be distracting, though this does add to the overall quirkiness of the film. A fantastic cast which includes Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, Margaret Hamilton (in a small but memorable role), Finlay Currie and Sidney Blackmer, makes this film a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic Flatulence","review":"I found it wearisome, and ultimately futile and pointless, attempting to follow and unravel this film's pretenses and confused message. Insufferably smug, self-righteous, sanctimonious, and sermonizing, not to mention poorly directed and acted, it says a great deal for my endurance (masochism?) that I was able to sit through this bombastic claptrap from beginning to end. I assure you, there's no reason for you to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience EVER! NO STARS!!!","review":"I normally do not write reviews. I look to see what other people have said before I buy, but when everything goes well, I just move on. Not this time! I have been buying from Amazon for years now. This is the first time that I have not received my product. I ordered it on 5/3 and supposedly it was shipped on 5/5, however when I still did not have it on 5/29 I tried to contact the seller. I did not get a response. I am now working with Amazon to try and get my money back. I felt this seller had good feedback, but now I would not trust them at all. I would give NO STARS if it would let me!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People will talk...","review":"People will talk...they do indeed. I enjoyed this movie on Turner Classics so much that I went and got my copy from Amazon. There's nothing special about the storyline, it's presented well (and I don't want to give the plot away). Cary Grant seems to have some fun and takes a few liberties with his role - the rest of the cast performs well, also. Get a copy and watch a competent ensemble go to work! Five stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A generous side of John Coltrane","review":"The first thing you might notice about Traneing In is that the Red Garland Trio is listed prominently. Perhaps because of this, John Coltrane gives more space to the rhythm section than usual. Red, Paul Chambers, and Art Taylor have the stage to themselves for the first 3:43 of the CD, then Coltrane comes in. Coltrane's playing is very good throughout this CD. The program isn't very adventerous -- \\"Giant Steps\\" is still two years away -- \\"Traneing In\\" has two Coltrane originals and three minor standards. The songs range from lively midtempos (\\"Traneing In\\" & \\"Bass Blues\\") to slow (\\"Slow Dance\\" & \\"You Leave Me Breathless\\") to speedy (the misleadingly named \\"Soft Lights and Sweet Music\\"). This is a good Coltrane CD, not one of his classics, but if you've already gotten the top rank Coltranes, you should add this to your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Didn't Someone Think of this Sooner?","review":"If you're old enough to need reading glasses, you know what a pain it is to be outdoors with sunglasses when you need to see fine detail. Off would come the sunglasses and out would come the reading glasses -- back and forth all day. What a pain! These sunglasses have reading lenses built in. Whether I'm driving, fly fishing, hiking and trying to read a map or GPS, etc., these glasses both protect my eyes while making it a snap to read or see fine detail. Highly recommended. Once you try them you will never go back and wish that you had thought of this great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Optics","review":"These sunglasses are great!!!! Thier polorized optics are second to none. I tested these with other very expensive sunglasses and they were better than any of them. They are great for fishing. The only down side to the glasses is the frames have a hole in the earpeace that can have a lanyard string put through it. Unfortunetely this creates a weak spot in the frames and they can break off the ear piece.

The first time I thought it was me. The second time, well, maybe my grandsons got a hold of them. The third time -- well, this time I had left the glasses in the car where no one could get at them but me, and when I examined them after a week's use I found that the earpiece was 1/2 broken through right at that blasted hole. No more. The price might be good, but not when you have to buy a new pair ever fortnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Say the Least","review":"Went fishing and these were very irritating to wear.

Other than that they're fine.Note: I take these reviews very seriously. If you have a criticism of the review please leave a comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Poor quality! I bought these sunglasses for my fishing expeditions.

I'm certain that they must be nice people, but I wouldn't consider them to be models. Buy a Play Boy dvd instead. You'll be much more satisfied.

I started playing, and the gameplay had been changed sooo much that it was nothing like it predecessors. Instead of controling a whole army of people with various attacks, it was more like a crappy Zelda game.

Once responsible for some of the best mixes on the market, Subliminal mixes of late have been fairly flat and uninteresting. Both mixes start out with overly long uninteresting songs that almost make you want to give up on the mix entirely by the time track two finally arrives. Further listening only reveals more of the same. There is very little warmth throughout any of the tracks and not one song stands out. Even the remixes are uninteresting - Robbie Rivera's Sex 2005 is missing all the original hooks rendering it limp and lifeless, and not at all reminiscent of the original. Looking back, out of all the eight Subliminal Sessions mixes only maybe three are worth owning, this one unfortunately is not one of those mixes. I say don't fall for it again (or at least this time) - with so many dud's to so few truly great mixes, Subliminal is no longer a brand to be counted on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves it","review":"Another great construction truck from Playmobil.

I would like that this camera had audio for video recording, but I think can't ask too much. For you folks who are scared about this camera eating batteries just buy rechargeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUV dis one","review":"Yes it is a battery eater but the good news is that it only needs 2 AA's. I also wish the lens door had a little more tension on the closing clik. All this talk about battery cnsumption baffles me. It's only a fraction of FILM CONSUMPTION! For a simple cheap camera the quality is superb. I wish the video mode had audio though, You can do depth of field adjustment on it which is great on a point and shoot. The LCD is a bit small but it holds up well outdoors in bright light. It comes with a nifty pouch too. The 2 x digital zoom actually WORKS! Of course I use Kodak Ofoto for all my prints so that may be why I love it so.Spanky Camera"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera for a great price!","review":"I was very pleased with this little camera. It takes really nice pictures. Also, being a person who hates reading directions, the camera was pretty much self-explainatory. I just loaded the software and I was off!

I had never used a digital camara before, so the experience was new to me. It wasn't too complicated and I do enjoy not having to worry about getting film or dropping off the film and picking it up.The only drawback I have found is that I did not receive an adapter and this uses up battery power very quickly. That is annoying to me. I know adapters are available but I didn't receive one with this present. I suppose I should not be so cheap and go get one.

I mean, seriously? There was nothing better back in 1946 to get shortlisted? This is very much like including Borat in the Best Picture Oscar nomination list.Having said that, Danger Planet would be fantastic, if you were 10 years old back in 1945.

The albums produced to the max and his voice is stellar. The album is dull to a degree because of the sameness from track to track. Not a rocker in the bunch until the tenth track which is only somewhat upbeat. I can't bash the album because the songs again are good songs just simular. I would have loved to hear him blast something in the vien of \\"Tied Up In Love\\" from Penetrator or even a poppy \\"How About That\\". He sounds as if he can still sing the hell out of a song but he went the way Cheap Tricks, Robin Zander did on his painfully slow/boring over produced self titled album.

However, it starts out strangely and doesn't set the tone by simply breathing or doing a simple meditation. Also, there is no music which is a little weird. I also found myself wishing I could hold some of the poses, like down-dog, for an extended period. I felt that a focus on flexibility was really lacking in this program.

I like the fact that each cell charges independently and the charger window shows progress for each. Before purchasing this charger, I had been having problems with what I thought was the previous charger but have now been able to determine that 2 of my many batteries were completely dead. Not only is this a fast charger but it also doesn't generate that much heat as some of my past chargers had done, always making me a little cautious about leaving the charger charging unattended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I already owned one of these which I purchased from a local camera store I wanted another, but they never seem to have them in stock. Finally I bought two more on here. These are great. We run a photography business specializing in weddings.

Run, don't walk away from this book. You won't learn anything about Miles Davis but you will learn allot about Chris Murphy!! Who???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit better than I expected","review":"There's hero worship and then there's idolatry. Miles was and still is one of my musical heroes - an almost personal relationship exists with your heroes, even though I never met the man. Even though this book for the most part operates on the level of blind adoration of Miles, those who have been touched by his music, and therefore his personality, are bound to get [drawn] in. So I found myself enjoying all the stories. It's like what Joe Zawinul said about Miles: the greatest conversation piece in 20 years . . . Fortunately, the author doesn't delve too deeply into giving \\"insight\\" into the music - there are perhaps others who could do that better, namely some of the musicians who played with Miles. But the author has offered up what I feel to be a sincere and heartful account of his time with Miles, coming from a person whose perspective is not usually heard from - the roadie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why all the naysayers?","review":"Like the previous reviewer stated, this book is a MEMOIR, not a biography. It gives a portrait of Miles through the eyes of a man who knew him intimately for years. It balances the good and the bad(did the negative reviewers who wanted more of the \\"bad\\" Miles skip over the part where he attacks and beats on Finney?? Hardly a \\"whitewash\\")It's a fun and absorbing read. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Diary Of A Roadie\\" is a more appropriate title.","review":"I was hoping to get some insight to Miles' great live band from '73-'75. Instead, we're treated to the author's sexist view of women, his total idolization of Miles and seemingly barely-remembered anecdotes of life with Miles on and off the road. Interspersed are stories of life on the road with David Allen Coe (nope, Miles wasn't playing trumpet in his band), visits with Johnny Cash (ditto), stories of personal drug use and abuse and the bedding of various women. When Murphy calls Orleans (remember those guys? They [stunk]) a \\"great band\\" it's time to break out the hula hoops.

It's not...it's just a sponge. It lasted a week longer than a normal sponge for me when looking for wear, but once it started to wear it was useless to me, and it is very hard to use for anything now that it is wearing (the wear is by the logo on the \\"smoother\\" side). I live in a house with no dishwasher (except myself) and we are a family of four, we go through sponges pretty quick. 4 stars because it gave me an extra week and it never started to smell!

The one I've had since late June, 2012 is crapping out on me already though.So, for $5, you get two months of sponge. And Amazon won't let me get a new one with my Prime membership unless I get $20 in more stuff. Awesome.If you're reading this, spongemongers, send me a replacement before I find $20 in more stuff to buy and I'll revise my rating.

I love this sponge. A small pearl of soap works up an excellent lather and lasts through tons of dishes (of course we always pre-soak our dirtiest dishes, so that helps too). The great lather also causes the sponge to be practically self-cleaning--no smell!--though when it does get dirty, it's dishwasher safe, which is wonderful. Be sure to rinse and wring the sponge out thoroughly after each use to maximize its longevity. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Descent sponge, works well, gets the job done.","review":"I bought this because it was touted to be one of the better sponges out there and I was looking for something to easily take out the tough stains in my kitchen sink. This gets the job done BUT the reason I gave it four stars is because I was expecting it to be like the magic eraser and work wonders but it's not on that level. I like that it can be washed in the dishwasher, re-usable, does not scratch easily and is double sided. Overall it's a solid sponge but not the miracle worker I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongest and longest lasting sponge!","review":"I purchased this sponge about a year ago and it's still going strong. Of course I make sure to sanitize the sponge every so often with the boiling water, but $4+ for a year seems unbelievably great deal for me!

The combat is repetitive, the presentation is dull and lifeless, and the entire game suffers from an apparent lack of effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent for children","review":"I purchased this game for my 8 year old grandson.

She read the book, saw the movie and was caught up it the beauty and fantasy of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Ever!!!!!!","review":"I love this game so much! I got it, then beat the whole thing in less than 24 hours. The game is action packed, and is a level type game. It's not like the lord of the rings, where you are put somewhere, and you have to figure out what to do and where to go. There is a trail that you have to follow. You have a partner with you (you know that if you've read the book). There are 16 levels in the whole game. For every level, you get to pick whether you want to play the level in easy, normal, or difficult mode (I always chose to play it in the normal mode). Any Eragon fan will love this game! Thanks, and I hope you get this and enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innovators","review":"The first and last chapter dragged as the author argued all around any points he was attempting to make. The middle of the book told a good story about technical advancement if you could get past the first chapter. The begining and end were disjointed, rambling, and seemed contrived to impress the reader with the author's mastery of the subject matter more than making any particular points."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Journey","review":"Once I picked this book up, I couldn't set it down. Just thinking about the authors adventure from Lake Itasca to New Orleans makes me want to drop everything and hit the open river myself. Because I read this book, I feel I have a deeper understanding of the history surrounding my childhood town and the mighty Mississippi that runs through it. This story of a very courageous and confident man finding happiness and love on the river that has given life to it's people for thousands of years will always stay with me, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone with some adventure in his or her own soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this cd","review":"I heard him down in Miami a few months ago and was really impressed. I read some online reviews saying this was his best cd, so I picked it up. I was sorely disappointed. The cd sounded like some of the really bad amateurish mixes from the late 90s, that try to impress with the use of only a few cool sounds. He mixed well, but the actual music was boring and flat. I'm going straight to a used cd store to try to trade in for a better cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychic TV - 'Live In Three Mean Fiddler' (Temple Records)","review":"Sound quality of this limited edition - 1,000 copy archive CD is better than I had expected - probably because awhile back, I heard a friend's copy of a similar release from the live bunch of Psychic TV releases they'd put out and THAT show sucked, if I remember correctly. However, 'Live In Three Mean Fiddler' serves as a good live documented performance from Psychic TV in their prime. Tunes here that gives you that 'like-you-are-there' vibe are \\"Mu-Sick Non Stop!\\", \\"Your Body\\", the effectively-weird \\"SticK Insecticide\\" and the eight-minute \\"I Can Hear Thee Voice Of Unclean Spirit\\". Personnel: Genesis P-Orridge - guitar, noise & vocals, Fred Giannelli - lead guitar, Daniel Black - keyboards and Mathew Best - drums. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year of Ritual","review":"In \\"A Year of Ritual: Sabbats & Esbats for Solitaries and Covens\\" author Sandra Kynes brings the reader through a year of ritual and ceremony just as the title suggests. As an advanced practitioner I felt a desire for less defined structure and more ideas to incorporate into my magical year. This is a good book for those who need total structure because there is not a lot of wiggle room for inserting your own ideas or beliefs. Sandra Kynes is a fine writer with a very concise, somewhat elfish style that is endearing. At the back of the book there is even a glossary and some pronunciations for elfish words, which is a really nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the Croce fanatic","review":"Most of the songs are only 1:30 to 2:00 long and the quality, as stated in other reviews, is not too good. I thought it could have been remastered better. I'll listen to this now and then but it will most likely sit on my shelf and collect dust. I'm a HUGE Jim Croce fan but I have to give this a thumbs down. 15 songs totaling 31 minutes isn't worth releasing. Should have had them available for download instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GIFT To Fans That Completes Jim Croce's Musical Legacy.","review":"This album is a very enjoyable listening experience. The fact that these songs are \\"Home Recordings:Americana\\" that were recorded on a home tape recorder in 1967 only adds to its charm. Jim Croce has and had a style all his own. Even when singing other peoples' songs he has a way of making them his own. His love for his art shines through. The best job possible was done in preparing these tracks for CD. This has become a favorite of mine that I will enjoy for it's simplicity in showcasing Jim Croce's talent. In answer to some who may ask \\"Why not 5 stars then?\\" it is only because I don't want to give the impression that it's a perfect recording by today's standards BUT as far as I'm concerned, it's as good as it gets in bringing 1967 recordings done on a home tape recorder into today's digital recording age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Cracked!","review":"I purchased and sent this CD as a gift to someone. They told me the case and the CD were both cracked in the package! Needless to say, the intent of the gift- to surprise someone with music they said they loved- was completely missed. I imagine the music itself is great, but something went wrong in the fulfillment and/or shipping of this item. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd expect from Jim Croce","review":"I bought this CD for one particular song that my dad wanted to hear, and the version wasn't what we'd hoped it would be. The songs were all poorly recorded, monotonous and nothing like the songs that Jim Croce is known for. This must have been some of his earliest work before he became popular and I think only a truly devoted fan would enjoy listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They do NOT sell replacement glass shades!","review":"It has been infuriating trying to find a replacement glass shade. They are not sold anywhere. ProTrack is not a stand-alone company that you can contact either...you can't find any information on the company, you can only find their products.

However, for the fan looking for a more basic collection of his singles, this piece offers a good skimming off of many of his top country hits of the entire 50's decade. Although there are several compilations of Pierce's 50's output, this is one of the few that offers \\"Bye Bye Love\\" (the Everly Bros. cover) - one of only two songs by Pierce that managed to crack the top 100 pop charts.The sound quality overall is good considering some of these tracks go back to the early 50's. The entire disc is in mono with the exception of \\"I Ain't Never\\" which is in stereo.All told, this CD collection from the U.K.'s Edsel label offers a decent quality compilation of Pierce's 50's output."},{"rating":"1","title":"salted cod fish","review":"I was expecting fillets but there were lots of very tiny pieces of fish.

But no longer. Unfortunately, after listening to this CD, I could not agree more. This is a perfect example of someone selling their soul, probably for the hopes of financial success. Quite sad, actually. I have heard bad new-age pop before, but why did she have to do it to Bach? There is very little Bach in it, but what is recognizable as Bach is pretty repulsive. What baffles me most, is why there is so little violin in it? That is just plain stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring but pleasant","review":"I don't know what all the fuss is all about. According to Amazon, this album pretty much does not sell at all. It is ranked no. 112,302 in music, and yet so many people feel the need to express their strong \`for' or \`against' it. Why so? The album is just as boring, in my opinion. So what if it is called Bach? Simply using snippets of Bach's melodies does not make it Bach and does not make the album classical. The album is pleasant to the ear, nevertheless, and feature a very simple violin line on top of various types of backgrounds. My favorite track is Largo. My least favorite track is The Sicilian, as it sounds pretty dated. BADinerie sounds dated as well, I guess, but mostly, this album is okay for one listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one!","review":"This violinist had seen better days... Some of her previous albums were worth listening. She fooled me to believe she is serious about good music, and about Bach. This album, however, is a rude awakening.

I guess she sold her soul for good cash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap?","review":"I bought this cd new, sealed, on ebay, for $2.26! I thought it was a great deal. Until I heard it. It's so bad! It's just so tacky!!! It sounds so much like cheap, fake, plastic music. This musician must know it's total crap... I mean, she is considered to be quite a talented serious violinist. She certainly could fool me with this one. This has to be one of the worst cds I have ever owned. Save your time and money for artists like Yo-yo Ma, Joshua Bell, Boris Belkin and others who have minimal standards they don't go below. (Not even for money.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much over the top","review":"When I heard the first tunes of the CD, I thought there must have been a mistake and they put the wrong CD in the wrong cover... Then I checked: Yes, I its still reads \\"Bach\\" on the CD itself... It was anwakening, if not necessarily rude as a fellow reviewer has sugessted, but certainly a very suprising one.Well, even if you like crossovers, this one is way over the top. I would not have recognized a single track as being from JSB. Look at other, more laudable crossover-experiments. Maybe the Kronos-quarttet, or recently Pierre Laurant Aimard in his Ligeti-Pygmae music approach. Risk taking, and interesting.This one here is just lush entertainment, a far too easy listening. No risk taking at all. It's interesting, yes sad, what otherwise serious classical music artists will do for money nowadays..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost it.","review":"Selling classical music with sex has never been something I cared for. And St. John always had very questionable CD covers. Nevertheless, I always had to admit that when it came to the music itself, it sounded like she had real integrity. The playing was always first class, with lots of personality and quite unique. Now, she just shattered all this. This CD has no integrity and no music, lowering herself to the level of corny artists like Linda Brava or what have you. Would she soon be posing for Playboy as well? ... Thank god there are still violinists like Hilary Hahn and Sarah Chang around to save the classical grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GIRL GONE WILD, AND DOWNWARD...","review":"This album is about a girl gone wild and certainly the reflection of a career gone wrong. If it were something irresponsible done to this girl then it could be said that it was tragic. But rather, in this case it appears the artist was very much a part of the process of the album and not a victim at all. This kind of a pathetic path downward is quite rare, even nowdays. Without a doubt, a product of a musician brought up without wholesome, solid musical values and traditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious musician.....","review":"I stumbled across St John's website, and read the big letter title: \\"The Curse of Beauty for Serious Musicians\\". This is apparently how her agents would like the general public to look upon her musical career. Some beauty I can see, but a serious musician? Never. This \\"re: Bach\\" album could not have been made by anyone who is a serious or even just an honest musician. It is an album that tries to lure the listeners with superficial effects like funky percussion, sexy female whispers, slick bass guitar and other elements that have no place together with anything that has Bach's name written on it. It is obvious that the artist thinks nobody out there can tell the difference between a good, honest musical expression and third rate commercial junk. It is also quite apparent that the artist has little respect for her audience's intelligence. (Maybe she knows something I don't.) But she did not fool me. This has to be one of the worst albums of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Lara!","review":"Poor Lara! For years, she tried everything to get noticed. First it was the nude cover of her first album, then the tough girl image of the second, afterwards the sexy \\"bad girl\\" cover of the third. Still, some people thought she was also a worthwhile violinist and some even liked her fresh attitude.In this last cd, however, she exposes not her body, for a change, but her lack of musical integrity or depth. It's no wonder this cd is already widely considered a big flop. There's little good to say about it.Although some ignorant, or self-proclaimed \\"progressive thinkers\\" get lured by it's silly effects, I highly advise to skip this one. Ever since 'Switch on Bach' was made, over 30 years ago, countless albums with variations on the subject of Bach were produced. We've already heard it all. There's nothing new here.There are so many better albums out there that will \\"expand your horizons\\" without insulting your intelligence or your sound musical taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"non intimate new age music with a big ego","review":"With all the wonderful cross over that exists around today, this album seems a total waste of time and money. The cover says \\"please buy me 'cause I'm sexy\\". But the cover is the best thing about this album. Musically, it is flat as a surfing board. Some melodies are more familiar than other ones, but what does it matter, anyway? They could have used Telemann or Chopin or Debussy, it would not make a slight little difference. the violin sound is really irritating at some sections. If I had to define the style of the music, I'd call it a non intimate new age. Not good enough to listen to and not pleasent or relaxing enough to hear in the background during dinner. Clearly, the artists' egos was bigger than their understanding of how to connect with their listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"re: Bach","review":"re: Bach is bad not because of it's new age or pop tracks. Those are alright. The arrangements are quite pleasent. No, the album is painful to listen to because of the way Lara plays on the classical tracks. She is sounding way worse than any of her previous albums. The playing is just so unmusical. The dynamics are horrible. Like maybe she was sick while recording it. I'd like to quickly forget this CD and only remember Lara the way she sounded on some of her previous, brilliant albums. If you never heard her play, try the Gypsy album. It is quite brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background music for a soft-core-porn movie, at best","review":"It's believable that this album was originally intended to be some sort of a parody, something like PDQ Bach with an overly intrusive electronic score. But at its best moments, it sounds like background music for a soft-core-porn movie from the early 1980s.Bad CDs such as this one can be a hoot sometimes, but rather than campy, St. John appears to be dead serious; and it's hard to feel anything but fury toward a pro arranger and a (semi?) classical violinist who manage to completely distort the beauty of perhaps the greatest composer in human history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical blunder","review":"It's fascinating, indeed. Take a genius producer, Magnus Fiennes, who has produced totally unknown artists such as the \\"Bond\\" quartet, and made them stars with millions of copies sold. Take Lara St. John, probably a better instrumentalist than most Magnus has worked with, not to mention better known (but perhaps not better looking...) And the album falls flat on it's face! The idea seemed just perfect: Magnus + Lara + Bach = a hit!. But instead, this album spins low into the abyss of bad recordings no one remembers a day after hearing. (And the deeply discounted price of the CD, 2 months after release, speaks for itself...). Certainly a 'faux pas' record-producers can analyze and learn from. I never heard Indian Bach. I never heard Celtic Bach. It all sounds very interesting in theory. But in reality, it all smells from \\"plastic\\"; fake, over-produced, humorless, dated bunch of tracks. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange","review":"The music is so mixed, it is pretty impossible to enjoy or relax with. The violin sounds kind of harsh, and pretty weird on many tracks.

Anything \\"goes\\" with Lara..."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap can become offensive","review":"At a certain point, 'cheap' becomes offensive. This album offends because of it cheapens the greatness of Bach. I'm not talking about a snobby reaction to something that tries to popularize classical music. The pop versions here are so transparently dull and without soul that I feel it is necessary to post a reaction. This album is soulless. But aside from that: I just read an interview with this violinist where she complains she is not taken seriously enough, because of her good looks and her provocative record covers. I find this complaint totally absurd in light of such tasteless, soulless cheap album. A real serious musician would have never made this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than anything I've heard in years...","review":"Sony should not have made this album... But then, a big company can afford to make mistakes from time to time. This album, however, is just about Lara and her musical choices. It is not about music, certainly not Bach's. I also doubt Lara really wanted to promote \\"Muzak\\" or pop beats of any kind. She night have wanted to show herself as a a \\"forward thinking\\" young lady, who \\"moves with the times\\". A person who is willing to step on the most \\"holly\\" musical icons for no clear reason or logic. This album could never helped her sagging career, anyway. I bought it for $2.39 and now I see it's available for as little as 0.89. It is not often that one makes such an obvious mistake in choosing what to record. This artist was recognized by some to be fairly serious about her craft. Many others thought differently. But this pathetic album is the clearest proof that behind the pretty face was nothing of substance, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"As with most books, it took a chapter or two to really get into it.

As for the review that says the remote must be pointed directly at the receiver, I can't say that I have the same issue. I can angle it almost at the ceiling and it will still work. I can't imagine how this unit could break a system any more than any other controller could. In functionality it's a wireless controller that's shaped like a remote. This is no more likely to break your PS2 than any other third party controller, I would say.If you have a PS2 and you need a remote, do not hesitate to get this.

Transferred some game stats to it from another card, and started my season of baseball. After the first game I saved it. When I went out of the season mode, and came back in 15 minutes later, it called said the memory was corrupt and needed to be formatted. This was after only playing one game. I don't consider that very reliable even if it was suggested that there might be overheating or other issues. So for the third day in a row I will be going back to the store tomorrow to return.

I have had nothing but problems with this piece of garbage. If I could I would give it negative stars for this complete waste of money. The 16x will save fine with appartentley no problems, but when its time to retrieve data off the 16x it displays corrupt files or doesn't verify that a memory card is even present.

It tries so hard to be a real movie, that you don't get the feeling of the concert experience, like really being there.Then there is the set list. While they're good songs, there is no variety. Only two YES albums are covered here, \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"90125\\". You don't get to hear any other classics like \\"And You And I\\" or \\"Roundabout\\", which I'm sure the band must have performed during their 1984 tour.For a better YES tour, check out the \\"Keys To Ascention\\" or \\"Live From the House of Yes\\" DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to \\"Bonus Materials\\" and choose \\"Director's Cut\\"","review":"Love Yes.

Some of the instrumentation and vocals also seem pre-recorded. Mr. Rabin is a great guitar player and singer/song writer, but \\"finger-tapping\\" in a Yessong?

It starts at the beginning of WWII and goes through NASA's \\"Women in Space\\" program in the 60's. It's fast-paced, FUNNY, and sometimes poignant. I picked it up because of its cover--an old photo of these four chic young women pilots in front of their WWII plane. By the time I finished it, all I could do was ask myself why I hadn't heard of these amazing women pilots before.

Custer and General Sheridan were interested in the fertility and mineral wealth of the region which led to massive white immigration and its encroachment on the Indian reservation. The white man started the fight with the Sioux, under Sitting Bull, for the same reason as always--money. This movie is an example of Institutional racism.

Funny thing is that the scene that I recall the most is when Custer drags his arch enemy out of the back of a wagon to make him aware of their impending doom. As a child, and to this day, I was touched by what it must have been like to face a hopeless fate such Custer and his men. Flynn, I believe did a wonderful job in interpreting Custer's desparate situation. This caused me later in life to read more about the full history of Custer, the Old West, and the plight of the American Indian. In doing so learned what a real hero General Custer was, and that the battle of the Little Big Horn was truely the \\"Last Stand\\" for the Native American.

Bad editing is less upsetting when eBooks are offered for bargain prices, but this book is not.

For example, in Chapter 9, everywhere that an F2 cross is described, you'll see something like this:\\"(1/4AA + '/2Aa + 114aa)\\"That should read (1/4AA + 1/2Aa + 1/4aa).Sure, I can puzzle it out without any struggle, but I shouldn't have to. Once you add in many other common OCR errors, like \\"F,\\" for \\"F1\\", \\"Fz\\" for \\"F2\\", and \\"as\\" for \\"aa\\", some sections become a real pain to read.The content of this book is great, but I tire of getting ripped off by publishers that won't edit their Kindle editions with the same care that they would give to a physical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting book for home vegetable growers","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has a passion for growing vegetables and wants to know more about growing their own varieties.

The only stand out tracks from the CD are the Missy Elliott song, and the one by Tamia.

During the role playing part you can't save in the levels, you have to wait until you complete the chapter, and that can take well over an hour. Because its so easy to get lost. Plus during the combat the enemy characters move in slow motion. The game counts your hit, and I had a hit count of over 100, and I went over 50 plenty of times. Who ever came up with enemy characters of this game needs to be fired. You really start to dislike your character also. This game doesn't do the movie any justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"The movie this game is based on is probably my favorite movie of all time. The game does a pretty good job following the story with futuristic twists. At times the hordes of enemys get a little old but its a good time to practice moves. As far as saving goes, I am pretty sure the game saves your place every time it goes to a load screen, even though it does not advertise this it does. Who wants to quit in the middle of a chapter anyway? I found the game to be much like the movie once it was over I really wished it wasn't.As far as game play goes I wish I had more control over the camera. That's about my only complaint.I highly recommend this game, for its story line and game play. Its not an extremely hard game but after you beat normal you get a hard option.If i had to do it again I wouldn't change anything .

The rest is bad, no speed control on my 3 wire fan, and the USB ports only worked as USB 1, even though rear ports are USB 2.0. Geeks.com ignored my request for an RMA, so I'm SOL.What I should have done (in hindsight of course) is simply buy an updated tower case with the front ports and audio already installed. To be honest, it would have been less work and faster to relocate my motherboard and hardware to the new case vs cleanly running and tie wrapping the multitude of wires this thing comes with. Cost would not have been much different for a basic case with front ports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible instructions and no driver for Vista","review":"The instruction book leaves something to be desired... it basically comes without them.The manufacturer site says it is Vista supported which is why I bought it. I installed it and Vista installs it as an 'unknown device'. I went to their site and all the downloads are for XP or earlier so I contacted support. They don't even have a Vista driver. I've never actually had a hardware company trick me into buying something when they don't even have a driver for it.

And maybe some things called Demons. Plus a legend about a creation called the Multiman, or possibly Ultiman. Confusing? You bet, not to mention stiff and unpleasant. The so-called Gods have little use for humanity as we understand it, and are wholly self-centered and contemptible, cartoon-ish, really. If Williamson's point is that genetic manipulation is just a bad idea, he's made it, but he's written a very distasteful book in the process. The choice of suffering children as protagonists is just one of Williamson's bad artistic decisions.

There are a few rarities included of Sinatra, Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. live somewhere.(no credits are provided) Seldom do they complete a track as the drunken bantor between them, mostly directed at Sammy cuts the song short. Some will love it! Will this last over time for repeated listening? Many other now faded or fading stars of the Vegas lounge circuit are represented. There's some things by Bing, Tony Bennet, Mel Torme, even some youthful Ray Charles, before he had that unmistakable voice, and early Nat King Cole. The cuts come from various sources and the quality of sound varies from track to track. There are far better sets out there, but this collection gathers a few now obsure stars of the past.

Each track has a smooth and languid feel, the aural equivalent of feathers being levitated by a gentle zephyr, propelled along by Suzanne Perry's warm, ethereal voice. Mellower than LSD's previous releases yet more densely textured, each track possesses a timeless, expansive quality that guitarist Ryan Lum had been perfecting on \\"Idylls\\" and \\"Ardor\\". Well-crafted without being over-produced, and definitely music that manages to be both sensual and contemplative at once. The first two tracks \\"El Pedregal\\" and \\"Sideways Forest\\" set the tone for the rest of the disc, promising and delivering an atmospheric, evocative listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy listening","review":"If you're hooked on Cocteau Twins, the finely-textured and ethereal music of LSD might be just the thing while you're waiting for the next CT album.

It deserves to be heard by a much larger audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"music to dream to","review":"Not alot of bands could even come close to sounding like the cocteau twins. LSD is probably that band. They create rich atmospheric music without sounding like knock-offs. Ryan lum is a genius guitar player suzzanne perrys voice floats over the music effortlessly.

And still it performs like a champ. Over time the original watch has begun to look a bit on the battered side. I figured if my first Wenger watch lasted so well, I would do well with another one. So I looked not just for the Swiss Army branding, but specifically for Wenger Swiss Army brand. I will continue to wear my original Wenger for work. Now I have a shiny new one for going out. I love the simple, readable face.One last comment. My vision has deteriorated a bit over the past few years.

Actually, I daydreamed back in college through a linguistics class that used Mencken's American Language textbook, but it took Bode's biography to teach me how important Mencken was to realism and the fight against puritans and Big Government pablum. While I ignored the classics in school, Bode's story of Mencken's critique of the great writers of the 20's and 30's gave me a list of books to read. As a libertarian Mencken's favorites -- Theodore Dreiser, Joseph Conrad, Sinclair Lewis, etc. -- have delighted me as much as Bode's biography. The lonely, creative individualist in Dreiser's \\"The Genius\\" and Conrad's \\"Victory\\" is the same character that Mencken is. For that matter, Ayn Rand seems to be in a similar class as Mencken.

The same thing about how she started singing when she was 5 and the same story about her father sending producers home because Beyonce was not ready at that time.Then, the concert is interrupted by strange cuts from backstage.

Clearly, her voice is in fine form with its new gospel-inspired stylings. But this video does not do anything to inform the viewer about the film's subject, Beyonce. It feels very over-polished, slick, and completely forgettable.It's too heavy on material from her DC period, and the story-telling aspect of the show wears on the viewer after a while cuz you never get hear full versions of the songs. The video clips interspersed between performances does nothing to create the sense of intimacy with the entertainer as most concert footage should do.In the end, the viewer is left feeling unsatisfied and wonderding if the purchase of this DVD was worth the money. It isn't.

Time after time, she is repeating the same routines... I for one am tired of it. Most of the show is devoted to Destiny's Child's music. Beyonce has enough music of her own to finally stop performing the songs of her former group. I think it's tacky. On top of that, there is a little too much video footage being thrown in while the focus should be on what's happening on the stage.

LOADS OF FUN!!!!!!","review":"Thanks for such great service. Item was well packed and shipped quickly. I will be back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Love this game. Wished I'd bought it sooner. For those who ever wished for a little more comedy in a game, this is one for you. Has multiple difficulty modes, the only one NOT there is \\"Easy\\". Interesting story that can keep you confused or wanting to hurry up and find out more. Anything you didn't quite before, you can go to some of the in-game libraries and look for a slightly detailed (or simpler) explanation (i.e., a description of what a fonon was). Only until I looked in an in-game book did I really get what was going on at the start of the game. Either way, it was a significant buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of the Abyss","review":"\\"Tales of the Abyss\\" is another game in the series for the PlayStation 2, made by those who made \\"Tales of Symphonia\\".Because of that, it shares many similarites to that in how it plays. The game is all in 3D, and you're able to move in 3D on the battlefield. This adds a lot to the game, but also makes it a little easier as well, as it's not a difficult task to just go around an enemy. The game also introduces things like FOFs that make fighting a very fun experience to just mix and match you attacks and make combos. There are also various difficulty modes that can be switched to make the game either harder for those that want a challenge.There's a large amount of voice acting in the game, tons of sidequests, and the story is nice as well with interesting characters. The game lasts about 50 hours overall, and when you consider the sideusts the game could easily reach pretty close to 100 hours. Overall this is my favorite of all the games in the series released in North America."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best tales game","review":"I bought this because I enjoy the tales series and i wanted to play an rpg because I only have a wii and a ps2. The main character is not very likeable and his blonde haired boyfriend isn't either. The story is not good at all and I played a good 15 hours into this game. It was also annoying when I got to this particular dungeon and ran out of gels.............. after that I felt it wasn't worth it. I am playing tales of symphonia: dawn of the new world now and love it! I would recommend this game to anyone! Go get that game instead it is for the wii! Also that stupid blue rat gets annoying and isnt even funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts OK, gets better, then gets worse","review":"I don't ask much from a game, but button mashing is one thing that drives me nuts. The game seems to stop for scenes all the time. What is the point in giving me control over the character to take two steps to start a movie, then get control and take three steps to start a movie. That is how this game starts (and many others) and then that is how this game ends. The middle is pretty good but about 30 hours into it I could not wait for it to end and even skipping anything extra it still took another 15 hours to finish. It was not bad enough to just give up but darn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"RPG Game for Non-Gamers","review":"I'm not normally a person who plays videogames, and hardly one who likes RPGs. I usually start them and leave them halfway because I lose interest. I picked this game up on a whim, since I had heard a lot of good things about it. I wasn't expecting much, but Tales of the Abyss consistently kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. The battle system is extremely fun, the story is very engaging and heartfelt, and the cast is full of colorful and complex characters. Even for someone who gets tired of games quickly, I never got tired of this one. I recommend it highly, even if you aren't someone who likes games that much like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This game has poor graphics. The storyline, dialog, and voice acting are all very lame. The music is unremarkable. The gameplay, while fast paced, I found mundane.This game is a hybrid of sorts between an adventure game with JRPG cliches and a fighting game such as Street Fighter or King of Fighters. The fighting game aspect is really like a poorly made fighting game, though. It features gameplay from both adventure games and fighting games, but excels at neither. Tales of Legendia has this same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Tales of the Abyss is a game you can easily immerse yourself into, and one that you can play for countless hours over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost legendary","review":"Nimmt man alles zusammen was ToA ausmacht(spannende teils dramatische Storyline, ausgezeichnete musikkalische untermalung, liebenswürdige Charaktere, Spieldauer von +90h, fantastische animierte Zwischzsenen)kommt man zu einem Rollenspiel das man getrost mit einem epischen Werk wie FinalFantasy VII vergleichen kann."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Update to the Tales game series","review":"I am a fan of the Tales series (tales of Symphonia on GC) and this is a great update to the series. The battle system is the first great update. In the GC game you were only able to focus on one player at a time, even though most of the time you play with a team of four and its a 2 player game. In Abyss the camera pans to the players that you are using, not just Player one. The fighting controls are basically the same but elements are added in this game such as Fire and Wind. Abilities are upgradeable also. Beyond the battle system, the storyline is a bit confusing and hard to follow at first, (kind of like the Harry Potter series if you only saw the movies) but the more you learn the easier it gets. The CG animation are worth the effort of getting though the game and the games' characters are complex, fun and interesting.This is a must have for any RPG fan, young and old. You will enjoy it more with 2 players.

Oddly enough, there are far more mistakes in the third edition of Gasiorowicz than the second.... it is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, but confusing","review":"This book is very confusingly put together, and I would not recommend it to a first-time student. Some chapters seem out of order, each chapter usually includes a very difficult end-of-chapter calculational example. The strict Dirac notation is not adhered to. The author throws in some advanced terminology without explaining it. I think it is a great additional resource for teachers or students wanting additional problems or review. Some explanations, however, are wrong--like the explanation of half-integer spin sign change on p. 244 of the 2nd ed. The 3rd ed. is seemingly crippled by references to the publisher's web site, to keep the book \\"thin\\" (and hence attractive to some eclectic group of quantum mechanics teachers that no one has met). Instead of this gutting, future editions of this book could use a coauthor to make it more reasonable and sensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum Physics, Gasiorwicz","review":"I used this as one of my primary texts at university (I did Physics at Oxford) and thought that it was one of the best (along with Schiff). Much clearer than many other standard texts which can get a tad involved, and emphasised some of the fundamental maths involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save it for later","review":"To call this an introductory text is ridiculous. We used it in my first quantum course and everyone hated it. I got another text from the library and stuck to that. This book is better suited as a reference for someone who is already familiar with quantum theory. If you use it to learn QM for the first time, it will leave you thinking that physics has nothing to do with physical reality at all, but rather with mathematical tricks. He almost never mentions the physical meaning of whats going on with the math. Very discouraging for the novice. If you want people to think you're smarter than you are, buy this book. Just don't tell them that you don't understand it either when they're flipping through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking in detail","review":"The author glosses over things without even hinting that there may be details missing. While the book does offer decent explanations on certain topics, it downright ignores important details that will leave anyone new to the material completely lost. The section on wave packets was the nail in the coffin for me. The author jumps from the initial Gaussian form to the solution without even mentioning that a fourier transform had taken place or why extra terms had suddenly appeared. Trying to use this book as an introductory text is brutal and completely ineffective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The book is not well written and rather disorganized. I read each chapter carefully. However, I am always very confused after I finished reading. The book did not show all the important steps in the derivation of formula. The examples are usually not relevant to the homework problems. Neither the examples nor the problems improve your understanding of the theory developed in the chapter. If you are forced to use this book in a class and find it not suitable for you, I recommend you to use Griffith(2nd ed.) as a supplement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a text to understand QM","review":"I started studying QM on Gasiorowicz text book but today I've realized that I had wasted my time without understanding anything about QM. Other books made it possible to let me appreciate the beauty of this theory and understand it really. This book is a terrible choice for students who are interested in theoretical physics and also a bad choice for those interested in experimental physics. Finally, the author often fully explains simple mathematical tools and completely jumps over advanced methods where a student may need help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't even bother with this book, it's a miserable failure of an introductory text. Despite this being the chosen text for my QM course, I had to look elsewhere for any sort of understanding of the material as this book just didn't cut it.For future editions, the author might try justifying some of the mathematical leaps he makes or offering some clue as to how to move from one step in a \\"derivation\\" to the next instead of leaving the vaguest details up to the reader to figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book, it is not worth [the money]","review":"This book is so worthless it even fails as a door-stop (barely 500 pages). His absolutely poor mathematical treatment is only outshadowed by his the innumberable amount of typos. He attempts to cram all of quantum mechanics into a book that fits in your pocket and the only thing that happens when you pick it up, is you gain five pounds.

Gasiorowicz contains weak explanations and attempts to be terse but fails miserably. Use Libboff or Cohen and Tannouji or any other QM text youll learn much more conceptually with much less reading. The only reason somebody would use this book would be if they had read and understood another QM textbook and wanted to needlessly read a bad book on a subject they know.

Quantum mechanics is ALWAYS difficult at first by its very nature, so those who complain that it is too difficult are probably just stupid or too lazy to actually read the book. The book does a good job on teaching bra-ket formalism and operator methods as well as solving for spin and angular momentum states. The book takes you through all the mathematical steps in a friendly way.I duly recommend for a sophomore/junior level college QM course.The only reason I with-hold the fifth star is because the book could have more interesting exercises and end of chapter problems ( answers to odd numbered problems would be good to)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst for Introduction, Good for review","review":"I Have read both Liboff, Griffiths, mcGervey and a few others and I have still not found as bad a book for introducing quantum. Besides the number of typos, the author skips mathematical steps like crazy without giving the slightest reason. In addition he just sites principles which you will not know the slightest bit about from reading this book. Most students in my class appear to have turned to Liboff at this point in time and I do not know of a single admirer of Gasiorowicz in my class, AND the semester is almost over!!!I suggest a combination Liboff for a rough idea of quantum and then Griffiths for an excellent and beautiful grasp of the concepts (introductory level of course.)P.S. - You just have to get over Griffiths placing the Schrodinger equation on the first page and then you're off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete but lacks motivation, examples, and pedagogy","review":"This is a complete and comprehensive review of Quantum Mechanics. Unfortunately, the text is best suited for someone with previous knowledge of the field and superior skills in mathematics of physics at a higher level than the book is actually used in (Upper-Division Undergraduate Physics). The book lacks cohesiveness required to tackle an abstract subject like quantum mechanics and skips many steps which are non trivial to the untrained reader. The book has essentailly no examples. It is good book for someone who has already done the subject but has forgotten it and wishes to relearn some of the concepts but is very confusing and shocking as a first book in this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"No organization","review":"There is one and only one thing wrong with this book - it does not teach QM conceptually by building on Mechanics. Instead it just states stuff, giving no reason for why things are done as they are. Overall, this book is terrible - bad for undergrads who will learn little, and horrible for grads who won't learn principles. Wiley has compounded the problem by moving large portions of the book online - WTF is up with that? Am I paying for a paper copy of the book or for internet access to a PDF? The sooner this book goes out of print, the better. The sooner Wiley goes out of business, the (even) better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort from former king of improv.","review":"Outpatients is a mediocre effort from the former champion of improf and off the wall humour. This is a studio effort with Gary Owens (the voice in Crank Calls). Winters no longer has the panache and madness fans have always known him for. When a new cd has a track featuring an imitation of Johnny Carson, Jimmy Stewart, or John Wane (tracks 6, 3, and 13) (voiced by Rich Little) you know somebody's out of touch and out of date.If you really really want a Jonathan Winters cd to add to your collection, then this might fit the bill. Otherwise, this is nort worth it.I am a Jonathan Winters fan and keep hoping someone somewhere will release the old material. I bought this because I am a fan, I am probably going to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want the complete set","review":"If you're expecting the warm and funny Johnathan Winters from,say, \\"Mork and Mindy\\" or even earlier, don't buy this cd.You will be terribly disappointed. There is allegedly funny stuff on this cd I wouldn't repeat here or in polite company. It has nothing to do with it not being politically correct, it's just disturbing.If you feel the need to have a complete set of Johnathan Winters work, by all means, buy it. But I wouldn't expect you to enjoy it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Introduction to Christian Rock","review":"Cut and Move is the first song I heard from these guys and it was just a clipit on my phone but my intense curiosity was piqued. There are two songs on here that have the same effect on me as Desperate by Decyfer Down. The first is the Rain Song and the second is Cornerstone. Great, great songs. Very powerful songs. My kids are starting to sing along to Rain Song. It's very neat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"I saw these guys live and was blown away by their energy and driving sound. I bought their cd and was not disappointed! This disc is simple, straightforward rock. No frills, no complex lyrics, no complex music for that matter. Just rock....and it works. A great cd which speaks volumes about one man's faith and a life changed. My favorites are \\"I Am The Door\\", \\"To Fly\\", and \\"Jacob's Dream\\". The riffs on that song are what power rock is about. I can't wait for their sophmore cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and uncreative","review":"Yup..those are two of the biggest problems with Day of fire. They have an overused hard rock/grunge sound to begin with, and all the songs on the album sound exactly the same. Cornerstone, Through the fire and Time stand out on their on, whereas the rest of the songs sound too formulated. Hopefully there next release will be a bit more creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Messages Set to Awesome Music","review":"This c.d. has moving messages set to awesome music!This music has both a rock and inspirational feel.I was slightly shocked, actually, to walk into a clothing store where I usually hear mostly alternative rock and pop music, but heard the song, \\"Fade Away\\".I thought, \\"Wow, a Christian song is being played in a place where Christian music is not typically found!\\" I was excited!A five star rating, in my opinion, does not fully do this c.d. justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESNT WORK","review":"THEIR WEBSITE SAYS IT SPECIFICALLY WORKS ON A SPECIFIC CAR BUT IT DOESNT.

I really liked their song \\"My Boo\\" and I was disappointed to not only not find it on this cd, but the overall quality of songs on this cd were not as good as \\"My Boo.\\" The only part of this cd that I did like was the fact that they stick to their roots and keep the bass pumping through the whole cd. I really wouldn't recommend buying this cd though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"This DVD is 10 minutes long and either shouldn't be for sale or it should only be $5.

Don't waste your money...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is an album for all occasions and came as a complete surprise when I first bought it some years ago now. As a fan of Garth Brooks (and a few other country singers) at the time I was familiar with Gary's songwriting skills but nothing prepares you in advance for his wonderful soulful singing voice, turning all of his songs into the definitive versions at a stroke. With sympathetic backing and excellent harnonies, this is an album to treasure and to savor at regular intervals (although perhaps not when you have just split up from a loved one or when your children leave home!) As one reviewer has noted, this is an album to take on a desert island if you were to be stranded, the songs easily standing the test of time and each one of a quality matching the famed songwriters of the jazz and easy listening era. This guy is one of the very best writers of song and melody in modern popular music, and if you don't believe me, check out this album. You will not regret it. Indispensable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth finding","review":"Angel'in Heavy Syrup hail from Osaka, Japan. Unlike their contemporaries the Boredoms there is nothing harsh about them; their lyrics are sung, not screamed,and their guitar style is more similar to the Jefferson Airplane or Blue Cheer. Their bassist/vocalist Mimeko sings angelically over droning guitars laden with effects; the effect is an ode to and a reworking of psychedelic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Obenski is Stunningly Original!","review":"A Stunningly Original song writer, Amy's music touches your heart string.

Covers all the stuff about PowerPoint 2007 you could possibly want to know, and then some. I make professional presentations with PowerPoint for the photography classes I teach, and it was quite a challenge untill I got my copy of this great book. I use many sophisticated graphics and transitions in my presentations and I was able to quickly learn how using this reference book.

This is \\"bare-bones\\", and \\"no frills\\" done to perfection. The coffee maker is made of very thin plastic, and the pins that hold the lid on are about 1/8\\" thick. I do not think they would break unless they were twisted. The coffee maker failed to work after the 1st pot of coffee and I sent it back. I wouldn't even recommend it to send with your kid to college, because it's lack of a auto-shut off feature makes it a safety hazard. I really believe that Consumer Reports got it wrong by rating this so highly.Unless your after a \\"no-frills\\" coffeemaker, I would not recommend this pot. I have since purchased a 12 cup Cuisinart DCC-1200, which has more features, and is a quality product. It is worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"RV Coffee Maker","review":"We bought this coffee maker, after much research, for our new RV because of the size and features it had.

That's why I was so disappointed to get this book and find most of the recipes are mediocre, at best. There isn't anything in this book that tastes like real, good, Mexican cooking. You can find better in many other books. I just cringe having to say this when I'm such a fan of Doris's other books, but her Mexican book and her Italian book just...rather suck. I've had so much better in other books. Save your money and maybe check this one out of the library to try a few recipes first, and see if I'm wrong. If you agree with me, then you aren't out any money. Sorry....this one just flat misses the boat on flavor and excitement.

One on the best songs on the album. Some of my other favorites are: Boom, Boss Up, Hard Times, No War, Brick, Pay, and Woo Woo Woo, which has a music video. If you haven't seen the music video for Woo Woo Woo, definately check that out. And if you haven't already, go and grip yoself a copy of Repentance.

I have all of eshams cd's plus all the natas cd's. This is my personal favorite of all of Eshams works. Esham has been a great emcee for a very long time and basically helped launch the careers of kid rock, eminem, insance clown posse, and others. I also like the fact that esham has stayed underground, does his own beats, and works with all sorts of different underground artist. I would also recommend Judgement Day, Kill the fetus, and pretty much anything with esham on it if you are a fan of acid rap. Easily the most unacknoweldged artist from detroit, but definatly the best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Book, Shangri-La, and Repentance","review":"During the time of this LPs release... we all know what Psychopathic was up to. It was more personal music than anything. You can feel that when you listen to the LPs that came out during that era. Twiztid made Green Book. ICP made Shangri-La. Esham made Repentance.Esham goes off, but c'mon now it isn't \\"Unholy\\".So just know that this takes it in that direction if you are a new Juggalo.Don't get me wrong his oldschool stuff is scary. It has a lot of bass to it. So you can drive around really slow listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst Album","review":"Esham has made a living off being an evil, explicit rapper that was 10x more controversial than anything eminem ever released. The extreme and often twisted philosophy on life was well represented in his previous albums. Now, however, he is not as aggressive on the mic anymore, the underground sound of the icp label sounds cheap in a bad way, not like the minimal beats and synthesizers found in Natas's \\"Godlike.\\" He seems to take himself to seriously on this album, rapping about anti-war, and his true love relationship with his girlfriend. No longer is he a creative, funny, disturbing rapper like kool keith or edan. He has lost his edge and has delivered an album like any other mainstream rapper but not as well produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repentance is my personal fav Esham","review":"Repentance was Esham's Debut Album on Psychopathic Records and in the height of ICP's feud with Eminem,Esham is also at war with Detroit's Emcee being as he is a Legend in the Underground Scene.The Album starts off hardcore with Bang and takes into great tracks like \\"Woo Woo Woo\\" with a strong beat and catchy lyrics,\\"back in the day\\" which takes shots at Eminem,Dr Dre and D12 and \\"Hard Times\\" with ICP which does the same as well as being a really good track.\\"Look at Me\\" with Twiztid and \\"Boom\\" with Violent J are the Album's stand out tracks in my opinion.I love J's verse in Boom and he comes harder than E actually.The only tracks that i dont care much for are \\"Boss Up\\" and \\"No War\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell La Good!","review":"I have been on Acid Rap for years.

Dinah Shore giddily singing without realizing she is annoying everyone? Pee-Wee and a group of Marines in a dance number? The answer is you can't help but enjoy every minute of it. This special just oozes fun and camp. But the real incredible thing is that it's all about something positive - selfnessness. And this moral is never beaten over your head or made overly sappy. It's simply part of the whole.Pop this DVD in and kids as well as adults will eventually stop what they are doing to watch the amazing antics.

There is tons of action, further character development (when you thought you knew everything) and so much going on you thought you couldn't keep track of it, but because it flows so well you do. Sonea is fully \\"there\\" as a character in this book. We get to know Akkarin, The High Lord, much better - where we just glimpsed him before. Akkarin actually turned out to be my favorite character. He is very complex, not unlike most humans. Cery, has a much larger role. I missed him in book 2. The story of Dannyl and Tayend, which was a little tedious in book 2 for me, is very enjoyable in The High Lord. All the way around I feel like Trudi did a fantastic job of keeping you guessing. If you want an author that will always surprise you Trudi Canavan is the one for you.....and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. what a trip into a fantasy world!","review":"I was hooked on the story almost from the first sentence and I thouroughly enjoyed this book.(Actually, this applies to all three books in the Trilogy.) Trudi kept the action moving and kept adding surprise twists to the plot throughout..including the Epilogue!All of the varied major characters were well introduced and their individual stories wove well into a complex and complicated plot. I found myself quickly involved emotionally with almost all of them, both the heroes and the villans. I loved it! It's a good thing I purchased the entire trilogy at the same time as waiting for the second and third books to arrive via second order would have felt like forever!

I will never read any other books by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I can't imagine what is possessing people to say they love this book.

However, the plot moved so slowly it wasn't until the last two or three chapters of each book that things finally started to happen.

Now that she has a boyfriend forget being strong and smart, he does all the work.The ending was the worst disappointment, I'm not angry he died but its how he died.

But, hey, live is not always a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, some real action","review":"After 2 books of not so important and pretty predicatable plot, finally, a little twist in the story! The only annoyance as always are the narrations deviating from Sonea's plot. Danyl was poorly developed character, his story did not tie in well at all. Finally though High Lord's secrets are revealed! Too bad we only got to meet akkarin in the last third of the series and got to spend so little time with him. Really, this series was a great page turner, couldn't put it down, but had some majar flaws (lots of boring and redudant explanations, undeveloped secondary characters, pacing issues, lots of magical/fanatasy cliches) but what redeemed it all for me in the book was the fact that I really couldn't put it down and the High Lord's appearance in the plot. Mostly more of a young adult fanatsy book, light and easy to read, nothing too deep involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book out of the Trilogy","review":"Loved the first book as we followed Sonea's journey through the Magician's Guild training & her relationships w/ Cery, Rothen & the High Lord. I didn't really think there was much in the 2nd book. Although this last book wanders a bit, it wraps things up nicely and offers us a bit of romance as well. (No SPOILERS here) I'm actually reading over certain parts in the beginning as they are hints of things to come! Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but...","review":"I really wish that more time had been spent with Sonea and Akkarin. Their story felt too rushed - as though the author was told to make cuts because everyone knows that sf/f books just have to always be trilogies. I hated the ending, because it's not what I wanted, but I can't wait for more Trudi Canavan books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"This is a truly beautiful work. I've bought some CDs at the local record store and was very disappointed before I wised up and started looking through the reviews here at Amazon for some better material. This looks not like a Western collection, but like an actual Chinese CD. The liner notes have a rather melancholy feel to them, and this is reflected in some of the music showcased here -- piece number 4, Parting and Yang Guan, is particularly moving. The instruments evoke deep emotions; one in particular (I don't know what it is called, but it sounds like a violin) literally does not \\"play\\" but rather \\"sings\\" these sweet, expressive, minor-keyed melodies. The haunting voice of this instrument weaves itself all throughout the pieces, narrating stories that are foreign and yet very, very real to a western listener. This collection really deserve the title \\"Masterpieces\\". I only wish I knew where to find other works of this high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best...","review":"I dissapointed in quality of album, songs too modern, not tradition enough. For real fan of chinese classical, sound not enough Chinese!!! Much song too westernized. You should like to try album of the title \\"Rain Dropping On The Banana Tree\\". It has the old songs actually record in old time, not much western influence, is more traditional opera and chamber music. Earliest date for song recorded on that album is 1903!!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Eight years ago I turned all of my property into oriental gardens.

It is a perfect way to center myself in my car with my surround sound speakers both before and after driving my way to work. It is great listening for just resting in a chair or doing daily cleaning chores. I would definitely recommend this CD to others, if you enjoy chinese music I do not see being disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"A great introduction to Chinese Music.

Definitely reccomend this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Unless your hair curls very easily vast amounts of mouse/thickening spray before blow drying and lots of hairspray afterwards will be necessary to accomplish any kind of style with this tool.

If you want a straight kind of styled look, this might be for you. This \\"curling\\" iron is really a monster. I was hoping for some bigger volume curls but it didn't turn out so well. I really would suggest going smaller. You can use it to get a pretty cool straight look but that's not personally what I needed. So it really does depend what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it love it!","review":"I love this curler. Although it is a little heavy. I got used it.

Gosh, this thing is HUGE!!!! I tried it on my hair...nothing. No curls at all. I have flat, very flat hair and I want some fullness and body but it did nothing but made my hair hot and some ugly tiny flips on the ends. I hated it!This thing can get so hot but it's so big and a bit heavy only a professional can use this on anyone's hair...or probably the more patient ones. I'm not that patient. I'm returning it today and probably get a smaller one at Sally's. I just found out that Hot Tools and Helen of Troy are the same and Sally's carry Helen of Troy. I use Solia flat iron to straighten my hair...great flat iron and I can even make curls with it. This thing give no curls at all. I'm not surprised though...just a wrong choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heats up well!","review":"Bought this because i wanted big curls. Doesn't really work unless you have really long hair to be honest. Mine is medium length and it just kind of gave me a little undercurl at the bottom and made my hair seem a little more voluminous. I'm sure this sized barrel works better if you have longer hair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it didn't work for me!","review":"it didn't just work for me that's why i returned it about four days after i received it. I really wanted the big curls that's why i got it, but because the curling iron is big, and gets really hot, i could not get the curls i wanted. Hence, i ended up getting burnt. i guess it might be perfect for people with very long hair (mine is in neck). may be in the future i will buy a 1inch curling iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome curling iron!","review":"Very pleased! Super fast shipping! I ordered this item on the Monday (Sept 22nd) and I received it that Thursday (Sept 23rd)! This is an awesome curling iron!

For that reason I would purchase from this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome Hot Tools- supertool2","review":"I just got mine today and is perfect love it ..i have layers so this was perfect for straight hair.

I love them because my fine straight hair actually holds a curl with these irons. Unfortunately the first time I turned this curling iron on to use it the gold started PEELING OFF! I didn't even know that this was possible! I'm not really sure if the major chunks of metal showing through will damage my hair or not...but I'm just completely shocked that the gold peeled off. Maybe I just got a defective one...never had these problems with hot tools before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supertool 2\\"","review":"I'm not real happy with my new purchase, I have used hot tools for years and the quality on this one doesn't seem to compare to the others I've owned.

For people with thick hair I feel it works really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased.","review":"When I ordered this, I knew that it would not create curls, but I did expect it to put curl or volume in my hair none the less. When I first tried to curl my hair, it came out straight and looking as though I had not done anything to it. I spend about an hour curling my hair in different ways hoping to see some sort of curl to it, but I saw nothing. I, who is usually pleased with anything done to my hair, was completely unsatisfied and I will be returning the curling iron. If you are hoping to see big curls, or any curls in that matter, do not get this iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I have been buying off amazon for a year now and never have I been so disappointed in a product. I bought this curling iron because I wanted wavy hair (and also my hair is long, past mid back). I didn't really expect to get a curl out of it because it is a 2inch. Regardless, I was pretty sure I could get some huge beachy waves. This thing wouldn't even wave my hair and I don't have hard to curl hair either. Major disappointment, waste of my money and time.

Go to the drug store and get one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase if you want curly hair","review":"I purchased the 2\\" curling iron for my daughter. The good news is that it arrived very quickly and the price was competitive. The bad news is the 2\\" curling iron does not curl hair. I guess it is just tooo big of a diameter and because of that, it only gives a very gentle curl on the very bottom of the hair. It acts more like a hair straightener than a curling iron. I would not recommend purchasing this curling iron.I wish I would have read the other reviews about this curling iron before purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One tool, two functions","review":"I recently started to travel more with my job than I did in the past. I needed to cut down on the amount that I pack! This was one place I was able to do it. This is not only good as a curling iron, when you use it, you don't need a straightner either! As far as heat goes, this thing packs it! This makes natural looking curls and if your hair is shorter, it will just curl it under. I highly recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it! But it's big!","review":"I needed a replacement curling iron for my medium-long thick hair and I thought this was the same size as the one I was replacing...needless to say I about fainted when I opened the box! It's huge! I thought about sending it back and thought..-my fault I didn't order the appropriate size (should have been 1 inch) To my surprise, I spend less time with the bigger cylinder! Only drawback is I keep burning my forehead because I'm not used to the huge size! Now I use two irons...one for my bangs and this one for my long hair! Still spend less time though! I recommend it highly! I turn it on and leave the room to finish up my routine in the bathroom, not more than 2-3 min and I come back and its heated perfectly! I like the switch on/off button. It's more user friendly than my smaller one... The weight of it is barely noticeable for the size being so much bigger..Just keep in mind if you are moving up in size it will require adjustments on your part."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called a straightener.","review":"I have long, curly hair all the way to my waist and I was looking for something to give me beachy waves that a 1\\" curler does not. I guess I can't say that it is a bad curler but it definitely does not make curls, it simply straightens hair and makes it curl out or in at the bottom. I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to. This one was just TOO big!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Curls fine, but falls apart","review":"When this curling iron came with extra springs, I should have known what was coming. I used it twice and the spring tweaked and wouldn't roll correctly, I have replaced both springs it came with and it did the same thing, so now I have to push on the thing to get it to close around my hair everytime I use it. I would not recommend this product to anyone and am now buying a new iron from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curling iron 2\\"","review":"This is a very nice curling iron for any hair type. The only con to the product is the handle is a little smaller than they used to be made(I would have given it a 5 star rating if the handle was larger). It is still a nice product and I use mine everyday. You can do a quick large curl or a straighter look with the tips of your hair curled under or up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! Pulls out your hair!","review":"Maybe mine had a spring too tight, but it pulled out a lot of my hair. I've had several curling irons and I've never had one rip at my hair like this one.

I am thinking I was not the first to return this iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives big beautiful long-lasting curls","review":"This is a high quality curling iron. The gold barrel coating allows my hair to slide over when I want it to. There are loads of temperature settings. When I received this curling iron I immediately began working on my hair.

I washed my hair the day before so it couldnt have been that. im very disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for straightening & end curl","review":"This Hot Tools SuperTool 2\\" Professional Spring Curling Iron does exactly what I wanted: Straightens the wave left from my 1 and 2 year old long hair perms, and curls the ends. It may be because I have the old perm that keeps the curl in place for days. But, it works even better and faster than I hoped. I hesitated having straight hair because of the extra time it takes to make it look nice. But this curling iron is so quick, it only takes 10-minutes to make my hair look professionally styled.I spray One 'N Only Argan Oil lightly all over after air drying, before using the curling iron on the mid-heat setting. The old perm remains straight and the ends stay curled for 3 days, until the next shampoo. (My hair is 18\\" long, very thick, Asian hair that is black underneath and half natural silver-gray on top.) This is a great curling iron: Quick to heat up and super easy to use!

It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism. The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it. The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos. Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'. It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers. Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie.

I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solarbabies Rocks!","review":"Solarbabies is a futuristic movie about a group of kids (ages 7-17)living in an orphanage. None of the kids knows where they came from or what the outside world is about. That is, until they get a chance to go beyond the walls, both the walls of their captivity and the walls of their perceptions.

For all of you who wrote negative reviews, you just have no soul if you did not \\"get\\" this movie.A group of orphans overcome obstacles to make their lives better, to save the earth from total destruction. A classic good vs. evil overall theme, and also survival of the fittest. Some of the meaning is lost in the ineptness of the creators of the film, but if you have any scrupples, and just a little heart and soul, you will understand it!

If you like this movie, you will also like \\"28 Days Later\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The premise has seen better days, and lots of them. It's a post-apocalyptic world, a Mad Maxian place that trades in water rather than fuel, with a giant evil corporation thrown in for fun. The major dramatice tension comes from two teen gangs, one (the bad guys) associated with EvilCorp. And, when not pressed into near-slavery, they seem to get around on roller skates with headlights. Why there are skatable roads back and forth across the desert, so conveniently paved, cleared, and maintained, is beyond me, but there it is. Including that one straight into the secret domain of the goodguy Eco-whoozis. Oh, and the evil scientist - can't forget the evil scientist.Utterly forgettable.

HOWEVER, after a few more listens I LOVED IT! I think this reaction is because it is not like anything she has done before. I love the smokey, sultry nightclub feel of this album and the orchestrations are great. Babs is a mature artist and her choice of material and arrangements and voice all come together to show us a new mature, contented and yet wistful Barbra. The design of the packaging on this cd is really well done and includes a dvd with 2 songs and commentary. Wonderful to watch.

For the rest of us, Streisand is in better voice than usual but this disc is like buttah: bland. Every note that comes out of her mouth is self-concious and overwrought.

I ended up finding the same thing for about $2 at Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding me.","review":"Nearly $16 for ten small screws in a plastic tube? You have to be kidding me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on Target","review":"I have enjoyed this book which provides a good blend of 'understanding your camera' with 'how to work magic with it' in CS2. I have recommended the book to others; especially those confused with all the camera and CS2 technologies. I refuse to lend it as I'm afraid I won't get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good, disappointing","review":"This one, well, I love jazz, but this one isn't good. I gave it as a present and was embarrassed about how it sounded. I went into it blindly and won't do that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Does Not Work!","review":"This rug tape does not work at all. It barely sticks to the back of a small area rug and doesn't stick to the floor at all. The rug slips and skids around just as much as it did without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely does NOT work","review":"It does stick to the rug but it doesn't even pretend to stick to the floor. My flour is a Korel tile and I got down on hands and knees and washed and dried it before putting the rug down. I stood on it for several minutes and left it alone for hours. It was like I had done nothing. The rubber backing on the rug itself provided more traction than this stuff did. I can't believe they are charging $10.00+ for this stuff. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and relaxing","review":"I just stumbled on to this CD being a big Ozric Tentacles fan.This is amazing if you like spacey layered synthesizer music. Most tracks have a soothing feeling to them. I turn this on at work if I'm stressed out. It has the compositional flair and complexity that the Ozrics have without the intense guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"mic check","review":"black dice sounds more like negativland than any of the bands the first reviewer mentioned- we all know what bands are from japan. you don't have to name check. i can name check better than any of em- fursaxa, nurse with wound, sun city girls, sunburned hand of the man, new blockaders, double leopards, any other band on the basic obscure level and black dice doensn't sound like any of them. to say that black dice sounds like merzbow (there are elements that resemble merzbow), melt bananna (Not even close) and the boredoms (what the hell is wrong with the first reviewer) implies that you are just tossing names off the cuff to show how smart you are when it comes to music. Thing is: do your homework. they are a great electronic noise band with ambient leanings. this is a great transitional album. not as good as beaches and canyons but worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"i am getting so sick of bands like this. they are the type od people who think they are doing somthing new! but they are not! it all sucks! their is no talent in this crap! some girl at work gave me this cd, saying it was awsome and i would like it. i love a lot of music from \\"80's oldschool punk\\" to \\"IDM\\". but this just tells me who ever made these tracks (yes tracks, you cant even call these songs) went on his computer made a bunch of stupid thoughtless meaningless songs, and called a album. i say CRAP!!!!!! ALL YOU INDIE ROCK NEW WAVE GOTH KIDS DIE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that useful for shopping","review":"Has some interesting background information about anime/manga but it is simply not that useful for shopping.First, any guide to Japan NEEDS to have the Japanese name of the store.It is simply impossible to match up anything without this as the English equivalent is often not found, especially if you're going to ask someone about where a store is.Second, there are quite a few places missing, especially of interest to any female anime fans out there. There is no mention of Ikebukuro at all, which is known as somewhat of the female equivalent to Akihabara.And the NHK Studio Park is also missing which would be of interest to fans of Domo-kun and other NHK shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"My hubby's favorite...","review":"My husband bakes his own multi-grain bread & uses, only, Trappist products to spread on his toasted bread. He enjoys it with a cup of tea, for breakfast. We try to use organic products, whenever possible. But, we make an exception for Trappist marmalades, cause they are, simply, the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written and photographed--a book you can use","review":"So glad I bought this book and can think of several people it would make a great gift for. I plan to use it as the basis of a few tours of New York (though at this point in my life, I'll only be sipping water at the later stops). What a fun thing to do with out-of-town guests--and the book will make you an excellent tour guide, as it contains so many great stories. You can tell that the author, Jef Klein, is a former bartender and somebody who knows and loves New York. Her passion for these places is contagious--it makes you want to visit them...or maybe head to your neighborhood bar and become part of the lore. The photos by Cary Hazlegrove are also incredible, and one of the great things is that they're in black and white, which is so fitting for the book's sense of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Father's Day Gift!!","review":"I just received this book and I LOVE it! Got it for my husband for Father's Day and he is going to flip when he sees it! He works in NYC and goes out all the time with clients and all of us to most of the places in the book. Now he'll have lots of stories from each place. The book has lots of insight and details about each bar and the pictures are wonderful. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The book is useless. All illustrations in black and white.Buy Photoshop Elements Solutions instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"mucho helpful for beginners like me","review":"I bought a new scanner and Photoshop Elements was included along with the scanner. This book has been very helpful. It's easy to follow, and there are plenty of examples, screenshots and photos. I don't think I would have figured out how to do so many things in Elements all by myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"The first third of thid book covers capturing digital images. The last 2 thirds mimic the manual that comes with the software. This is a typical computer users manual full of fluff and not much substance. Sorry but I took the book back to the store. So I would suggest looking around for a better book then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, but poorly organized, and written.","review":"It is difficult to find a well-written, well-organized book on computer software. To many of the writers well, can't write-- both on the macro level (they can't organize a book in a way that matches how people learn and use software) or the micro level (poorly constructed sentences, pointless paragraphs, bizarre \\"cute\\" asides). Lisa Lee is not the worst offender, but this book doesn't exactly escape the stereotype either. The book is not written in a user friendly way (i.e. starting with the most basic, important uses of photo editing and moving on to weirder stuff). Instead, it goes feature by feature (with little sense of priority) through the software, like a manual. I'm hoping other Elements books are better.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"If you need a book to teach you how to install the software this book may indeed be useful for you. But if you need any tips to actually use the software the book is unfortunately not helpful. Just read the manual once again instead, everything this book offers is already in there and you'll save money."},{"rating":"2","title":"All old music","review":"These are mostly old tracks that he had in many different cds. But he did change some of them around and added some new tracks. In Elegante de boutique he cut out Eddiee Dee and change the beat.In Al natural he added Yandel.And in Guasa Guasa is the same beat as the old one but with voltio and is a rap war song against Lito, Polaco and Don Chezina. He has some other hot songs with Tono Rosario and with Aventura."},{"rating":"2","title":"a hot album by tego","review":"this album was much better then his first, this is a must buy, for all the reggaeton fans ya should get this...its definatly bangin...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't hip hop music","review":"I don't understand why reggaeton artists think their music is profound and true hip hop. Reggaeton music is not a culture. Reggae and true dancehall music is a culture and those artist make music for everyone to listen to. If artists like Tego Calderon and Daddy Yankee want to put out music for everyone to hear. At least put out material in english y'all. Also, I've been labled a \\"Reggaeton Hater\\" just because I'm voicing my opinion on the genre of music. All I got to say to those people is, you guys don't know what the hell you're talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneer Work","review":"The work of Tego Calderon is also an example of the creativity that is possible to find in this genre. The lyrics are not as clearly understandable as Calle 13's for example but this is a recording that is very rich and complex and requires repeated listening, which is is a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tego is one of the BEST!","review":"As far as the kid further below saying these artists need to put music out in English, I'd just like to say, I think Tego's style, AS IS, is fantastic and probably wouldn't sound as hot in english...and I'm not biased, I'm white and lots of his stuff I don't understand at first, but it is that good that I'll go to the trouble of translating it so that I can listen to it and understand. As a lyricist, I think he is very profound. Tego's music is HOT and his style is unique and sounds amazing!! If you don't like it, fine, leave it as a matter of personal taste in genre, but you can't put it down because you simply don't understand it. Many people who don't speak Spanish still enjoy his music. As for the album, it's great, just like all Tego's stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that good as everyone says","review":"This album was k, defenetly not one of the best. Everybody seems to be recommend it, I defenetly do not. I am a big fan of reggaeton, this album did not provide me with the beats and the lyrics I was looking for. It is more for the spanish hip hop goers. Out of all my latin reggaeton CD's, this is the one I least listen to. The only one true song i like is Al Natural with Yandel."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-605d3511"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/63.md","filePath":"sponsor/63.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/63.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
