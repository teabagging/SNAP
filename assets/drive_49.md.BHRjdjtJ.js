I would want my money back if I had paid for it! Granted I am only trying my first recipe from it now (Linzer Roll Cookies), but the directions are contradictory and full of errors. For instance, the recipe tells you to roll the dough out into one 10 inch square and in the next sentences tell you what to do with the rectangles of dough. So we go from one square to some rectangles. So Nick, which one is it supposed to be? I guess I'll just have to wing it! Hello, isn't a professional pastry chef supposed to know his stuff? I'll stick with the King Arthur Flour, their new cookie book is fabulous as is their Complete Baking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of variety, great read, good cookies","review":"I've tried several of the recipes in this book, and most of them were very successful. A couple of the recipes were too sweet for my family's taste, but I made the chocolate chip cookies for my husband's office around the holidays, and two people said they were, hands down, the best chocolate chip cookies they'd ever had.The book is divided into cookie category sections (e.g., refrigerator, drop, bars, etc.) and there are many, many recipes with interesting backgrounds on all of them. There's also a great reference section in the back for ordering specialty items, cookie presses, and other things you might not find locally (although most of the recipes can be made with everyday ingredients & equipment).Overall, I think this is a wonderful cookbook and it's by far the best cookie book I've ever used. I turn to it again and again not only when I'm planning on making cookies, but when I just want to read about them and drool over the pictures, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I had high hopes for this book and was impressed by the variety of recipes it contained.

The 1 mg tablets allow me to fluctuate between the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this and know suffering.","review":"This book is utterly awful. The narrative changes from first to third person and back again for no apparent reason. None of the characters are believable and their actions make no sense. The plot goes in all sorts of bizarre directions, both to accomodate a clumsy interpretation of Revelation and also a seemingly random collection of photographs (a crowd of people waving brooms, a holiday snapshot near a big bell in Moscow - not terribly apocalyptic). As a novel, it wobbles between tedious and unintentionally funny. As a piece of religious propaganda, it's a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets just say it's not good.","review":"I hadn't even realized this book was still in print. Leaving any content issues aside, this is an extremely poorly written book. The characters are stilted, the perspective changes for no apparant reason and the prose is somewhat less than enthralling.

As one reviewer pointed out, he switches grom first person to third person. What he didn't tell you is Mr. Kirban actually got so confused he began switching back and forth between the two, sometimes in the same paragraph. To his credit, I will say that some of his \\"prediction\\" about modern life were dead-on. You see, the book came out in 1970, but takes place in the year 2000.

Kirban is also quite dogmatic on the issue of Christian rock music and Christian rock bands. He sees them as part of the great \\"End Times\\" apostasy. That is, anyone who is a contemporary Christian music artist is actually an apostate, according to Kirban.Another odd thing about this book, the narrative suddenly changes from first person as told by George to third person with George being spoken of along with the other characters.Finally, the end of the story as Christ returning to Earth riding astride a literal horse along with His disciples, including those \\"caught up\\" in the \\"Rapture\\" all riding on literal horses! Kirban undoubtedly interprets Revelation 19 quite literally!Intellectually weak like all the rest of this genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Core UNC Fans will find new information","review":"I recommend this book to true, long-time dedicated UNC fans. Probably no one else could read the whole thing. You will remember each game from your own perspective but Chansky gives you the details from behind the scenes. Many tid-bits and juicy morsals to satisfy your curiosity about the program and about the man. If you like Smith, this book will affirm your respect for him. If you don't like him, this book will not change your mind. Smith is presented mostly sympathetically, but his flaws are too numerous to hide, yet for the true fan, they are expected and when seen within the contaxt of his life, they are forgivable. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Also, I recently read \\"Playing for Keeps\\" about Jordan. There is no redundancy here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This!","review":"This is the worst piece of trash that I have ever seen pawned off as a vacuum!

I didn't even feel like expending the time, money or energy to ship it back to the store in New York that it originated at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very poor technical quality.","review":"This is the poorest technical quality release I have ever heard.

And I'm not a fan of Alfredo Kraus. To add to all that, the sound is unacceptable.This only deserve 2 stars because Callas is here, without it, it would be worthless. The five star Traviata is hands down the fab performance of the underrated Cotrubas/Domingo/Milnes recording. That is what Traviata is all about. Cotrubas sings the best sempre libera around, even better than that overrated singer from Australia, and far better than La Divina at this point of her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"This Traviata is not only wonderfully sung but also in great sound.

The picture clearly shows the hole in the middle (which matches our outlets). The ones that arrived have a hole at the top and bottom, which would (A) require us to drill holes in our drywall and (B) not be nearly as secure as screwing them into the plate (I suspect that the action of pushing the slider piece over will eventually loosen it anyway).Bottom line -- do not order this item from \\"Quality Deals\\".

Originally, I bought a lot of the regular outlet covers and only of these but have gradually been replacing them as I determine which outlets I need to access. While they are not necessary for those outlets that are rarely used, it is a huge time saver for plugs that you use even a few times a week (vacuum, computer cords etc.) They also blend right in and you wouldn't know they were child proof unless you went to plug something in.

This product only has a screw to fasten it to the outlet in the center with none for the top or the bottom (which is exactly opposite of what we need). You should check your situation before you order this outlet plate; it is unusable for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than Standard Covers","review":"These are a bit narrower than a standard cover.

If they say standard size, they should be standard size, not smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use the outlet once these are installed","review":"This outlet cover is great if you never plan on using the outlet. It keeps my son from sticking his finger in the socket, but the cover sticks out too far from the outlet and the plugs cannot make contact with the socket. It has been very frustrating.They're big and bulky but I found the box-type covers more useful then these. Its also been easier just to move furniture in front of plugs where practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"like the product, hate the price","review":"This price is a LOT for something that youll have to buy many of!!!! this comes with just one, and if you multiply the price by the amount outlets you have, youll be spending a lot of money.

There are very few books that draw together so many fine and seminal pieces of literature and play them against one another so well. It's a fine book.There are, however, features of the book which are just maddening. Did ancient religious scholars stop to question the historicity of Genesis 1-3? No, out of enlightened self-interest (and a strong wish to avoid being executed as an apostate) they did not. As the modern inheritors of that legacy, we are not quite so bound up in the literal. I think the editors, all very capible, might have included more material from the mythological, metaphysical, and allegorical readings of creation and fall.It is an exceptional book as it is--but it could be a real masterwork if some slightly more heretical material were included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended as a reference book","review":"Eve & Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender by Linda S.

So if you are looking for a relaxing yet informative book about Adam and Eve (sorry! \\"Eve and Adam\\") to read on the beach or while visiting your in-laws, do not consider this book.This is a serious, academic (to the point of near boredom!) book that demonstrates \\"the remarkable hold the story of Eve and Adam has on the Western imagination\\".So why four stars? I gave four stars because the book did not meet my objective-a relaxing read on Adam and Eve. Why not three star then? I did not give a three star rating because the book provided some serious information about the sad nature of gender discrimination.Recommended as a good reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but didn't keep my interest","review":"I found this book alternately interesting and boring. The stream of conscious narrative was an interesting perspective on the mind of a young boy. Overall, though, I wasn't engaged by the story, which didn't seem to go anywhere, nor by the inner life of the boy, which was too undeveloped to draw me in.Probably best for people deeply interested in New York or Jewish immigrant life at the turn of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"one bad thing after another happening to a pathetic little victim,\\" would have been a better title.","review":"I certainly couldn't top the review by A.

She does argue a theory about a particular phenomenon.Some people might be aware that the year 2012 is approaching us very soon.

It's not that this workout is difficult, but Kari's background is in dance, and this workout is evidence of that. Here it seems she's more concerned with displaying her dance ability than her step ability. It plays more like a dance routine and Kari uses the step as a prop. There's very little actual stepping going on, but there is a whole lot of ponying up and down, knee hopping turns around the step and just plain razzle-dazzle that tries to make up for substance.

It was my first exposure to narrative poetry and it has been my favorite book since then. When I read twenty years later that it was also the favorite book of John F. Kennedy it reassured me that he would avoid war at all costs. It is an anti-war story, and the devastation of war, the profiles of the all too human generals and of Lincoln are an important footnote of history. The poetry is musical and sometimes stark. He is able to impart the real devastation of war on the lives of those affected by it. I would reccommend it to anyone who loves poetry and history.

As a serious piano student, I was accomplished in playing Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. In fact, Glenn Gould's piano rendition of Book One was the first album I ever purchased. I was familiar with Gould's Bach interpretation, and when my Israeli friend heard my praise, he went to his cupboard and produced this recording. \\"You've never heard Bach played like this,\\" he said, smiling wistfully. He played the LP and the room was suddenly alive with the internal joy and rhythmic nuance that only the best Bach performers can capture. Over the years, I have returned to this recording for creative inspiration as it sounds as fresh and vital on the thousandth hearing as the first.

Elizabeth was paranoid about being a woman in a job populated mostly by men. She was weak and dependent, but she was surprised when she was expected to do more menial chores than the men.

I did not feel any. The assasin was cold and unsympathetic.

Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The book seems to lift sections from his previous works, slaps them together with shallow, almost robotic characters and leaves me wanting. The \\"Butcher Boy\\" series, is in my opinion, now dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Unusual Thriller","review":"Butcher's Boy grabs you from the start and keeps you going. The thing that makes this book so compelling is that you end up rooting for the \\"bad\\" guy.The protagonist of this book is a ruthless professional killer who has earned the nickname that is the book's title. Nonetheless, you end up hoping he'll get away from the even more awful people who hire him, and the police (remember they're supposed to be the \\"good\\" guys).Perry's descriptions of settings and characters in this, and all of his books, are excellent. This one is embellished by a tight plot and a point of view that is different from other novels.I wish I hadn't given my copy away as the book is now hard to find. Perhaps a publisher will re-issue it; or it'll be made into a movie (hopefully a good one) that will bring it back on the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting comparison to \\"Day of the Jackal\\"...","review":"This was one shrewd story. Accurately compared to \\"The Day of the Jackal\\", Perry puts the reader in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the green Justice Department analyst who is pursing a possible hit man on paper, as well as the flesh-and-blood hit man as he tries to escape from double-dealing employers and dumb old bad luck. Perhaps it is because said hit man is clearly bright and has such careful habits and such a will to survive. You wouldn't want a wolf in your back yard, but you do admire their skill, cunning, and life force.It seems that there are many mysteries set in and around Las Vegas lately but this one really does capture the seediness behind the scenes and the grainy textures of the life there.It is a complex, well-told story that is really quite unique in its approach and deserves a read if you're able.

Gobbi gives one of the great dramatic performances of any title role in opera. Sure, there are others who brought more resplendent voices to the role (i.e., Taddei and the 55 year old but magnificent Ricardo Stracciari), but neither of them gives a portrayal that is anywhere near as moving as Gobbi's. As for Callas: what is it about the quality of her voice that so causes your heart to go out to her immediately in sympathy? There is something so vulnerable, genuine and three-dimensional about her Gilda - it's hard to put into words. As for di Stefano, has anyone else so perfectly captured the Duke's mixture of charm and cruelty? And if that were not enough, Serafin provides us with one of the finest-conducted Rigoletto out there.As far as I'm concerned, this is a top candidate if you are choosing a sole version of this Verdi masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding. My favorite version of Rigoletto.","review":"Amazon's reviewer got it right. Callas is a marvelous Gilda, but she is not the only star of this performance. Gobbi is a superb Rigoletto. His musicianship is outstanding, and his interpretation is both strong and sensitive. Serafin keeps the tension going, providing us with a crackling interpretation. By the end the listener is drained emotionally.There are other good versions. For those looking for an excellent performance in more modern sound, I recommend the Guilini with Domingo and Cotrubas. For those for whom an older sound does not detract from a superior performance, this is the one to get.However, as I often say, in the end you will probably get both if you love this opera as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing","review":"How can the listeners say that Callas sang a good Gilda? To me, her voice is not only ugly, but her coloratura sloppy and lousy. Also her voice is dark and tired at the same time. She sounds at least 30 years too old to play Gilda. The quartet went ok because Callas had a large voice, and Gobbi and Di Stefano supported her. But it is a far cry from ideal. The caro nome was boring to the max. I don't find Callas's trill to be valid, nor her coloratura. Perhaps she should stick to Tosca or Gioconda.To be blunt, this is a big disappointment on all account except for Gobbi. I'm not too fond of Stefano either. And the sound is bland and colorless. I am returning this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad sound, shrill singing, not a good choice","review":"This has typical bad, bad sound with lots of noise. Callas uses her head voice trying to sound young, and instead sounded like a shrill soprano. This woman has no voice. How she conquered opera during the 1950's I'll never know. I think you all are suffering from \\"Emperor's new clothes\\". If you want to here Verdi as it is meant to be sung - and in stero, unlike Callas's mono, get the Sutherland set. She is the queen. It was Sutherland's supreme presence during the earliest of 1960 that force Callas out of retirment.P.S. Yes, I heard this recording in the college library...Gilda belongs to Sutherland, perhaps Callas should have sung the barmaid..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST RIGOLETTO EVER","review":"This recording makes Pavoratti sound steril and fat.

But the technique and stage presence is wondrous. I would get this set before it gets out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Genius!","review":"Gilda isn't a role for for canaries, per se. Please understand that the role of Gilda was written in mind for a character who was, at the same time both rebellious and innocent. Callas portrayed these colors very well, and to have someone say that she sounds old is an insult. Joan Sutherland, if I believe, is the one who sounds more like a 35 year old woman, and in terms of looks, I think it was Callas who looked more convincing if you put her in Gilda's costume than if the junoesque Sutherland did. And Sutherland's diction made her sound even more matrimonly. Callas could easily sing Gilda around Dame Joan. And as for di Stefano? What a great Duke! At least his voice is so much better than Pavarotti's cow bawling.

Joe Pettitt has done a great job explaining the inner workings of the late model Honda engines. In a country that's in love with the American V-8's, it's hard to find many books on the subject of import performance. That is one reason this book is so valuable to the Hondaphile.

What he finds is a web of corruption, greed, intimidation, and cover ups that make the lines between the criminals and law enforcement very blurry and non-existant in some cases. This is an extremely well researched and well reported book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very well-written","review":"I recommend this book for several reasons. First off, it is extremely well-written. There's no rambling, it's very well researched, and the way the stories and facts are expressed are not dry at all. The writer, Randall Sullivan, writes for Rolling Stone magazine, so it's presented in that style. Even if you aren't interested in the Tupac/Biggie story, this book still goes deep into the origins of the Bloods and Crips, East coast and West coast rap feuds, and especially, just how corrupt the LAPD was(and probably still is). I've read other books on these subjects, including the recently released book by \\"hip-hop cop\\" Derrick Parker, but this book is by far the best. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"After finishing LAbyrinth, I can say I am extremely pleased with Randall Sullivan's effort. The book was thoroughly researched, well written, and is the most definitive work written on the Biggie Smalls/Tupac murders. Although there are plenty of dates and facts throughout, the book's narrative is easy to follow, and it doesn't really read like a text. If you're interested in true crime and/or the rap industry's seething underbelly, then this should be a top choice. Also included is a startling portrait of the LAPD as one of the most corrupt police organizations in U.S. history. The binding thread in this book is Detective Russell Poole's investigation of Biggie's murder, and the subsequent LAPD officer ties to Death Row Record's executive Suge Knight. Highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Picture","review":"Although the pictures show a mickey mouse style connector on the cord, this is not what it is.

Another criticism is the very small maps for ranges of various plants. Aside from these points it is a good general guide. Of the many keys I have used in many different texts, the ones here are unique, combining a blend of taxonimic and non-taxonomic characteristics to make them useful and easy to follow. I was very impressed with the key for willows, which many books have a very difficult time with. The winter and summer keys were also helpful for many species.

I was, however, quickly disappointed because the phone fails to deliver on the most basic of functions. Daily I deal with calls being interrupted due to the handset losing communication with the base unit. Also, the unit has the capability of adding up to 3 additional handsets that all communicate with one base unit. I added one handset (which alone was more expensive than many complete phone units)and unfortunately, it only worked for a few weeks before it developed such horrendous static and interference that I just stopped using it altogether.My lesson learned from this experience is that just because it looks like a Mercedes doesn't mean it functions like one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not buying vtech again....","review":"I am disappointed in this product.

I could not pick up phone calls. I had to call people back on my cell phone when they left a message. It is cheaper to buy a new phone than to send the thing in for repair.

We found that, no matter where we placed the base unit, you had to be within 15-20 feet of the base in order to get decent reception.Oh, and the speaker phone??? Let's just say that you are going to want to be in a very quiet room in order to hear the people on the other end, even at full volume, but wow, hit a key and the tone from the phone nearly basts you away.

For no discernable reason (microwave or computer proximity; bad weather) the crackling can sometimes be so bad, I have to finish the call on a corded phone. Someone speaking softly can't be heard over the sound of whooshing air. Lot of great features, like calling from handset to handset, but other than that I can't wait to find a better system.

Main gripe -- we can't quite get use to the menu system -- get lost easily and it beeps at you. For example, finding a number in memory requires unintutitive keystrokes. I don't like fighting with my phone! Also -- when cradling the phone against my shoulder, I have inadvertantly muted the phone several times from my cheekbone pushing the menu button. Since the UI is clunky, I frantically try to unmute it and of course the caller thinks we have lost our connection. Lastly, you never want to lose the owners manual, because you'll never figure out how to program the phone without it.

There is a bit of an echo which gives the effect of trying to talk to someone while standing in a tin can. The range of this phone is not quite up to par with my old 900MHz phone, which means that I can almost walk out my front door without losing reception.

After reading other reviews on this phone I've noticed many people complaining about the range of it. For me the range is great. I'm able to go anywhere in the house and outside with it.

If you need something that goes beyond 100 feet, why don't you just use a cell phone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a terrific phone","review":"I'm not sure about the others complaining of bad sound/poor range. I found neither to be true. The range exceeds that of my last two 900MHz phones ~ 125-150 feet (through several brick walls). Loaded with features; the handsfree on the handset is very nice, although it can be difficult to hear with a lot of ambient room noise because the speaker is on the back of the handset and it gets washed out if the TV or radio is on. Very nice menu features and the volume control \\"goes to 11,\\" that is, the high end is probably louder than you'd like - which is a refreshing change (I'm sure the people that use the loudness feature on pay phones might appreciate this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemlingly nice phone, but serious problems lurk...","review":"Great feature list, but here's what doesn't work well:1. The phone randomly decides to reset itself, usually when you are picking up an incoming call. This behavior occurs on a colleague's phone as well.2. The handsfree feature is half duplex, and it works poorly enough that I don't bother using it anymore.3. The memory capability is simplistic and awkward. It doesn't share the phone numbers between handsets, and you can't edit a number that you receive through caller ID (well, you can edit it, but if you have to shorten or lengthen the number, you're out of luck) It'd be nice if the caller ID call back would automatically figure out how to dial based on your area code as well, but no such luck.I put up with this phone for a year, simply because I hate spending ... on something just to throw it away.

I even exchanged the phone for another one thinking it might be defective. Finally, I gave up and returned the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone","review":"Used this phone for 5 months now, and it's still working perfectly. I don't understand the various negative comments that I've seen. The only negative aspects that I've experienced are: (1)The caller ID display protudes a bit and rubs against your face when you are talking. This causes it to sometimes get smeared with makeup. (2) The range is a bit short. You don't lose calls, but at about 75 feet, it's sometimes a little noisy. The extended range function doesn't seem to do much to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem handsets","review":"I was attracted to the VTech because you could add additional handsets and use the intercom feature from handset to handset, which was convenient. The accessory handset failed after less than 2 weeks and the keypad wouldn't respond - couldn't dial or answer the phone. I exchanged the handset. The base handset then stopped ringing, not too convenient when you're in the yard, expecting a call, and the phone doesn't ring. I returned the phone. Two malfunctions in less than 4 weeks. On the plus side, I thought programming was very intuitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The features are great but sound quality lets it down","review":"Looks good and has nice features, but the sound quality and static is totally unacceptable. I tried all the solutions recommended in manual and FAQs on VTech website, to no avail. I contacted VTech customer support and they have been non-responsive. The static somewhat disappears when using the handset speaker, but the speaker seems to operate in half duplex -- so if I happen to talk at the same time as the person at the other end of the line, it echos back and cuts out. AND, when on speaker, the other party can't hear unless it is within a foot from my mouth. This phone has features I am having trouble finding in any other brand -- no answering machine, ability to add extra handsets, speakerphone, and headset jack. But it's going back and the search will begin again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best phone I've ever had","review":"This is by far the best phone I've ever had, I love the features, simple to understand (user friendly).

I have 2 handsets and they both crash when I answer the phone. Just read the info about waiting for the caller ID to process thru before answering and will try that. I called Vtech about this and they told me that it was because I have a satellite dish and satellite signals mess up the phone. They where unable to explain why satellite signals constantly bombarding the entire earth cause no ill effects, only if you have a dish to recive them. Thats not even as good as telling me they dont know. My advice if you buy this phone is to keep your phone at least 1 mile away from any parabolic reflective surfaces and live in a place that satellite signals can not penetrate if you expect it to work.(according to their rep) My advice is to buy any phone but this one,a 10$ phone will at least let you answer it EVERY TIME.

I received a range that well surpasses My VTech 900 MHz phone, and I also noticed that I did receive the break-up problem. Solution? I moved the base a few inches and VOILA! The problem was gone. I would definately recommend this phone because of its features, range, clearity, and expandibility. If you are in the market for a 2.4 GHz phone, they all have fallbacks. This phone seems to have the fewest."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.4 Gigahertz...I don't think so!","review":"My old Vtech DSS 900Mhz has better reception.

I called tech support and was told that frequency should penetrate through them with ease. Well, not so. I can't even show it off to friends and family. I might just get embarrased with this so-called 2.4 gigahertz phone. Another problem that I discovered is that the voice-mail indicator doesn't work.The design, however, is cool. Looks like a cell phone. I like the handset intercom. The sound is loud but again it breaks up. I will probably return it and get a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with a headset","review":"I live in rural Minnesota, am on call to a local hospital but also like to garden. I selected this phone because I liked the options of answering from the handset, or if that was missing, from the base unit. I liked its near weightlessness but found it impossible to balance between my ear and shoulder. I also wasn't fond of the echo I heard when I talked. Instead of returning it I purchased a Plantronics M175 headset and the difference was miraculous. I now love this phone, ignoring my husband's frequent remarks about taking orders for McDonald's. I have had no reduction in sound quality up to 200 yards (the distance to the mail box) despite the fact that the base is next to my refrigerator (not encouraged by the manufacturer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Reception","review":"Okay, I read all the reviews so I was warned; but the features were exactly what I needed so I took a chance. It didn't pay off. The features were fantastic: multiple handsets, speakerphone (one on handset is cool too), visual v-mail indication on base and handsets, convenient small size. The handset sound wasn't the best, but I could live with it.But the phone was totally unusable. First, the handset that came with the base worked sometimes, but it also often completely garbled my speech. I thought (hoped) it was just a bad handset, so I moved the extra handset onto the base. That handset had such bad reception that I was close enough to the base to switch to speakerphone yet the person I was speaking to couldn't understand me over the handset (the batter was fully charged).I wanted to like it, I tried to like it, but when it comes down to it, the phone has to support the basic functions of speech, and that's where this one fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this phone.","review":"This is an expensive phone and I was expecting better sound quality. It looks neat and I loved how it looks and its small size, however the sound quality was worse than my old Panasonic 49mhz phone that was 6 years old. There was a echo when I talked and a constant humming sound that I could not get rid of. For all the hype about 2.4 gigahetz phones I am not impressed. I returned it for Toshiba FD-9859 for less than half the cost and have been very happy with Toshiba's 900 digital phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"This phone drives me nuts. I wish I could return it. Half the time, when I press the button to answer it, nothing happens. The range isn't that good either. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recomend this phone","review":"I read the reviews and found them to be inconclusive. Some people love this phone, others don't. After spending a few days with the one I just bought (and returned) I have to say I come down on the negative side. There was an incessant hiss in the background which really got irritating. I also could not seem to get rid of a sort of echo/reverb that was quite distracting. While I liked the size of the phone, the handset is not paticularily comfortable to hold. The headset I tried, just made all the audio problems worse. Why can't someone make a small cordless phone that sounds good and works? The menu options are difficult to navigate, especially volume which varies from call to call for some reason. All in all, I would not recomend this phone.

Why this splendid CD is no longer available remains a mystery to me. His gripping account of Strauss's \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" may not be as exaggerated as others, but nonetheless it is a splendid version played by one of America's great orchestras. The Philadelphia Orchestra's playing is as lively and warm as any I've heard from their peers in Berlin and Vienna. Both Sawallisch and the Philadelphians are splendid partners for Emmanuel Ax, who offers one of the flashiest performances of Strauss's \\"Burleske\\" I've heard yet, replete with great keyboard pyrotechnics. By virtue of these two fine performances this CD is worth owning. As for Sawallisch's rendition of \\"Don Juan\\", it is fine in its own right, but isn't nearly as emotionally stirring as those from Reiner or Karajan. Let's hope this fine CD is available again soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received units that are different than described","review":"The units I received have much smaller shafts for the knobs than the pictured units and the shafts are not grooved to fit a grooved hole in the knob, they have a flat that requires the knob to have a set screw to attach them.

As it is, several of the guns have errors in the history section (i.e. Colt is still making the 1911) and they even duplicate some guns in whole (i.e. Beretta M9 and 92 are seperate entries). The book adds nothing to the game besides an unreliability mechanic, which is a seperate roll before you roll to hit, as opposed to building it into the to hit roll.(by this system, the gun jams just before you shoot it, as opposed to when you do.)The book was $20 discounted, and I'll probably lose money for sending it back, but it's not worth me keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"innacurate information","review":"In reading about one weapon i found it contained numerous innaccuracies.

At first, the plot seems interesting and well conceived. However, as she starts jumping around historical periods, following the trace of the sheet with which the body of Christ was covered and on which the image of Christ miraculously appears, the plot goes astray. Too many characters, and very few of them are fully developed.She tries to cover too much in 500+ pages....Knights Templar, a couple of french kings, Constantinople....and so on. The book does not involve you in any way. Definitely not a page turner.....Not to ruin the book's ending, suffice it to say that one of the greatest misteries in history is resolved in an extremely simplistic manner.I originally bought the book because it is a great hit in libraries in Madrid, which is usually a decent indicator of how good a book is, but in this case, big dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't compare to Dan Brown: She's far better","review":"Julia Navarro has style, investigates her subject well and offers a constant rhythm and an acrion packed plot throughout the book.

I live in Hawaii, so I just hop in the ocean and aqua jog about 500 meters and back, so it's not as boring as if I were in a pool. I rinse it off afterwards and keep it in my car.

I experienced a similar disappointment with a remastered Colloseum CD (Valentyne Suite) that sounds absolutely horrible in mono. At least give the consumer a choice between mono or stereo.

These comments refer to the mono releases (Snapper's \\"jewel case\\", Repertoire's and all the Japanese releases) - the stereo (Snapper's digipack) release is mastered within the CD's dynamic range, but the mix is very annoying, with vocals on one channel and instruments on the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"The Pretty Things were always a second tier outfit, and this dated, overhyped dud shows why.

Most of the acid trip relies on the masterful production (very close to what you would hear on Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\") and an appealing mixture of British folk and eastern music (of course, with a 60s twist).

The fullnes of her phrasing, and the insinuations of her low notes, give to the character the correct dimensions. Is an human and fascinating Turandot. Tullio Serafin conducts this opera masterly, with a lot of colors, and great expression. The rest of the cast sing very well, and in a refined way.

As for the tenor, he's even worst. All and all, a pathetic recording ( I returned it ). May I suggest the VHS tape with Domingo and Marton? It's visually splendid, and the singing is first class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten years too late but still incredible","review":"Who wants to know why Callas was adored as Turandot must go back to the few excerpts from Buenos Aires with del Monaco as Calaf. She breathes fire there! The EMI-recording is more subtle and even though Callas sounds tightened and strained from time to time this is the most colourful most expressive Turandot on disc. Not shrill and ugly like Marton, not flimsy like Ricciarelli, not bland like Sutherland and not dull like Caballe. Yet a little more security around the passagio might be a good thing.

Yeah, I got the thing working eventually, but only after cursing the people who wrote the instructions. You'd think that the company would expend at least SOME effort to make sure that the directions were clear and unambiguous.The directions say that the remote (outdoor) sensor doesn't work well in very cold weather (because the batteries don't function well). Well, since I live in the northeast, very cold weather is common here. If I knew this in advance, I wouldn't have bought the unit.I can't recommend this product. There must be something better available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waster your money","review":"I have had a variety or Oregon Scientific equipment and they are either just fine or total pieces of junk. This one falls into the junk category. It won't pick up WWV to set the clock and it won't pick up the outdoor sender unit unless it is within a few feet (less than 10') of the base station. Also, the outdoor unit does not send humidity, for that you need to buy another sender unit. Finally, the base station does not display indoor and outdoor temps at the same time. It can do one or the other or it can sequence through all 4 temperatures: one on the base station and 3 sender units and by the way, it cycles through ALL 4 channels even if there is no sender units on a channel so most of the time you will be looking at dashed lines and waiting for an actual temp to show up.

Then, the romance pretty much died out as they just had sex in different locations. The emotions that Hero & heroine seemed to have at the start of the book got pushed aside & wasn't expanded on as they went through their sexcapade.

Rumor Has It was a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recording","review":"A nimble performance that doesn't overplay the symphony's lusher moments yet doesn't shy away from the real emotion underlying the piece.The organ played by Eisenberg hasn't the deep-throated Anglo-German vioce often employed in recordings of the Third Symphony; instead it features a reedier, lighter feel that, as another reviewer here rightly puts it, gives the performance a decidedly appropriate French feel. (I've been partial to the Dutoit version on London/Decca for years, but after hearing Plasson's I must admit Dutoit's recording now seems a bit too busy for my ears, although I still find it excellent overall.)EMI's recording here is excellent. The instrumental sound is well-balanced, open and true -- not too closely micked but so distant the performance loses presence.Overall, a superb recording. I'm at a loss to explain why EMI allows some of its finest recordings (like this one) to float in and out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of the \\"Organ\\" Symphony by Saint-Saens, and this recording is further proof that it is splendid. A huge help to this recording is that of the French venue in which it was recorded. As another reviewer stated, it gives the piece an appropriate French feel to it. I also have to say that the orchestra and organist are all at the top of their game. The rhythmic accompaniments in the first half of the first movement are crisp and clear. The slow second half of the first movement (when the organ first enters) has a nice lush sound that is furthered by the acoustical environment in which this was recorded. Also, for those who have not heard \\"Cypres et Lauriers\\" before, this disc is excellent. Here again, the performers give it their all, and it really comes across. Overall, I would say this is my favorite recording of the Symphony, and also probably THE recording for the Cypres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'all don't even know....","review":"Don't try to comprehend how fresh and raw this album is... you'll hurt your head.

I gave it 4 stars due to the familiar hiss of the era's analog technology. However, I was so enthused after listening to this recording of Scheherazade that I continued to successively buy three more DDD & SACDs convinced there had to be a comparable recording with all the added audio spatial resolution. The increased fidelity simply showcased orchestral flaws that detracted from listening ease of that first Karajan recording. DG must re-masters this and Resphigi's Pines of Rome that will inevitably be worthy of a 5 star rating. You will not find a better performance. I highly recommend this recording even if you already have a different rendition. Karajan is simply the standard here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Karajan Standard","review":"Though to this day I consider Karajan to be unsurpassed as a conductor, this is one of the few of his recordings than can be avoided. As others have pointed out, the strings are particularly in Scheherazade polished but in the overall I get the feeling that the ensemble was not able to get their usual synergy. It sounds as little pieces of music put together one after another instead of a whole work. For Scheherazade I seriously recommend trying Gergiev's, Reiner's, Mackerras's or Kondrashin's. As for the 1812, again, not bad but far from being the best around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read about Astrology!

(all these names were on the video slipcase) was recorded in \\"SLP\\" (otherwise know as EP) speed instead of SP like most VHS tapes are. As a result, the picture and sound quality are poor - the images are fuzzy at the edges and the stereo separation is barely noticeable, and I even tried listening with headphones! Hopefully this movie will be re-done in regular DVD since I don't own a Blu-Ray and won't buy one just for this movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 70's Thriller with Olivier and Peck","review":"The DVD is ok, but other than that, this is a very good film concerning the pursuit by an aging Nazi hunter, played by Laurence Olivier, of Dr. Josef Mengele, played by Gregory Peck.

We know that it could be nice to add some notes if you are looking for some extra color but in this case, it is to much. I believe that it is not good for the audience because they are getting something that it is not by Bach. Also, the CD cover is not very atractive and the picture is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i love this bed set. it is soooooooooo cute. the only downfall to it is that the comforter doesnt fit the crib, it is too small in length, and too wide in width. the fitted sheet for it fits great though. when i went to buy it at the store located in vernon hills, il., they me that they were going to discontinue this set, and wouldnt sell me thier floor model, so i had to go to the schaumburg, il store which was totally out of my way and a pain in the behind to get to. so if youre looking to buy it, call the store beforehand to see if it is in stock or if theyll sell their floor model to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was just wondering...","review":"i started my baby registry today and when i saw this in the store it was for a mini sized portable crib. i was wondering if it would fit on a full sized crib? thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality & Good Price","review":"...With the Sleepy Time Snoopy set, you get the essential 3 pieces, all for a great price.

I liked that this book was an easy read; not a text book style manual. She explains her reasoning behind her techniques and tells you exactly what to do. I have taken Dressage lessons for 10 years, so I knew most of what she was saying already, but it always help to clarify what you have in your mind with another rider's opinions and experience. I gave the book to my mother-in-law who is just starting Dressage and she is finding it very valuable. She said that it gives her a guideline and a place to start with things instructors may take for granted; how to place your leg, how to put on a Dressgae bridle, and then good basics for lunging. She gives voice commands that work for her and my mother-in-law found that very useful.

She is an independent woman and hires herself out as a secretary to a distant relative who lives in a ruin of a castle in Scotland. He is disfigured, has an invalid daughter, very strange servants, and no wife (that she knows of). Of course she falls in love with him, but there are secrets all around.

I've just finished the 8 week program - it took me more like 10 to get through with my schedule, but I loved the organization of it.. each week has a different focus, and every day within that week a different angle on the week's focus... there are different versions of each pose so that you can really see how the placement of the body matters. the pictures were quite good and in the end, you have yourself weeks of practices that you can comfortably reconfigure over and over. this is a slow moving practice; generally you hold each pose for 30 seconds to several minutes. it covers a really wide range from standing poses to inversions. I really feel that I can just turn on some music, lower the lights, and comfortably make my own home practice on the fly of any length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beginner's Book","review":"I thought this book was great because it has so many different routines; you never have to do the same routine twice throughout the whole eight-week program, and every week you get to learn new poses. Also, the way the program is designed you really improve quickly, each week is a little more difficult than the week before it. After completing the program I felt like I knew tons of poses, and could easily keep up with many yoga classes. I really liked doing yoga from a book more than from a DVD because it gave me enough time to make each pose feel right for myself, I really learned to control my breath and set my own pace. If you are really interested in making yoga a daily part of your life, this book is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Transfer!","review":"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release A Bell From Hell, She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound.

The author spins the tale of two brothers and two sisters from separate families and different economic worlds but both faced with circumstances beyond their control. Ms. Fuller brings the characters to life giving each scene a rich, Irish flavor. The story is engaging and poignant, filled with suspense and romance. This book is not the end of the story, however. Book two is planned for release in either late 2006 or early 2007, continuing the tale.I look forward to the sequel and any future books by this author.

It's as useful for the mid-career changer as it is for the recent graduate. I do a fair amount of career coaching myself and I recommend this book as a solid resource for others in the field, as well.

Both my Hong Kong and US power cables mated perfectly with this adapter, and it held them with a solid grip.Last but not least, I tested the ground prong with my multimeter, and I can confirm that it conducts through to the ground plug on the other side of the adapter.Indian wiring notwithstanding, you should feel comfortable plugging your three pronged devices into this adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed for India.","review":"This was exactly what i needed to plug in everything in India.

With close to no exception, I don't like Phil Collins. I am not going to say that I'm a die hard Peter Gabriel era Genesis person either, cause I think there is plenty of that stuff that is incredibly overrated. The only one that actually gets it's due praise is probably Lamb. Both Foxtrot and Selling England have plenty of garbage tracks on them. Anyway...I'm getting a little off topic already. I bought this based on reviews that said it's actually still very complex, rich, and still full on prog. Which is completely true. The song writing here is splendid. Phil's voice is stellar, and his drumming ain't no joke either! If you like prog, give this a chance, you will like it. Guaranteed.

Granted everything isn't for everyone, but as a stalwart Genesis fan, especially with Phil Collins as lead vocal, I grew very fond of their music after purchasing \\"Abacab\\" and \\"Duke\\". I seem to have a soft spot in me that enjoys their music.

Trick displays the unique Englishness of the group, starting with that whimsical, Dickensian cover. Banks, Hackett, Rutherford, and Collins all step to the fore, showing that Genesis is as much about their considerable musical abilities as it is about Gabriel's unique theatrical fantasiesPart of the album contains a recurring musical theme: introduced in Dance On A Volcano, revisited in Squonk, and finally reprised in Los Endos. Hackett's acoustic guitar work shines on Entangled, while Banks displays the sonic marvels of his \\"banks\\" of keyboards to good measure in Robbery, Assault, & Battery. And then there is Ripples, a story of \\"the passing of time and the coming of old age\\", one of the band's most moving songs ever.Another fine album from a band that was once synonymous with intelligent, creative music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly less then stellar","review":"Obviously if there is enough mentioning of unimpressive remastering, they had to have gotten something wrong. Yes, there are some really well done passages that bring to light spectacular new dimension previously buried in the mix, but that is more the exception then the rule. There is just a certain detachment that prevents truly melding to the mostly awe-inspiring material, leaving a final product shiny in certain spots, though coldly balanced in muted tones.

One day, I saw the \\"Remastered\\" edition, so I tried it and I have been able to compare the older cd to the remastered edition because I have two cd players on the same amplifier, it was clear, the remastered was a lot better. When I saw the boxset of DTS version on the market, I decided to try \\"just one of them\\" and I chose \\"A trick of the Tail\\" instead of buying the box., just to see if it was really better. All I can say is \\"WOW\\", I never heard Genesis this way, the DTS version is simply amazing and I don't regret to have bought this album for the fourth time ! Check for my \\"remastered\\" versions of all Genesis album on EBay, I will buy all the DVD Audio version of their entire catalogue, the sound is simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis Part II","review":"This album marked a change in the band, as Phil Collins took over vocals after Peter Gabriel left the band. Perhaps to prove to the critics that \\"Peter\\" was not the band, the group created one of their most inspired albums and one of my personal favorites. The first time I heard \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" I thought perhaps Peter had remained in the band afterall as the vocal style was very similar. As the album proceeded you could hear Phil's way of singing was similar but yet different. The band is very tight on this album and with the remastering and 5.1 sound it is simply wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"With the departure of Peter Gabriel many thought Genesis was in trouble. They weren't. As the opener \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" shows Genesis were in top form, creating an instant classic. \\"Entangled\\" flows smoothly along with \\"Squonk\\", a very interesting number. Phil Collins voice is superb, along with stunning guitar from Hackett and bass from Rutherford. Tony Bank's keeys are off the hook as usual, and the songs he contributes are all of high quality. The album closes with \\"Los Endos\\", a nice little summary of the album. Overall, the album is full of high exciting points, and only seldomly, are there lows. This is a must have for any Genesis fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"I don't know if I can say much about this album. I can't say I liked it really, but it wasn't exactly bad. Los Endos was cool. Dance On A Volcano, Ripples, Squonk, and the title track were promising. But everything else was kind of boring. At least Gabriel was gone. He's much better singer as a solo artist than with Genesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entangled - remake","review":"Artist Dimthingshineon recently did a cover of Genesis: \\"Entangled\\" on his latest 4 CD project called \\"Nostalgia\\" released in 2009.

Please come back!","review":"I will admit that Peter Gabriel did not hold all of Genesis' talent within his own hands -- all of the members contributed on all of their pre Lamb Lies Down on Broadway albums. With this being said, this album is a cheap ripoff of Peter Gabriel's Genesis. The only reason this album deserves more than one star is because it at least makes you remember how good Genesis once was by rehashing old ideas and Phil Collins' blatant copying of Gabriel's singing style. If you are a true Genesis fan and already have all of the albums featuring Gabriel's unique focus and genius, I suggest you explore Gabriel's body of solo work before wasting any money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring...","review":"Doing this pseudo-inteliigent music, Genesis made a bad album, much worse than \\"Selling ENgland by the Pound\\", which is a classic.

From the thunderous opening of 'Dance on a Volcano' you can tell this is real stadium-shaking prog rock. 'Entangled' has absolutely beautiful harmonies and a scary frightening solo at the end. A lot of the songs have kind of bland verses leading up to absolutely stunning middle sections - Mad Man Moon, Robbery Assault and Battery, and Ripples. 'Squonk' is a bit more commercial sounding but has a nice groove. The title track is somewhat weak but has its place on the album. The end song is a good summary of the album's themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Collins Takes Over The Reigns & Creates a Dyanasty","review":"A trick of the tail released back in 1976 is The first Genesis release Phil Collins marks his vocal debut. Several years haspassed since i heard this recording & about 2 years ago i was lisening to my entire collection of rock music on vinyl and tapeand i came across \\"A TRICK OF THE TAIL\\" put the record on and was truly amazed on how good the sound still was espcally songslike \\"DANCE ON A VOLCANO\\" \\"ROBBERY, ASSUALT, & BATTERY\\" such powerful progressive rock that it ages like fine wine and never goes out of style. I beileve there isn't as much focus on the music of Gennesis Before 1980 the Year When the Phenominal album \\"DUKE\\" was released and that is a shame because there is a lot of great Gennesis Material that Radio & the general public never knew existed from 1973 To 1978 that has also never been appreicated for It's musical Orginality & Integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD \\"Voyage of the Acolyte\\" is recomended also","review":"This cd shows that Genesis still stood strong after the departure of Peter Gabriel. Another cd that sounds just like this is Steve Hackett's 1975 \\"Voyage of the Acolyte\\". On this cd, Phil Collins(drums, vocals), Mike Rutherford(bass), and of course Steve Hackett(guitar, mellotron) all play and write here. This is the other \\"And Then There were Three\\" minus Tony Banks. Voyage was recorded just 1 week after Genesis played their last show with Peter on May 27 1975. I strongly recomend getting \\"Voyage of the Acolyte\\" to fans of \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and \\"Wind and Wuthering\\". It's sold here also."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Call It \\"2008 Version\\"","review":"I've been a big Genesis fan for ages, and \\"Trick\\" has always been one of my favorites. I was recently in Japan on tour and was very excited to pick up the new 'remastered' version. But I was shocked when I heard it. This is not just a sonic upgrade, it is a completely new mix,. And frankly, it is not as good a mix as the original. Among the many changes, the keyboards are not loud enough, a noticeable difference. On top of that, it seems some of the vocals have actually been re-cut, which is frustrating to listen to. If they wanted to do all this tweaking they should have characterized this release differently, called it \\"New 2008 Version\\" or something... The word 'remaster' is misleading.This almost reminds me of the spiffed-up new versions of the original Stars Wars trilogy. A big disappointment. Look for the earlier 'definitive edition remaster' version from 1994. 2 stars because it's still a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much compression","review":"I'm a huge fan and have an outstanding system. This SACD/DVD-A will disappoint if you understand what breathing is when it comes to audio. Someone got overzealous with a compressor and made the vocal so bright that there are times when the music is gated in order to make way for it. If you want to hear what surround is capable of, purchase any Porcupine Tree disk or pick up the first Crowded House disk. Measure for measure, this disk is great if you are a die hard fan, but overdubbed concert footage and poorly engineered productions don't make up for what you can get from the first stereo remaster even if it was only at CD sampling rates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"Ok, the music is great and sounds just like I expected, BUT once again (like the Duke CD/DVD) the concert footage is poorly remastered! The audio track does NOT match the video...Phil sings, but his vocals arrive a 'touch' late. Arrrgh! Same annoying problem on the 'enhanced' Duke 1980 concert footage.I have the VHS of that Trick of the Tail 1976 concert, and the audio is spot on. Also, the interviews on this DVD are perfect soundtrack-wise, so what's up with the concert audio? Is it just me? I bought the CD/DVD primarily for the incredible Glasgow '76 concert footage, but feel frustrated. Any comments? Help?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale that does the trick","review":"This is one of my favourite albums from Genesis. Songs are typically progressive and the melodies are cativating. Instrumental playing is the finest. The lyrics tell stories which reach our feelings. Phil Collins sings soft and blends into the melody and instruments, never fighting. Immediate recommendations for listening are Mad Man Moon keyboard-based melody, Entangled, a thrilling story and charming melody and Ripples, a cry about our limited lifespan. Anyone familiar with Smashing Pumpkins, Coldplay and Radiohead, just to mention a few more recent rock groups, should like this album, as would enjoy Genesis' Wind and Wuthering and Seconds Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whirlpool of scratches","review":"It came in but it was not \\"like new.\\" A whirlpool of scratches came from the center.

It is a magnificent fairytale on how the characters have 30% of their income devoted entirely to spending on wants and desires. I like a good story as much as the next guy, but would someone recommend a book that is a bit more based on reality? For example, in the equation for the yearly budget, how about including continually compounded interest for credit cards and other debts?

I get so tired of people claiming that debt is someone else's fault besides the consumer. I love the suggestions in this book like, if you can't afford your house, get a roommate, or if you can't afford the big SUV, sell it and get a more cost effective car. It's kind of a tough love approach while still being upbeat. I feel that I have had my finances in order for a while now, but I found inspiration in this book to do even better. I loved the simple formula and encouraging language. I think this is a book that everyone should read, even if they think they are doing just fine. There are a few worksheets, but no huge complicated budgets that tend to overwhelm people. They are simple and get right to the heart of your spending. I would (and will!) recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple","review":"Elizabeth Warren presents a very simple, matter of fact way to approach your finances.

There isn't anything special going on here. I found myself anticipating the point of good viewing for the entire hour and 1/2 only to see the credits roll.If you're looking for something shocking, important and semi true-to-life like Clarks other films, don't waste your time or money on this one.

If anything, Clark proves that being an indie filmmaker is no guarantee of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Day In Paradise","review":"All a round, Another Day In Paradise is a really good film. The performances from all four of the main actors are most excellent. Much is made about James Woods in this film ( and rightfully so ) but Vincent Kartheiser ( from the Angel series ) is the one who I was most impressed with. He's a good actor I know, but he pulled off this role frightfully well. It's a Larry Clark film so you know you're going to see quite a bit ( literally ) of the two younger actors ( Kartheiser & Natasha Gregson Wagner ), but this doesn't take away anything from the film ( as in some of Clark's other works ). Overall, the film is very good and I Do recommend it :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Average Movie","review":"A disappointing follow-up to the impressive \\"Kids\\", \\"Another Day in Paradise\\" has some interesting elements (good acting, ok dialogue, a couple of twists), but ultimately it fails to engage and never rises above so-so, mildly watchable material. It\`s not a bad choice to watch on a boring afternoon, still it isn\`t more than a forgettable and cliched story about young and old criminals in the suburbs. Director Larry Clark has done better, and this blah effort stands as his weakest movie to date.Run-of-the-mill and uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth it for 'Woods'.","review":"It's Larry Clark's road movie with too much ...[profanity] and drugs and not enough of a story.James Woods IS the film~(anything he's in is worth seeing)~ Melanie Griffith...yeah,yeah whatever.Natasha Gregson Wagner looks 22 & Vincent Kartheiser looks like he's 12.Just wade through the boring,corny parts & watch it for Woods' fine performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, violent depiction of low-life junkies","review":"This is a depressing movie of low-life dope dealers and murderers.

(Any abused man or woman will probably be mesmerized by some of the scenes and the feelings evoked in this intense movie.)The new lifestyle she slowly, but surely creates for herself, against the backdrop of her husband piecing together her escape and his savage determination to find her creates a savvy suspense thriller that could be a classic in anyone's home movie library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie.","review":"Sleeping with the Enemy is a good movie about a woman who is on the run from her abusive husband and stars Julia Roberts as the wife and Patrick Bergin as her violent husband and they both did some good acting and I felt really bad for Julia's character but I was glad when she got away from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful","review":"I think this movie came out before Pretty Woman made Julia Roberts a star, and it's a pretty entertaining flick. Julia is a battered woman who escapes her husband and starts anew. But instead of being a harrowing drama flick about the aftermath of an abusive relationship, it's instead a suspense movie.While her husband is tracking her down, Julia gets a house and a cute new neighbor who steadily tries to win her over. No surprise really about this movie, it's fairly predictable. But if you like a modicum of suspense, but scare really easily (like I do) then you'll like this middle-of-the-road suspense drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick but empty woman-on-the run thriller","review":"A woman, escaping from her abusive husband, fakes her identity and attempts to lead a new life. What is a slick and glossy thriller is actually very trivial in terms of thrills and suspense and is badly scripted to boot.

Julia Roberts is outstanding as the wife of a prominent business man who decides after too many hits she is finally going to leave. However, she knows walking out on her husband is not going to be enough as he will track her down and probably kill her, so she fakes her own death and leaves, then starts her new life over again in a new town. Then, as a shock to her and the audience the husband tracks her down!Patrick Bergen is amazingly creepy in this film as the abusing husband.

There is also a chapter search card that accompanies the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Favorite Movies!","review":"I love this movie. I have watched it again and again on VHS and hope that it will be released on DVD. I love the way this movie was filmed. Some of my favorite scenes are, the drops of blood from his hand dripping into the commode where he finds her wedding ring. Julia Roberts character on the front porch after cleaning the house she rents, very relaxed. The street where the house resides is just beautiful. The call to her mother when all she can do is listen. Great Film and Great Ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updating movies","review":"I've been updating my old VHS tapes to DVD's.

I wish the studios could come up with more films like this one, which is not only scary but has great visuals, a great story, and the lovely Julia Roberts. By the way, the music a previous reviewer questioned is probably \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\" by Hector Berlioz. It was also played in \\"The Shining.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Oppressor - 'Solstice Of Oppression' (Red Light)","review":"'Solstice...' is the Chicago death metal band's first out of four CD's.The vocals here are nearly incomprehensible.Some decent riffs on this disc,I'll give them that much.Line-up:Tim King-bass&vocals,Adam Zadel-guitar,Jim Stopper-guitar and Tom Schofield-drums.Sorry,not for me.Might possibly appeal to some fans,of say Cannibal Corpse,Obituary,Coven and Rigor Mortis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing helpful is the practice tests on the CD...","review":"The purpose of the book is to prepare you for the certification exam. For me it didn't meet that requirement.The book does have a section for each of the objectives Microsoft has defined for the exam. But is FULL of errors (typos and concepts too!!), lacking good examples, concepts are defined vaguely and there is A LOT left out.I took the exam and passed but I don't feel it was because of the book. I had to do additional research on each topic because the book wasn't enough. And in the exam there is definitely much more than the book covers.The 2 stars are because:1. The CD that comes with the book. The practice tests are very helpful to prepare for the exam, not only because they are exam-like questions but because you see some topics that weren't even mentioned on the book.2.

Unfortunately, this book is terrible.First off, there is not enough detail to be a training kit. It seems to me that the book was rushed when it was being written. There are many errors in the examples provided, typos, etc...For example, in the MDI lesson it say to set the mdiparent member to true, but that member is not a boolean value.I'm taking the practice tests provided with the book side by side with the book and the questions based off the book's contents contain questions which are not covered in the book. How can the questions on the CD accompanied with the book reference a lesson when no mention of the question is in the lesson?Only three helpful things come from this book: the objective card, the CD, and the 15% discount on the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Pass the Exam with a High Score","review":"After reading this book and passing 70-526 exam, I found the book has 3 problems at least.1. The book might cover all topics against the exam but doesn't include all necessary information for you to pass it. For example, a question in my real exam asked a question about Thread Monitor. However, the book doesn't mention anything about Monitor.2. The book has at least 2 different writing styles.3. The book can't include enough pictures to illustrate what controls it is talking about, how controls are related to one another or how they interact. This leads that sometimes I lost what the book tried to tell me.It is impossible for you to pass the exam with a high score only by this book.You might pass the exam with fears by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof Is In the Pudding","review":"I always use the MS Self-Paced kits for my certification exams. So far I have passed the exams. This particular book was annoying in that there were quite a few editing mistakes and the errata website only had information for the first half of the book.

In one scene he has his heroine taking the safety off her revolver (only one or two revolvers have ever been made with safeties, and they are quite rare). In another scene he has the bad guy slamming the clip home on his automatic, then swinging the cylinder out to reload. If he is going to write police fiction, he ought to at least familiarize himself with guns. It is a great story, though, and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE EYES HAVE IT","review":"This follow up to \\"Fall from Grace\\" brings back our heroes, Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks, and lets them get more personally involved, in light of Jane's near-fatal mistake in the first book.The murderer in this one is identified early on, but does not take away any of the suspense Phillips so craftily builds. The inclusion of Kenny's nephew in the story adds a different twist, and actually, ends up saving the heroes' lives at one point.The killer is a nasty one, shooting out the eyes of former or current police officers. Phillips pulls some surprises in that he allows some of the officers we've become familiar with in both novels to come to rather unexpected ends.The final twist is a real big one, and Phillips handles it expertly and believably.Looking forward to more Candiotti and Marks escapades in the future. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I picked up this book because of the glowing reviews, and was very disappointed.

I couldn't even buy the bad guy, who wasn't anything more complex than a cartoon character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginning readers","review":"\\"Purple Is Part of a Rainbow\\" is a good book for children with developing vocabularies. In this book, the simple rhymes of Carolyn Kowalczyk are well complemented by the lovely artwork of Gene Sharp.The rhymes follow a standard format: \\"A petal is part of a flower. / A rainbow is part of a shower. / A feather is part of a bird. / A letter is part of a word.\\" Each sentence is accompanied by an illustration. The colorful illustrations have a soft, gentle quality to them. Another nice touch is the fact that the artwork depicts people of various racial/ethnic characteristics.The educational value of the book is enhanced by a word list at the end. Overall, a well done collaboration, with a wonderfully poetic title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have 70's UK Punk","review":"These guys rocked the dives of the UK.

Researched and found on Anazon just an mirror face and ordered it. I would not recommend this fix for a heated mirror as mine was. A heated mirror has a liquid inside of it to conduct the current for heating and can be damaging to the paint and is almost impossible to remove the old mirror face without splashing the car,it will make ugly spots on a light colored car. If the mirror is unheated it works much betted.

But this entry is weak. There are far too many characters, and the plot is extremely convoluted. Perry breaks the law 8 or 9 times without any justification, tarnishing his image of someone who is protecting justice and not just his clients. The result is that it is simply not as enjoyable as the best in the series. To call any of the novels \\"believable\\" would be a stretch, but this one is so far out of bounds that you simply stop taking it seriously. It is the only book in the series that I can remember having to push myself to finish.

When I found it in a shop I couldn't resist the temptation (I knew track 2 was a big hit in France) and I'm very glad about this. I don't have any favourite song because the whole CD is great! It reminded me vaguely of Les Negresses Vertes, with the typical French sound combined with a subtle and very pleasant Arabic feel to it. These guys not only rap, but they can also sing. Excellent music to dance to, and a shame Amazon doesn't offer the chance to listen to tracks (but don't let that stop you from buying it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomber la chemise","review":"For all of you trying to decide whether or not to purchase this CD, the answer is DO IT!

Best among them are \\"Ridin' for a Fall\\" by Dennis Morgan and Joan Leslie, \\"Love isn't Born, It's Made\\" by Ann Sheridan, \\"Ice Cold Katie\\" by Hattie McDaniel, \\"Goin' North\\" by Alan Hale and Jack Carson, and Bette Davis' inimitable rendition of \\"They're Either Too Young or Too Old\\" (sung with cigarette, of course).

YOu dont' have to guess what's going on. ... You see it and understand it.I generally dont' like Leonardo Decapitated...But he did excellent in this roll. He played Romeo so well. Claire Danes is innocent pure and beautiful. She plays Juliet so well. All the charactors are so well casted..If you are looking for the perfect date movie this is the one.

Though I hate to tell ppl that this my favorite movie, it really is. It just feeds the hopeless romantic in me. Baz Luhrmann is a great director, even if you don't like his movies you gotta admire his brilliant creativity. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are great as the young star-crossed lovers, but I could imagine different actors doing a finer job... (sorry guys!) My absolute favorite part of the movie is the party scene where R+J first meet. The Fishtank scene...*melt*....ahh gets me every time.

I'm a dude but I love the way it's shot. Sure I'm a 5-starring fan boy but this movie deserves more credit than IMDb gives it(6.8 right now, AYFKM?)It's a MOVIE, Shakespeare is not lounging back watching the play. This is an INTERPRETATION of Shakespeare's work and it is a MASTERPIECE in it's own right. Leo does a GREAT job as well as Claire Danes. It's excellent, eerie, unique, and very interestingly shot and portrayed. It is pretty uniform with the way it was worked too, despite being shot in California and almost not looking like it... though I've never been to the West Coast so I don't know too much.

There was no originality in updating the family feud to a fight between gangs. Have we seen West Side Story? And the fact that the final scene in the movie was changed was revolting. The reason they committed suicide was to defy fate. It's hard to do that when I expect to hear Homer Simpson say \\"Doh!\\" as Juliet wakes up to a dying Romeo. The most insulting part of the film had to be the balcony scene that took place in a pool. Where did that come from? Ugh. Not to mention the fact that for the entire movie Claire Danes displays fewer emotions than inanimate objects.

I can appreciate chaotic movies, Nowhere was one of my personal favs. but when applied to something with a solid storyline, it just makes the story tertiary to what is going on visually. admittedly I had a bias to begin with, not necessarily with leo, but with the story, romeo and juliet was never my fav shakesperean story. but I think it could have been so much better.

It is a classic tragic love story and I have every line memorized. I was so excited when this movie came out and I wasn't disapointed.I liked how it was modernized so viewers of today could relate to the play. I actually liked that the dialogue in this film mirrors the original text. Something would be missing if they changed the dialogue.Of course some of the acting is overdone and can be a little \\"cheesy\\" at times but it fits great with the story.I also enjoyed the music so if you liked the movie, you should pick up the soundtrack as well.I definitely recommend this DVD to the hopeless romantics out there as well as any fan of Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frentic and Overrated","review":"I went with some friends to see this at the theater on a rainy afternoon, and was expecting a pleasant surprise. What I got was an unexpected disappointment.While the movie starts out very well, opening on the aftermaths of Romeo and Juliet's deaths, the film starts quickly losing it by the minute. While it sounded like a good idea to modernize Shakespeare's most famous play, by still retaining the original dialogue and speech, it doesn't come together very well. Director Baz Luhrmann is trying too hard to cater to the MTV generation and the teen girls who love Leo."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good!","review":"This is just sad. This movie isn't artistic.

So, I was scanning through the channels and I came to chanel 71, now I had seen the 1960's version of the movie and wasn't expecting anything different. I should of been, after all this is a Luhrmann production...After watching the movie, I wanted to cry for the very first time since ROTK I really bean to sob. One of the saddest scenes in the movie is when Mercurcio dies, with the hysterical Romeo sobbing over him. Another great scene is when Romeo is in the tomb of Juliet with his friend (I forgot his name) and gave him one last hug, knowing he would be the last face he saw. Next to Strictly Ballrom, this is my favortie Baz film. And need I say it...Baz is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romeo and Juliet in modern days","review":"Wow, Leonardo DiCaprio is the perfect Romeo.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes sound like they merely read the lines (even haltingly at times), not understand and feel them. The only redeeming things about this are the sets, so wonderfully overabundant at times it's dreamlike, and the characters of Tybalt and Mercutio. One other thing is the mostly successful attempt to update the play. This version is nothing compared to the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli one, with the hauntingly beautiful Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, who combine the innocence and shyness of adolesence with its overwhelming emotion, every line and look bleeding with it. The DiCaprio/Danes movie is a poor version of a great play. I rented it again recently, to see if it got better, but I cringed whenever Romeo and Juliet talked. It's really too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Adaptation","review":"This movie is a great modern adaptation of the age old tale of Romeo and Juliet.

I am soooooooo in love with the movie, book, and even more in love with Leo. He is a great actor as well as the sexiest! I think Claire Danes was a good Juliet. She was fit for the part. Titanic was also a great movie. Leo if your reading this your a great actor as well as very cute.

This movie, in terms of the execution of the script, does a disservice in getting kids hooked on the poetry of Shakespeare's writing.However, I will admit that visually it's great. The setting is apt. Mercutio is amazing. But, teachers, I would think twice about showing this version to your class."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANKYOU LEO!!!","review":"I think the film was a little bit bored.

Zeffirelli's version is the definitive Romeo & Juliet. What he achieved will probably never be equalled let alone exceeded. The 1968 movie was achingly bueatiful. If you watch that version you will fall in love with either Romeo or Juliet. This version by contrast is worthless trash. Guys, if you show the 1968 version to your date you will definitely score (as long as you are not a complete toad).

Every actor gives an impressive performance and each shows their understanding of the Old English dialogue they use to express themselves. In fact, I gained a greater understanding of some of Shakespeare's terminology by the inflection and timing the actors used to speak the playwrite's words. Well worth the watch. An impressive piece of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold, clever, & visually stunning interpretation","review":"This brash \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" is unlike any other film version that preceded it and is guaranteed to make a strong impression whatever its flaws. The old world gentility of Zeffirelli's vision has been brutally stripped away here, leaving a film that blazes with potent imagery and throbs with the violence of adolescent passion. I found the translation deeply unsettling at first, but once I relaxed and allowed myself to admire the filmmakers' inventiveness, I realized that this version was both stunningly creative and, in its way, quite true to Shakespeare's tragic tale of star-crossed teenage love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie to add to Blu Ray","review":"I've always loved this movie and am so glad it finally came to Blu Ray.

I had never been interested in Shakespeare before, but after seeing this movie, I became a Shakespeare addict. I have thank Baz Luhrman for his innovative way of using camera techniques, objects, and actors to update this tragedy.Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes did great jobs of playing the star-crossed lovers who ultimately lose their lives for love.I love this updated version because it allows you to better understand the sometimes difficult language that Shakespeare used in his plays. While the look of the film is very updated, the language is still the same.I would highly recommend this film to people who are unsure about Shakespeare because they think it's too hard to understand. After watching this film you'll understand the story better than you ever had before and may even become a huge Shakespeare fan while you're at it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The DiCaprio Version","review":"My friends and I call this the DiCaprio version, and boy is it amazing! I think perhaps this movie is a 5 star or a 1 star - in other words, you either love it or you hate it. I definitely loved it!This movie steps away from the traditional ideas of Romeo and Juliet and delivers something completely new. Sure, seeing DiCaprio spouting Shakespeare takes a bit of getting used to, but once the original shock subsides the plot just takes over.The amazing thing is that Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes actually manage it. They pull it off! Romeo and Juliet cease to be the protagonists of an archaic, dusty, old romance and become real people with real love.One other thing, often overlooked: the music! Each song is perfect for each scene - adding just enough, never distracting and never taking away.Yes, the DiCaprio version is different, but that's exactly what Romeo and Juliet needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare Rocks","review":"Love this version of Romeo & Juliet.

Sorry Amazon, I'm an extremely literal person and if I don't know what they're saying I get confused. To top it off, many of the words have archaic meaning and if I don't see them written I have no idea what they are. The only \\"fix\\" for me would be to follow along with a script.

He introduced Dicaprio and Danes to Shakespearean language that they are far from reciting in a flowing manner that sounds correct.Luhrmann has gotten rid the beautiful gowns that Shakespeare had his actors in and turned it into a wild fashion show that many may dislike. Despite his mistakes Luhrmann has not been at a total loss, he did manage to translate the characters into modern characters we can recognize well, such as the flamboyant Mercutio into a RuPaul; however some do not stay true to Shakespeare, greatly upseting the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spent more money to see this film then they did to film it","review":"William Shakespeare must have been turning over in his grave after what they did to his popular tale. I have never been a fan of Romeo and Juliet (I think Hamlet is much better) but even I know the butchering of a classic play when I see one. Leonardo and Claire are good actors, and in this peice of trash they play a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is set in the nineties, they still stick to the original script, even though half of it is cut for the sake of those who get tired of Shakespeare, (why they get tired of him, I don't know).Now I know that Hollywood has had some pretty bad follies before, but this film is beyond the area in which I draw the line. They should be ashamed of themselves. If you have to watch a version of ROMEO AND JULIET I'd highly reccomend either WEST SIDE STORY or the Franco Zefferelli version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time and money!!!!!!","review":"I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, but after I saw Mercutio, I just wanted to turn it off. I also had a hard time seeing modern times and hearing Shapearean language. To me, it just didn't work. Also, I thouhgt that Claire Daines lacked animation during the pool scene (who thought of this scenery addition?) She almost sounded like she was reading her lines from a script. Leo is a much better actor than what I saw in this movie. He went from speaking in a monotone voice to screaming. (Leo and Claire must have taken acting lessons at the same place) He seems to think that screaming out his emotions is acting. He did a much better job in Titanic. The only reason all of these teenage girls think he can act is because he is sort of cute. (Ah, love is blind) If you like Shakespeare and you want to see it done right, rent the 1968 version. It is a thousand times better than the so-called modern one and as an added bonus, the actors know how to act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising I didn't sleep by the first 5 minutes","review":"This is the most boring-est movie I have ever laid my eyes on.

Yeah, I paid the seven bucks to see it, and I was horrified at the liberties they took. I know one of the qualities of great literature is that it can be adapted into modern times and that it's accessible to all ages, but this is a joke. \\"Leo\\" and Claire Danes are pathetic as the star-crossed lovers. It's uncomfortable to see them try and speak in Shakespeare's language. It also seems that acting in itself had gone by the wayside. There is no legitimate supporting cast--and I couldn't wait until that John Leguzamo guy died.

I'm not sure what the purpose of doing this is ... maybe to entice teeny boppers to appreciate brilliant literature with a big box office draw like Leonardo DiCaprio! That's probably why I couldn't get into this movie. Shakespeare would roll over in his grave! No one would believe that anyone talks like that in this day and age. I think that if a retelling of Romeo and Juliet had to be done, put it in modern-age language. This cannot compare to Zefferelli's version (1968) or West Side Story (1961), nor would I try. Even Leo couldn't save this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL","review":"I saw this in high school after reading the play, and it was so absolutely absurd that one wonders if it's supposed to be a satire. But no, it's just that stupid. The entire class was in stiches. Shakespeare is my all time favourite playwrite, and this is quite possibly the worst adaptation of any Shakespeare play ever written. Full of cliches, discontinuity, cheesy visual \\"stretches\\" (ie. the gun's the Capulate and Mountague 'thugz' wield are manufactured by \\"Sword, co\\") to fit the old-century lines. Someone with the mindset of a Jr High school-girl might find this breathtaking, but for the rest, its two hours of laughing at the stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonardo does not belong!...","review":"This version of Romeo and Juliet is a classic case of casting marketable but notably inept actors in the lead roles. The director did a good job of passing the script of the original play through a rusty cheese grater. Unfortunately, people were enchanted with this pulverized excuse for a Shakespeare play. If the bard were still alive, the director would still be in the midst of a nationally televised law suit!Even though I must applaud Luhrmann's attempt at bringing this Shakespeare play into modern times, he failed horribly. Why did there have to be a beach?... The real Verona is landlocked!... Also, calling the guns \\"Sabers\\" was a pathetic attempt at modernization. If Luhrmann had simply kept the play in its original setting and combined it with real acting and real people it might have had a chance.

I absolutly love Leo and Claire Danes was as brill in this as in 'My So called Life.' This was an absolutely excelent adaption of shakespere and the acting was great. The soudtracks are both excelent too! I own this video and I watch it every day. I just love it! All the actors were all brilliantly suited to thier roles and that made it even better. Great acting by Claire and Leo etc, singing by Des'ree and writing by Shakespere in the first place! A great team! It's almost as good as 'Titanic'!

This movie could have been titantic if it wasn't for the very outragous gang scenes and the Capulet ball. Don't get me wrong the scenes which included Romeo and Juliet were very extraordinary. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes was an excellent choose to share the main roles in Romeo and Juliet. Sorry if this bugs anybody. I really recommend everybody renting this one if you haven't yet. So go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Trigger Happy","review":"One of the most imaginative and compelling Shakespearian adaptions I have ever seen. Luhrmann gives the MTV generation something they can relate to and puts a hard edge on the fairy tale like version from Zeffirelli. The leads give passionate performances esspecially from the very impressive Claire Danes. Shakespeare was a writer who knew people and Baz Luhrmann gives the younger generation a taste of classic literature which on a regular basis is strictly bound to the classroom. A fantastic follow up to Strictly Ballroom and well worth every good review it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This movie was.....suspenseful, catching, intelligent, and you had to be able to pay attention to understand what was going on.

It's perfect....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically original!, a visual slendor to experience!","review":"This film is Wonderfully constructed, and an extraordinary concept. Taking William Shakespeare's classic story and tranfering it into today's enviornment is fantastic. The real testament to the films success, is in the fact that it does not matter if you know the the story or not. It's so effective in it's look and design, that it automatically captivates you, comanding you're attention. Combine the fact that you have a classic story behind that look, and it guarentees that the tale will eventually transcend it's time period. With a combination like that; hey! you can't go wrong bro! Excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie of all TIME!","review":"This is movie captures the true essence of DiCaprio's wisdom, and acting ability, he is not a no-talent hack, if you have seen him in other movies you will see that he can play a variety of parts. As for Claire Danes, brilliant! She is not only a great actress, but she is beautiful too. The movie is a true 90s way of making a old play, beautiful again. I watch it whenever possible, and one day hope to own it (someday, tomorrow) Once again, great movie, everyone should see it, especially people looking to laugh and cry.

Don't forget, this movie is at least 10 years old, and bringing it back to life is a hard task. I can say that at certain scenes, you can see A LOT of detail, like close ups of Leo and stuff, but on the whole, it was pretty much dvd quality, just a little bit better. The sound is amazing and some scenes show color so well. You might be disappointed if you are expecting stellar picture quality, but it does look better then standard dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, Modern, Faithful, Fantastic! - Ivory tower fetishists beware!","review":"You'll love it or hate it.Personally, I found it deliriously enthralling! Brilliantly ambitious in art direction, and more authentic in it's portrayal of anguished teenage romance than any other version. A sweet sound track doesn't hurt!If you can't appreciate Shakespeare and highbrow art-flicks, you're not going to appreciate the faithful dialogue and lovely little double entendres. If you don't dig over the top, two fisted Hong Kong fire fights, you'll be nauseated by the gorgeous excess.But if you're lucky enough to enjoy both, I guarantee this gem will pack more punch than Romeo's .45!I never appreciated the source material more.

I just hated this whole movie. I am a Shakespere addict, but this adaptation I just can't sit through.Leo and Claire Danes do pretty good jobs, so it's not the acting. I just hate everything else about this movie, it seems to be mocking Shakespere. It was just... ick.Everyone else I know loved this movie, so it might just be me. In any event, if you're looking for some good modern Shakespere, definitely check out Hamlet with Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles. It's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romeo & Juliet","review":"I love the story of Romeo and Juliet, BUT this version is not my cup of tea, it seems to comical, nothing can compare to the Leonard Whiting / Olivia Hussy version, which is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the faeries' midwife","review":"I wish this film had been about when I was first studying the play. The acting is superb, the chemistry is excellent amongst the entire cast, the soundtrack stands on its own, and it goes without saying that the direction is superb. Carelessly done, the contemporary backdrop could easily clutter the sonnets and iambic pentameter. Luhrmann's vision to make the timeless story poignant is flawless. DiCaprio and Danes deliver teenaged angst without being trite. Perrineau is the best Mercutio imaginable. I am ever moved by Danes' final scenes, certainly among those that put her on the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Leo!!!!","review":"Excellent!

My friend and I ended up kissing the screen when Leo showed up on the screen! My friend and I have a goal to meet Leonardo DiCaprio before we turn 20 years old. We are also becoming actresses so we can be in good movies like Romeo & Juliet! It made me really jelous when Claire Danes and Leo kept kissing. BUY THIS VIDEO NOW!!!

I love the way they modernized it, but kept the old way of talking and the original script (though some of it was new). My favorite scene, by far, was the part after Romeo shot Tybalt and goes to Juliet's room to be with her. The passion and romance is completely there. You can feel it in your bones. All in all, I find this to be a very romantic movie. It's very lovely and you should definitely own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ditch the hype and watch the movie","review":"Once you strip away the manic video montage of Verona Beach, Baz Luhrman's precocious musical tendancies, the over-wrought drama of the secondary characters, you are a left with perhaps the purest telling of this famous tragedy. The often bland Leonardo DiCaprio and the often brilliant Claire Dane meld perfectly in to their respective roles as Romeo and Juliet. All the innocence, the wonderment, the naivete, and the wreckless, unbridalled passion is captured equisitely in this movie. Forget the irreverence, forget the baudy, tacky colors, this is Romeo and Juliet as it was meant to be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fiasco","review":"The Bard spins in his grave over this movie: the only thing I can think of that could rival the cringe-inducing factor of every scene involving either of the woefully miscast leads (when I say \\"miscast\\" it's with the underlying expectation that anyone performing in a work by the greatest writer in the history of the English language should be able to act) would be Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's laughable performances as romantic leads in Star Wars Episode II.Run, don't walk, to pick up Zefferelli's 1968 version if you want to see how R & J can translate well to the big screen; avoid this version like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"shakespeare would be hinding his face","review":"this is a poorly made film for one thing i have seen better acting from five year olds it had none of the heart and passion that made it such a touching play in the first place and can i just say to all the girls out there going goo goo gaa gaa over whats his name get a grip you were asked to review the movie not him and i would also like to share with all of you that \\"leo\\" didn't write the play nor did he help write it william shakespeare died over 400 years ago so you can stop giving him your congads on the \\"book\\" it wasn't him shakespeare did it all by himself"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"i love romeo and juliet and everyone nows the story of them so there is not reason for me to explain this movie really"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible sound.

Also, I recommend the soundtrack... it's a keeper.To buy or not to buy, that is your question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonardo and Claire as Romeo + Juliet? hmmm....","review":"After Titanic, this was the movie that made me love Leonardo DiCaprio. The rest of the cast, except for John Leguizamo as Tybalt, did a very nice job-John was too over the top for me, Miriam Margolyes as the nurse was pretty funny, and Claire Danes was very cute as Juliet. The music fit the mood of the story very well. If you like Shakespeare's work, you may like this film as well. I saw BL's version of Moulin Rouge-which was good, but this is better. Now admittedly, the first ten minutes of this film may be hard to take for some, it seems more like a gangster shoot out sequence than WS, but oh well, those who don't have the urge to turn it off, the rest of the movie is very well done. How would Shakespeare feel about this film? Honestly, I don't know, my High School english teachers liked it, but they also liked the Farrelly brothers Kingpin, and I thought it was grossly stupid, so use your own judgment."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"I didn't expect anything too great, but this was simply painful to watch. I have nothing against quirkiness, or modern takes on Shakespeare, but watching this film is a lot like watching an obnoxiously loud, two-hour-long commercial that's trying hard to tell the teenagers of the world that \\"we understand what you think is cool.\\" Chris Tucker does NOT help. Nor does the eye-wearying, goofy, rapid-fire editing. Nor does the fact that the actors are simply not very compelling in their roles. I don't see how anyone other than teeny-bopper girls who like to see Leonardo DiCaprio wet could get much of anything out of this. It simply has no charm, no sense of tact or aesthetic restraint. The attempts at humor are never funny. It may be true that it is meant to be over-the-top, but it could've been over-the-top and done well at the same time.

Anyway, it came to cable, and I watched it. Looks like I'll have to eat crow. I was absolutely stunned by its audacious stylishness. It was a romp from beginning to end. Everyone gave superb performances, except for DiCaprio and Daines, who were merely good enough. They could have found a sexier woman to play Juliet. John Leguizamo and Harold Perrineau Jr. gave especially noteworthy performances. It was a real delight to watch these thoroughly modern characters so effortlessly speak Elizabethan english.

For me at least the first time was awful, but now every time I watch it grows on me into the classic it was meant to be. Still they base it off the classic. I would still like to see a pure remake using modern day terminology vs. the classic speech.Either way it is worth a watch. If you don't like it on the first watch wait a day and watch it again.

In fact, I have enjoyed several other modern remakes of Shakespeare's plays. This one just doesn't work. The movie setting is today's world while the diaglogue is from Shakespeare's time. The dialogue was hard to understand. This resulted in many of the double entendres being lost in the mush. I hope that the movie producers saved a lot of money. They didn't have to hire a clever scriptwriting staff.The settings for this movie were terrible. The mansions were trying to look like castles and modern houses all at the same time. Again, this didn't work.I also think Dicaprio was miscast. He seemed too inexperienced to play the role of Romeo. His lines sounded forced, and his emotions were often overacted.Skip this one, and see the 1968 version instead. Better yet, attend a live performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"He want to be a star","review":"This director think he's Kubrick. Or Greenaway perhaps. Or Orson Welles maybe.

It's a joke, really. I don't know why hollywood keeps churning out crap like this; if you are going to make a shakespearean movie, the setting should at least somewhat line up with the lingo. The actors can't even act; it feels like they are just reading the text out of their high school english books. The only good movie that follows this trend is Hamlet starring Kenneth Branagh (or however you spell his last name), and that's because the dialogue could pass for the time in which the story is set (and Kenneth is an awesome actor, but thats beside the point).

The movie follows the same storyline: two teenagers from two fighting houses fall madly in love and kill themself because of their family's hate. The catch though: the story has been moved from the 1600's to the 1990's. Lurhman retells the story in a modern way using guns for swords, a pill for Queen Mab, and cars instead of carriages. The movie is great. The language stays the same people. Sorry about that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern setting, but the basic Shakespeare is unhurt...","review":"Romeo smoking cigarettes? The family feud being played out in fast cars with faster assault rifles? Well, yes.

There was so many confusing plots and story lines especially the ending that was so stupid, it was like you watching the middle part of the movie, I have to say that this may go down in history for unrealistic, overachievment love stories of the decade. But there were a couple of good scenes but not quite to save At First Sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I normally like Val Kilmer, but this movie stunk, big time! The only interesting part is the concept dealing with a man who has been blind all his life and how he cannot understand things like shadow, depth perception, reflections, etc. The romantic interlude with Mira Sorvino just doesn't work. Don't waste your money! Even if it's a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used too many tissues to like this...","review":"\\"At First Sight\\" is a miserably sappy film about a blind man who gains his sight and falls in love with a woman. I believe it was based on a true story, and congratulations for that man, but no congratulations for this movie. It's an obvious tearjerker, but there are too many scenes where you just want to bawl your eyes out to make it a feel-good movie. There's nothing redeeming about this film at all! My only compliments go to Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino, who do fine jobs with their characters. But other than that, \\"At First Sight\\" was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried,in joy","review":"I recommend this movie to anyone who is close to or want tounderstand a person with disabilities better. I am not saying everyperson with a disability feels the same way a person who is blind would, but it does convey the \\"normal\\" person's reaction. I could not in a million years ever explain the underlying hurt of suggesting surgery to \\"correct\\" my deafness as if I am not already perfect the way I am. Thank you Val Kilmer for taking the time to study and know the nuances of blindness and showing the rest of the world exactly what it is like. I have always watched Val Kilmer movies, knowing I would be entertained, however after watching \\"at first sight\\" I would have to say I am totally in love with the guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am writing about the sountrack","review":"I love the soundtrack for this movie....The best song is \\"Slide\\" by goo goo dolls.

I tell you the soundtrack makes this an amazing movie, it goes so well along with the movie. With the lyrics in \\"Slide\\".....\\"Could you whisper in my ear the things you wanna feel, I'll give you anything\\"... \\"Do you wanna get married, or runaway\\"....\\"Slide into my room\\"...and Johnny Rzeznik's voice makes it justthat more amazing.

It is in a larger format than most such books, and has *excellent* illustrations, along with the requisite fluffy patch for a toddler to touch. Best of all, the text invites toddlers to interact in different ways with the picture, touch with your toes, nose, etc. As such, it is more 'educational' than any of the other fuzzy books that I have seen.

One of the most difficult things to get beginning actors to do is take risks. Most of these scenes don't require much of that,and because memorizing the lines, being loud enough, staying open, are still struggles for them, something safe is helpful to many of my students. I wish more of the scenes were comic, that helps bring more out of them as well. But, I have been working with this book for years and have not found anything else that has the right length and style for my students on a repeated basis. Of course I only use this for their first scene, after that we require much more. But has worked for me and they leave alot of room for creative students to expand on what's there, while not intimidating students who are more timid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, if high school is nonsensical rambles","review":"I had the unfortunate privilege of reading many of the skits in here, finding them very senseless. Not only do these scenes never happen, but by the end of each short we feel just as we did when it began. Nothing has been accomplished and there never has been that much of a conflict to begin with. The language is too mild, high schoolers do not talk like that. Words and phrases like \\"Oh my God\\" are overused, trust me, high schoolers do have a wider vocabulary than that. I have not read the sequel to this book and do not wish to unless for a good laugh, which is all the first book is good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fit did not hold shape for a week","review":"Bad Fit did not hold shape for a week had to use clips to hold on a 48 inch round table"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for 60\\" table","review":"I ordered this for my 60\\" diameter patio table.

I was missing several flat washers and lock washers when I assembled but I think my 2yr old was responsible rather than the manufacturer.I would have rated this 5 stars except for the fact that the finish is typical China quality (poor). You can scratch the finish of with your fingernail. So, if cherry is the color you want, I strongly suggest a coat of polyurethane before assembly. I wanted oak so the poor finish was a plus since I started stripping it as soon as it arrived.

Everything.The plot was like a road that ran thru the lives of this family. There were turns and twists. It kept you moving forward to see where the family would end. You could feel things building without the author having to force feed it to you.The characters were well developed and multi-dimensional. Abigail was strong and smart, but had her own insecurities. I like when I can understand the decisions the characters make. I understood Abigail's perspective when she dealt with her grandfather's mixed race children, her husband, even the town's people.The language of the story helped to establish the setting. I am from Louisiana, so I love when writers are able to make me feel the humid, languid beauty of the south.I strongly recommend that anyone who wants a good read, purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating view of a family","review":"Having read this book, I think I have a better understanding of race relations in the South, particularly in the middle of this century. All the characters were fully developed, and all of the complexities and subtleties of a family with half black siblings, and the aftermath of that discovery, were handled convincingly. What I did not believe was that one of the siblings who went north and passed for white would risk it all by returning south on a well-publicized visit. Otherwise, I would have given the novel a \\"9\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"So much of this book keeps coming back to mind and I chew on the meaning or the motivation for the character.

It was really quite a satisfying read and a great story. Though somewhat bleak, I felt it was a true testament to family ties and bonds. I walked away with a real sense of history and rootedness. It's just too bad it had to be accompanied with so much bitterness and revenge. I would recommend this one to anyone who likes Southern stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"mixed feelings by the end","review":"I read this book because it won a Pulitzer Prize. That is what brought me to it. I would find myself liking passages at one moment and then not liking the book further along...only to have the cycle repeat itself. The prose, wasn't particularly poignant or poetic...two characteristics that for me make a book truly great and memorable. The storyline is what kept me reading... it was refreshing and for the time period in which the book was published, decidedly relevant. Three characters were given a voice beginning and ending with Abigail. Abigail always seemed like a vague child and an even vaguer woman... I was glad to see the novel end the way it did. Though perhaps it was a bit over the top... at least it would have been in \\"real\\" life. I am leaving the book wishing there had been a little more depth to the characters, but also eager to discuss the myriad details that held the book together and struck me as the most interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Romance","review":"If you like what we call the sweet romances (no sex, no violence), you'll enjoy these four novellas that make up the book Carolina. Lehman's vivid description of the southeast, especially the mountains, enables readers to be there. No travelogue information that feels as if the words came off a brochure, Lehman infuses just enough detail to make readers sense how it feels to wade in clear mountain streams or trek along the paths of the Blue Ridge Mountains. But above all, of course, these are four distinct and cleverly plotted romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money.","review":"Maybe I missed something here... but this one was really bad.

The darkness of the work is because the villians are vampires and can't do out in sunlight; but, except for that, they don't seem very horrific. I mean their evil and turn everybody into vampires or use them for food etc.; but none of it is shown and I didn't really get a feeling of them being any different from any other baddie out to take over the world. I'm hoping this is all because of story exposition and plot development, and it'll be made clearer in upcoming editions. That said..It was interesting, holds promise, and I give it 4*."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the REAL DEAL - Great for Advanced","review":"This is my second Ripped video and it is the toughest most enjoyable workout in my collection. I recently went searching for DVD's to add to my collection and found Jari Love and get Ripped. I really feel like I struck gold. I like these dvd's so much I plan to order the entire Ripped collection. The workouts are tough - advanced level but there are modifications for beginner and/or intermediate. A beginner would not be able to finish most of the sets however the great thing about it is that it gives you something to work towards. I added Ripped to my workout 2 weeks ago and have already lost 5lbs and gained some muscle definition. I am definitley a new and loyal fan! If you are advanced, looking for more definition, a new challenge...this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I'm not a beginner to working out, and I love weights.

It is by far the best workout with weights I have ever owned. It's tough but super complete, covers all parts of the body. I dread it because I am still sore.

You will see results in less than 4 weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real results","review":"This DVD has been a staple in my collection for 4 years. It's the first DVD that I've used that seemed to create real results. It's very challenging for beginning and intermediate weight trainers and has modifications so that even the most advanced weight trainers can benefit. It uses more reps that most workout DVDs which is where the results come into play, but even if you are looking for a brief workout, you can make this work for you by only doing a few sections a day. The moves are simple and traditional, which I like. No fancy footwork or complicated routines. Just a good, tough workout for the whole body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Purchase Ever","review":"I really love this video. I've been teaching fitness classes for 5 years and have never found a video for weights that was so effective for all ages at all levels. Jari has such a nice style, she leaves out the glitter but keeps you engaged to continue the workout without being a drill sergeant. I just really love her style and the workout shows results in 2 weeks. If you're looking for a one hour weight workout to do at home, this one is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets you going!","review":"Excellent, just like the first 3 DVDs I bought.Makes you work harder than doing it on your own and even when you don't feel like working out, you don't want to let Jari down and then you really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From DownUnder","review":"Fantastic DVD,it is so tough and you will feel the burn and sore the next day.

This workout was not what I expected. I thought because of all the positive reviews that I would have a complete workout for strength training! Not so. This workout is heavy on the upper body and arms, and gives only a mild workout for the legs. Even Jari's grammar leaves something to be desired. Although who cares if it is a good workout right?!

However, now there's going to be a 2 disc \\"Best Of\\" that is coming out this fall that I will probably update my collection and replace this with. So any of you considering this collection instead might want to wait for that one instead because it has all the hits represented here plus the aforementioned \\"Already Gone\\" and some album tracks that are often played on classic rock radio like \\"In the City\\", \\"Victim of Love\\", etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of the Classic Eagles","review":"I can't tell you Why alone is Worth the Price alone.Hotel California,Life in the fast lane,Best of My love,&the Philly Sounding influenced Take it to the Limit.this is a must have in your collection.this best captures the Eagles.all of the essential Songs here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Very Best Of The Eagles","review":"I'm not too happy with the condition of the cd,not too mention the case!It was scratched and the case was broken.I would like to reoreder it,but not at this time.I love the Eagles music!Karen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered for an Even Better Sound!","review":"This is the best compilation of the Eagles' work on one disc that's out there.

The bass lines are very ordinary. The lyrics are vague, or unclear, which usually doesn't matter - if your music has a hook. The best heavy metal bands in history all had this one thing in common - from Korn to Black Sabbath, no matter how \\"hard\\" the music is, it has a hook. Broken Thoughts does have its moments, where they slow down to an easier, more melodic groove. Word to the band: you need a stronger vocalist to carry your music (no offense), and concentrate on what you're good at. Originality doesn't mean a thing if a song doesn't stick in your audience's head. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful look at humans and nature","review":"This book (a series of nine essays) moves a bit slow, but the pacing is perfect for the style of writing. The essays were on nature, the definition and impact of nature, and instead of vitriolic bashing of human's interaction with nature, Snyder shows that we could live in harmony with our sacred places. I reccommend you read the essays one at a time, and take your time with them. They really make you think about how each culture interacts with the region they are in, and how sometimes we do take our relationship to the wild the wrong way. It is both poetic, and scientific, the perfect education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In spite of my passion for this conserving wild places I couldn't finish this book.

The book does not deliver what is promised on the back cover or introduction. The author glosses over each topic but never actually gives any information that isn't already common knowledge. The computer information is very vague and outdated, the home business chapter spends time on balancing family/photo/part-time wants and not setting up in your home office specific to photography, the model posing and lighting section gives about five pointers that if you haven't already learned them -- you are really only just thinking of being a photographer, finding models has never been a problem so that part and the two \\"legal\\" contracts were useless to me.

I didn't listen.Julie - I hate to think SC could crown such a ditz...IQ is required for Miss SC because she is competing for Miss America. In fact I knew a former Miss SC & I think she'd be insulted.

If someone were telling me these things and strange things started to happen to me and my friends around me, wouldn't I take it at least alittle bit seriously?? That part was kind of frustrating to me.That someone could be that dumb! I kept waiting for her to say, Oh, my life is really in danger!! Well, duh!!!!!!!Anyway, aside from that little anoyance the book was well written, and was really suspensful at the end. The romance was few and far between but that is okay.

I enjoyed her personality, and spunk,and at the end she jumps in and nearly saves both of their lives by attacking Bast one of the bad guys.

The story telling reads like a teenage harlequin romance book. Definitely a beach book you could leave in the sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad, So Sad","review":"The most god-awful book I've ever read! I am very disappointed. I was a fan of Karen Robards. I didn't run out and buy her books as soon as they were published as I do with some of the other authors I'm fond of, but I did consider her a consistent, fun read. However, this book has thoroughly changed my mind...I grew so frustrated with her attempts at hip-hop, cool, wise-cracking humor in the pathetic dialog, I almost put the book down twice-but, alas, I'd paid money for it and was determined to finish it. If she had told the story straight, without this irritating distraction, it could have been a very good story. What happened to the style she was beginning to forge with her modern-day stories such as: Hunter's Moon, The Senator's Wife, The Midnight Hour, and Paradise County..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written romantic suspense","review":"I for the most part really enjoyed this book.

Very disappointing; I won't read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I keep reading Robards because when she's on, it's fantastic. <u>Nobody's Angel</u> is my favorite. In this book, well, it just isn't believable. I hardly think a mobster would marry a girl just to get her into bed. Silly. THe cross dressing bit gets old too. Unless this girl is dumber than most, she would have guessed that he was under cover rather than gay a lot sooner. There is one little thing that has been nagging me both in this book and in <u>Paradise County</u>. She keeps switching styles. It can be and is hot to use more modern language in modern stories. But she can't make up her mind, and keeps slipping into regency verbiage. No modern man suckles a woman's breast \\"like a babe\\" there are other examples as well. This would be strike two, as far as I'm concerned. Hope the next Robards is a home run, or she may just strike out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was a big fan of all her older romances. \\"To Trust a Stranger\\" was too violent to be considered much of a romance.

Thankfully, instead of purchasing this from the bookstore on campus (at an outrageous price), I was able to find a copy via Amazon that was much less expensive.Yes, I was required by the guidelines of the class to read this and while it was more interesting than the other text, it was still a far cry from being entertaining or 'good'. Again, I realize that this is a textbook of sorts that many art classes utilize, but that is no excuse for it to be written in such a boring format and make art and the world of aesthetics seem 'boring' to most.I personally would say not to buy this unless you are really dedicated to wanting to learn about aesthetics or because you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I saw this movie on a flight between Las Vegas and Chicago.

Connery and Jones were at there best in this film. I am a Catherin Zeta-Jones fan big time and I really liked this movie because of her. It has a really good storyline to back it up. At first I didn't know who stole the art work at the beginning of the movie and to tell you the truth I still haven't figured out who it was. That is why I wish that they would tell you. The one good thing that none of you will expect is what happens in the end. I am not going to spoil it for you but for those of you who have seen it you know what to expect right?

I suspect (and hope) each night he laid his head to pillow, that he grit his teeth and imagined ways of breaking his contract. Small town high school students show more vitality and verve than she does in this role. She was soooo terrible in this part, that, thankfully, it distracted me from the amateurish directing, wandering plot lines, and pedestrian script.

Buyers beware: D-Theatre tapes will not play on D-VHS players. Even your state of the art D-VHS machine can't play D-Theatre tapes unless its got the proprietary JVC D-Theatre chip. How can D-VHS catch on if there's already a format battle within D-VHS? Hey movie moguls, it's about the quality of the picture for personal home use (afterall we're paying $1200 for the machine and $40 bucks for each movie) not about making hundreds of copies (you think we could afford the machine if we spent our time making copies?)

There was really no excitement in it- the last Y2K scam scene was really pretty badly done. But the part of this movie really bugs me is that Sean Connery is so old!!!!! I don't mean he's too old to be acting or whatever, he just seems so perverted in this movie (jones/connery sex: the most disgusting thing i could think of and never want to see again). Let's not add to the other fact: there's absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads. But whatever: if you're a die hard action fan and don't mind watching sean connery make out on the floor with catherine zeta jones, this movie's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean, Sean, You can do a WHOLE lot better","review":"I am personally considering suing twentieth century fox so they can give me my 2 hours back for watching that. 2 reasons this movie even got one star: 1-Cathrine Zeta Jones slinking through those lasers 2-There wasn't an option for 0 stars. As much as I respect Connery's ability to command a powerful role and performance, even he fluttered through this wasate of time. I am sure that the screen writer is unemployed unless the WB channel or UPN needs a miniseries. It just seemed like it was never going to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stank worse then year old milk","review":"I watched this film last night and was bored out of my mind. The plot was bland, and the actors were even worse. Catherine Zeta Jones, who is a stunning actress, has no acting ability whatsoever. She lacks any emotion in the film, making her character stupid instead of sly. I would not recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE HAD MORE TWISTS THAN A PRETZEL!","review":"I had high hopes for this movie when it first came to theaters. Sean Connery is quite a good actor and Catherine Zeta-Jones is quite beautiful. But Sean Connery's acting and Catherine Zeta-Jones' beauty couldn't save this film. It started out quite well with the initial heist. The director does a good job pulling you into the story. Then, he takes a turn for the worst and gives you the exact opposite of the criminal you thought you knew all along. It just doesn't add up. If they had just stuck with one twist it could have been a great film. But no! They had to out-twist even a pretzel! What were the screenwriters thinking! Don't see this movie unless you like being not confused by many twists that were meant to confuse and say \\"Hey, this is a great film.\\" Trust me on this one. I hope this is helpful.

After all, Zeta-Jones' body clad in skin-tight garments is certainly a sight worth beholding. However, that's pretty much all this movie can sport: the story is weak and not very original (the \\"Thomas Crown affair\\" is the real thing and a much better movie overall) and the characters are not convinced about their roles (neither are we). It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but it could be better. Go for the other title (The \\"TC affair\\") if you haven't seen it already and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Not Perfect","review":"this film is good were it keeps the audience attracted to it's events, actually I bought it because I think that Mr..

I think this movie seems to lower his acting credentials if compared to his other movies. Also, I don't like the female lead actress. She is horrible.

This movie is suitable for all ages; everyone will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"I had not expected much from this movie, but I ended up liking it very much. While not terribly believable, the plot does not have any major holes in it. It was not entirely original, I recognised several scenes from movies like \\"the Setup\\" and the Thomas Crown Affair. On the other hand, nothing was completely copied end the plot held enough twists to be interesting. The actor did an admirable job, rather better then most action movies. The one difficulty I have with the whole movie is the part played by Connery. While he is still in fysically good shape, it is obvious he is no longer capable of the acrobatics that he is supposed to perform. This however is a minor point."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing plot..","review":"and an awesome movie all around. I really enjoyed this movie. Sean Connery played at his best!

I wanted it for the deleted scense and the alternate ending, well, they stink. there is no talking in these scenes, just sound effects. so you have no idea what is really going on or what they are saying, unless you can read lips. the ending is pretty stupid too, plus, no speaking, so who knows if it could have been better. the director's commentary can be interesting and the trailers and 'making of' are good to watch, but I was really looking forward to the extra footage and am tremendously disappointed. but the movie is pretty good if you haven't seen it. but it's not worth it to do what i did and buy another copy if you already have one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entrapment","review":"A fasinating Film.

I have always admired Sean's skill and presence...What's interesting and a little iffy is that he plays a \\"likeable bad guy\\". His appeal is present in force but I think they could have casted the female lead much better, Jones is no where near the caliber Sean is. I don't like the Bond films...even the ones with Sean, because they are SO predictable and flimsy. Now, usually I like a story with depth and backstory which this one simply doesn't have. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable all the same.I admire that there is no sex scene (I plain don't like them; but that's not to say that Sean has lost his sex appeal, he hasn't!

Now Mr. Connery gets to act with one of the most beautiful actresses in our day. Catherine Zeta Jones (The Mask of Zorro, The Haunting) is a professional thief, being masked by a professional job working for an insurance company. When Virginia (Jones) is sent to hunt down a stolen painting we discover her as the thief. 'Gin' goes to the home of Robert MacDougal 'Mac' (Connery) to help her pull off the thieving job of the century.What starts out as a business relationship soon turns into a physical attraction to each other, hence Connery being lucky.

They should have had Anna Nicole Smith as his love interest, then it would have been believable.Zeta Jones cannot act to save her life!

This is a flick I couldn't get into, even in dvd format. Looking more like a father and daughter, Connery and Zeta-Jones never generate the electricity that say, Brosnon and Russo have in Thomas Crown Affair. I agree with another reader that the stars were miscast. Jones never really gets into character, probably too concious of wanting to look perfect every time she's in a scene. I'm a Connery fan, but the old dog has just simply run out of tricks. We've seen them all. Yes, the theft and the finalé may be worth the price of a rental, but don't buy this, unless you enjoy seeing a 60-some year old man running around with a woman half his age. Ring a bell?

Sean Connery is elegant, if a bit lethargic, in his role, but always an actor who is fun to share a couple of hours with. Zeta-Jones does a good job in her role, but her acting chops have certainly matured since this film.Ving Rhames and Will Patton are adequate, but other actors could have done just as well.There are some really breathtaking scenes, especially with Jones in the initial heist and the jawdropping escape from the bank.

Jones is a thief/insurance investigator who is hired/forced to capture the old master, played by Connery, except she falls in love, a la The Thomas Crowne Affair, with the bad guy and they run off into the sunset together. Except there doesn't appear to be any real motivation for the two thieves to work together and we never see any affection develop between the two.

I have read other books by Barbara Freethy which were moving and exciting page turners. But Summer Secrets did nothing but fizzle my hopes for a good summer read. A bunch of middle age former high school BFFS, and an entitled spoiled teenager take off on an yacht adventure. Anything that could go wrong does. It wouldn't be a tale at sea without the unbelievable clash with pirates. I would have found the book more enjoyable if all of the characters were kidnapped and lost at sea. It was no summer picnic getting through this novel. It is way too predictable and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"This book was cheap and had good reviews and high stars for a summer read. I am sorry but it was so poorly written, predictable and honestly, it was just stupid--even for a summer beach bag read. The author aged herself by poorly capturing her young characters. Eye rolling over the sexual angst that once again makes the author seem to be a generation or two behind the time. Will be more careful when buying books based on amazon reviews. Not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romaance novel","review":"I do not like nor read romance novels. I bought this, and read it, but this is not my favourite.

I should have stopped reading it in the first 50 pages. I thought maybe there would be an intelligent plot twist somewhere along the way, but this book reads like a Harlequin romance without the sex scenes. My apologies to the author and to the fan base, but if you are not a reader of sugar-sweet romance novels, do not buy this book.I would have given the book two stars were it not for the horrific editing. These were not small typos that the experienced reader stumbles over and then keeps reading. These were jarring errors that forced the reader to go back and re-read the last few sentences before the error, in order to decode the meaning. The author should ask for money back from the editor, if there was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read","review":"Barbara Freethy, This was my first book by you, but I assure you it will not be my last!I did lose a bit of sleep because of it, but it was worth it.

However, I would never have finished this book if there was not a \\"summer secret\\" to discover. The editing was terrible, the circumstances were unbelievable, the language was elementary, and the character development was amateurish. There were many twists and turns, which Freethy even pointed out in a sentence that read along the lines of \\"even Tyler could not believe this unexpected twist\\"... not exactly a sophisticated writing style.

The basketball scenes are as well done as any you'll see in any movie, and the comedic personalities of Billy Hoyle (Woody) and Sidney Dean (Wesley) are irresistable. The trash talking, the flashy play, the hustling is all smiles for any basketball fan. The most rewarding part of this movie however is the friendship that develops between Billy Ho and Sidney. They look beyond race and class and find a common ground on the blacktop and in each other's games. They're both so likeable in this movie that it's hard not to feel good about the way it all ends up.

His peculiar style works in the interpretation of Bruckner, Tchaikovsky, and perhaps some of Brahms' works. But Haydn? Combine his extremely slow tempo and gloomy tone in the interpretation of Haydn, and then the youthful freshness, vitality, and clarity of Haydn are all vanished away. What you get is Requiem of Haydn which he never wrote. Don't spend a single penny for this recording. Listen Collin Davis or Eugen Jochum. By far they are the best interpreters of Haydn's symphonies in general, 'Drumroll' in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collectible, terrible hunting.","review":"This knife is NOT for the hunter in the family.

Skiing is far from surfing, in fact a swim coach would probably have a better idea of how to condition for surfing.

Luckly for him he had his dads bag filled with money and credit cards which can help him live and check into a hotel in NYC. Kevin is also smart enough to have his own plane ticket to Florida just in cast a mistake happen's again which it did. The same two bad guys from the first movie use to be called the \\"wet Bandets\\" now the \\"sticky bandets\\" nave escape from jail into NYC."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best holiday films ever,","review":"This is one of a few movies that can be almost ten years old but are still funny. Culkin plays a kid, a very smart kid, who loses his family in the airport and accidentally gets on a flight to New York. Then he does things that I would never think of, like recording his voice on a recorder and playing it deep ona pay phone to check into a hotel. I know it's just a movie and things like that make it hilarious. The hotel scene where he plays a movie and makes the hotel employees think that there is a guy with a machine in the room is my personal favorite. I can't wait for a DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice sequel to the fabulous original movie.","review":"The sequel to the original Home Alone is not as good as the original movie, but it still brings forth joy and sorrow. Very sad how the little boy got left behind again, and this time in a strange, unfamiliar place. I think that all the Home Alone movies carry a special meaning and that people should still continue to watch them, even though the movies are about a decade old.

It was a bit dumbed-down with a formula too easy to read. Did they use some of the same props for this this movie from the first movie? I thought I detected that. I found this review had some good points....\\"They tried the same formula but it did not have the charm, warmth, or laughs of the first film. This time they even threw in a homeless woman to try and capitalize on America's fascination and empathy for homeless people. It didn't work. The homeless woman character seemed to be full of all sorts of wisdom and brilliance. She was also some kind of \\"bird lady\\" who fed pigeons in the park and was almost entirely covered by bird feces. Too bad she didn't use her profound sense of wisdom to understand that being covered in bird poop is unhealthy and disgusting.\\"Caulkin is beguiling and quite a pest...but he is not as good the second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you think seeing people get hurt is funny, this movie's for you","review":"Pure uninspired slapstick.

It was very creative and a fun, family holiday movie, with a lot of laughs. The second one had such potential, but they ruined it in so many ways. First of all, he isn't Home Alone, so the title alone is ridiculously incorrect. He is accidently in NY while his family is searching for him. Everything is so repetitive-from eating ice cream while watching movies, to the pranks he plays on the villains. What I noticed most was the furniture in his hotel room. It is from the house set of the first movie! Look at the 4 poster bed, the tv, the tables, even the lamp and the decorations around the fireplace. After all the money they made on the first movie, they couldn't even purchase new props? Stick with the first movie-this one is just a remake with a lot of bad choices. No charm, whatsover. I gave it 2 stars for keeping the same cast and the lovely scene of the toy store. But those 2 things are not worth the movie, itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Cant Believe They Did it Twice","review":"Actually I would recomend this Home Alone and the first Home Alone movie because both are just as funny. And actually they didnt do it twice because while they left him behind in the first movie in this one he had his own ticket and got on the wrong plane. For that reason alone I disagree with anyone who says if youve seen one youve seen them both. Yes they have similar plotlines. I dont want to get negative or preachy but has it occured to anyone that it stops there? Anyway give Home Alone and Home Alone 2 a try. The third and forth are where they went downhill. Merry Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Christmas Favorite!!!","review":"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the 'Home Alone' series! This is a really good sequel! A year after Kevin stopped Harry and Marv, he gets on the wrong plane and heads to New York, while his family goes to Florida. Harry and Marv broke out of prison, and they happen to be in New York too. Kevin uses his dad's Credit Card to stay at the Plaza Hotel. When the staff scare him away, he tries to visit his relatives, but they are not home. Kevin runs into Harry and Marv who plan to rob a toy store where all the money will go to the Children's Hospital. Kevin sets up the traps again at his uncles' house and chaos ensues, and with the help of the 'bird lady' a showdown happens in Central Park.

In fact, I'm surprised at how well it has worn the test of time. The movie is filled with great scenes and impeccable timing, sometimes approaching slapstick routines. The humor is good natured, but doesn't shy away from some curse words. Of course, Macaulay Culkin makes it all possible with his adorable acting and wisecracks (\\"I'm 10 years old, TV's my life\\"). Most people have probably already seenHome Alone 2: Lost in New York. If you have, I invite you to watch it again whenever you feel nostalgic (especially in light of the fact that Hollywood can't make good comedies anymore).

When we received the Mike Jackson sticks my son decided just to keep them instead of trying to exchange them for the sticks we originally ordered. The Jackson sticks are nice and working out fine.

It is a very interesting book. It is a really fast paced book because it is so action packed. It is one of those, \\"Sit on the edge of your seat until three in the morning when you finish it,\\" books. It is the greatest series everMaximum Ride: the Angel Experiment is about six amazing children, Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel, who have wings and can fly. When one of the flock members, Angel, is captured, by the school, they go on an awesome journey to find her. Then once they find her, they go to a place called the Institute, which has all the files of their past, and try to find out about their parents, who they do not know. That is what happened in the book, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FREAKING BOOK EVER!","review":"Im currently on book four in the Max Ride series, and i stopped by to say that James Patterson did an exeptional job with this book.

I was a Warriors fan before Maximum Ride, but now, Max first, Firestar and the clans second! buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series to get young readers reading!","review":"My daughter started reading this series last week. She loved the first book so much that we went and bought the rest of the series for her. At her school library, the waiting list for book one is over 10 long. I cannot say enough about how well James Patterson writes, he makes it almost impossible to put down the book until you are finished with it, and then it is all you can do is think about starting the next one. This type of writing is what gets young readers hooked on the wonderful world of getting lost in a book, living out other lives many times over. I cannot thank Mr. Patterson enough for his talent, not only in crafting a great read, but for his efforts in getting young people reading. He is truly a gifted writer and this series is one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"This book is by-far the best book i have ever read!

However that is just the beginning. Patterson seems to be rushimg through it. There is not enough detail nor is there a comclusion. zthe overall realism is pathetic. I still don't know where the climax is or the real problem. It seems whem they get taken back to the School, they ae rescued in the most unlikely manner, by a flock of hawks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good read","review":"I thought this was a good read.

But I also read this series in order in about 3 days so I didn't have to wait for the next book at all. I seriously could not put this book down I read this book in less than 2 hours and rushed out to the nearest store because I couldn't wait to get the next book. I personally did not think this was the best book in the series I liked Max, Fang, and angel the best but you have to read this one first. I cannot wait for the next book to come out February 2012. I was such a nerd I know when the last book comes out before amazon. Also this book is really open ended towards age groups and gender. I would recommend this book to anyone between 8 and ancient.

It is a very poorly written story with zero suspension of disbelief. I only made it about 60 pages into the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Beyond the bad writing/dialog, I simply could not relate to a main character who is supposedly grieving beyond comprehension because her loved one was taken to be tortured and killed, but in route to rescue her she stops for a nap that turns into a slumber. After wasting all that time sleeping, she gets sidetracked again because she sees some kid who may be getting picked on that she has to stop to help... Really?? Loved one tortured and killed vs a kid maybe being picked on and you delay for that... Nice priorities! I'm sure it gets much worse than that, but that is where I had to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel, Or Comic Book without Pictures?","review":"I have just recently finished the third book in the Maximum Ride series, and let me tell you, it is not worth your time. The back story is lacking, and only consists of Max (short for Maximum) briefly talking about what happened before you (the reader) came into play. The story then catapults into a broken record plot line of \\"The Bad Guys\\" showing up at wherever the group is, with the group narrowly escaping while making \\"The Bad Guys\\" look as foolish and inexperienced as possible. Repeat Plot line for all books, with a small dash of originality thrown in.RECAP:1. Would be a great gift for a young reader. (It does seem like it was written by someone under the age of 12.)2. Not so great for an older reader (15 and up)3.

It was amazing!!! And that's coming from an average 10-year-old girl. Ok, maybe I'm not THAT average, but I'm close! The reason say that is because, I LOVE TO READ!!! And you probably know that not a lot of average 5th graders like to read. The thing is, I can only read a lot if I LIKE the book. If don't like it, it takes me forever to read!

I'm sorry ... that is just plain dishonest and deceitful. You should be ashamed of yourself ... Your morals are lacking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no ending","review":"I realize that this is supposed to be the start of a series, but really! A book should have an ending, closure, something that leaves us satisfied and still wanting. This book has neither of these. It just stops. All the questions that you had during the book and especially in the final moments, the new questions that you have, are left hanging. The questions like, who is Max, is Jeb her father, what about the other \\"angels\\"? What about the other experiments that they freed? Who is the voice? I know it sounds like I'm probably giving some stuff away, but trust me I'm not. The book could have been great if he had finished it. As it is, you get only half the book, half the story and none of it is satisfying in the least. Stick with Harry Potter.

I'm usually not that picky about swear words, but I've had such bad luck with books lately, that this just made me happy. :)I'm not in a huge hurry to read the rest of the series, but I think I'll most certainly be picking them up someday when I need an escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually pretty good","review":"I'm not a fan of James Patterson, but since this one was free, I got it.

I've already chosen to use this as the book for our next teen book discussion. A young boy came in a few days ago and asked for a good fantasy book, although this book isn't exactly in the fantasy catagory I still gave it to him and heavily encouraged him to read it.

James Paterson is a good writer who adds lots of detailed adjectives that let the reader paint a mental picture of the story in their head. The only thing that bothered me though, is that each chapter is only about 2-3 pages, but i got used to it pretty quick. But other then that it was a good science fiction book.

It wasn't so good that I'm going to rush out and buy the next one (which I think, is probably the whole point.) Also, there were lots of huge holes in the plot...for example, all that guessing at a password to use the jerk's ATM card. An ATM would've locked them out after three or four tries. And would've confiscated the card. Same thing with the computer they were trying to hack into. Jeez, even I know that, and I'm not a computer whiz.

I thought this book was going to be amazing from first page to the very end, but by the time I was half way through I was wanting to quit. I think part of the reason I didn't enjoy it is do to the length. This book was sooo long! I just kept guessing when it was going to end and when it finally did end I gave a huge sigh of relief! I also thought the plot was a bit dull... The book was an \\"adventure\\", but some things seemed like they repeated themselves. Over and over again. For example, the hunt for the Institute. It took up over half the book. I like things to go a little faster. At this point I am not sure if I will continue reading the books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start....","review":"I purchased this book because it was free...but I believe I would of purchased it anyway.

The first book I read by James Patterson, and honestly I was expecting a lot worse. The only complaint I have is the first book being a lot easier to acquire than the others. My local public library only has the first, which I find hard to understand. Why have only the first book in a series?Anyway, back to the book. I found I could really relate to Max, as I am her age. Love Gasman, Angel, and Fang also, but at some points I got a little irritated with Iggy and Nudge. Nudge especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it!","review":"The story of the whole flock is really interesting and unique. You get to know each of them throughout the whole book, and have a lot of good laughs. It may feel unfinished by the time you are done with the book, but there is a reason to it: Max still needs to save the world. I totally recommend the Maximum Ride Novels to ANYONE who loves action, adventure, romance and comedy (Yes, Patterson puts it all in there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for reluctant age 11 and up readers...","review":"If you can get your age 11 or older child to read \\"Maximum Ride...\\", they will not be disappointed. This is the only book by Mr. Patterson that I have read but I was struck by his ability to craft a fast moving, very exciting tale. Others critique the weak characterizations and dialogue but if you have a child who loves adventure stories with a strong dose of fantasy this is the book that may launch them into being more avid readers. What isn't clear at present is if Mr. Patterson can sustain the core of this tale over several books in a series. We will have to wait and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book rocks","review":"I just brought this book. I just start reading it. The only problem that i'm having is that the characters aren't the same as they were in two other books (When the Wind Blows and The Lake House. The only character is the same is Max.

The book is really good through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par Writing","review":"I read this really quickly, and that's not a good sign, like eating your veggies when you're a kid just to get it over with. I have a habit of having to finish the books I start even if they're bad. This is one of those books.The ideas in this book are interesting and even compelling; however, the writing is choppy and bland. It's driven by dialogue and not description or plot. I find Patterson's attempt at first-person writing from the perspective of a 14-year-old girl to be unconvincing. It's like he's really writing her as if she's a boy but he's just calling her a girl. Maybe he's trying to appeal to more people that way but I find it negatively affects the character.My husband bought this to read on a long flight and he quit because he couldn't stand the writing, and he's a fan of some of Patterson's other writing. I think all the hub-bub is just because Patterson is famous for adult fiction. He should stick with that. This foray into YA fiction was a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for Pre-Teens, not a good \\"cross-over\\" novel","review":"Some young adult novels are good \\"cross-over\\" novels and have the ability to entertain and engross all ages (i.e. Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, Earthsea, etc.). This, unfortunately, isn't one of those novels. I can't even say that the writing would be a good \\"teen read.\\" In fact, I would place it in the \\"pre-teen\\" caetegory.The writing, per se, is not bad, but for an adult reader, not terribly engrossing. I liked the concept, but did not find it to be much of a page turner, perhaps because the characters were not depicted in depth enough early on to draw me in. A mediocre read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good--continuity problems keep it from being great","review":"This is a very good read, and Mr. Patterson definitely keeps the reader engaged in the story from the first page. You quickly come to care about the human/avian children, and their fates. My only quibble with the book (keeping it from a five-star rating) is the lack of continuity between it and 'Lake House'. Going under the assumption that 'Max' here is the same young lady as in the previous two bird books, there is no explanation of what went on during the intervening four or so years, nor what happened to some major characters. On top of that, some of her backstory has changed. Please don't get me wrong--it's a good book and I'll be eagerly awaiting the sequel. However, a cleaner tie-in to the previous works would have made it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"half a book","review":"i am def a big fan of book series that have a lot of books in them i.e. harry potter. the big difference with harry potter is that each book is somewhat self contained. when read together it adds t the whole experience but each book has a beginning middle and end. this book is just the beginning of the whole story. there are a lot of interesting story ideas that literally go nowhere. it really is half of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I Read it","review":"This book is not good young adult fiction. It's simply dumbed down adult fiction. From the unbelievable premise to the concocted adversaries to the shameless plug for the next book, this is an exercise in merchandising more than literature.

It's a little bland for me but then Patterson's works often are... it's still not a bad read. What IS bad is the realization (upon finishing the book) that THERE IS NO ENDING!!!!! That's right folks, in little more than a mental mugging the writer attempts to force the reader into buying the sequel in the hope that maybe IT will have some sort of lucid conclusion. Now, I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I do have my good days.

However, I was totally surprised. I fell right in line with it and soon found myself truly loving the story line. At first I wasn't sure that I liked how short the chapters were and that they usually meant a perspective change. However, that made the flow of the book work really well and I ended up loving it. There is happiness, sorrow, sarcasm, and humor in this great read.The story follows 6 kids (Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gazzy, and Angel) who are fighting for their lives and trying to find what the future holds for them. They start to get ahead and then something makes them pause. Through all the trials, you watch as some grow into new gifts and others find out more of themselves, while some still find out more of others.

A friend of mind told me that these books were being made into a movie and outlined the premise, and (ugh) it didn't sound so bad - I enjoy random \\"experiment/people escape from the lab, try to make it in the real world\\" random fiction. After reading 3/4 of the book, I have to wonder if James Patterson is even literate, much less capable of producing decent fiction. I hate buying books and not finishing them, but I can't even think of a REASON to care about making it to the end. The characters are all essentially the same (dull and undeveloped) person, with little nervous tics and random handicaps to intended to make them seem distinct - but instead, making the act of trying to empathize with them vaguely nauseating.NOT recommended under any circumstances, unless you're looking for something to just kill a couple of brain cells and punish you for your sins."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've read all of James Patterson's books, but this will probably be the last.

Simple plot, stupid (even for children) characters, nothing to keep my attention. I usually finish a book this size in about a day. This one was so dull it took me over four.

The story is just unfolding when suddenly I am reading an epilogue! I was beginning to wonder why the 35% to 40% white space and all of the extra verbiage when the book suddenly ends. There was no warning that this was just the start of a series, but even so I see no reason why it could not have stood on its own feet as, for instance, the Harry Potter stories do. I should have sensed the movie plan and foreseen the hacking that I've come to expect from Patterson in later years. Still I resent the waste of time. One star for the movie action potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying High","review":"I saw the second title of this series at my local Borders bookstore, and decided to try the first title. Do not be fooled by the \\"Young Adult\\" category; this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read. Though a little adolescent at times, this novel is still excellent, and I recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really bad.","review":"The author's intention here was for the readers to go and grab the next book in the series.

He is sadly mistaken.

There is a vast amount of material amassed but the structure of the book is poor.It seems being overburden with details and particulars and lacking unified clear consistent approach. In addition some mistakes are just plain annoying. If one wants to be serious about vibrations - do not sweat over this book. It can be just another somewhat usefull reference book to find some particular solution to for some particular problem.Instead one can study mechanics with beautifully written classical L.Meirovitch, \\"Fundamentals of Vibrations\\" which is much more original, rigorous, clear, usefull and serious book to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Book","review":"I used this textbook for my Mechanical Vibrations course and was very displeased with it. My biggest gripe is the lack of examples in each chapter. There are an abundance of homework problems at the end of each chapter, but the vast majority of them are not illustrated at all in example problems. I noticed this immediately in Chapter 1 when attempting to solve several of the problems. The text also develops equations and formulas without detail and explanation. Luckily my teacher developed the eqations in class lecture and provided the majority of information for the course. While working out homework and test problems that were assigned, the book was of little use for me. I think the clarity of writing could be better, as well. By the way, I got an A in the course and still found the book to be poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"I found this book to be very hard to understand, and not very systematic. in some of the examples it is assumed that you know how to do all the math, or you understand entirely the thought process. Maybe there is not a better text, but compared to my other engineering text books, I would say this is one of the worst that i have used. It seems that it would be better for those who have a strong understanding of dynamics. Not introductory courses to the subject.And again one of the largest drawbacks that i found was it did not have great examples, some were good, some were ok, but they did not cover the sections well in my opinion.Also one of the most annoying things is a formula that we used extensively for 3 weeks was found in an example, not in the text where it should have been for those who don't fully examine the examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"An undergraduate text which is unclear...not enough examples","review":"On the surface, this text seems to cover everything and seems well-organized. However, further examination will reveal that it is often unclear and seems to skip or briefly mention many important subjects. Further, there are not nearly enough examples to convey the subject matter to the average undergraduate engineering student. Unfortunately, it has been my experience (after 6 years as a mechanical engineering student) that there are hardly any well-written texts on the subject of mechanical vibrations. This one only reinforces that notion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"What started off as a clear, concise text that fully explained basic concepts quickly degraded into a confusing and unhelpful text that seemed to assume you already knew the topics and treated it as a review. Example problems are completely worthless as Rao often skips dozens of steps at once, assuming the reader is already a pro at modeling complex physical systems. To make matters worse, there seems to be a distinct lack of explanations and plain definitions for many terms that are randomly introduced into the topic. Modal shapes, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, etc. are all introduced with little to no background information.The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I could potentially see the book's value as a review text or reference, but as the main text for an introductory course on vibrations... Well, let's just say you better have a much better teacher than Rao is a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book.","review":"How can you rate any book written on the Book of all Books anything less than 5 stars? This book is somewhat complex and requires the reader to cross-reference materials and generally contemplate the written material. Not a light read.

The original Rangers, Jason and Kimberly, are back. Since I don't care for the new series, I really enjoyed seeing Austin St. John again for his martial arts skill and trademark over-acting prowess that made the original series so fun to watch. The very pretty Amy Jo Johnson makes this movie easy on the eyes, and the rest of the fun, cheesy story, along with the comically fun characters round out this movie in an awesome way. If you don't care for Power Rangers and you don't enjoy a lot of Nacho Cheese, this movie probably isn't for you.

This movie really sucks compared to the first one. First a kid named Justin becomes a Power Ranger after another one is injured and the character and the acting just doesn't cut it. What also sucks is that Kimberly and Jason from the original Mighty Morphin PRs are there and it is clear that Tommy still have feelings for Kimberly and as a fan of the Tommy/Kimberly romance Kat being there just ruins everything. Divatox is cool as a villian but doesn't compare to Rita and Ivan Ooze as she is too conceited and superficial which gets annoying after a while. Overall, at this point the series Power Rangers has changed so much that what made the Power Rangers popular is completely GONE. I can't even identify with the characters anymore. EVERYTHING has changed. The only thing I did like was the technological advances in their Zords and their gadgets. Thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"turbo (...), down with turbo, down with turbo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Power Rangers Turbo is the worst Power Rangers season of all!!!

Tommy and the other Rangers used to be cool until the people at Saban made them not the Power Rangers Turbo, but the Loser Dork (...)

It's cool to see two of the original Rangers comeback, and the Turbo Zords are a nice change from the animal-based Zords of previous versions. And what's \\"Power Rangers\\" without the antics of Bulk and Skull? Their still the best comic relief since Abbot and Costello. Unlike the first movie, they decided to keep the look of the series, rather than flashy effects, and ties in to the series as a set-up of \\"Power Rangers Turbo\\".

And in the case of Power Rangers Samurai, the characters are actually pretty thoughtful and try to teach a lesson. So when I saw the positive reviews for this movie, I thought it was a slam-dunk. But about a quarter through, my 5 year old was scared and wanted to turn it off. We persevered a bit, but some of the bad guys in this are really gross and creepy.

Maestro Sawallisch gives an intimate parlor reading of the cycle (much in keeping with Schubert's own milieu) while Thomas Hampson leads a full-blown operatic assault. This is disappointing because I prefer Hampson's work when he sings on a smaller scale. Just listen to his Scene from Faust in the Hyperion Schubert Edition, where he practically whispers into Marie McLauglin's ear. It is some of the most compelling drama I have ever heard.I much prefer the recording of Winterreise by Thomas Allen and Roger Vignoles, where there is a strong sense that the performers are on the same page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance, crystal clear digital recording","review":"An hinthimistic travel through sentiment and emotion in hostile nature.

I prefer the sound of LIVE AT LEEDS--the echo is warmer--but that is nitpicking. They are both great live LPs in their own right, and owning both is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical expiriance to remember","review":"This CD is perfect for any fan of The Who, or anyone looking to see what the fuss is all about over this band. It functions almost like a Who primer, including all of their greatest songs (with the possible exeption of \\"Who are you\\") alongside their masterpiece, \\"Tommy\\". This performance of Tommy is a true milestone in the evolution of the Deaf, dumb, and blind boy. It is representative of the golden age in between the original double-album released in 1969 and the disasterous Ken Russell movie. Alongside the great music, you can almost smell the cannabis in the stale air, and see Pete Townshend playing his guitar windmill-style. As close as you can come to the 60's without time travel.

You can read all the glowing reviews here (I sure did) and be swayed. Or you can save your dough and go back to the Live at Leeds 14 track version, which includes many of the same songs, just in a more stirring performance. And, as a bonus, you get to skip the perfunctory Tommy stuff completely. It just ain't worth it. From the sadly missing horns in the overture to the strained vocals throughout, this Tommy is a hobbled version of the original.I read here The Who was the finest live act ever. Maybe they were, though I sure did not see every big band in those days. I saw many, including the Moon-drumming Who twice, and was richly rewarded both times. Those were fun nights, with an energy and vibrancy I enjoyed. This CD just does not measure up.No need for more comment. I didn't much like it. Leeds is still a winner, this, a remote runner-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism, if you please...","review":"After wearing out a copy of the Live at Leeds remaster (not true, but you get the idea), I figured I'd give their IOW cd a try; knowing that this is was one of the best live bands of all time, how bad could it be?In actual fact, it's a solid live album, and like most of the other reviewers, the tunes from Tommy performed here are worth owning, but the band takes a bit too long to get into their groove, and Moon's drumming on the first 4 songs is pretty awful, by their own previously set standards.I don't doubt that it was probably a fantastic show to attend, but Live at Leeds is the stronger album, in both performance and sound quality. This album sort of catches them on the way down, and while they still had a long way yet to fall by 1970, it's not an essential live recording. Anybody that tells you so is likely a die-hard fan, and as such, their opinion is too biased to give you honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real WHO","review":"I can only consider a The WHO Live recording when it's with all 4 members and Keith Moon is here and sounds great.The recording sounds a bit rougher than the Live At Leeds stuff (recorded soon after that) but because of the period recorded it well worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too tired","review":"Everything about this release is wrong, except for the content. Maybe if the sound was recompressed, remixed and washed out a couple of times it might be tolerable. It seems most of The Who's punch from \\"Live at Leeds\\" was lost in the open air of this festival. I've heard better bootlegs, but not to say that this recording is \\"dirty\\", because it's not. If anything is too quiet, clean and tired. I'd pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"who did this?","review":"this is by far the worst live disc I have heard.

So their live Tommy is seperated between the two discs, so what! At least there is a live Tommy (that was until there was a Live At Leeds Deluxe). There are alot of cool jams on here worth to listen to, like John Entwistle's \\"Heaven and Hell\\", \\"Water\\", \\"Tommy Overture\\", \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", \\"Shakin' All Over/Spoonful/Twist And Shout\\", and \\"Substitute/My Generation/Naked Eye/Magic Bus.\\" I won't say that it is an important album to buy for any Who Fan, but if you do decide to buy it, it's good to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd part product- flimsy in comparison to original","review":"Though I'd save money and buy these.

The mac and cheese was decent, but not mouth watering.I was ashamed to serve this crap to my southern-bred boyfriend.

Sylvia collects recipes from friends, family and neighbors, and writes nostalgically about picnics, church events and fun serving soul food.Sylvia founded a wonderful restaurant business in Harlem, NY and in Atlanta, Georgia. She reveals some of her secrets to soul food here. But the recipes are deceptively simple and unless you grew up on great soul food (I did not) you might have trouble to reproduce the complexity of flavor. Like Cajun cooking, soul food seems to be based on experience and a honed sense of taste for seasonings that defies documentation.But you can try, and this is a fine book for recipes, especially for chicken and for vegetables like limas and greens.

Her Song \\"Reach\\" truly captivates the mind and soul and reflects the raw tallent a singer who can enflict her feelings of emotion to the audience with her voice. Sadly the rest of the album lacked to what should have been a grammy winner. The over use of the afro-latin beat killed it and that ever cheeky \\"higher\\" was probably one of her worst songs ever written. In short if you are appreciate the true afro rhythem beat, then you would not mind this album, but for the rest of us who appreciate Gloria as that latin Dancing, Disco singing, Miami Sound machine girl, then you'd appreciate her other albums, particularly her greatest Hits CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different, but I liked it.","review":"This album is a little bit different than previous hits like CUTS BOTH WAYS or INTO THE LIGHT.

This one is brisk but unemotional, cleanly sung and played but totally lacking in drama. All of the voices (Heppner included) sound as if they are reaching for something but not finding anyone there but, more startling, Colin Davis' conducting has no dramatic feel or forward impetus despite (or perhaps because of) the brisk tempos. You would do much better to buy the old 1969 recording with Veasey and Vickers or, better yet, the early-'80s Met video with Jessye Norman (Cassandra), Placido Domingo (Enee) and the late Tatiana Troyanos (Dido) in one of her greatest roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped it was better","review":"My husband heard one song of this album on the radio and ordered the CD.

Nicholson, as he usually is, is hauntingly convincing as the blue collar working man turned labor powerbroker and, dare we say, Mafia puppet. But the film is more a showcase of the labor movement's history and conveys the struggle of the then-working class. In a supporting role, DeVito augments his producing-directing duties incredibly, and his project is a spendid snapshot not only of the title subject but the sign of Hoffa's times. Unlike real life, though, DeVito treats us to his suspicion as to how Hoffa met his end, and his explanation is about as good as anyone has come up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Representative of one style of popular storytelling that entertained those growing up to become \\"The Greatest Generation\\".Definitely dated,slightly campy,but still thoroughly enjoyable for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I used this text for my developmental class.

The cardio bursts integrated in this program are great. I recommend this program for anyone that wants a TOTAL workout. Clear instructions, not too talky, music is not too annoying. I appreciate that the instructor does all the moves in the workout. A total weight and cardio program."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 calories? Yeah, right...","review":"I was highly disappointed by this video, particularly because I feel that the description and reviews were misleading. Don't be fooled - this is a STEP AEROBICS video. Several reviewers said that you could get a good workout without the step. While it is true that there are modifications offered, it basically amounts to marching in place or jumping jacks. For some people the heavy emphasis on the step may be fine, but I hate step aerobics (hello 1980s!). Also, I didn't find the workout challenging at all, and I find it very hard to believe that anyone could possibly come close to burning 1000 calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!:(","review":"Oh my gosh that was the most boring exercise video I've done in years!Don\\"t be fooled by the title and flashy picture on the cover.Also no offense to Jari but she looks really creepy in these and not how I would ever want to look like.Keep looking there are alot of good ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"I got this in a 4 pack of Jari Love DVDs. This was the first I tried. Pretty challenging. I was impressed. I liked how she calmly explained the moves...no yelling or cutsie stuff. There is a lot of back and forth between the cardio/step and weights which breaks up the workout. But the cardio segments felt a little short.I have been doing The Firm DVDs lately. This is significantly harder than those.I hope the rest of the DVDs in the pack are up to the same standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will lover her! And you will be dripping sweat!","review":"Found this by looking for what was the most effective cardio video. And this video was what all the pros said to use. I can't stand many instructors. I love her. She is motivating and soothing all at the same time. I'm not into the drill sergeants that feel like bulls charging at me. She will make you work, you will get through it, and you will have worked your up a major dripping sweat. It's awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the odd man out","review":"I'm an avid home work out-er. I heard about Jari and figured I should give her a try since everyone is raving about her. I found this work out BORING. Don't get me wrong, it's hard, but the amount of the same set over and over I found very dull. I didn't think it was as hard as it was made out to be either. The main point is if it's a hard work out, I like to be distracted, and feel like the time flies so I'm not focusing on how terrible I feel. I felt like this work out dragged on and on. I did it twice, and decided that was enough for me. I also found all their bodies disgusting. Over tanned, zero body fat, nastiness. Her body doesn't motivate me at all. Also, what's with her asking \\"Are you smiling?\\" It made me want to punch her in the face! I was so annoyed at her saying that. She said it like three times, and always at moments when I really wouldn't be smiling. All in all, I like Tracie Long better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well done, not worth it","review":"I was very excited to get this dvd, I had heard great things and who is going to argue with burning 1000 calories in a hour? I was really upset when I started my first workout and you couldn't see the trainer's whole body. They would start sets of her working out showing her from the waist up, I had no idea what she was doing with her feet! I think it would have been a great workout, but they did a bad job filming it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a bootleg version?","review":"The quality of the video was not very good. The music was awful too. The concept is good, but I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"good work out but too long","review":"good work about but one hour is too long for me. I need a more condensed workout that can produce result in about 30mins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"This dvd was recommended by Fitness magazine, so I decided to give it a try. It's awesome! It takes about 1 hr, but it alternates between cardio and strength training. At the end there's a couple ab exercises then stretching. I do it about 2-3 times a week, because of the high intensity. The cardio is fast paced, and you'll be huffing and puffing to keep up. (I do!) Plus she includes variations to the exercises, in case you don't have a step or if you need lower intensity. One exercise you do 70 push-ups. But it's broken down, you do 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, then 4, with stretches after each set. When I started the video a couple weeks ago I could do about 40, but now I can do 70! (I still do them on me knees, but this week I'm going to start them the right way.) I'm getting toned allover, especially my lower body, which is my problem area! This is definately worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"how does she do it???","review":"This workout is awesome! Somehow, you work you a** off, and definitely feel it after, but the workout is doable b/c she cuts it up into mini mini segments. Just by the time you are ready to quit, she moves on to another muscle group and you just keep tagging along... I have ordered all of her dvd's and can't wait to try them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT","review":"Fun and challenging workout. Jari Love is motivating and not too chatty. The music is good and there is just enough variety in the workout so one doesn't become bored. If a workout is what you want, a workout is what you're going to get. It's a good buy for the fun and the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I own all of Jari's workouts and this is my favorite! I love the compound exercises coupled with the cardio intervals for maximum calorie burn. I always appreciate that at least 1 performer is doing the modified version of the exercises especially since I don't own an aerobic step yet. I had to increase some of the weights as I am more advanced with weight training, but love all the sets in this workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"Well, personally, I found this to be one of the most boring workouts ever. For me, Jari couldn't be more unmotivating and just plain boring. It's hard for me to even comment on the workout itself because I went mind numb doing it. (I actually think the workout itself was decent, but I had a really hard time getting past how bored I felt doing it. I am a big fan of Jillian Michaels and her style of workout, not that I'm comparing the two, just for reviewers reference) Obviously there are plenty of people out there who like this video, I'm just not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A workout for anyone!","review":"This yoga and Pilates workout offers something for everyone, at any level of fitness and flexibility. I have used it with my kids as well as my 80 year old mother! Plus Melissa Stone isn't your typical emaciated instructor - she's juicy! Great positive daily nourishment for body and soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This website is decieving","review":"This cd has nothing to do with lars pederson, and should not be in the when store.

I could not put the book down and kept reading and reading. I recommended it to my mother and she also read it and loved it. It is Mrs. Henry Wood's greatest triumph. The reader feels so greatly for Lady Isabel, one wishes the ending were happier for her. The deaths of little William and finally Lady Isabel bring many tears. No wonder it was such a success in the Victorian era and it should be printed again in this time, to counter so much trash and vulgarity that is written.I certainly can believe how successful it must have been when it was first printed in 1861. I also believe anyone who reads it wishes Lady Isabel back in her ex-husband's life and Barbara Hare out! Wonderful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coyotes Know","review":"What a beautiful book, both in the rhymes that tell a story and in the woodcuts that capture the remains of the Old West: 1904, to be exact, when two miners struck gold and the boomtown of Rhyolite, Nevada, sprang up. Four years later, 10,000 people with all their accoutrements deserted the town in a matter of weeks. Banks failed, businesses went bust, and the desert began its work . . . as the coyotes sensed it would. This is a book worth reading aloud, worth studying for meaning and illustrations. If I'm ever in Nevada, I would want to visit the ghost town of Rhyolite just because of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice children's book","review":"We ordered and read this after visiting Rhyolite. Really helped explain to the kids what happened there."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the verge of stardom","review":"I've been on this Robert Rodriquez (and friends) kick lately and his sister Patricia Vonne was featured on his \\"Mariachi and Mexico\\" compilation. Her voice on \\"Serverina\\" is awesome which led to the purchase of this album. While equally adept at singing Neo Country or a striking spanish song, she keeps things interesting with her energy and style. She's a talent and needs to stay on the road of \\"heavy Mariachi\\" and she'll be someone to reckon with. The more she can play with her brother, Del Castillo and Tivo, the better her sound will be. Regardless, this album is a keeper with numerous quality tracks that get better with each listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chin-ning Chu has great insight into doing business with Asian culture","review":"This book was not quite as exciting as Thick face Black heart, but was still worth the read! I did find it very intriguing & helpful with gaining new insight regarding doing business with Japanese and Chinese. She shares straight from the heart & doesn't hold anything back when sharing Asian secrets. If you are a Business person or salesman who deals with Asians, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK! I feel much more adequate to negotiate with Asians now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"If you are serious about understanding the Asian mind-set, and are tired of those who pretend to know, this is THE definitive book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"This is a frank discussion of the Oriental mind-set by an Oriental living in the US. I found the historic context quite fascinating. I had heard about the \\"The Art of War\\" and it was nice to get some background as well as a summary. I particulary liked the historic illustrations of use of the strategies.Insights into business etiquette, social hierarchy and what to be aware of in each of the regions is given.Since the book was written (1990) the economic miracle of Japan has stalled, so it would be interesting to get an update as to how the attitudes of workers may have changed in the intervening period where job security is no longer assured."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Asian Mind Game","review":"Without question this is one of the most incisive books written about living and working with Asians, especially the Chinese and Japanese. Put this together with some knowledge of Group Dynamics and you will have two very powerful tools to engage in business with Asians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jerks First And Finest.....","review":"This is the Circle Jerks' best album, yet it's only about 15 min. long. The best thing to remember: Try to get the version on Porterhouse Records(Greg Hetson's(C.J. guitarist)new label), as it includes a cd-rom with a video(Target video's Beverly Hills) as well as 8 bonus tracks(5 you have to register for), and it's all great. The 14 main tracks are all amazing, under 2 min. blasts of adolescent punk rock, bratily sung by former Black Flag vocalist Keith Morris. A must own for any hardcore punk enthusiast. Killer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have! A Must-Have","review":"Plenty of reviews on this one -- I have to say, my buddy played this for me in 1981, along with the DKs, Fear, D.O.A., Angry Samoans, Crass, Black Flag -- it changed my life! I suddenly felt better (and continue to do so!).My dad hated even the guitar tracks from this LP (likewise the Samoans) -- it was amazingly vile to the Establishment of the time, they just despised it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Ill...","review":"14 songs in about 15 minutes... incredible.

After listening to the album for a little while I can't pinpoint one song that I really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speed, Budweiser, and Pimples","review":"Absolutely great album. Short, fast, and humorous. Keith Morris's social commentaries, backed with an alarmingly tight and fast band make this one of the BEST hardcore albums ever! They kinda went downhill after this, in my opinion. The last song, \\"Group Sex\\" is hilarious (and co-written by Jeffrey Lee Pierce of the Gun Club). In it Morris reads off a phone number for the infamous residence that hosted sex parties in the 70s. Well, one night about 15 years ago I called the number and spoke to a woman who knew excatly why I called. She said many people had called her over the years, but were disappointed to find out that the phone number belonged to someone else now and that she didn't host these parties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want Hardcore Punk???","review":"This Cd is one of the best Cd's I own!!!...and probably one of the shortest.

Second, every movie has Korean subtitles that cannot be turned off (even if you go into the \\"setup\\" menu item and select none).That being said, the transfers look acceptable and the price is hard to beat. Had I to do it over again though, I probably would NOT buy this. It's nothing more than a cheap knock-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A *VERY* Bad experience!","review":"I ordered this collection & had high hopes. Unfortunately, it was a bad experience:1) The biggest problem is that some of the movies have SUBTITLES YOU CAN'T TURN OFF. I put \\"The Great Dictator\\" in and noticed the Korean subtitles - which were on by default. So I went to the menu and was able to turn them off. Then I put in \\"Modern Times\\" & noticed the same thing, so I went to turn them off BUT YOU CAN\\"T! There is no \\"set up\\" menu item on that disc, unlike the \\"The Great Dictator\\" disc. BOOO! I didn't check any other discs, just went to return it at this point.2) The plastic box that the DVDs comes in arrived badly broken. The DVD s looked fine, and played OK, but the case was badly damaged.3) The item did not ship on its ship date, but Amazon did not inform me of any delays until I emailed them. Thankfully, they apologized and upgraded the shipping, to their credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"illegal pirate version","review":"this is a cheap korean pirated copy.Wondering what to do as i am now in possession of an illegal copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound/Steep Learning Curve on Controls","review":"The sound can't be beat. After just a little tuning, the system sounds great for either movies or stereo.The controls and setup require patience and the manual.

Most everything is included, but it would have been nice to have a digital audio cable and some heavier gage speaker wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little irritating","review":"I liked the convienece of these pads with the lanolin built in but the pads irritated my skin a little. The edges of the pads were not soft. I wouldn't purchase these again. I'm going back to the Johnson and Johnson pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept But Okay Product","review":"The concept of the pads are great. However, product execution was not done very well. While it varies from pad to pad, the amount of lanolin seemed decent. Even the main material of the pad, the portion that contains the lanolin, feels comfortable. The problem for me was that the size of the pads and/or the material around the outer edges. The material around the edges of the pads was very uncomfortable in that it's too scratchy. It feels like paper and would have been better if it was the same as the material of the pad. The size of the pads also seem small (I'm ~42DD) because of the scratchiness. Perhaps if the pads were larger it wouldn't be as much of a problem of it a different material was used all together. I stopped using them and instead use another disposable brand all together & just add lanolin myself as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nursing pads ever!","review":"These nursing pads are so fabulous! This is my third baby and I've always had problems with leaking. I thought I was just doomed to be constantly wet and get up several times each night to change my bra and nursing pads.

They made learning to feed my baby much easier! I tried using lanolin out of a tube but it was a pain to apply after every feeding. These do the work for you. Just pop them into your nursing bra and you're done. My skin never cracked or bled with these! I am so happy with these pads I am going to give them as baby shower gifts to every pregnant woman I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay in place well","review":"I'm a second time nursing mother and I am very glad I found this product. Other reviewers are correct that the amount of lanolin can vary from pad to pad, but I disagree that some pads have no lanolin at all. I am on my 3rd box, and that hasn't happened to me yet. I try to use lanolin or another nipple cream after each feeding, but when I forget, my nipples still seem fine because of these pads. My favorite part is that because of the lanolin, they stay in place better at night. With my last child, the pad would sometimes slide over at night, and I'd wake up with a soaked bra/shirt. This generally doesn't happen with these, because the lanolin is slightly sticky, and so they tend to stay right where I put them. They are very absorbent as well. Overall, great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Tracey Thorn can do know wrong!

Tracey Thorn has the kind of voice that is so heart-breakingly beautiful, agile, gentle and unrestrained, it can devastate you in an instant; it's the kind of voice that is so chill-inducing that hearing her perform live is a religious experience. Really. She is that good.This album is that good, too. Out of the Woods is a reminder why this woman is one of the most underrated musicians performing today: literate songs, gorgeous melodies, complex but accessible soundscapes.

Thankfully, he had the bravery to get his experiences on paper for generations to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bauby's story will remain with you","review":"At this point, mostly everyone knows the story of what happened to Jean-Dominique Bauby as well as the story of his life, so it's pointless to rehash what's already common knowledge, but one thing that needs to be said (or reiterated) is that it's absolutely amazing that the late Bauby dictated this book to his therapist by blinking one letter at a time.\\"The Diving Bell and The Butterfly\\" is a pretty quick read, but what's contained within is, at the risk of sounding cliche, deeply moving and powerful. To think that someone was patient enough (in this day and age of minus zero patience and even shorter attention spans) to take the time to transcribe his thoughts one letter at a time defies description.As always, some details were changed in the adaptation from the book to the movie, but the message remains the same - and it will remain with you long after reading the book and/or watching the movie. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring life testament","review":"Bauby gives us a truly remarkable and inspirational story of his life trapped inside a body that no longer serves him.But his mind remains as sharp as ever.He transcends his immobility with grace and a remarkable gift of a rich, lucid imagination.He is free in his mind to enjoy all of life and it's lush sensory gifts and memories...to take flight as if a butterfly.A heartbreaking true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bauby has written a couragous memoir.","review":"If you liked this book an even better one is Under the eye of the Clock by Christopher Nolan. It is the story of a neurologically handicapped boy who turns to writing once he is given the correct medication, to allow himself to touch the keys of a typewriter with a stick.The difference for me in the two memoirs is that Bauby was a good wrtiter but Nolan is a gifted writer. Nolan was able to keep inside himself, prior to his release post medication, an enormous wealth of lyrical prose. Nolan is Irish and the text is truely musical in quality. The boy's upbringing is remarkable and his family is likewise admirable and courageous.Nolan's book is one of the best books I have ever read. The musical quality of the text is similar to Cry the Beloved Country by Patton. Other books that deal with neurologically impaired but gifted people are An Anthropologist on Mars and The Man who MIstook his Hat for his wife, by OLiver Sachs."},{"rating":"2","title":"diving bell and the butterfly","review":"the book was in the condition described (good to new) and arrived promptly. great transaction! would definitely do business with this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Did not enjoy this book. The whole story is composed of all the random thoughts that enter his head making it hard to follow. I'm a nurse on a neurology unit and thought it would be an interesting read and help me gain a better understanding of what these patients go through, but it wasn't that kind of book. He barely even recalled his family. It only mentioned his kids once or twice. Like I said the book is just full of random, bazaar thoughts and memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden gem!!","review":"I had never heard of this book until I found the movie via online website that recommended it as a video rental (which I did without even reviewing synopsis.) A surprisingly amazing film, I read the true account thereafter. Written via incomprehensible circumstances/methods, Jean Dominique Bauby clearly demonstrates the human spirit: maintaining his sense of humor, nonetheless conveying the horror of his physical imprisonment, while also offering comfort to the reader (as a true 'butterfly'.) A quick read - very inspiring. One of the very few times I recommend seeing the film first - then reading the book - as you will no doubt gain even more appreciation for the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only wish..","review":"I only wish Jean-Dominique Bauby could have written more. When I sat down to read his memoir it impressed so much, I found myself in deep thought thinking about what powerful things he wrote about. I was taken by the picture of the author 3 pages within the book..it is from a distance but I was very moved by what I saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memoir worth reading","review":"Some great books come in small packages!!!This a short but phenomenonally inspirational book written by a truly gifted writer. Instead of writing with computer, he used his left eye to blink each letter out because he was paralyzed from a condition called \\"locked in syndrome.\\" He used his short time left to share his story describing his love for his children and his regrets around the life he had carved out for himself before suffering from this LIS affliction. His last months spent paralyzed actually set him free to describe his realities and fantasies. I found this book sad yet somewhat miraculous that someone could maintain a sense of strength and spirit with so little physical life left. I would recommend this book without any hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding the positive in the direst situation","review":"If you are a fan of biography, this is a must read. If you are amazed by the concept of a person communicating with only the use of their left eye, you will buy this book. And you will be amazed, not only at the author's perseverence, but at his positive outlook on life in spite of his condition. It is a triumph of the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable, breathtaking account of true inspiration","review":"This book was by far the best I have ever read. His writing style carried you through the book, leaving me wanting more. I sighed at the end of every chapter and I couldn't put it down.

Beautifully written, truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Locked-in to a wonderful story","review":"A tremendous story from a wonderful writer. So unfortunate that he had to write the book under such extraordinary circumstances"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly","review":"What an insight into a \\"mind\\" locked up and yet able to communicate,though almost to the point of unbelievable. The patience he had to blink out an alphabet, and the pain he must have felt at not being able to physically \\"do\\" what he wrote about had to be deep. It taught me how important patience and faith should be in each person's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flight","review":"How does someone even begin to review a book like this? The beauty of its prose, its imagery, the unbearable pathos of the backstory behind its creation. All the superlatives have been heaped on it by others. I just wanted to add another recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind blowing story","review":"Read this story to get into the skin of somebody who woke up one day all transformed. A modern Metamorphosis but in real life. It's a sobering tale which can inspire you if it does not depress you. Read it if you are already strong in yourself and you don't need a pep talk which it's not. I initially purchased it to get motivated and it brought me down. However, it deals with reality and ultimately reality is what will bring anybody up. As we accept life as it comes to us, we are able to cope with it and make sure our positives are more than the negatives in life. To that extent the book does exactly that. My hat off to such a brave soul who chose to struggle to the very end. Writing a book with your left eye lid is proof that the human spirit lives on."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary book is filled with raw courage & love","review":"Journey into the world of a man living in a state of virtually total paralysis, unable to speak or move. In the authors words he was only \\"a mind in a jar\\". At the age of 43, Bauby, the editor in chief of the famed French fashion magazine\\"Elle\\", was struck down with a rare kind of massive stroke to the brain stem. His body allowed only the control and movement of one eye lid, yet this extraordinary man grasped this opportunity, blinking out, letter by letter, this remarkable communique.This extraordinary book is filled with raw courage, a love of life and insight that details the world anew. Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after the publication of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing story for any human","review":"I am usually a connoisseur of fine fiction, but I found this little biography to be quite compelling. I was directed to this book after I saw a preview for the movie. While the writing and imagery of \\"the Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is straightforward and simplistic, it truly is the story behind the writing that makes this book captivating. Bauby doesn't have to reach out with his written words and shake the reader into thoughts of \\"the meaning of life\\" and \\"seizing the day\\". It is the reader who becomes engrossed in the history and genius behind Bauby's elegant simplistic prose that finds the true treasure of Bauby's gift. What would you want to say to the world if you were in his position? Read it and appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, heart-wrenching and unforgettable","review":"The Bell Jar and the Butterfly broke my heart, but I would not have missed reading it for the world. What an amazing mind and spirit lived on in M. Bauby's inert body. His writing not only gives readers an unprecedented glimpse into the experience of someone so handicapped, but also reminds us of the resilience of the human spirit. Too often, I have taken for granted the days of my life and the privileges afforded by my healthy body. This beautiful book compels me to treasure them."},{"rating":"1","title":"awe-inspiring, great book to read time and time again","review":"recommended to me by one of my teachers in physical therapy school, this book put everything into prospective for me. it taught me how to appreciate the little things in life and to never take anything for granted because you never know when that will be taken away from you. i have read this book many times and have given it to countless people and patients to read. of possible, i would give it 6 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"At the risk of sounding like a creep, I don't get it. This success of this book is obviously a godsend for family left behind in this terribly moving, tragic story. Thank God for that. But I found myself feeling at once manipulated and guilty for feeling that way. How dare I look at someone else's tragedy so coldly! Well, I'm going to stand out here in the cold, because this is a manipulation of the highest order, and most of the people I know who read the book feel the same way. Still, buying the book is undoubtedly going to help the man's loved ones, so there's little harm in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big impression. Sorry.","review":"Quite frankly, this was just not my type of book. I definitely feel compassion for Bauby. I think it is absolutely amazing he was able to dictate a book in this condition. I am not familiar with \\"locked in syndrome\\" and I admire Bauby for his determination under these dire circumstances. However, I am not a big fan of a book where the focus is more on metaphors and writing style. I think it takes away from the emotion that can be projected to the reader. It is a possibility Bauby hid behind the words and phrases and I do not blame him for this. This book just wasn't able to leave that big of an impression on me. I feel bad about that but not guilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly","review":"\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is terribly overhyped. Naturally it is a phenomenal undertaking for a disabled Jean-Dominique Bauby, but it is far from a quality literary work. It reads more like a moneymaking venture if it was intended to be published; or marketing it as a literary work was the moneymaking venture. I will see the movie though in the hope that it is different from the book. This book certainly would not lift up the spirits of a convalescing disabled person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depending on what you expect from the book.....","review":"When I learnt about Mr. Bauby's situation. I decided immediately that I have to read his book. I expected that I should be able to learn some lessons from someone who is approaching a final stage in his life. Lessons on what I should do or prepare when I still can. In this respect, the book disappoints me. There are very few lessons covered which we can learn from. What Mr. Bauby is trying to tell us is that the Butterfly (i.e. the mind) can still fly freely unrestricted by the paralyzed body. Except for some chapters, this book is just an ordinary book written by an ordinary writer who is in a perfect health. Depending on what you expect, the book might be a good inspirational source for anyone who is in Mr. Bauby's position."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"This book was an eye-opening and amazing view into the internal life of a man under tragic circumstances. It is a very human look - sometimes funny and sarcastic and at times tragically sad - into Bauby's mind and spirit which never gives in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly: A Memoir of Life and Death","review":"I thought this was a wonderful quick read. I saw the movie and couldn't wait to read the book. How amazing that in all his struggles he was able to write this book. It shows you that even without body function the amazing strength of his will can go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing and terrifying","review":"It is hard to imagine being in this situation. We are given an insight into a condition that makes us think what would we want given such a limited quality of life.

It was incredible he was able to learn to dictate this book and credit to the women who so patiently helped to give us this short account of this tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I learned from The Diving Bell and the Butterfly","review":"I learned for some men passion and lust is more important than love no matter how painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Insight","review":"Want to understand and empathize with someone who is severely disabled?

Without self pity or bitterness, Jean-Dominique Bauby courageously and vividly expresses his cherished identities (as writer/editor/father/husband/lover/ bon vivant) and eschews his forced exile as a paralyzed inmate in a special French hospital. This small book provides a useful and thought-provoking lesson for those too taken up with satisfying their own creature comforts to experience the richness of life that is passing them by. Read it and weep. Read it and learn. But most importantly, read it and celebrate life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The problem with this book.","review":"The ONLY problem with this book is... that's too short. I could read more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely important book by an important person.","review":"As a physical therapist and movement scientist who appreciates human motion each day, I found my appreciation humbled and heightened. A book to stop you whereever you are --and remind you that life is less about how things are and more about how you choose to experience them. This was an impressive man."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you ever feel hard done by...","review":"This short book is indispensable reading. It is the perfect non chemical cure for any mild depression, effects of hard days and decisions, or any type of generally feeling sorry for oneself. It's the story of a man trapped inside his body because of a stroke - and the life, fun, mischief and spirit that he displays are humbling. It's also funny, lively, and above all true. The author (who died shortly after the book was finished) dictated the book one letter at a time, but it reads beautifully and stays with you afterwards. Whatever your issues - work, love, looks, life, religion, money - perhaps even health, this will remind you about what it is to be alive at all. At the risk of sounding a complete hippy, do have a read, and do be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive book but wish it would have had more pictures.","review":"When I think I have it bad, life gives me a book like this to read and it puts things into perspective.This is a thought provoking study into a life we can hardly visualize. The pictures of the author in the magazine article were so stark in contrast of his before and after life that I feel they should have been added to the book giving us clearer visualization of his struggle both inside and out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destiny","review":"This man surely lived his destiny, be it a sad one. Without Jeremy Leggatt's accident and subsequent experiences we would not have the insight of living the life he did and be poorer for it. With humour and candor he takes us on his journey with all its struggles and poignant moments. Everyone needs to read this book to get an insight into how treasured life needs to be and how, until something like this happens to us, we take life for granted.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Affirming Spiritual Uplift!","review":"To quote the New York TImes: \\"A wistful, poetic, ironic and whimsically affirmative testament by a man who refused to die in spirit.\\" If you have ever thought that your life was a shambles, that you had a physical infirmity that totally depressed you - read this book. If you can pick up a book and read it, this is the one to read. It is the most inspiration packed 132 pages you will ever read !

And you know what? I probably didn't even scratch the surface.This book will definitely become a family heirloom. Something I'd write into my Will and make my children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and so on read and learn valuable life lessons from.

A book about ourselves and the ultimate values. A book about love and life when they became memories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humbling and uplifting.","review":"This short book is easy to read. However, it took an extraordinary effort to write it. Reading it is a humbling and insightful experience. We read of how a man lost all function, except one eyelid. And despite being seemingly imprisoned in a paralyzed body, he still had an active and free mind. Most of the book tells of how he escaped the drudgery of his overall condition and daily routine by traveling the highways of memories within his mind. He not only reflected on life, but continued to live as best as he could. I am thankful that Mr. Bauby shared his experience w/ others. I found it to be humbling, uplifting and humorous reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a comfortable read, but contemplative","review":"It is impossible for me to separate out the content of this book from the manner in which it was written - dictated one letter at a time by blinking after a massive stroke. It is a book both triumphant and acutely sad, and although a quick read in real time, the narrative plays on the theme of time itself, forcing you to slow down for the duration of the read and consider the implications of being trapped by your own body and stripped of both movement and a spontaneous voice - a prospect any sane mind, mine included, instinctively shies away from. It is not a comfortable read - it is too sobering for that - but it a contemplative one. (Lisa McKay, Author ofMy Hands Came Away Red)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, although not what I expected","review":"Interesting book. I'm left a little stranded when deciding how I feel about it. Jean-Dominique, a 43 year old editor of the French Elle Magazine, has a massive stroke and is left trapped in his own body. His brain, his wit, his intelligence are still there, but his only communication with the outside word is the blinking of his left eye.The writing is lovely and touching and very sad as he describes things as varied as the day of his stroke, his dreams, a Father's Day at the beach with his kids, and the letters his friends send him. I did not finish it feeling inspired though. What I did walk away with, was a big question of \`why.' Dictating this book letter-by-painful-letter, why did he chose the topics he did? And is the choice of those topics the portrayal of who he is as a person?I don't know. I can't help but wonder what I would chose to do, be, write, if I were in his situation. It is his answer to the question that I find so interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bauby leaves a rough butterfly kiss for his readers.","review":"Jean-Dominique Bauby wrote by batting an eyelash, over and over again. Eyelashes brushed gently against the cheek are called butterfly kisses, and he has left behind the roughest of butterfly kisses with \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\\" Entombed in immobility, his spirit and imagination took flight. He had a life of such exquisite privilege before his stroke -- even the stroke itself took place in a brand new BMW. Bauby wrote that now that he drooled on himself, he preferred to drool on cashmere, rather than wear those shabby hospital sweatsuits. He kept intact the sentiments he had honed as the editor of the French \\"Elle\\" magazine.

The writing is excellent, the acting is wonderful (remember, compelling is far more important than believable in fantasy), the set design is beyond words.

Robin Williams stars in this eccentric and feeble comedy, playing Leslie Zevo, the nephew of the general (Michael Gambon) who inherits his brother's toy factory and so decides only to manufacture war games, tanks and guns. So Leslie (Robin Williams) decides to stop his uncle by turning the toy shop into a war zone. You will gasp at the extravagent, spectacular sets and costumes but apart from that there's very little interest. The film limps along at a sluggish pace and has no real sense of direction.

A rather nondescript affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sets, dumb story","review":"After the owner of a toy company dies his militant brother tuns it into a war-toy factory, and it's up to Robin Williams to stop him. This film deserves recognition for its set pieces, while the rest of the movie sinks under its own weight. Some hokey performances (especially from LL Cool J and that girl with the bad southern accent), banal dialogue, and annoying, not to mention noisy, gadgets make this quite an ordeal to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad!","review":"Yes, this was director Barry Levinson's pet project. He wrote the script in the 70's; but didn't have the clout to get it made until the early 90's. Some pet projects, however, are better just left on the shelf. Despite a top flight director, a marketable and whimisical star, marvelous sets, and one of the most unique trailers in movie history, \\"Toys\\" was a failure.Why? Well, the script with its anti-military message might have worked in the post-Vietnam 70's; but it was woefully out of sorts with the post-Gulf War 90's. Also the film is almost entirely a lesson of style over substance. The sets are great; but there is little going on within them except Robin Williams being really, REALLY annoying. \\"Toys\\" is dull, pointless, bewildering, anachronistic, and just painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful is not a strong enough word...","review":"This is the only movie that I walked out of, ever.

The imaginative visuals alone make the movie great. It doesn't need anything else.This movie is high quality all the way. I recommend that everybody see it at least once. I think it's in the perfect format. It's perfect for a movie screen, but wouldn't work at all if it were a book.

Kennnedy's book also has simple recipes, and also has superb hints on cooking, and gives a wonderful running commentary on the origin of the dishes, and suggestions on how to serve the dish. Kennedy's also has photographs.Newer books by Bayless and others have come forth since 1972, however both Zelayeta's and Kennedy's books have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook!","review":"Purchased this book for my mother.

I haven't even implemented all of his techniques yet, and already my success rate has increased from less than 25% to over 75% over the last several competitions. I've set goals, implemented a plan to achieve them, and am truly enjoying all my competitions, win or lose. I'm sure my dog has picked up on my attitude shift, and is performing better because of it.

He ended the season with a .455 batting average and had the most RBI's on his team. I even had parents ask me what happened because he looked so much more confident.

I a huge fan of Kathy Mallory and all the books, and I think this, while not up there with my all time fav, (Flight of the Stone Angel), i think it was both fitting and satisfying. Like 'Stone Angel', i love the stories about Mallory's past, and this is no different. The ending WAS shocking, but it ties up heaps of loose ends. I for one, had never given Mallory's father much thought, only Cassandra.So do read it, it's worth it, especially to find out what happens at the end.

Please understand that she and I have similar taste so, that even thought I did not read the book myself I probably would have felt the same way she did.

However, I'll never find out. I just couldn't follow this story; it was all over the place. Events were jumbled. Had I not read the end flap, I basically would have had no idea whatsoever what the plot was supposed to be about. O'Connell assumes the reader knows more than they do, I think. The writing was neither smooth nor particularily compelling. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the ending as I never got there; I was too hopelessly lost in the poorly executed plot. Any book that it so poorly written that I cannot finish it gets one star from me. Unfortunately, I purchased this book new. Wish I could get my money back. Life is too short to read bad books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love all this author has to offer","review":"I have been digesting all of Ms. O'Connell's books this summer. \\"Find Me\\" is another exceptional book. She reminds me of a female James Lee Burke. I don't think this signals the end of a series but the beginning of another chapter in Mallory's life. I find her character very layered and I love this about Mallory. \\"Find Me\\" is just one of her latest journeys toward healing her past. I hope Ms. O'Connell keeps writing her Mallory books and I wish she would team up with James Lee and introduce Mallory to Dave Robicheaux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow going","review":"I read 200 pages of this, and nothing much happened. Maybe the story starts to go somewhere in the second half; I didn't get that far.Mallory is a psychopath who is always on the verge of shooting people for minor indiscretions or for no reason at all. At one point she beats up an FBI agent without provocation and then walks away, while neither her victim nor his colleagues make any attempt to arrest her. The author really lost me with this scene; not only was it unrealistic, but it made Mallory seem like the quintessential bad cop - a violent nutjob who should not be carrying a gun or a badge.On the plus side, the prose is crisp and clean. There is some amusing interaction between Mallory and a state trooper at one point. And the paperback is nicely packaged in a \\"venti\\" (tall) edition. But since I didn't like the heroine and found the plot aimless and draggy, I can't recommend Find Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Mallory series","review":"This was an OH MY GOD, this can't be the end kind of book. Yes, there must be a story in there, and it dragged on a little throughout the Route 66 voyage, but I seriously hope this was not the last! I want another one out right now!

Presumably because Paul McCartney's name is on it. What did I expect? Well, I hoped at least for a catchy tune or two. No such luck. Nothing here I'd call a melody or tune, catchy or not.(This is a piece with a program, by the way--a program based on an ostensible epic poem in free verse. In other words, it does not rhyme and is not metered, but it omits articles, prepositions, and verbs to show it is nevertheless \\"poetry\\". It can be summarized thus: Giant fiery asteroid collides with earth. Life evolves. Boy meets girl. Boy marries girl.

As John Lennon so aptly put it: Muzak to your ears. He is a proven genius (\\"The Long and Winding Road\\" may be my favorite song ever). But his efforts of the last 30 years left me drowsy, at best. Let us not forget - he did record \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\".However - and a BIG However - I sincerely enjoy Standing Stone, which I bought on a whim at a used CD shop. Perhaps it's just a phase I'm going through, after the vast amounts of Celtic literature I've been reading lately and all the recent Harry Potter hype.

The piece as a whole still warrants the one star, I feel, but the chorale finale, helps this piece out - enough to raise the rating. This finale is proof that McCartney does have some very good ideas to share with the world in a classical context. My hope is whatever inspired him to write that finale will inspire him to write his next piece.There is hope for him - he may rise to being an excellent composer.

In it he discussed Mouravieff as a bit of an imposter. He did not actually study with Gurdjieff and may have actually plagiarized Ouspensky. His addition of courtly love was an attempt to create a 5th way which Gurdjieff did not teach, and his use of the phrase 'eastern orthodox tradition' may be based on a misunderstanding of something Gurdjieff did say, indicating a form of Christianity older than Egypt, not the Eastern Orthodox brand.So before buying this, research Mouravieff and maybe read Patterson.

For example, if I'm searching for the word \\"tetrachord\\", I'll get 39 results. In those results, I still need to find which is the definition and which are occurences throughout the dictionary.

However, I must point out that the letterbox transfer does not look as good as it could be: the image is soft, and the bottom of the screen is cropped a little too much, making the image look cramped. As an example, on the full screen laserdisc, you can see the wad of money which Martin Sheen is holding when Charlie repays his loans while they are in the garage. On the DVD, all that picture information is cropped. Only a sliver of picture information is added to the sides from the widescreen version.

It is very poor, you might as well buy the DVD because they look exactly the same. Do not expect HD from this edition, maybe in later ones, as they usually do, they'll do the job right. Still, if you are such a fanatic of the movie that you MUST have the Blu ray edition, go ahead, but don't expect justice to it. I gave it 2 stars instead of just one, because of the little extras (O.

Other than that small amount of nostalgia, this is a horribly acted, poorly written, cliche filled mess. I cannot understand the positive reviews this gets, even by late 1980s standards. If you really want to hear some terrible dialogue, just watch the part when the union boss walks into Douglas' office. I thought I was watching a cheesy John Wayne impression. Boiler Room is the one to watch, at least that has some decent acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much porn - Yuck !","review":"As is typical from hollywood expect full frontal nudity...yuck !I purchased the film to hopefully watch an action flick not a porn flick.As for the plot. The plots ok but Hal Holbrook is this old guy who keeps comingup with ho-hum platitdes referring to his moralistic ideas of approaches to stock marketinvestment which make one want to throw up.The most interesting true story ever related to stocks is the life story of Jesse Livermore.Livermore was a poor farm boy who left home at 15 with 5.00 his mother gave him.20 years later, after learning to trade, he eventually made 100 million shorting the 1929 crash.Now theres movie potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, confusing, lacking in character depth...","review":"I didn't like this movie.

Gordon Gecko is the embodiment of the \\"vulture capitalist\\" and the Master of the Universe mentality which puts short term personal gain above the good of the country's economic future.

A look into the moral struggles of one who can have it all but gives it up. A Tour De Force...meant to be quotable...catches you up in the momentum of being bad...slaps you on the wrist..then drops you back on the side of right. MY FAVORITE FILM OF ALL TIME on so many levels.

This is a great movie. After reading the \\"bad\\" reviews, I can only agree with one; Daryl Hannah's acting is pretty poor. Olive Stone has always been criticized for his inability to handle a woman on the screen, and thi is further testament to that. But to say Michael Douglas was terrible? Come on, they dont give out Oscars for bad performances. And so what if this character seemed to be the basis for every character he would play. This was the first. And most great actors play a lot of similar roles. Dustin Hoffman - was there really a difference in rainman and the graduate? And Oliver Stone as the Ed Wood of the 90's? Come on. Carol Reed of the 90's maybe. Good thing that guy saw Tim Burrton's movie.But dont take my word for it either.

I was amazed to see that another market crash, this time Prime Mortgage could re-occur there seems to be someone always ready to seize the opportunity to make a quick buck and not give a damn about the consequences. Just like Michael Douglas's character says \\"I just move the money around\\". Very compelling viewing and a warning to where you put your stocks and investments. Here in Australia the lending and valuation legislation is much tighter and harder to get a loan, although there are people now lending money to those who cannot afford it, Difference is the properties are not overvalued and the lending bodies just re-possess the property."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL","review":"MOVIE WAS ...WELL ILL GRADE IT A C IN MY BOOK...IM NOT INTO STUFF LIKE THAT AND ALL WAS SO CROOKED"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very interesting...","review":"...I had never seen it before, so I bought it before I went to see Wall Street, Part II.

All you folks in the finance industry out there - watch this movie three times a day, everyday, after meals. Adam Smith (\\"The Wealth of Nations\\", ISBN:0879757051, buy it here ! ) would've taken the trouble to rise from his grave to watch this one.Douglas was excellent and deserved his Oscar, and Sheen (both dad and son) were terrific. I'm not a great fan of Oliver Stone's other movies, but this is one movie I treasure as much as my MSFT stock certificate !The quotes from the dialogue should be printed in bold and stuck up on the wall of every investment bank's office:\\"It's all about bucks kid. The rest is conversation\\".\\"See this building over here ... it was my first real estate deal ...I made over $900,000.

It captures the essence of capitalism - though the intention of the film is anti-capitalism! Given the recent high profile scandals of late many would agree with the premise of this movie! I don't, but that is another matter.What's really at fault, and what I think this movie is, is an exposé of human nature! When we are tempted, do we resist or do we eat of the forbidden fruit? The question is age old, we know the answers, yet some of us set these issues aside - to be confronted with the equal and opposite reaction to our actions and the moral decisions they bring about!This is what makes this a good film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's version of business","review":"If you have any business experience, you will laugh at this unrealistic look at big business. Beyond this the acting ranges from bad to fair. Now Douglas did win an Oscar but it really was for his performance in Fatal Attraction not this film. Wall Street has the Oliver Stone pedigree. And since he is a Hollywood darling, it is more acceptible to award this film than a torid film like Fatal Attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Laugh Riot!!! The Most Hilarious Film of the 80s!!!!!","review":"Truly, one of the most hilarious movies ever made. The fact that it is intended to be a serious character study of greed's effects on a young man makes the hilarity even more intense. Oliver Stone is the Ed Wood of the 80s-90s!!! Watch Daryl Hannah pretend to know something about art!! Watch Charlie Sheen pretend to know something about acting!! Watch Martin Sheen realize what a bozo his son is!!! Watch Michael Douglas grease his hair, and win an Oscar for it!!! Listen to Oliver Stone's deathless dialogue!!! Not since Plan Nine from Outer Space has a script plumbed such inanities with such utter solemnity. A true classic, with Valley of the Dolls, and Showgirls."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading and untrue","review":"Making money in the movie market is good and honest while making money at the financial market is a crime? That is why \\"greed is good\\" is a phrase that can only be said by someone who does not have any ability to deal in the financial markets and so has to practice fraudulent insider information? That is not capitalism, that is crime. But I guess that in Mr. Stone's eyes it's the same. If you are a socialist you'll love this movie. If as in my case you are a libertarian, and you are looking for a true vision of HONEST stock market entrepreneurs you will not find it here. \\"Other People's Money\\" is a much better, and truthful insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD SCHOOL PUNK","review":"IF YOU LIKE MISIFTS OR BLACK FLAG OR ANYTHING YOU WILL LIKE THIS.

The film fails to capture Crichton's opinions on the Japanese, and it changes the murderer to a person who could never have been considered in the book. The makers of this film didn't care about making a good film; they just wanted to be politically correct by not insulting the Japanese.

Still, I found this movie slow, and wondering what the point was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, foggy and complete waste of energy","review":"Don't even consider watching this movie, if you already read the book and are hoping for a decent adaption to screen. This movie is more interested in showing us body parts than a good plot that moves and flows well.Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes do nothing to brighten the outlook or dialogue of this movie, and Steve Buscemie's role is way to short to be any help in saving the torn threads of this really awful movie. Besides being, this movie doesn't inform us why the murdered girl is playing such a big important role in the film, only that men seem to enjoy her, and who was the killer. The negotiations are never really explained also, we only know they are importent to the Japanese, and the American's are a bit wary in agreeing.If you're looking for a good Micheal Crichton movie, try Jurassic Park 1-3 or the thirteent Warrior.

I cannot believe that some people actually enjoy this movie. Poor Westly Snipes. He was only cast in it to make it seem like it wasn't a RACIST movie. And the representation of the Japanese culture was so inacurate. Most of the Asian cast coudn't even speak Japanese! Also ALL of the female characters were blatantly degrading!

Since it was past the 30 day period I couldn't take it back for a refund. Intex customer service is awful. After being on hold for 30 minutes they automatically hang up on you. There is no email address to contact them at their website (I wonder why??!). Looks like I wasted $50 on this junk. Save yourself a lot of headaches and get an airbed at Walmart. At least you can get a refund if it leaks before 90 days.Note: When these airbeds leak, the leaks will be located mostly in the grooves in between the flocking on top. For some reason the plastic is very thin in these grooves. Bad design"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes company happy","review":"I got this to have somewhere better than the couch for company to sleep.

In order to deal with the blatant and clear technical deficiencies he has to slow down ever 10 bars or so.

Don't call Suicidal punk or thrash. They're just a unique hard rocking band. I also recommend all their other albums, How will I Laugh Tomorrow being the best and Infectious grooves.

I have recently started watching Fellini films with Marcello Mastroianni. He is perfectly cast to romance Shirley MacLaine. Kathy Bates (Titanic, Misery) is always wonderful as far as I'm concerned. She really has met her match with Shirley MacLaine. Kathy Bates has been playing more crazy mother roles now, this is great to see her on the receiving end. This movie is comparable to Moonstruck, Steel Magnolias and even Terms of Endearment. Marcia Gay Harden is incredibly funny dressing up as by gone movie stars.

I would have liked to have seen that plan presented in a single place (perhaps as a review at the end of the book.)I also felt this book just scratched the surface of the hows and whys of cleaning and organizing.

Add a nasty spin by Jeff Kober (FALCON CREST), and you have the makings of a sharp and tense thriller. Just when you think Payne has been as vicious as he could be, he pulls one more little trick out of his hat, and his over the top cruelty is disturbingly effective. Rapper MC Hammer as crimelord Dexter Caine doesn't do much with the little he's given, but he tries hard. the little boy who plays Mikey (can't remember his name) is very good, if a little too tough to be loveable.All in all, Boz delivers in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the coolest villian ever is in this movie","review":"If you like to root for the bad guy this is your movie.

Too much of a bad thing and we get some pretty corny acting. Also, this is a movie people where Rapper MC Hammer (He is credited as Hammer) portrays a druglord...so you do a math. Bruce Payne (Dungeons and Dragons, Passenger 57) in full blown long hair tries to deliver us a calm and cool collective badguy but ends up delivering a really corny and annoying part.

This was long before poseur bands like AFI and Alkaline Trio started whoring out dark Punk. The music is raw, catchy and full of life (or living death?).

I say fairly durable because if you put the middle of the blade in a vice (hydraulic clamp), and put maybe 5-10 pounds of pressure on the handle, the blade will snap. Also the spear tip tends to wear down pretty much no matter what, but the blade material is soft enough that its easy to re-sharpen.The edge is not sharp. I can run my finger down the edge (with pressure applied) and it won't cut me. I've tried to sharpen the edge, but the blade material keeps kicking my butt (it may be better for you more experienced sharpeners though).It's a bit big to carry in the pocket. In the boot is ok, but I find the best place, for me, is in the waist-band.Yes it will kill.

Think of it this way, \\"I have a voice and it brought me this far for anyone to pull me down.The more you criticize, the stronger I get. Fantasia, I know your voice when I hear it. Those who rated your album with one star don't know what they where doing. They click on anything. It's time for me to go now Fantasia. Keep your dreams alive. Peace out. HOLLA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!!","review":"Fantasia is extremely talented. I am glad she has the capacity to rise above those who are against her and remain positive. The negative reviewers obviously did not hear the same CD that I purchased. Fantasia is AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia sounds TERRIBLE","review":"I kind of liked her on American Idol, although there is a sound in her voice, similar with Donald Duck! I thought I would give her cd a chance! Wish I didn't buy it. It really isn't good. That sound, the duck sound is there, I really do hear it! UGH"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"summertime is not all its cracked up to be take the visual away and its not so great. her upper register is almost child like sounding very nasal. fantasia is a great performer but not a great singer. theres one macy grey and believe me thats far too many. I belive is a mess this girl is supposed to be the best singer in the country, well then were in trouble. kelly clarkson is the only AI to show true promise five years down the road she will probably still be around. I wouldnt buy this single. lets wait till fantasia album comes out then well really see what see can do"},{"rating":"2","title":"A SINGER WITH HEART AND SOUL!!","review":"Fantasia is a great singer and she has great stage appeal. Her voice is unique and that is what the music undustry is looking for.Her cd is good and she sings with all her heart and soul. She has made every song her own. If the people that say her voice is squeaky then they have not listen to the cd.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia the Great","review":"I'm a big Fantasia fan and was very excited when she won American Idol. I was deeply touched by her heart warming performances. I can only hope that her single will do well commercially. She is a very gifted singer, however I'm not sure that the three songs on this CD reflect her true talent. I Believe is a nice sappy tune that is driven my her spirituality, which is the driving force behind her soulfull voice. Her rendition of Chain of Fools is cute, but I hope that it will not be included on her upcoming album. Perhaps not as it was pulled from the AI compilation project. Her rendition of Summertime is exquisite, however the studio version doesn't hold up to her performances on the show. In fact, I believe that Fantasia's artistry is best appreciated when she is performing live as situational emotion and visuality seem to propel her to higher dimensions."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS OK!!!","review":"NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS SINGLE.THE ONLY SONG I LIKE IS \\"CHAIN OF FOOLS\\" & WE HEARED IT BEFORE ON AI3 CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I WAS EXPECTING BETTER QUALITY THATS ALL.FANTAISA IS TALENTED BUT THAT WASNT FEATURED IN THE SINGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!PERSONALY I DNT RECOMMEND IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Believe / Chain of Fools / Summertime","review":"I like her songs but there is to much yelling in the songs.She has a great voice but for me it would be better to tonedown some notes. I love the vibes and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"I thought that this CD wasn't my favorite, and that \\"Summertime\\" was getting really old for my taste. Barrino performed it three times on American Idol, and none of the times did it impress me to a certain point that it seemed to for the judges. Her voice seemed a little nasally and seemed to be distracted a lot by all of her \\"yeah yeah's\\". I was not all that impressed by this single."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Simon summed it up perfectly:","review":"\\"Donald Duck on helium.\\" Grating to the ears, at best. Fantasia should audition for a spot in the musical Hairspray, where sreeching is celebrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in CD Single!","review":"I like fantasia on the show but was disappointed with her cd, she sounds to nasal and screechy, I believe is a gospel song which I really don't hear the soul in her voice but maybe its because I just don't like the song. The other two well just aren't good in my opinion. Their are so many better singers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the accompaniment","review":"Zero star for the vocals. This girl simply doesn't deserve airtime. Her voice is squeaky, her tone is pitchy, and her style is ugly. No wonder she's already a has-been after releasing only one single!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but would that be enough!","review":"I think Fantasia is a very talented singer with a bright future. I love her energetic powerful voice makes me believe that nothing is impossible but her styles of music will only be for a certain type of market. When you are in the music industry, you need a broader market (music for everyone) in order to be a star and I don't think that she will be there..Her song is on the billboard at #1 but compare with previous AI winners(Kelly & Ruben) her sales is not even half of them on their first week..and that doesn't look promising for her future. Anyway! I wish you all the best of luck Fantasia..I may not like the type of your music or the way you sing it but I have nothing against you and I think that you work hard to be where you are and you deserve to go along the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my ears","review":"I can't believe she was able to win a talent contest with this voice! Her voice is so screechy that it actually hurts my ears. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible CD!","review":"This album offers nothing more than the bad performances that Fantasia showed on American Idol. Her voice is as annoying as ever - very squeaky as if she's not singing. The style is no better. The constant hange in lyrics to yeah, yeah, yeahs is absolutely shows absolutely no class and no espect for the composers of the songs.This is the worst AI CD I've ever purchased. While I don't agree with the personal attacks made on her on this site, I'm not surprised that the one-star reviews are overwhelming.Those who don't like her CD have as much right to say their piece as those who like it. If Fantasia's fans can't take the criticisms being made on their idol, they shouldn't put her in such a high-profile position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this CD, unless you enjoy screaming instead of singing! Spend the money on Diana's single, someone who can actually sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasal Sounding","review":"Yikes just what we need another nasal sounding singer. Bad singer, bad cd, do not recommend unless you have ear plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"F","review":"I don't want to make anyone mad, but she can't sing any better than average. What's the point of a show like this if that's all we end up with? I bouht both Fantasias and Diana's CD's and neither turned out that good. Diana's was slightly better but boring as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"'I Believe' she is the best","review":"I have been listening to this CD for hours nonstop. This is the best CD I have bought in a long time. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. I'm buying more today for family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding CD !!","review":"The CD single delivered much more than expected !! The musical arrangement for \\"I Believe\\" is beautiful... and as always \\"Summertime\\" is a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Keep Her in NC!","review":"I bought this cd thinking and hoping I could enjoy the music of the newest American Idol. I was wrong. Her voice is irritating, the gospel song I believe is not only written poorly but any church goer can sing it. Save your money this girl is going nowhere, I only hope she stays home in NC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screechy Idol","review":"I can't believe anyone is buying this piece of nothing! Shouldn't have won! Just goes to show that the voting is screwed up! Need to change it to reflect real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on my watch, NO!","review":"I can not allow myself to purchase the soundtrack for the TV show Girls Behaving Badly (joke). Seriously, I heard enough of her on the American Idol to last me three lifetimes. Actually, originally I wrote this review without listening to the free sample clips. I just finished listening to them and popped three Advil. She is a average singer who sells albums based on her charisma. The songs are painful to listen to and the production is also very hallow/empty sounding (B-rated)."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD PROVES AMERICAN IDOL NEEDS TO GO!!!","review":"Another Idol, more hype, bad songs, mediocre performances...enough is enough people! American Idol needs to be cancelled immediately.......unfortunately, this is what America wants.......I'm just waiting for the day when this show will be passe'. These kids are having their lives ruined by this show. This CD is just another example of why America is in the sad shape its in."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"I find Fantasia's voice annoying. Summertime is good, but the other two songs, she's yelling and screechy. Her voice has a weird cartoonish squeak to it that is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star review for 1 star performer.","review":"If you are a single mom I highly recommend this cd because it will make you happy. otherwise - just like a duck on helium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst production ever!","review":"American Idol has topped itself in reaching an alltime low. She can't sing great only a like a cartoon. She sets a poor example for single mothers who think they will become the next American Idol. If I'm generous, I'd say she is a pretty good singer, but not American Idol, or what I'd expect. Diana DeGarbage doesn't matter either. Everyone knows that Jennifer Hudson was the only hope we had and the stupid rigged show blew it for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Both released singles were horrible..","review":"I think that this single is awful. The songs are so cheesy, and I've heard enough of Fantasia. Her voice makes me cringe at times, when she screeches through her higher notes. And the million \\"yeah, yeah's\\" are now unbearable to listen to. This really doesn't seem like \\"music\\" to me. I do like \\"I Believe\\" - but I like Diana's better. I think most people would realize how much better Diana's was if they had the rest of the song, like Fantasia got to have. Although Diana's single was terrible too... \\"I Believe\\" was a good song for Diana. It just fits her voice much better. I don't see good things for Fantasia in the future. I really don't think any of the American Idols will last, sad to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - Overdone","review":"She might have power in her voice but it is one that is best suited for Broadway. Too much of everything is not a good thing. Thought the tone on her CD might be downplayed from AI but was wrong. Overproduced, oversung ~ OVERDONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm disappointed in this CD. I just didn't like it. \\"I believe\\" is a porr excuse for a song, full of every cliche we've ever heard in a song. Fantasia's voice has a squeaky quality that I just do not care for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst singer in the world!","review":"If you're into sound that's so screechy that you'd need to have earplugs, this CD is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money on this trash. The songs are cheesy, the production is low-quality, but the worst thing is the voice: the girl just can't sing! Her definition of \\"singing\\" is shrieking through the songs that she murders and changing the lyrics to those annoying 'yeah, yeah, yeahs' that have characterized her style.It's no wonder her record sales can't even reach half of AI runner-up Clay Aiken's recordings! What a flop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get William Hung's CD instead!","review":"Better songs, better performances, and more importantly, BETTER VOICE. You won't hear any squeaking in that album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but she's no Diana Degarmo.","review":"I was disappointed to see that Fantasia won over Diana. I think she's WAY overrated. Her voice really isn't that good. The only thing good about this CD is I Believe, but Diana really tore it up on that one. I love AI, but Fantasia is not one of the best singers to come from the show. I'm debating whether or not to buy her CD when it's released, but chances are that I probably won't unless I can get it cheap. What's the deal with everyone saying that her rendition of Summertime is anything wonderful? When I heard it, I really didn't care for it. Chain Of Fools is okay, but it's not really my cup of tea, either. I would say this-save your money and buy Diana's CD, you probably think I'm biased, but I'm not because I have enjoyed everyone on AI thus far. I just firmly believe that Diana has the stronger voice and the upper hand over Fantasia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!","review":"I don't think that Fantasia should have won. When she \\"sings\\" it's just a bunch of screeching and scratching, not really singing at all, but that's just me. and chain of fools was just taken from the soul cd wasn't it? it sounds exactly the same. I think it would have been better for her fans if she released something that everyone hasn't already heard!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Album sucks, as expected!","review":"Well, what do we really expect from a non-singer who tries to shriek through each song with her squeaky voice?No wonder this is a flop by AI standards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, just horrible!","review":"I do not know why people would listen to this horrible sounding stuff, it certainly isn't singing! She has the worst voice I have ever heard. This was definitely a waste of my money, not one of the three songs on here are any good. She needs some professional lessons before she records again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put's the A in AWFUL !!!!","review":"I haven't been really following the whole AI thing this year but Wow, I thought all the people that were complaining about Fantasia sounding like nails on a chalk board and Donald Duck with all her screeching were just bashing her because their favorite didn't win. BUT...After hearing this CD I can see where they are all coming from. She is really AWFUL. It was actually painful to listen to her. It's hard to believe that the show isn't fixed when you figure that Fantasia is the best the AI show had to offer America this year. It's just the most pathetic thing I heard in a long time! It's a shame they don't offer the option of ZERO stars because it hurt me to actually give this CD a rating of even 1 star!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wanted to like it, but...","review":"Now I wish Jennifer Hudson had won. What bad luck she had. She's so much better than Fantasia, with a rich voice and versatile style. I really wanted to like Tasia's debut, but there's no variety here and song selection is poor. (Chain of Fools is not a good choice to cover, since nobody can compare to Aretha). Sure hope the full-length album by Fantasia is better (I'll make sure I preview it first before buying, though.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"I love the series and always buy the new releases, but this one is really annoying. I couldn't get through it...I think she does better live. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aflac signed a new deal with Fantasia","review":"3 things describe this disc, Dreadful, out of tune, boring! Would not recommend to worst enamy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, SINGS LIKE A FROG & DANCES LIKE A DUCK!","review":"What else is there to say, I cannot believe this single. The I believe song can be found in any church and would sound better then Fantasia, She sings like a frog and struts across the stage like a duck. Saw her performance tonight at macys holiday 4th and had to change the channel when I saw her hiphuggers showing more then I wanted to see. Come on Fantasia, your no britney spears, and definately no star. Give it up before you really make yourself look bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"the person how deserved to win","review":"all of the 3 songs are just amazing and breathtaking and i can't wait toget the full lenth CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Star is Born\\"","review":"Fantasia has proven once again that she is the consummate entertainer.Her engaging personality, her awesome charm, her magnificient voice, her breathtaking beauty, her keen fashion sense and her amazing versatility will certainly guarantee her a place in the entertainment world and in our hearts for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and Delightful!!","review":"Fantasia didn't let me down with this CD. When I first played it, I got goosebumps and had to turn off my car's air-conditioning. She has such talent! I don't usually like this type of music, but her rendition of these songs is so uplifting and delightful that I have listened to them over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with this \\"squeak\\" sour-grapes reviewer?","review":"Whoever this person is...it is blatantly obvious there is something not-at-all right about this person. For someone to take this much time and energy to convince everyone that they don't like Fantasia...is just a tad...obsessive. We get it, okay?And if you doubt that it's the same person making each one of these 1-star reviews...look at how they use the same phrasing and terminology over and over...accusing fantasia of being a \\"duck\\" (huh?)...and being \\"squeaky\\"...and using the \\"yeah, yeah, yeah's\\".Could it be obsessive compulsive disorder? Sour grapes? A head injury? Alcohol? Hmmm. Makes you wonder.Fantasia was and is the American Idol of 2004. She deserved to win...because she was the best. Simon knew it...Paula Knew it....Randy knew it. And America knew it.Get over it already, Mr. or Mrs. Squeaky-Duck Reviewer. Let it go. You'll feel better. And so will we."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality is so much better than on TV","review":"I have Fantasia's CD. The quality is awesome. Sounds worlds different than on TV. She knocked it out of the park."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucked!","review":"The only song good on this cd single was I Believe. The rest of the songs sucked! Save your money for Diana's single when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Believe In Fantasia","review":"I went out and purchased Fantasia's singles cd this morning. The girl has got it! Whatever it is in the entertainment business. The studio version of I Believe is just as powerful and chillin as when she performed it on 'Idol.' I know that Fantasia'a future in music is very bright. GO FANTASIA!!! PEACEOh, Diana is cool, but why is her single coming out so close to Fantasia's? Not another Clay-Ruben situation please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Fantasia commands your attention! This isn't even her best performance and she STILLS blows me away. Only Fantasia can take a dumb song (I believe) and make it HOT! I can't wait for project to be released. It's going to be HOT...in the meantime, I'll continue to enjoy this wonderful taste of greatness!Favorite Cut- SUMMERTIMEDon't HATE.....CONGRATULATE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please!...you haters.....","review":"For all of those who claim the production of the cd was poorly done, it may be your sound system's problem! Fantasia's voice is fantastic and however she is recorded on a cd, it's not her fault! It's the fault of her (or the AI) production staff.Don't fault her voice. After all the voting, SHE won so don't be a hater!...Just wait and see what the entire cd has to offer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated","review":"After listening to this CD, I'm happy to say that I didn't buy it (my friend ripped a copy for me). But there is no reason to berate me for owning a copy because I'll be giving it back. I figure it cost my friend fifty cents to make the copy. That's fifty cents down the drain!The CD is mediocre at best with too much warbly singing, bad backgrounds, and lousy editing. If this is the best of AI, this country is in trouble!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She is an amazing singer","review":"I can't say enough about Fantasia Barrino. My only problem is the music is awful and the production really stinks! Sorry Fantasia, but they let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bashers will try anything to rain on Fantasia's parade","review":"But guess what? It won't happen. Like EVERY entertainment industry rep has said... Fantasia is IT! This debut single is great. She takes her talent and wraps it around whatever she sings and makes magic.Those who are giving negative reviews have not purchased her CD and won't. Fantasia is the real deal, wo bashers deal with it!GO FANTASIA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I too Believe...Inspiring, simply amazing","review":"Just when I thought she couldn't get any better. Fantasia does it again. She's simply amazing.She takes \\"I Believe\\" and pulls you in and it just lifts you up. By song end you feel so inspired and you too will believe you can do anything.\\"Chain of Fools\\" will make you want to get up and dance. Aretha would be proud of Fantasia remake of her song.Oh God, \\"Summertime\\" is wonderful. So jazzy and smooth. I simply love it. Her voice is so rich and pure.I can't wait for her full album release. I highly recommend getting this if you don't already have. Pick up a couple of copies, 1 for home, car and office. You'll definitely want to have this cd to play wherever you can. And no doubt your family and friends will want to borrow this cd. Fantasia is definitely one of the best new artists around. She'll have you yearning for more of her fantastic talent.Well Done Fantasia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good enough","review":"this cd isnt good at all, her voice just doesnt record well i wouldnt recommend it at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"i thought she had undeniable talent. Im not a raging Diana fan i just am not a Fantasia fan. At first i thought all but Chain of Fools was awesome. I was wrong. Mediocre talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend this CD","review":"I was looking forward to this CD ever since I found out she was going to release it. I was so anxious to listen to it after I bought it, but it's just terrible. I usually like Fantasia's voice, but it's so nasal. I don't plan to buy her album whenever its released. This was just very bad for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Simon Said, Donald Duck on Helium!","review":"For once in this whole year of American Idol did Simon get it right when he told Fantasia that she sounded like Donald Duck on helium! I thought that I would get the cd and give her a chance because I love American Idol and its whole concept, and we all know that artists sound better on recordings than live, but boy was I wrong! It is the same cartoon voice that she sang with live. You would think that they could have done some fancy productions to cover some of that up on this!! It is just a terrible, terrible effort. Nothing but high pitched shrills and shrieks, sounds like a poor cat dying a slow, miserable death. Summertime is so boring it will make you cry and Chain of Fools with all the added stupid lyrics makes you want to shoot yourself, and I Believe is just like hearing the dentist drill into your teeth. Sorry, but this is not American Idol music! Come on, what happened to talent like Clay and Kelly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad choice America!","review":"She shouts they songs, is flat and off key. She has a nasel sounding voice that is unpleasant and sounds like a cartoon....!!!! I gave my CD to a fan of Fantasia. I don't see what she sees in her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst singer in the world!","review":"The girl can't sing! All she does is squeak, squeak, squeak. She shrieks her way through all the boring, ugly songs. She's the most overrated non-talented singer in the world. Don't waste your money on this poor CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia doesn't have a good voice at all!","review":"I hated fantasia's single! In some parts her voice was to pitchy and in some parts she was off tune. I thought that it whould be better than this but it wasn't!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I know that she is somewhat of a talented young woman, so I wanted to try her cd out. But it was definitely a waste of money, I did not like one song on it. Her voice is too raspy and too squeaky in every single song, not to mention the corny type of songs, that is repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful and very well put together","review":"Im sorry that their are still true haters out there. I dont think the people who says bought the cd really didnt,because if you didnt like her on AI then why would you buy her single you guys are really fools. Dont you have anything better to do than play on the computer.Wait until youre PUGGY diana cd comes out and will see her cd sounds it probably sucks. Just check the records Fantasia has had strong sales rank which surpasses diana so why FANTASIA IS #2 on amazon and diana is #25 which fantasia has had a jump ahead in sales along time. Just stop hating she is the best and #1. For that person who said they got the cd and went back to the store to return that was a lie because once u open a cd u cant return it so stop lying."},{"rating":"1","title":"More studio-manufactured GARBAGE!","review":"Yet another AI reject, thrown into the studio where her vocals air-brushed into generic perfection. It's crap and it sucks. If you don't believe me, then why are people tryin' to hawk this for a fraction of what they bought it for?Throw this in the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"American GARBAGE!!!","review":"Thankfully, I didn't buy this CD. I was in my friends car and she played it for me. She said, you have to hear this garbage. I can't believe I wasted a good $5.00 on this. I had to agree with her. It was beyond awful. Fantasia has a very annoying voice that grates on you. While listening to her music, I actually found myself covering my ears when she would screech. And what is with the Ya Ya Ya's that she adds to everything she sings. I'm was never a fan of the Ameican Idol show and to be honest, after hearing this CD, I can assure you, I won't be wasting my time every watching that show. If this is the best in America that that show could come up....How sad for this country!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is GREAT","review":"This cd is great. It proves that the correct person won American Idol this season. \\"I Believe\\" is a cheesy song, but Fantasia is able to convey the emotion of the lyrics. \\"Chain of Fools\\" was not one of my favorite performances from Fantasia on the show, but I think she does a good job in the studio with it. \\"Summertime\\" is the stand-out here. The arrangement is great and this is a excellent opportunity for Fantasia to shine. The other reviews in here that refer to personal life or compare her to other contestants are bogus - listen to the music and you will hear a truly talented artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst C.D.","review":"Fantasia Burrino supposely won American Idol 3, but she doesn't deserve to be an Idol. There's 3 reasons why. Reason #1 She can't sing. Reason #2 She's always off key. And Reason #3 If she has an album what good will it do her. Soon people will realize she can't sing. She probably just went on American Idol, for people to notice her. Don't Buy It."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"do not buy this cd! fantasia is a horrible singer and the only reason she won season 3 of american idol is cuz the judges kept pushing for her. i personally think they were told to do that cuz the show was called \\"racist.\\" of course, the show is not racist; just look who won season 2: ruben! fantasia's voice is annoying and can make even the best song unbearable. save your money, dont get this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating!!!!","review":"What a dissapointment!! It is absolutely painful to listent her squeeky attempts at singing. Was this the best American Idol had???? YIKES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No No!!","review":"She may have a big mouth but she sure as hell don't make up for it in singing! Too much yeah yeah yeah's gives her a no no no no! for her debut. Sorry Fantasia! Not a fan of yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Fantasia sings with her heart, but the tone of her voice sounds nasal. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My CD made a great frisbee!","review":"Seriously, I had expected more from the studio recording than this! You can tell they rushed this CD out and the fact that Fantasia made them delay an extra week caused problems for everyone. She made small intonation errors on the show and I just assumed they'd work it out on the recording, but they didn't! As a result it sounds like it has no dynamics what so ever. And the choir is hideous. Sorry, but it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I heard \\"I Believe\\" on the radio a few days ago. It started out ok, but quickly tanked as Fantasia started pushing the limits of her voice. This is horrible. Yes, Fantasia CAN carry a tune, but it sounds like Donald Duck's sister. I never realized just how cartoonish her voice is, until I was subjected to this song on the radio. I definitely did NOT think she was the best singer on AI--and before you call me a racist--my favorite was actually Jennifer Hudson. Fantasia is going to end up like the other AI winners: she will have one semi-big hit, and will then fade into obscurity. No big loss for my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE...JUST HORRIBLE","review":"If you are going to listen to this please make sure all your mirrors and windows are far away!She can't stay in key much less sing any high notes.Fantasia sorry singing is not your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for Cat in Heat's effort!","review":"As one reviewer aptly said, \\"Zero star for the vocals. This girl simply doesn't deserve airtime. Her voice is squeaky, her tone is pitchy, and her style is ugly. No wonder she's already a has-been after releasing only one single!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented and Blessed","review":"American Idol is a chance of a life time and it's title should be given to pure talent. Fantasia can really sing and it shows throughout I Believe and I am sure she has the ability to perform many different types of song and she will show her skills in the different songs on her CD. An artist should never limit themselves to one type of singing so for the other reviewist being able to sing all types of songs and arrangements shows skill and talent. It's called versatility! Congrats to the North Carolinan and pure talent of America's Idol Fantasia. I am truly proud of her and all she is being blessed with and I pray her success continues for years and years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This single is enough for you to buy every album she is on. Fantasia has a wonderful voice and she puts it on everything she records. My suggestion is to go out and buy the 3 song disk and listen to it over and over again because it moves your soul. This CD is Fantastic Fantasia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Talent","review":"I purchased and listened to the three songs on Fantasia's new CD and I was thoroughly impressed. Ms. Barrino is a master phraseologist and her voice is as smooth as velvet. I was reading the reviews and I saw where a few people gave this CD a one-star. They could not have possibly listened to this CD to rate it thusly. If they are Diana fans, fine. They should purchase her CD and go on with their lives. Fantasia is no Reuben. There is no way that Diana is going to outsell Fantasia Barrino so they should accept that fact and move on. Clay Aiken is an exceptional talent and deserved all of his success, and he, too, proves that you cannot manufacture talent. The beautiful thing about Ms. Barrino is that she doesn't need a gimmick or fake reviews to drive her ahead. Her talent speaks for itself. The CD is awesome. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"America Got It Right!!!","review":"Fantasia is excellent and really made the cheesy 'I Believe' come to live. She did to this song what was needed, put a spiritual tone behind it that really touches the soul. Her rendition of 'Summertime' is the best I've heard in ages and I've listened to this song since it was in the movie 'Porgy & Bess'...her jazzy, bluesy tones really serves to redefine the full meaning of the song--great touch. 'Chain of Fools' is great but I must say I would have preferred to ear her recreate 'Fool In Love'...nonetheless, she did an excellent job with a true soul classic.Her voice and emotions really make this CD worth every penny spent. In fact I purchased one for home and one for work. Well worth the money. I'm eagerly awaiting her full album to see what new things are created to fully embody her vocal talents. Also waiting to see her first video.I highly recommend purchasing this CD and give a listen for yourself. (...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankyou,Fantasia.","review":"To me,this CD is a little gem. Fantasia,has a distinctive voice and a unique style.Each word,and each note that she sings are,like threads of silver and gold, and colours of the rainbow,and she weaves them into this intricate and beautiful Tapestry,which is her song.She does not simply sing her song,but she also imbibes and savours it.And,amazingly,in the process,she is able to transfer all that flavour that she senses,to the listener.The songs in the CD are of differnt styles and tempos,and your mood changes from one song to another.1. I Beleive...It makes me want to fly,and do things that I was too scared to do in the past.2. Chain of fools....Made me got up from my seat and dance.3. Summertime...I feel like I'm lying down under the cool shade of a flowering tree,and a cool breeze fanning my face..........It makes me feel happy,and thats a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Summertime is good - Very disappointed in the rest","review":"I was blown away when Fantasia did her rendition of Summertime on American Idol. The CD version is good, but doesn't capture the same soulful emotion as the TV performance. As for the other two songs, I can hardly bear to listen to them. Chain of Fools is over produced and I Believe is just a crummy song. Fantasia deserved much better. She's only about half as good as Ruben Studdard was last year and you don't hear much from him now. His \\"Brand New\\" remixed single is like number 20,000 on Amazon sales chart. By this time next year, Fantasia will probably fare the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion Perfected!!!","review":"Just an awesome CD!!!! Her performance of Summertime brings me to tears every time I play it... This girl is not just a singer, not just some girl trying to have a career... She has been blessed with a gift that only the Lord could have given her... No amount of lessons, or practice could get anyone to this level... She has an incredible ability to make you feel whatever it is that she is feeling when she is singing... That my friend is a gift from GOD..... God bless you Fantasia and your gift!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"All you haters out there need to stop bashing Fantasia, she rocks!I've always loved her on American Idol and I'm sooo glad I bought this single so I can listen to her beautiful voice all the time.If you loved Fantasia on AI, or if you're just looking for some good music to calm you down, this is the real deal.Peace Out.*******JESSICA*******"},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to a friends copy","review":"fantasia was very good on american idol but did not deserve to win she should have been third or fourth place. summertime was not as good as it was on American idol. fantasia is not a great singer shes a great performer and an okay singer she tends to sound like big bird when she goes for the high notes in I believe.Chain of fools was okay. Theres something missing when I listen to this cd. Fantasia is a lot better when your watching her perform. listening to her sing on a cd is a little difficult. I suggest people keep there $6 and borrow it from a friend if they must listen to it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF DA CHAIN","review":"This cd single was long overdue, from The American Idol winner... I followed her on AI, since she sang \\"Something To Talk About\\" So I couldn't be disappointed if she sang \\"Old Mcdonald\\" So I was even more breathless when I listened to her cd. Her funky version of \\"Chain Of Fools\\" had me dancing around my house. Plus, her SULTRY version of \\"Summertime\\", gives you that Big Band, Ella Fitzgerald, and Lou Armstrong, Kinda feeling. I CAN'T wait for her WHOLE Album, I know I am going to need a few, for myself, plus for stocking stuffers...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother...","review":"I bought this single even though she wasnt exactly my favorite singer on American Idol figuring Id give her a chance.

No, she will never ever come close to singing as good as Clay - he is almost perfection! I do wish her the best though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth as velevet? I think your ears need a check.","review":"There is nothing original about Fantasia, everything that she is has already been done by former performers and also currently Macy Gray. Call that talent? She doesn't have anyway. She screeches, and screams, and turns every song into a gospel song. Also, the American Idol is supposed to do POP music. Hence the original show POP idol. Want to do R&B, Hip-Hop and all that bad stuff? Go and try to get a record deal yourself. And also, all the tracks sound the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so singer, bad production people","review":"Come On people! The only good song on here is Summertime and it is OLD and tired! I watched AI from beginning to end and they have no clue what they are doing. The only thing they got right was to vote for Fantasia. I loved the show, I can't stand the CD. Don't know why I forced it on myself. I guess I hoped it would grow on me, but it doesn't. It's just like Kelly's CD from Season 1. Only 2 good songs and then blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cd just so so","review":"I bought this CD and it doesn't sound anywhere near as good as the live versions from the show. \\"I Believe\\" is alright and that's about it.

Her voice is good, but the recording isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This never should have been released","review":"Bad songs, average singers, rushed out the door, boring tracks, lousy mix. Why didn't they get her better songs? I'm not really giving Fantasia one star, I give her 4, but the songs are terrible! I am rating the CD, so 1 star it gets! Don't buy this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fantastic Fantasia!","review":"I just don't get it! I have respect for her as a person and performer, but that voice, oh it is so terrible! I can't believe that she won American Idol. Her voice is way too shreiky, and the notes are all off key. And what is with all of the added notes like yeah, yeah, yeah? Does that really need to be in there? Hopefully the rest of her cd will be better. Because these songs on the single are really bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is the best compliment she's ever got","review":"Why can't I give this a -10 this CD is complete trash.After work I decided to get this CD I want to see what this years American idol sounds like.Ouch Wasn't there anybody better then this.I want my money back this is a disgrace to humanity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice is raspy at best...","review":"and she has difficulty hitting the high notes that she has to scream. This is not exactly what you'd expect from someone who supposedly won a singing contest.The songs aren't the best either. She's no soul singer, much less a queen in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"During American Idol, I honestly didn't like Fantasia. However, I was sure she would sound great on a record. I decided to buy both Diana's and Fantasia's singles and see who's was better. The result was overwhelming: Diana was far superior. Just listening to both versions of I Believe will prove that. Fantasia has kept the horribly painful things she did in the show, which I thought was just to seem edgy and unique and to get fans. Nope...that's her voice.I Believe is by far the worst of the three songs. The other two deserve probably 2 or 3. But, I Believe actually did hurt my head. The high notes are shreiked, and the \\"yeah-yeah-yeah\\"s every 5 seconds are irritating. If possible, she sounds even more like Donald Duck meets Macy Gray than she did on the show.I had hopes for Fantasia. I thought she'd finally impress me on a CD, but it's even worse. She's irritating, and can't sing very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No NO!","review":"I watched American Idol and scratched my head as I watched Fantasia. Yes, she is a good performer with a lot of charisma. She just has a really horrible voice! She is American Idol 2 reject Kimberly Caldwell without the cheesy moves. Fantasia rarely sang the lyrics to the songs, instead shouted and screeched \\"Yeahs\\" throught most of the songs. Summertime is all wrong. The girl sounds like a duplicate of Macy Gray, but more nasal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened to her voice?","review":"I watched AI3 this year and I was not realy a fan of anyone..No one had the IT factor this year. I am sorry but Fantasia's voice reminds me of fingernails on a chalk board..Trully I would rather listen to that than Fantasia..Do not waste your money on this so called Music..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a screamer!","review":"What a horrible, HORRIBLE CD this is! My friend (if I can call him that) gave me this CD. All Fantasia does is scream, screetch and yell all the words of what used to be great songs! And people are right, the Yeah, yeah, yeah's s*uck! How did we end up with these two losers near the top? What happened to Latoya! Come on, this is a joke! I threw the CD out the window and I accidently hit some weeds with it and they got knocked down. It did save me from some gardning work so I gave it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"I am a a big fan of Fantasia ever since she was on American Idol. Ever night she came on she sounded great and her songs were amazing. On this CD the only good song on her is Summertime. She sounded better live then on her CD. Summertime is the only one of those song that is worth listening to. The first 2 songs said ok, those songs dont show why she won American Idol, she sounds like an OK performer. But Summertime is difenatly worth listening to, i say its the only good song on the CD. I was very upset with what I heard. I though this CD was going to blow me away, but it didn't at all. Oh well my loss, i just hope her Album is 50 times better then this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, I too believe, Fantasia","review":"This version of I Believe, with the new verse added is absolutely AMAZING! It couldn't be any better. The words inspire and Fantasia's love of the music and singing lifts us into heaven. She is truly an amazing talent and will be around for many years to come. Can't wait for the CD in the fall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"close to ok","review":"I am not an AI fan, but with so many co-workers who are, I went out and bought both Fantasia's and Diana's CD's.

Good luck Fantasia...looks like you may need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haters make fantasia stronger","review":"Fantasia got so much people frontin on her ,people needs to make fantasia live her life peacefully,and stop saying these nasty remarks about her.She is a very talented young lady and will be around for a long time.Stop hatin for realTime out for dramabecause this is too much for one person to handle, she is a human bein like everybody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the fans need to quit","review":"I understand why people talk about Fantasia's life. American Idol is just about that: being America's IDOL. It's not just about musical talent, it's about how one conducts oneself; should be good enough to be considered an IDOL. (...)My mother thinks she squeaked Chain of Fools too bad that it doesn't sound even close to the original. (...). The show is about being an idol.Fantasia's lucky that being a \\"novelty\\" was a factor in Fox choosing her for the title. Otherwise if it were based on talent alone (which she doesn't have), she wouldn't even have reached the top 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia Rules!","review":"I give Fantasia a good recommendation because she can sing! The songs have a lot of feeling and can bring me to tears. Go Fantasia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia's CD","review":"I listened to a friends copy of this CD and did not care for it. I feel she screems way too much and her Gospel style in EVERYTHING is too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Hung!","review":"I did not watch American Idol 3. The judges DO NOT judge, the show is NOT fair and impartial and I just don't understand why they stand by who they stand by. All the critics rave about this girl! Why? Her voice is HORRIBLE! Most of the time she just sings yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I have always been a fan of true vocal talent and I don't hear it here at all! Most of the pop \\"singers\\" today need vocal enhancement and very rarely sing live because of it. Give me true vocal talent any day. You won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Plugs","review":"I am not a big AI fan, and neither of the AI 3 finalists are that great either. Listening to Fantasia screech her vocals makes me want to grap ear plugs. She sounds just as bad as Macy Gray. Both have no talent and have horrible voices. On the other side we have Diana. She also has a lot of work to do on her vocals. She is to nasal and is hard to listen to. Given a choice between the two, I would have to go with Diana, who has a softer calmer voice. And I dont feel the need to reach for the ear plugs. Diana is to nasal, and Fantasia sounds like a cat about to die schreeching! Kids today have little to no talent, can not write or play their own music. Some can not even sing their own music. These kids need to graduate first before singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!","review":"I say, NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!Fantaisa repeatedly says Yeah! in all her songs. I find her voice very annoying. She is not unique as she sounds just like Macy Gray, but worse. Summertime is okay, but not sung like it should be for Porgy and Bess! The other songs are horrible. Yeah, Yeah, I really mean horrible.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you even listening to her sing?","review":"Anybody who gives Fantasia five stars must not really be listening when she sings.

It's so much better, I've actually listened to both singles. Although Summertime is good, Chain of Fools is screechy and I Believe isn't in the same leauge as Diana's! If you buy this and not Diana's your missing out. At least buy BOTH of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE'S NO LATOYA OR JENNIFER!!","review":"I always thought Fantasia had talent & stage presence, but couldn't imagine listening to an entire CD of her whiny, nasally screeching, even if she does come from my home town. Sometimes a particular artist's voice just does not appeal to you, though others may love it. This recording does nothing to alter my original view. LaToya London & Jennifer Hudson both displayed much more power & range in the AI3 competition & should have been the final 2. Sorry, Fanny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barrino Makes a Horrible Single!!!!","review":"Miss Barrino sure screeches her head off on this dreadful single. It is simply the worst CD/Single ever put out by an american idol contestant. Diana Degarmo overachieves her vocally by far. In this Single, Fantasia proves what was beginning to be known on the show(all she does is screech). She makes an art out of it with this single. Don't even waste your money unless you enjoy the wretched tunes of your dogs howling added together with a nail being scraped across a chalk board. JUST TERRIBLE,DON'T BUY IT, YOU WILL BE TERRIBLY DISSAPOINTED, AS I WAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated CD","review":"I know ... say anything bad about this singer and people accuse you of being a 'hater'. Well the truth is that it's just not that great of a CD. The mixing is mediocre, and background is not crisp, and the arrangement is not the best for someone with Fantasia's style of singing. Her strength lies in gospel style music. Chain of Fools is a horrible rendition! And Tamyra's song \\"I Believe\\" is, well to put it mildly, a real disappointment.Doesn't Fantasia write any music of her own? It's nice that she won the competition, but she'll never make it big selling CDs like this. It's a really poor choice of genre for her voice.I'll wait until she puts out a gospel CD before I consider buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Macy Gray..Nooooooooo!","review":"I have respect for her as a person and performer, but that voice, oh it's just not for me!

I can't reccomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time around","review":"I rated this cd five stars and if I could the second time around I would give it ten stars. I don't quite get the hateful comments. why can't we be civil and agree to disagree while giving all the young talent a chance. Fantasia will not be everybody's cup of tea but she has earned the respect of many, so my hats off to you and go with God because the haters don't have a life and they only seek to destroy what they envy. that is why they spend so much time giving their negative comments over and over and over again! Diana will have a place in music but not with me for now. This contest is about talent and I thank God for AI because they made music sound like music again and the little guy gets his chance to shine and that could not have happen without AI. Everyone feels like a winner when the right one wins. This is the greatest show that I have seen lately. Simon won't bow to the americans who want to play the race card and he's a very wise man for doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! An Idol worth paying money for","review":"Thank God! We finally have an Idol who has true talent. Even if her style doesn't appeal to you, you have to admit she has more raw ability than all the other contestants put together.

I watch all of AI last season and just never thought she could carry a tune, but of course look at about half of the popular singers out their today...most of them can't carry a note either. Most people thought she was fantastic singing summertime...and I said hello is everyone toned death. The music indusrty hasn't been good since around the 80's and after the later 90's came it really went down hill. I could remember buying 8 to 9 out of the top 10 records back in the 80's, now I'm lucky to buy one cd single out of the top 10. With voices like Fantasia it isn't going to get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disappointed.....","review":"I had a chance to listen to these songs.

Her voice is extremely screechy. She hits notes and I get the feeling I did in school for someting going down the chalkboard and everything in my body aching. I do like Diana's version. I hope Fantasia does well, it just won't be me helping her. She really needs some help with ennunciating words. It would help in trying to understand what she is saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T GET IT","review":"Listening to it once was one too many times. Screeching, off key... truly a mystery (to me) why some people like her nasal voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I bought this CD thinking it was going to be great by the way everybody talked about it. When i heard her version of I Believe i was like what the hell is this, when she sang that song live si was 10 times better. of course she has to add her horrible yeah yeah yeah and she really does screech through half of the song. Chains of Fool is nothing special either. Once again her Live version is 10 times better as well. It sounds like a karoke song which is not very good. The only song that is worth listening to is Summertime, its the only song that actuallu songs good when she is not screeching through out the song. So overall this CD is not WORTH your money. If you like yeah yeah yeahs, yelling, and shouting then this is your CD but if not dont even bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"she is best LIVE","review":"I really liked Fantasia on AI3, but seeing her makes all the differnce.

This CD includes something for everyone. 1st Song - 'I Believe' has a gospel vibe and sounds even better than it did on American Idol. 2nd Song - 'Chain of Fools' is an upbeat tune that you can definitely dance and party to. 3rd Song - 'Summertime' is for all you folks who want to chill out, relax and listen to a nice mellow tune.

Diana was okay, but she can't light a candle to the stage presence and vocal range of Fantasia. I am proud that she is representing my home state of North Carolina. She should be an inspiration to those who are trying to make it. The negative responses I have heard about Fantasia have more to do with her background and not her vocals. We need to look at the talent of Fantasia and not how she has lived her life or the color of her skin. No one has lived a perfect live so why should the public expect her to be perfect when we ourselves are not perfect. But unfortunately that is the kind of country we live in. All I have to say is may God Bless Fantasia because she has a stars personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This girl is beautiful, talented and SOULFUL.The cd is AMAZING.

The show is over, idol found, and this year it's Fantasia. Her cd is amazing. Yes, I Believe is a bit trite, but Ms. Fantasia revs it up, kicks it up a notch and delivers a tour de force performance. Chain of Fools will make the Queen of Soul take notice, Summertime is Fantasia's calling card, and she can't be denied! So all you one star people, you might as well get use to it, cause Fantasia is the best thing to come out of North Carolina since........ Michael Jordan!

So don't let those \\"was this review helpful to you\\" numbers or any future negative reviews fool you, because they are obviously from either those who resent that Diana De Garmo lost to Fantasia on Idol, or have NO clue what true musical talent is.Now, Fantasia... I want to hear what you can do with Dr John's Litenie des Saints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fantastic","review":"This girl is really talented. Listened to her new single \\"I believe\\".. It literally moved me to tears. I like her version of \\"Summertime\\" too. The CD is definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I just wish she had more songs on this cd.....This is the first single i've ever bought....and i'm not dissapointed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing talent","review":"I have been playing this cd for hours . This girl draws you in and demands your attention . A star just waiting to happen . She inspires when she sings . I wish her all the best . Highly reccommend this cd !!! Love me some Fantasia !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Born to be a star","review":"Fantasia has the look the personality and most importantly the voice that will help her to make it in this industry as a true diva. She was born to be a star. \\"I Believe\\" is a fantastic song, although the studio recording doesn't do any justice to her emotional live performances of the song. Still a great track. \\"Chain of Fools\\" was something we've already heard; both on the show and the American Idol Season 3 compilation album and \\"Summertime\\" is what is going to be Fantasia's trademark song. This will do for her what \\"I Will Always Love You\\" did for Whitney Houston. The only thing that I don't understand is why a recording of \\"Dreams\\" didn't make the cut. I love the way that Fantasia sings that song and it would be nice to have it. Looking forward to your debut, good luck in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I thought I would give it a try, but she hasn't gotten any better. Her voice is so annoying on this record. \\"Yeah Yeah\\" is not a lyric, in my opinion. I wish her the best, but she will have to do a lot better than this if she wants to succeed in this industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed!!!","review":"Don't get this CD! Unless you happen to like boring music! I Believe is sappy, Chain of fools is repetative! And Summertime is dead. How did we end up with 2 old songs!????? Fantasia is better than this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"'I Believe' people who buy this are a 'chain of fools'","review":"... in the 'Summertime'.Even the single titles are a warning to consumers. Buyer beware. This CD is pure crap. 'Chain of Fools' is very karaoke sounding. Summertime we've heard plenty, there is no need to add it on a CD, Fantasia fans should want new material. And then you have that annoying song 'I belive', which is a rip off of about ten different songs.I believe that Fantasia the worst Idol champion in all the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - Not Very Good","review":"I never cared for the sound of Fantasia's voice, but I really enjoyed her stage presence. She is wonderful to watch. I expected great things from this CD, but was let down. The \\"yeah, yeah, yeah's\\" really throw off the song. I find myself listening more for those (and counting them) rather than listening to the songs. Much too much schreeching and yeahing for me. I hoped for more, but it didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia? More Like Horribilasia!","review":"OK... so I was a fan of AI, and on AI, I really like Fantasia... so I'm like \\"ooh buy the single...\\" so I bought it, and it is HORRIBLE!! Omigosh... she screams almost all of I Believe, in Summertime, it's EXACTLY like the live version, and in Chain of Fools, which she already did for the Sould CD, it's just EXACTLY like both live version and the Sould cd's... they practically just took both and combined them!! Overall, this CD upset me badly..Summertime: 2/5 - Boring and bland!!Chain of Fools: 1/5 - I want something NEW!I Beleive: 0/5 - Not only does she have NO emotion, its screamed, screeched, yelled... she uses no range in this...Overall, I would give this single an \\"F\\" for a grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia Has Got It.","review":"What a fantastic voice. Fantasia has got it going on. She has powerful vocals and talent that just surpasses the average person. She is gifted and rocks on. This single leaves you wanting more. Rock on, rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! u have got to hear this.","review":"WOW this is the best American Idol single yet! I believe rocks and Summertime is awesome.Someone I know has just purchased Diana's single it is dreadful. she hollars the whole time she is singing. Fantasia Single rocks and i cant wait til her debut album hits the shelves. I know it will be awesome. If you do not purchase this CD you will always regret it. It is best money you will ever spend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"idol","review":"just not very interesting, she sounds like a few other singers already out there. I'm not crazy about her over-the-top performances, she tends to over-sing, and ends up sounding more like she's screaming than singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Believe #1 4 consecutive weeks","review":"Fantasia's I Believe CD has been the number one selling single for 4 consecutive weeks. I think that alone speaks for itself. She'll go far in life and this CD with I believe, Chain of Fools, and Summertime proves this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star in the Making","review":"Every now and then, we get to watch a young talent come into her own. In the case of Fantasia, we get to watch someone incredibly talented and different become an actual song stylist. Mark my word, there will come a day when songs that this young woman sings won't dare be covered by other vocalists (if they have the sense they were born with). There are few singers who have that distinction. They include Bette Midler, Patti Labelle and Aretha Franklin. When Fantasia sings a song it often seems that the song was or should have been written especially for her. Listen to this songstress and you won't be disappointed. The hairs (the little ones in the back) on your head will tingle with delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Effort--Fantasia Rocks","review":"Purchased single and love the passion and soul Fantasia puts into each song. She does an excellent job with Summertime and I Believe...really makes you Believe..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia is AMAZING!!!","review":"Initially, Fantasia was not my favorite on AI3, but later I began to understand why the judges and even Clive Davis thinks she is so good. Thank God this CD is not a carbon copy of her performances (which were great) on TV. When I listen to a singer, I don't like to hear the same exact version of the song everytime. On this CD, Fantasia offers something different in every song that you didn't already hear on TV. Also, I've read some reviews (from professionals in the business) and almost all of them were pretty complimentary of this CD single. I have to agree. She sings with so much feeling and passion. Knowing her story, I can really feel her in \\"I Believe\\". She did what people told her she couldn't do. She entered the public eye knowing that people would criticize her and forever judge her for her past mistake. Kudos to Fantasia for realizing her dream! Great CD... I can hardly wait for her album in November."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut Single is a Masterpiece","review":"The AI3 winner debut single reaches inside of your soul. It is absolutely fabulous! It is truly a soulful, passionate piece of art. Her music has a way of \\"grabbing you\\". It makes you laugh, cry and remember the good ole days.I am anxiously awaiting Fantasia's full CD. She is a wonderful spirit sent into the world to spread the glory of \\"God\\" in song."},{"rating":"2","title":"The correct WINNER!!","review":"I loved her from the 1st time she sang on American Idol. Something special about her voice that is very inspiring. I cannot recommend enough the purchase of this single."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best idol debut cd yet","review":"And I don't say that lightly. Clay Aiken had the best prior to Fantasia's. I didn't like the recorded version of \\"bridge over troubled waters\\" ( it didn't have the punch of the live performance> which is the only reason fantasia gets a better review from me. All three songs are well performed and well arranged. Yes, \\"I believe\\" is as weak as all the other American Idol debut songs but Fantasia performs it well. \\"Summertime\\" is awesome and \\"Chain of Fools\\" has you bouncing in your seat.I feel that this CD demonstrates Fantasia's range. She could easily have the cross-appeal of say Beyonce, if J records doesn't get it in their minds to just market her as an R&B artist. She can sing anything as AI3 demonstrated. I agree with Simon. Fantasia is potentially the strongest idol yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old soul, New sound","review":"At 19, Fantasia has lived more life than many people twice her age and her performances show it! Her voice is smoky, rich and bluesy an intoxicating combination that touches your soul! I mean come on posters I'm a midwest midlife mom, even I can see her UNLIMITED TALENT!Fantasia is real people, real people make mistakes and then take responsibility for them and learn a few life lessons along the way. God has given her many gifts INCLUDING an awesome talent and a beautiful child. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"totally awesome","review":"Fantasia's cd -single is off the chain. it gave me chills,that girl can sing. beautiful voice. way to go Fantasia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia lacks tonal quality","review":"I gave Fantasia an honest try, but I couldn't take her voice for more than a few minutes. She does have style and I give her credit for that, but her tonal quality is too nasal and squeaky. I think Diana DeGarmo's version of \\"I Believe\\" will appeal to a wider audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, not \\"Hairspray\\" but \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\"!","review":"Her voice would be one of the \\"horrors\\". This CD is a classic example of what horrific means."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Lady Can SANG!!!!!","review":"Thank You Fantasia. You are a threat to Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys, why because you too can sang. I love this 3 song cd. Fantasia is blessed and American Idol 3rd episode finally bred a star. Only issue with AI3 is that I wish she had more competition. On AI3, Jennifer Hudson, the third black diva, and regretfully the first to be kicked off was elimated. It should have been her facing Fantasia, cause that would have been something, but it's cool. We have not seen the last of her. But Ms. Barrino, God Bless you and your long Career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia, good luck","review":"Summertime is the best on the cd other than that, I really didn't care for the choices that was made on her debut Cd.I think she has more to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"For all of you that hate Diana or think she screams .. I would love to see Fantasia hit half of the high notes that Diana can. If you wanna talk about screaming than Fantasia is the one to talk about. She has absolutely no talent and for people to say that Diana can't sing is just retarted. Obviously some people can't hear well. I think Fantasia cannot sing and shouldn't of even made it to the top 10. The only thing she has is personality that's why she won because it wasn't for her voice. Diana can outsing Fantasia anyday and her single is 10x better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1 star reviews are getting so old","review":"It doesn't matter how many 1 star reviews you write, it won't change the fact that Fantasia won... Fantasia won! Fantasia won! Her debut is evidence as to why SHE WON! Everything she touches comes alive, even the somewhat cheesy I Believe. Her take on Summertime is timeless and Chain of Fools will have even you bashers rocking. It is so immature and yet obsessive for those of you who spend countless minutes drugging up nonsense about Fantasia's undisputed talent just because Diana lost; it's pretty pathetic. Seek help you losers, help is available.Fantasia rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful voice!","review":"My 6 year old daughter talked me into buying a copy of this CD and we've been listening to it in the car ever since.Fantasia's vocals are powerful and the emotion she conveys is touching.The only negative is the clicking background sound in \\"Chain of Fools\\" It's especially annoying while driving because it soulds like there is something wrong with the car.Overall, the is the best CD I've bought in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality CD!!!! Terrible Production!!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Fantasia's, But I am very dissapointed with the horrible quality of this CD. Terrible mixing. Fantasia sounds like she's singing in the background or something. There was also a ticking sound during Chain of fools. Hope her next CD is better quality!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Donald Duck Strikes Again!!!","review":"I was in my friend's car and she was playing Fantasia's CD single. It was awful!!! My ears are still bleeding. I'm amazed that Disney hasn't called her on the carpet for a pat pending violation. She really does sound like Donald Duck. Needless to say, I won't be buying this CD and would tell anyone else not to waste your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a singer?","review":"All I heard was squeaking. The style wasn't even original; it was like Aretha Franklin being scratched by her cat. And the songs have been heard so many times before already.The producers need to come up with something good and more original. They can start by looking for a REAL singer who has a quality singing voice and a pleasing personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"America, PLEASE WAKE UP!","review":"This girl has no talent(understandable coming from American Idol).

I don't think Fantasia Barrino is horrible, but I don't think she's the best either. She has a voice. Unfortunately, it's not always the best voice. She has a fantastic performance style and personality. Her voice is another matter. Sometimes, she tries to hard to sound like Macy Grey and Aretha Franklin. She lacks their soulfulness and power. Kelly Clarkson managed to capture Aretha's power and soulfulness much better. Fantasia can really blow when she needs to. She can really yell and scream. She should not try to be soulful. What she should really do is just rock out and stop trying so hard to be the next Macy Gray or Aretha Franklin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd Sux","review":"omg i heard the songs on it and ity STINX i am she was downright aweful on the show but i thought the single would be better, i listened to my friend's copy we were both disgusted! and hour later she returned the single to the store and demanded her money back it was just AWEFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Awful!!!","review":"I gave Fantasia 1 star only because I wasn't able to give her a negative number.

I have heard Chain of Fools and it sounds just like it did on the compilation cd, its OK, but I saw her perform I BELIEVE on tv and it was just horrid to watch and listen too. She adds way too many yeahs, she oversings and sounds so screechy.. I like Fantasia but Diana is much better. Its nice to listen to a singer! There is way too much shouting with Fantasia ... she needs better songs that she can sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought both CD's","review":"I have Fantasia's and William Hungs new CD's and must say that Fantasia sings like a dying duck. She goofed it all up. At least William Hung's voice was soothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"Fantasia, who had a lot of tallent on the show, makes a squeaky, pathetic excuse for a single. I Believe is sung in such a squeaky voice, i love Diana Degarmo's version. Chain of Fools is sung in a no-emotion, boring, donald-duck voice. And Summertime is squeaky, pitchy and dull to listen to. Buy Diana DeGarmo's single instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idol really went down hill this year!","review":"No one had any real talent.

Keep looking up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so beautiful....what a talented artist!","review":"The first time I heard Fantasia Barrino sing \\"I Believe,\\" on American Idol she literally brought tears to my eyes. She made me smile and her interpretation of the song and its lyrics were very convincing! Though, some people have compared her to Macy Gray I have never heard anyone like Ms. Barrino before. Her voice has that warm glow so rare in singers of today.The other two singles didn't fail to disappoint. \\"Chain of Fools\\" and \\"Summertime\\" are unique and beautiful interpretations. Fantasia is going to go places with that beautiful voice and that sparkling personality we saw on the show week in and week out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the live version?","review":"The live version was awesome.

She's amazing in her ability to hit a note and keep its intonation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia has the Midas Touch!!!","review":"It fascinates me to listen to how Fantasia takes these three songs and completely owns them. She has not sung a single song the same way ever. This expanded version of \\"I Believe\\" is the best I've heard yet. However, everytime she performs she outdoes herself.This is a great debut and I look forward to her full album in the Fall. I highly recommend this CD. The talent is pure, raw and absolutely captivating. All three songs are a great listen!!!Congrats Fantasia!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many chefs spoil the dish","review":"Each chapter of the book is written by a different group of authors. Although authors themselves are respectable researchers in the field, this one more looks like a collection of papers rather than a \\"book\\". Also not all of them are good writers, so some of the chapters are extremely boring. Few concepts are just not explained to the level of detail I would have liked...in short this book gives you a \\"high-level\\" view. And at least I would not be able to implement any system explained without making my own assumptions. Of course, I should accept that I am not a master of this subject (but then isn't that the reason I am buying this book ?)I will not recommend this book at its given price. Makes no sense to spend $175 on this"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Perspective","review":"Most documentaries on early cinema concentrate on the American based contributions of Edison, Dickson etc,. These two, specifically dealing with sound and colour, bring in a whole new cast of characters, mostly European, who made significant, if mostly forgotten contributions. Some, like the bizarre inset of a conductor at the bottom of the screen to lead the orchestra, are mind boggling but indicative of the imaginative ways used to try and overcome shortcomings. Not always well balanced, but never dull, two very interesting documentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from a truly GREAT author","review":"This was a little change of pace for this author but as always I thoroughly enjoyed the trip and will take it again and again as I have with all of Amanda Quick's books........thanks for another wonderful entrancing tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"rerun","review":"I really enjoy the old Amanda Quick books. I have read most of her books written under her other names (Jayne Castle). The only problem is that she is reusing the plots and scenes from old books. This plot of this book was very similar to her other stories and some of the scene actually reminded me of scenes from her other books. I used to buy Amanda Quick books now I just check them out from the library. She has not written a book for my keeper shelf in years. Basically if you have read Amanda Quick's other books then you have read this one. If you are just looking for something to read then read this. This book is like a loaf of bread-plain but filling. But otherwise look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I really tried to like this one but to me it was just boring. I finally skimmed through it. I usually enjoy Historical romances with some mystery but none of this just rang true to me. I got so tired of the formal language which I relaize is Victorian style but when Jessica keeps referring to Anthony as \\"sir\\" even when they are having an affair simply got on my nerves. There were some secondary characters that were interesting, yet I found myself putting the book down thinking I will come back later which is very unusual for me when I'm reading. Some reviewers liked it so I realize we all have different tastes. Perhaps I should stick to the books she writes under the Jayne Ann Krentz name as I usually like those, though I have liked some of the ones under the Amanda Quick name. This one just lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. I simply couldn't keep my interest in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, plodding, predictable","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and it sounded like it would be intriguing, mysterious and sexy. It wasn't. It was plodding and predictable, with no surprises, and a \\"romance\\" that seemed especially fake. Left me with the feeling that the author needed to crank one out in order to make some quick cash. Waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorian Thriller","review":"Louisa Bryce, the mysterious sensational journalist known as I. M.Phantom, has another secret that she must keep from the authorities or risk the hangman's noose. Anthony Stalbridge is searching for the answers to his fiance's apparent suicide by drowning in the Thames. The two join forces to find the truth and, in the process,love.Amanda Quick has written a suspenseful Victorian thriller with fascinating main characters, sinister villians, and a host of supporting characters that neatly round out a tightly plotted, satisfying romantic suspense novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read...","review":"Novels like this one are the reason I like her as a writer. Interesting and a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to mail to friend it was so good","review":"The best romance novel I've read in a while. Really liked the way the writer wrote.

This is a great series and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than other recent ones, but not classic Quick","review":"I'm on the fence about this book. On one hand, I can't say I'm overly fond of the main male lead. The heroine is interesting and likeable, and I almost wish she'd end up with someone better (though the hero's family is quite interesting). The storyline has a good mix of mystery and action, if a little overly melodramatic. For those who like a bit more intrigue in their romance novels, this is a decent novel. Not the best by this author by a long shot, but not bad, either.And even though the author does a bit too much leading (as opposed to letting readers guess themselves or be utterly surprised) it's still a tidy, interesting plot. Pity about the hero, but still a solid novel. And if you like this one, I'd definitely read others by her (discounting the recent Arcane society ones)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The River Knows What?","review":"The River knows how ridiculously drab, typical, formula romance is? I've read this plot before--heroine murders in self defense and assumes another identity--and in the right author's hand the story line can be interesting and entertaining. Not happenin' here.The \\"River Knows\\" was a so-what, who really cares, boring mystery, easily-solved, lack-luster semi-romance novel. I couldn't wait for it to end. Could not care about either the heroine or the hero. Or anyone in the book for that matter. The writing was quite horrible actually, nothing intriguing or engaging at all.If you like Amanda Quick, and feel compelled to read this don't waste your money. Library is the way to go. I also suggest that you should read the other 2- and 1-star reviews here. Those reviews are right on target."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River Knows a Good Story","review":"This was an excellent Amanda Quick novel. Full of Intrigue and suspense. The novel with Louisa out to expose Hastings and of course Anthony to find out who killed his fiancee Fiona. There's chemistry between these two. But also deep secrets also. I won't say anymore but to say read this book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring........zzzzzzzzz.","review":"I think Amanda Quick is in dire need of a new muse. I don't know why I even bothered wasting my money on this book---perhaps because I keep hoping she'll put out a book on par with her earlier work. I never realized that a plot line could be so straight and narrow....and boring! It was almost painful how easy it was to predict what was going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of Let Me Down","review":"There were a few things that bothered me about The River Knows. First the story just seemed to grope along at a snail's pace. I didn't find to many parts in the story that kept me in suspense, which is unusual for Amanda Quick. She always seemed to have knack for blending, suspense, romance and humor with characters that you enjoy. I've always enjoyed Amanda Quick and normally the heroine is strong, with a mysterious flare, but this book sort of let me down. But despite these criticisms, I still thought the book was a worthwhile read and I'll continue to buy her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll never know what the river knows.","review":"I wish that writers would not call their books Romance novels if they are going to leave out the romance. The hero and heroine in this book have all the romantic excitement of Ozzie and Harriet. The interesting thing is, I liked them both, but Amanda simply did not make them the least bit romantically appealing. I don't mind enduring repetitive plots in her stories because some of her secondary characters are absolutely great, and in this story, some of them were more exciting than the leading couple. In fact, I don't even remember the lady's name. I think the hero's name was Anthony. If you're happy with a story in which the leading lady could easily have been a young and gabby, prim and proper Agatha Christie, then maybe you'll like this book. But if you're expecting romance, find yourself something else to read. That's what I had to do because I couldn't finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, use it on my Rv.","review":"Nice sign, I put it on the back of my Rv. I would purchase again . The price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Easy Reading","review":"This book was well written and moved quickly. It wasn't a sit on the edge of your seat thriller but it wasn't dull. It centers around a prominent family who are in the jewelery business. A string of murders happen and it seems just about everyone is breaking the seventh commandment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden treat","review":"I found out about Watershed by reading the book \\"Hitless Wonders\\" and was intrigued enough to track down some of their music. I'm a sucker for a live album and this one fits the bill quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it's trash, but trash can be fun.","review":"Absurd heroics, ridiculous set pieces, great effects (for the time) and a terrific cast, including lots of actors in supporting roles that have become familiar faces in movies or on TV. Worth every penny, I've probably watched it a dozen times (it makes a great double-bill with Dante's Peak). This is top-notch trash.My only question - why the f*** aren't Volcano and Dante's Peak on blu-ray?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, look...we're all the same color!","review":"I thought this movie was bad, at first. It had no plot, cheesy recycled effects, bad acting, themes of racism to please the masses, no suspense, and last, video in rewind that was supposed to look like it was going forward! My favorite! But then, I realized that by the end, this movie was up there with Starship Troopers. I broke at least 4 ribs laughing. If you want a good movie to ridicule forever...if you're always the guy cracking jokes, and people tell you to shut up...if you liked MST 3000, you'll get this DVD and enjoy giving Tommy Lee (Jones) the mocking of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Everybody's the Same!\\"","review":"This movie is horrible. Mediocre action flick at best- and what totally kills it is the forced morals it beats over your head. Movies like this do not need to have Rodney King references and other social issues: it's a brainless action flick. I have no problem with films that explore social issues- Spike Lee has had some thought provoking films, and \\"Crash\\" was an excellent example. However, movies like \\"Volcano\\" are so silly and so over the top that at the end of the movie all of our social ills are solved because everyone is covered in volcanic ash? When the little kid smiles and says \\"Everybody's the same\\" and the mushy music starts playing- this is pure Hollywood at its worst. This movie has little to recommend it to begin with- as action/ disaster flicks go, it's very mediocre to begin with. Throw in the contrived, cornball \\"moral\\" element, this is a god- awful movie. This movie is good for one thing: inducing vomitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Completely Underrated\\"","review":"Volcano is a completely underrated film with great special effects along with good acting and a so-so storyline.

Volcano was one of my favourites...I've given this film four stars because that's what it deserves for great action sequences and special effects.I see a lot of complaints about underdeveloped characters and plots but then again are we really expecting these from blockbusters? I think it's about some of these critics realised they just aren't going to get these things in a disaster film!! So stop looking and enjoy these films for what they offer.I found the fact that a volcano could erupt in LA a bit silly, and I wondered why they didn't just make the event an earthquake instead. We already had Dante's Peak, which I preferred, ID4, Twister and then there was Deep Impact and Armageddon. I thought there would have been a movie focusing on earthquakes.Sit back and be amazed and excited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheer for the Volcano!","review":"This is a hilariously BAD \\"Can't we just all get along?\\" GoldenTurkey movie. Once you get past the preposterous notion of alava-flowing volcano coming up out of Mid-Wilshire's Museum District,this movie is so bad, it's funny, especially if you arefamiliar with the LA area, then you can cheer and throw popcorn,as your favorite or hated sites are wasted. Slogan was great,\\"The Coast is Toast,\\" and worth getting together a bunch offriends and having a Golden Turkey festival party of your own.I cheered the volcano on, it was the best actor! Best scene waswhen the suits all looked around to see who's cell phone hadgone off.Best enjoyed with friends and some cold brewskis at a party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, lame, lame.","review":"Okay, so a volcano is forming under Los Angeles, and nobody manages to really figure this out until it's just about to explode. Pretty soon, folks are running from flying hot rocks, and magma lakes are having their way with the city of angels. It sounds exciting, but it isn't. For such a calamity, this felt so fake, with cheesy effects, dialogue and story, that I never got into it.Dante's Peak is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very special \\"catastrophy movie\\"","review":"I know a lot of people have found this movie forgettable, but I can't imagine why. OK, if what you are looking for is one of those movies where the entire world is about to collapse and everybody is looking up knowing this is the last time they'll ever see the sky, with a lot of religion, patriotism and love stories along the way until one guy coming out of nowhere saves the world and tries to pretend he doesn't mind being a hero, well this isn't the movie you are looking for.This is probably the best \\"catastrophy movie\\" I have ever seen, for being so exciting, action-filled and adorable even though it is avoiding all the things I mentioned earlier. With great performances on Tommy Lee Jones and Ann Heche's part, and with beautiful Alan Silvestri's music, I am sure that this is a movie that will be remembered through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, but mindless movie","review":"This is fun, but predictable and unbelievable star vehicle for Tommy Lee Jones.I recommend this movies for those times you want something enjoyable to just \\"veg out\\" for the evening.The movie moves fast enough with Tommy Lee Jones' acting to keep you entertained.Just watch and don't think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disaster movie!","review":"Good movie, although I could of asked a little bit more! I'd recommend this one if you just want to watch somthing good. But if you really want something that you'll remember for a long time... Dantes peak!But volcanos pretty good to, nice special affects!

Tommy Lee Jones showed his usual lack of range, basically playing the same character as always. I was expecting him to start looking for Harrison Ford any minute. And a volcano in LA ? Are we supposed to so stupid that will believe anything ? Or were they just too lazy to go on location? Every scene was incredibly predictable, and of course each close call came right to the last second. Basically, this movie is an insult to the viewer's intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"My husband and I saw this movie when it was in the theater. It is very, very boring.

Just sit back, and feel the brain cells melt away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Path to quick, easy wealth: idiotic screenplays!","review":"This movie hits all the tired old disaster flick clichés. As a budding screenwriter, I wanted to vomit. None of the characters say or do anything that makes any sense. The laws of geology, nature, and physics are thrown out the window. Impressive looking lava flows are all that seem to matter to the audiance. The screenwriter must have used all of two brain cells in writing this script. But he laughed all the way to the bank. You can't argue with success. I'll take my cue from him, and soon I'll be raking in the money. Wish me luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A First Rate Disaster Film, Never Dull For A Moment","review":"\\"Volcano\\" is a first rate disaster film, it is exciting all the way through to the very end. The effects are very good the compliment the movie well. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche turn in good performaneces. Out of all the disaster films released in the 1990's this one is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dante's Peak is better","review":"Anne Heche almost single-handly ruins this movie with her horrible over acting. Tom Lee Jones shows his one dimensional acting style and the rest of the cast submits mediocre performances as well. About the only thing done well was the lava, and I was rooting for it envelope Anne Heche and Tom Lee Jones in a fiery death. Unfortunately, they survive. This movie also trys to force a \\"we are the world\\" kind of theme, but showing how confronting lava can *gasp* bring people together in the force of adversity. A contrived plot device that could have definitely been left out. I think Dante's Peak captured a more realistic tone - when the eruption comes its pretty much everyone for themselves! If you do watch this movie, just watch it to root for the lava to destroy LA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch your home destroyed by a volcano","review":"I used to live in that neighborhood while working in Hollywood. I take a some what morbid delight in watching the CGI destruction. The best psrt of the movie is of course Tommy Lee Jones. I don't think he ever acts. He just plays himself and reads the lines. His character and personality is great. The scientist in me has a good laugh at the eruption and such. But it's easy to set that aside and enjoy. Also watch Dantes Peak for a comparison of disaster movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO 16X9 ENHANCEMENT?!","review":"Very disappointed there's no 16x9 enhancement. :(1 star for the DVD.There's no excuse for studios to release films without 16x9.Instead, like many early dvd releases, you get the 'widescreen/letterbox' release - which wasfine when watching on a 4:3 television; but with Widescreen televisions, it sucks because you'renow forced to watch it in what's called, \\"pillar boxing\\".Some TV's have the option of zooming in, eliminating the black bars on the left & right side, butthat's not recommended viewing -- you lose quality by \\"magnifying\\" the image.If you're thinking about purchasing -- I'd wait until they re-release the movie (which you know they will at some point)."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzz zzzzz oh its finished!","review":"This movie is sooooo boring, only because the same thing is happening over and over and over again and it just goes on and on and on....Its boring, dont bother with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFF","review":"I thought this was a pretty good disaster move, with perhaps not-so-good special effects (the lava flow seemed hokey to me).

I purchased this phone about a year ago or so and initially the battery life was acceptable, and I could talk for over an hour with no problems. About 6 months ago the battery life plummeted. The reason is because the batteries are crummy nickel cadmiums that suffer from memory effect. Now I have less than 15 to 20 minutes of talk time.

Lots of really gross questions (would you rather bite the head off a live gopher, or thoroughly lick the rear of a cat), and some conversation starting and thought provoking situations as well (would you rather cheat on your spouse and no one know, or not do it but everyone thinks you did?); anybody who can appreciate a good fart joke every now and then will have a great time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game.. for adults","review":"A pretty fun game.

I remember Christina's Back To Basics at the same time just had one CD in one shelve (people do recognize true talent). Jessica only had the show to back her up and bring more sales for her fake stupidity.

I liked a lot of the songs on this album including*A Public Affair*If you were mine*Fired Up*Let him fly*I belong to meand my favorite is \\"Walking round in a circle\\"I LOVE LOVE LOVE that song.

I really dont think it's a good purchase, but hey who I am to tell so?....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are people tripping","review":"This is the best CD that Jessica has ever done. I don't think that the first single was a good song choice, but this album is really cool. It's inspired by lots of really popular singers i.e. Madonna and Stevie Nicks. Most of the CD is uptempo. I like this change for Jessica. Previous albums make you want to fall asleep, but this has a cool little groove for each song. I think that she will do well with the second single. \\"I belong to me.\\" This is a pretty cool slow song. I guess we have to give the public what they expect from Jessica for the album to catch on. I hope that you guys enjoy the album. Don't listen to haters that are giving this such a bad review.

Then I'll pro tools it, have the backup singer re sing it. but all that will be done after you're gone.Jessica: making music is hard.Producer:well someone else wrote it, someone else picked the song, other people played it, I told you how to sing it, we'll have backup singers cover your bad voice, and the engineer will mix it.Jessica's Dad: you're fired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... what happened?","review":"I love good old disco and 80s/90s pop but does anyone else think that pop lately has been getting, well boring? It seems the past few years its the same old thing over and over again. Yes, the 80s are back but if we want to listen to 80s music we have a huge collection spanning over 10 years, we don't need an updated version. This album is horrible and boring. I really tried hard to like it but I am so shocked how Jessica isn't taking her talent UP to a new level and mature a bit. Her older albums have more validity then this one.

I don't buy many CD's (usually download specific songs). I liked her Irresistable CD, but this is aweful. One song is good, the rest sound like mush.The worst thing is that you can't hardly hear her sing. The mix is terrible, the vocals are way too low compared to the volume of her voice. It sounded like she whispered through most of the songs (I play this on a very high end system).DO NOT buy this piece of junk. I want my money back but I already opened the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless, Horrible, Hilarious","review":"Is this album a joke? Who is this girlie kidding? I think Jessica's day has come and gone. The song Public Affair is basically a combination of Madonna's 'Holiday' and Janet Jackson's 'Someone to Call My Lover'. Seriously. Listen to each of those songs separately and then listen to 'Public Affair' and you'll see what I mean. The rest of the album is pop fluff with Jessica doing the whole whiny, pitchy, breathy, trying to be sexy, bad singing thing.A friend of mine gave me her copy of this CD ('cause she didn't want it) and after one listen, I tried to give it back, but she wouldn't take it back!Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy the album!","review":"I think it's a pretty good album.

Also, the transitions between songs just don't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it worth it for the bonus track???","review":"So, you may be wondering if you should drop the extra bux for one extra track on this import. \\"I Belong To Me\\", track 14, is penned by well-known writer Diane Warren, runs 3 minutes and 40 seconds, and is what you'd expect from a Jessica Simpson slow jam: catchy melody, light hand clap rhythm track, sweetly hokey and lush orchestration. The vocal performance is mellow, except for some slight Jessica wailing at the end of the song. Best way to describe it: it's like one of the recent final songs written for the last two American Idols standing....usually, the judges will all say, 'loved you, hated the song,' or 'your performance was great, but the song is forgettable....\\"BUT, if you are a Jessica fanatic, there's no excuse to not have this slightly expanded copy of A Public Affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I like Jessica's previous album, but this one is pretty bad.

Don't let the first single fool you, the rest of the album isn't all that great.

She used to have a strong and impressive singing voice. It seems now that she tries too hard to incorporate sex appeal, really throwing off her sound. The album lacks a true flow, with no unifying sound between all the tracks. Many are nothing more than bubblegum 80s throwbacks. If you want to spend your money well, buy Christina Aguilera's new CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Him Fly?","review":"If you want to here a great version of the song\\"Let Him Fly\\", try the version from the Dixie Chicks \\"Fly\\" cd or the one from the writer, Patty Griffin,on her \\"Living with Ghosts\\" cd.I think Jessica has a good voice but her version pales in comparison to the other 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better... A complete bore...","review":"The reviewer below is correct. Jessica has a beautiful voice. But her songs lack that certain commercial \\"hook\\" that has been a proven success for Britney and Christina.

Once in a while is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this album. I was looking forward to hearing ballads and a few uptempo beats but not the ode to the 80s I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is AWFUL","review":"I bought this album, after hearing the hype about it. I thought maybe Jessica's voice had matured. But it is the same over-singing, lack of talent, try anything to make a buck rubbish.Do NOT buy this CD, it is terrible. I can't believe I wasted my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for trying","review":"I hate to give Jessica Simpson's CD a horrible review, but she has given me no choice. I loved Jessica Simpson's CD \\"In This Skin\\" so I was excited about this album. I was very disappointed. The lyrics are weak and her voice rarely hits the famous Jessica Simpson pitch that some people found annoying, but made Jessica Simpson, Jessica Simpson. I do not recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICK LACHEY's 2006 Album Is Better","review":"She can't sing - she can barely \\"chirp\\" her way through a song. Half a star would be a better rating for her lame efforts. No matter how many top celebrity producers she hires and how much studio wizardry, technology gimmickry and sound blending they add to her 'vocal' attempts - she only chirps off key at best. She had to 'repackage' her last album and add Dvd video clips just months after it was released because it wasn't selling. [Maybe she thinks she has to include visual 'sex' to sell her lackluster music.] Neither of the Simpson girls can sing, so, save yourself a huge disappointment & instead invest your $$$ on NICK LACHEY's \\"What's Left Of Me\\" cd, which is much better and packs a rockin' punch and some great ballads where he bares his soul and really sings his heart out with impassioned fervor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album is a BIG disappointment!!!!

Or maybe half a star. Seriously, it is one of the worst musical purchases I ever made. (Okay, so technically I didn't pay for it. My mom did. But she wasted her money because it sucks!)The only songs worth listening to on this album are You Spin Me Round and Fired Up. The rest are really stupid. Like REALLY. I expected more following Jessica's last album, In This Skin, which I thought was surprisingly enjoyable. A Public Affair, however, is not enjoyable. It's a waste. DO NOT get it unless you're into fluffy, meaningless pop junk, because that's exactly what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mickey mouse and Bubble gum","review":"Her tweenie fans should love this album. I just wonder when the music is going to grow up!Her good looks and pushy father are owed much of the credit for her continuing success.I liked her as the comic relief with ex hubby better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Great Album","review":"This is a pretty good album. I like the first single \\"A Public Affair\\" which is a great song for a girls' night out. I don't really like the song \\"Push Your Tush\\" which is well a terrible song. Though I do like the song \\"Walkin' 'Round in a Circle\\" which is one of her best songs yet. While her last album \\"In This Skin\\" wasn't exactly amazing this album makes up for it. I can't believe this album isn't doing so well while her ex-husband's album was a hit!!! His album was a bit dull while Jessica's is one of the best this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR $$$","review":"I am actually a fan of Jessica...I think she is generally fun to watch and has a good voice(sometimes). But this record is just sub-par. The songs are really dumb with stupid lyrics and no feeling. Her voice sounds just plain weird half of the time. One of the worst albums of the year, for sure. While I hate to make this comparison- I actually bought Nick Lachey's CD a while back and I am still listening to it all day. THAT is one great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please! Not Patty Griffin!!!","review":"This album is a colossal disappointment, given that she can actually sing pretty well - but not a surprise, since she clearly is content to douse herself with pop perfume again and again.I would like to commend her for covering Patty Griffin's \\"Let Him Fly\\" ... but no one has any business covering this song. I am so sad to see that Jessica did this. I'm sure it was - and still is - an important song for her during her divorce, but I am actually (literally) offended that she saw fit to include this incredible song on a disc with all the other schlock. It just makes me sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"get rid of this tired freak","review":"another crappy cd coming from miss simpson oh yeah she goes motown here this is why people download music because of crap like this screw her and her punk ex hubby and slutty sis ashley and oh yeah she can't even keep a damn boyfriend the dunce."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Public Disaster","review":"I love Jessica Simpson and I'm a big fan of her music, \\"In This Skin\\" was a wonderful album I couldn't take it out of my cd player for weeks, but after listening to \\"A Public Affair\\" it just seems like a cheesy 80s sounding dance album that was thrown together and is very over produced. Jessica is good at singing ballads which this cd seems to lack. \\"In This Skin\\" is a better buy, and I have to say her Nick Lachey's new album is wonderful and contains songs that have real meanings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother attending this \\"affair\\"","review":"Jessica Simpson's albums consistently get bad reviews, but no matter. I have enjoyed every single one. Until now, that is.A lot has happened to Simpson since she recorded her last disc. She has made the transition from B-lister to superstar. So, naturally I had high hopes for this album. Songwriters and producers would take notice and finally give her some songs that would launch her singing career into the stratosphere, I thought. Unfortunately, I thought wrong.The album begins with her so-so first single, \\"A Public Affair\\", and pretty much goes downhill from there. The disc's only redeeming track is \\"The Lover in Me\\", which is worth more than the $.99 it costs to download. But aside from this one bright spot, these songs make for an extremely disappointing affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Time For Jessica To Go!","review":"Out of all the natural and bleached blondes in the United States who can really sing, Jessica Simpson had to be the lucky one. I can't even believe she even made it this far. Her voice lacks depth, range, and maturity, basically, she sounds awful. Not as bad as Shakira, but close. Anyway, \\"A Public Affair\\" is a complete mess and should've been kept private. Jessica doesn't even know what she wants to do: pop, country, R&B, or swing, so she decides to do it all. I mean, did she even listen to this album before she released it? Embarrassing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened??","review":"I think Jessica had the potential to make a great album, but this album is terrible! The first single, A Public Affair, is catchy and fun. The rest of the songs on this album are dreadful. I don't even know what style she is trying to do on this album; it is such a mess!! I was excited to purchase this album, but after one listen, I feel I made a terrible mistake. Just very disappointing, because I was expecting SO much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next, Please","review":"I agree with the majority of posts. I am dissapointed in Jessica's new album and I own all of her albums. Why does she have to sing all \\"breathy\\"? What happened to the \\"belt-out-I Wanna Love You Forever\\" Jessica? She lost a lot of fans when she didn't want to split her earnings 50:50 with Nick. She wouldn't even be popular today if she hadn't gotten married and been on a tv show. Next time, I think she should try an edgier sound, kinda like Kelly Clarkson or her sister, Ashlee. Jessica can sing. I just don't know why she tries to do the sexy whisper on all her songs anymore! And I think the song \\"Walkin Round\\" sounds like it is from a Stevie Nicks song. Why so many samples?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a voice with no direction","review":"Jessica simpson has some talent,but is missing the right direction at getting it all together. the material here is all over the place&very cliched. the title track is a knock off of Madonna's \\"Holiday\\"&the Groove never catches on. Jessica is more Celine Dion than She is Britney Spears&yet She isn't anywhere near Celine Dion in terms of reaching her vocal goals as a Artist.She has pop appeal,but doesn't have the right Writers&producers to properly channel her musical talent. it is hurting her as a Artist. this Album is lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT","review":"I like this album. My only complaint is that they didn't include \\"I Belong To Me\\". We get instead, \\"Push Your Tush\\", which, while not a horrible song, it's not a great song either. \\"The Lover In Me\\", and \\"If You Were Mine\\" are incredibly catchy songs. Either one of these two would be awesome singles. She doesn't sing the same way as she did when she first started out, sounds like she has taken some singing lessons. Good for her. The big band sounding \\"Swing With Me\\" in my opinion, beats the hell out of Christina's jazzier, big band songs on her new album. \\"Walking Around In Circles\\" is a nice change of pace for Jessica. Kind of slows things down in the middle of the album, but not too much. Would be a nice single. \\"FIred Up\\" is a hot, hip-hop kind of song, sounds a little out of place on the CD, but is hot none the less. \\"Let Him Fly\\" ends the album on a nice mellow, acoustic note. She sings this one well. All in all a nice album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This really DESERVES a ZERO!!!","review":"Im not gonna go into full detail about this MESS. Except that Jessica Simpson is talented and has amazing voice to the likes of Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. However she just doesnt know what to do with it. She works with the wrong people & she really needs a mainstream producer to PUT her VOICE on the MAP & Utilize it to the best of her ability. This album was a MESS & thank goodness for technology cause i RIPPED it & added it to my iPod. I refuse to SPEND MONEY on this mess. That being said i only liked 1 song & that didnt even make it on the album unless she did a re-release and its called \\"I Belong To Me\\". Jessica here is to your next album which i hope will be better then everything else you released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable Album","review":"There just wasn't much to this album that I could get excited about. It all just sounds like filler except for a few of the slower songs. I would definitely recommend listening to this before buying it even if you are a Jessica Simpson fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love her, but...","review":"I adore Jessica Simpson!!! But this album is seriously lacking in originality. Why, oh why, do artist insist on re-making songs?!? Unless it's a Christmas song, it just doesn't work. At least for me it doesn't. Don't waste your money on this album, but definitely buy one of her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the public to think","review":"I was never a big jessica fan and this disc didn't make dislike her anymore than before but confirmed that all she is, is a girl singer someone who is pretty and can hold a note and sing on key and if you are looking for that in music then i suggest getting this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't wait to review this.","review":"i would love to review this product.BUT I NEVER RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL!

All because of Jessica's music. The tears cannot stop flowing from my eyes - both from witnessing the miracles this song has produced and from the sheer beauty of her music. She's like an Angel sent from Heaven to feed our souls and wake the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALBUM OF THE YEAR!","review":"I've never been a fan of Jessica Simpson to be honest, i never saw the big deal about her to begin with. I was unfamiliar with her songs, the only one I have ever heard was \\"public affair\\" which i thought was pure pop heaven! I took a risk and went out and bought the album...to my suprise, it is AMAZINGGGGG. I never thought this girl could pull off such a good album, it has everything! You can cry along with some of the songs and dance along to some of the songs, a perfect record in my eyes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I was hopping for a good album but instead its very average. At first it seemed boring but now I got used to it and its ok.I think instead of beeing all over she should have picked on styly of music plus to me the way songs put together is not a good choiceI hope she comes out with some better material soon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD I ever heard.","review":"OK. First I didn't buy the CD. I listen to them at Yahoo music subscription that I have.The first single was obviously a Madonna rip off. Surprised she didn't get sued yet. The remake of Dead or Alive song was the worst. Why make a remake if you're going to make it sound worst. I like couple songs before she did in the past but this CD just sucks so bad that I listen to the whole CD in 5 minutes.Kids, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed with this CD, she seemes to have lost her edge. Maybe losing at love made her lose her ability to produce good music.

This is her worst album ever. Theres gonna be a lot of dissappointed fans. Could have been better if she didn't sing using the voice she did. After a while this cd put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Affair: Avoid at all costs","review":"There is a thin line between paying homage to an era, and completely ripping off one song after the other. This entire album is an exercise in song recycling and bad production. The album tries to come across as laid back and fun, but instead seems forced and desperate. Jessica has never really made any real waves with her music, and this album cetainly won't be changing that.With opening sales close to those of Paris Hilton's debut, this could very well be the last album we here from jessica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Jessica claims this album contains the heart and soul of what's been happening in her life, but she forgot to include songs about a shrinking fan base who is tired of the regular slop. Save your money and buy Nick Lachey's album it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop","review":"Dear Ms. Simpson, please stop singing, you are only making yourself look worse than you already are. Your music isn't catchy, but worst of all, you have proven that you do not care about your voice or the kind of music you sing. Ms. Simpson, you originally had something that people were interested in. But, you gave into the pressure, and traded in your actual vocal talent for fluff and your physical appearance. You will NEVER be in the same league as Christina or Britney, so just stop please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wish","review":"I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could think of one, just one, good thing to say about this album. Sadly this was the worst 13 songs I ever had to suffer through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointing.","review":"What this CD is lacking is a heart.

I own every album she has made, and I anxiously await each new one. So of course when this album came out I snagged it up and looked forward to hearing those beautiful ballads that she does so well! She produces hearfelt songs and eliquently written ballads like no one else I have ever heard! This CD was a dissapointment to me...the only song that was like her \\"usual style\\" was \\"Between You and I\\"and I absolutely love that song! But everything else was all over the place. In my opinion she is trying too hard to become an upbeat club kinda singer and that just does not work for her-or it is not what she does well! She needs to stop trying to be what the other artists are because she is not successful with her \\"club\\" attempt at music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting a fun CD that I could pop in when I'm getting ready for a girls night out, but was extremely disappointed. There was only one song that made it worth buying and that is the cover of Fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, upbeat CD","review":"I have to say, I only own Sweet Kisses and was not very impressed with it other than the 3 singles. Irrisistible and In This Skin seemed to have good singles also, but I never bought the whole album.After hearing A Public Affair on the radio, I decided I would try out the whole cd when it came out. My usual music tastes over the last few years have been dance/techno/trance/electronica and some pop. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this cd, especially after reading all the negative reviews.I think I really enjoy the cd because a lot of the first tracks are upbeat and danceable. Besides A Public Affair, I love Swing with Me, B.O.Y., You Spin me Round, and the bonus track at the end. Fired Up is pretty good also, it reminds me of a mix between Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani.Some of the slower songs are just all right, but overall I like this album. Its good for when you are driving in your car or at the gym.Give Jess and her new album a chance people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Overpowers","review":"Regardless of the fact that I love Jessica Simpson, this CD doesn't live up to the others, namely Sweet Kisses and In This Skin. The music really overpowers her voice, particularly in Spin Me 'Round (Like a Record). You Belong to Me is possibly the best song on the album. A Public Affair is a good summery song, like if you're in the car with your girlfriends on a road trip, but beyond that, it's not so catchy. If you're not a dedicated JS fan, skip on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This album has a bit of everything. Jazz, pop, dance, and disco. All tracks equally as horrible. I miss the days when Jessica could sing. Now she does this thing with her voice that I can't stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Album","review":"I own all of Jessica Simpsons CD and this one is the worst one.

No wonder it doesn't sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tammy are you serious??","review":"In the Amazon review above Tammy la Gorce plugs this album as a success.........what????!!!!! This is without doubt one of the worst albums I have ever heard and I listened to it only out of curiousity to see if JS had started making any serious music. Obviously the answer is a resounding NO, and the title track is wincingly cheesy, with an attention-seeking video to boot. Tammy, you gave Nick Lachey's vastly, vastly superior \\"What's Left Of Me\\" album a negative review despite it having four strong tracks to Jessica's zero. Is it bias???"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh is she over yet","review":"someone get her vocal lessons! completelt unoriginal and oversung... dont waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"No artistic talent","review":"No thought, feeling, artistic anything in this cd.

We thought it was a billet piece and it was tubing welded together and then chromed.It did arrive in a Honda box and was a Honda piece but it had no hardware and didn't fit the Honda backrest and mounting brackets that were on our VTX 1300. There were no installation instructions letting us know what brackets they were designed for.Not only that, but it took more than 2 weeks for us to receive our product. We were getting ready to take a long ride and we didn't get the product in time. Now I'm afraid that we are going to have to pay a restocking fee to get the right bracket.

This is a VERY funny book! And well done. Murphy, like many dogs and their humans had gotten into the habit of too many calories and too little exercise. To view the storyline as a case of \\"society's...reverence of appearance above all else\\" and to equate Cheryl's conduct with \\"humilia[ion] by forced exercise or dieting\\" is a major case of the reader projecting HER issues on Murphy! He's a dog: he lives to eat, sleep AND please his alpha dog, Cheryl. And Cheryl, like any good alpha dog (or parent, for that matter) is using positive discipline and proactive behavior to mold her protege into the best--and healthiest--dog he can be.My kids love this book! And they don't see the negative messages that the CA reader does; they see a funny story about an owner's creative way to help her dog get healthier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad commentary","review":"Murphy is a fat yellow lab whose human, Cheryl, purchases a treadmill and forces Murphy to use it. He does, loses weight, attracts a female dog, and becomes famous.While Ziefert's intentions may be good, i.e. to encourage children to exercise and eat right, the less-than-subtle messages conveyed here are disturbing, to say the least. Is it alright to force someone to exercise, or to threaten them with punishment if they don't? Do we want to perpetuate this society's fascination with and reverence of appearance above all else? How many of us were humiliated by forced exercise or dieting as children, and how do we feel about it now? Did it improve our relationship to food or exercise? Were the results ultimately beneficial?Though this reaction may seem strong, picture books are read and absorbed by impressionable young children, many of whom are already overly body conscious.

Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. played supposedly mortal adversaries who both crashed onto a hostile planet. Together, they must work with one another in order to survive. The only part of the movie that I thought was a little out of this world (or somewhat silly) is that the Louis Gosset Jr.'s character gave birth and died during the process. It kind of smothered the story a little as Dennis Quaid's character must now somehow raise the baby alien by himself. Anyways, I would say that movie is sort of OK and is good for rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bit too much","review":"Barry Longyear's story is perfect. This movie could have been but what was that bull at the end with the whips and factory slaves and that stuff? They should have ended the movie as the story ended and not added that last bit. That totally ruined the movie for me. The novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt; the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity, if love doesn't prevail, at least strives to be better. In the movie, they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the Dracs. Did we learn NOTHING from the USA's foray into slavery and brutality? IT seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the 13-18 year old testosterone crown, thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect.

The old adage that with \\"love\\" everything is possible is the bottom line and foundation to this movie. The suspense of \\"uncle\\" saving the child and the faith that love will prevail is worth the time spent watching.

There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the delivery reminded me of students forced to read Shakespeare in class. After suffering through this, I got the Trevor Nunn/Ben Kingsley version--much, much better (though still not quite as good as the ASC version). Don't waste your time or money on this one. What was Branagh thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget!","review":"This rendering of Shakespeare's play is neither a full-fledged movie nor a filmed theatrical performance. It is rather a quickly completed television production that reminds one of 1960's children's programs.With the notable exception of the Victorian costumes that do succeed in making the infamous yellow stockings stand out, there are few original or creative elements that stand out.A single tacky and unoriginal set is used throughout the play.Silly elements such as the Christmas tree or the underground cave that serves as a jail fall flat and are just not funny.Worse, some actors play for the camera whereas others project their voices as if they were on stage.Sadly, this DVD can only be recommended to die-hard Branagh fans passionately interested in his career's evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality DVD","review":"Like a plane video tape - no caption, no scene selection, no special feature, etc. Furthermore, poor color; sometimes simply frozen. Greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very depressing version of a wonderful comedy!","review":"I usually enjoy Kenneth Branagh's versions of the Bard, but I truly believe he missed the mark on this one. So many hilarious moments were either passed over, or made overwhelmingly depressing! For instance, the entire scene with Malvolio in the prison is supposed to be a continuation of the joke. For some reason, Feste discovers a conscience and makes everyone feel bad about what they have done. That is not how it should be done!! Even the comical fight scene between Sir Andrew and Cesario is just awful and degenerates into sadness. The end is horrible!! This is supposed to be the great revealing, everything should end happily. Unfortunately, again it is extremely depressing. Do not waste your time on this. I will be looking for a much better version for my high school classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelfth Night a Disappointment","review":"I tried this because Kenneth Branaugh's name was connected and I find his Shakespeare enjoyable and extremely useful in the classroom.

The only plus to this version it is set on one stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Production","review":"This is where the Branagh/Shakespeare revelation began on screen. This is an excellent, wistful, adaptation of Twelfth Night/What You Will. Although it is a staged TV production, it is not a video of a staged play. A later version of Twelfth Night by Trevor Nunn uses bigger name actors and location filming, but this DVD showcases the wonderful language and verbal play of the text. Not only that, there are some beautiful musical passages used. Enjoyable from the first viewing, subsequent screenings yield even deeper understanding and pleasure from this mature comedy from the Bard."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Better Than Peyton Place","review":"But in a way, it is similar.

It's interesting the way she describes him: keeping a bottle under his bed, and throwing up every morning.

Davis' detail oriented approach does not work with Bruckner's music. Why did Davis think he could perform Bruckner? What possessed him to do such a thing? Money? Politics? Trying to please somebody? I don't know, but his tempos and building of climaxes are awful and so out-of-tune with the music. The LSO also play terrible here (must have caught them on an off-night) and clearly can't handle the sheer brute force it takes to pull off this symphony.Davis should be commended for treading into unknown territory (for him), but many times it doesn't work, and this recording is further proof of this notion.

Ok, How about hideous, disgusting, vile, trite, pathetic, and utterly contrived. The first SPEED was bad enough, was there really a need for a sequel, and on a cruise ship, give me a freaking break. Even Keanu wouldn't star in this nightmare movie from hell, that's how truly awful it was.I almost wish I could sue the film company for the hour or so I wasted by watching it when it came on cable. It was like a car accident, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't look away.

It ranks right up there with fight and dead-defying scenes on SOAP OPERAS!! A huge cruise ship plowing thru the harbor taking EVERYONE by surprise (obviously the weekend of DEAF boaters), as it smashed into small boats for the sake of...well, smashing into small boats..... Sandra Bullock has her hands tied and is underwater and her \\"guy\\" still has time to give her a kiss while under there. How sweet! (OR he may be trying to give breathe to her & the plot...who knows?) It would not have been surprising to see William Defoe twirl a big handle-bar moustache and give an evil laugh in his scenes.

The only reason I give it two stars is because Bullock manages through this turgid mess with a straight face and her hilarious lines make this a bearable action \\"thriller.\\"Rated PG-13 for violence and profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipboard drivel","review":"Why, oh why weren't Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on this ship? It would have struck that tanker near the end, gone down and mercifully spared us from \\"Speed 2\\" and its gosh-awful acting, plot and execution. Sandra Bullock, who specializes as America's favorite girl-next-door actress, reprises her role as an unwitting hostage, this time aboard a cruise ship hijacked by Willem Dafoe (whose talent is wasted here).

Looks like Keanu Reeves knew better and opted not to reprise his role, but what was Sandra Bullock thinking? She is a great and funny actress but jeez didn't she read the script? Jason Patric took Keanu's leading man place, he plays a different character entirely.

Trust me this film is horrible, stick to the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so speedy","review":"Really, the reason Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't a classic like the first one is because the speed storyline is not a bus, but a BOAT this time around. Do you really think a boat can go as fast as a bus? Even if a boat is fast, do you think that's more exciting than a bus avoiding danger in the city streets? I don't. What kind of amazing dangers can a boat avoid? OTHER boats? Ocean buoys?A bus with a bomb underneath it is more rewarding to watch. Speed 2 feels more like a way to cash in on the original. I watched the movie twice and wasn't satisfied either time. It's an okay movie, though.

In fact, at least in the IMDB listings, the only role he's EVER been nominated for (which he won) is some TV appearance in the 70's. This guy's a great actor who's been in a number of excellent films. His style is completely unaffected, never a distraction, and a pleasure to watch, MILLER'S CROSSING certainly being no exception. Would you have wanted anyone else to play Keaton in USUAL SUSPECTS? Come on...give this guy an award!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful acheivement in filmaking.","review":"This is the 90's version of a Road to Perdition I suppose. It's about the power struggles of the Mob in city, and one man who is the puppeteer of two crime bosses. Most of the performances are great, and at the time, many of the actors were virtually unknowns. I'd rank this just behind The Godfather and Goodfellas in term of prestige in the ganster genre, and above Scarface. A welcome addition to any collection, and precusor to Quentin Tarrentino's Pulp Fiction/Reservoir dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miller's Crossing","review":"The best Coen Film yet made, which puts it among the best ever made.There are more moments of genius in Miller's Crossing than one can count. The \\"Danny Boy\\" scene wherein Albert Finney establishes that he is still \\" . . . an artist with the Thompson\\" is so effortlessly grand and brutal that it rivals any scene in any film from any era.

Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, the entire cast brought a realism to their characters that is rare. The settings were so perfect and everything played off each other so well, you actually felt like you were there. Easily number two in my all time top 5 movies.

Kudos to the Coen's!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coens' best, and the genre's","review":"My Top Five Movies list is constantly changing, but Miller's Crossing has never fallen off. It is very nearly a perfect film.At this point, the gangster genre is completely hackneyed, but somehow the entire movie feels fresh and vital. Everything -- the characters, dialogue, acting, cinematography, direction -- is highly stylized and lovingly deliberate. Every shot would make a good framed photo, and every line of dialogue is quotable.Yes, everything here has been done before, but the brilliance of Miller's Crossing is that it distills, with obvious love, playful intelligence, and stunning talent, the essence of the genre. You must see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mafia Movie Since \\"Godfather\\"","review":"There's no use saying Miller's Crossing is better than Godfather. It is more nuanced, with more irony and quirkiness, but simply doesn't have the scope of that classic. Frankly, even though they are both mafia movies, it's rather like comparing apples to oranges... where the Godfather is an epic view from the top, Miller's Crossing is a morality play seen from an outsider's perspective. Where the Godfather is straightforward storytelling, Miller's Crossing has symbolic humor, multiple layers, and an intricate plot.You can watch Miller's Crossing over and again, and take something away from it every time. I would even go so far as to say it is the best thing the Coen brothers (Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother...) have ever done. In the simplest terms, it is brilliant. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing is what it seems at Millers Crossing","review":"Simpley fantastic. This movie is a masterpiece for the Coen brothers. The picture is visually stunning. The costumes and the atmosphere are wonderful. This movie is a throw back to old gangster movies and a different time. Albert Finney, John Turturro and Gabriel Bryne fill out this cast of quirky characters. The dialouge is well written and fun. Turturro gives an amazing performance as the sleazy Bernie Bernbaum. Gabriel Bryne is perfect as the cynical man behind the man. And Albert Finney is my personal favorite as Leo, an old time Boss of the cities political machine. Don't forget Steve Buschemi as Mink and The Dane. One of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's about another movie?","review":"Guys, what do you like about this movie?

Albert Finney,as Leo is a glorious stand-out--somehow I knew he would have on spats-- and his \\"come out blazing\\" scene is glorious. John Turturro is right on as a sniveling weasel, but Gabriel Byrne as Tom is a dream. All the way through the movie, I was wondering, is Tom planning all this, or is he ad libing as the needs of self preservation present themselves. I did not really know until the last scene. What a beautifully done movie. If you did not \\"catch it\\" then, you should \\"catch it\\" now. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie","review":"In my opinion, not only the best Coen brothers film, but my number one favorite movie. It is so packed with subtleties of imagery and dialogue that I notice something new every time I see it (and I try not to see it too much). For that same reason, it is a film that takes a few viewings to really appreciate. The first time I saw it I was a little overwhelmed with all the information, especially the fast-paced dialogue. I probably missed 10% of what was said. My second viewing was sheer joy, my third....you get the idea.The only negative aspect of this movie is that near the end there is an incredibly violent scene (both psychological and graphic) in Caspar's office that is too 'over-the-top'for my taste. I've gotten over it, but friends who've seen it have also complained about this scene....So the film is only 99.8% perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gangster Movie Ever","review":"All time best gangster movie.

Featuring magnificent perfomances from Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Hardin, Jon Polito and, in particular, Gabriel Byrne this wonderful gangster film is, by turns, dark, funny, violent, intriguing and with a continuously twisting plotline. Pretty much everything about it is pitched just about right. Without the extraordinary central performance by Gabriel Byrne though, it might not have been quite so impressive. How on earth did he not even get nominated for an Oscar for this performance? His Tom is world weary, heartless, complex, loyal, cunning, manipulative, attractive, repellant and both sympathetic and unsympathetic and all at the same time. Very few actors could have pulled this off with the aplomb shown by Byrne. His natural Dublin accent is an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long wait is well worth it.","review":"This film has been on many \\"needs to be on DVD\\" lists.

I knew it was meant to be a takeoff on film noir, so I didn't expect great art. Just some fun.Nope. Even with the stellar acting power of Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, this souffle falls flat. There is no -- as in NO -- plot to follow. All you see are guys dressed up like 30's mobsters, trying to talk tough and clever. But their lines aren't actually tough, and they certainly aren't clever.Halfway in, I commented to my wife, \\"It's kind of hard to follow,\\" to which she said, It's impossible. Nothing's happening.\\" We popped the DVD out at that point, and put in another movie. Maybe if I'd stuck it through to the end, some little thing would have actually happened.

Movie","review":"Reading the reviews for this movie, I came in with high hopes - which always makes it tougher in regards to being critical of a movie. However, Miller's Crossing did not even come close to meeting my expectations. I am a fan of Coen Bros. movies in general, especially O' Brother Where Art Thou, but this one left me very disappointed. The plot was extremely predictable and the dialogue was about as cliche as you can get. Very poor character development (the main character started out with an accent, but didn't stick with it?), and very little to keep me interested. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. To compare this movie with great movies like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, or Godfather is absolutely ridiculous. If you want to watch an enjoyable, well written mobster movie try Goodfellas, Scarface or the Untouchables, but completely avoid Miller's Crossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major \\"Turkey\\"..","review":"Don't waste your money on this one; probably the most ridiculous period film I've ever seen.

Knockoff","review":"This time the Coens decide to knockoff Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key. They do bring a lot of style to the project, but forget anything about substance. The film is a tiresome bore, overproduced and over-acted. Flashy and convinced of it's own significance, the film suffers from a severe case of obviousness.

This quartet, in this recording, epitomizes that understanding, that chemistry.I had a vinyl copy of Death and the Maiden by the Julliard String Quartet in the early '70's. It was remarkable then. This is even better than I remember that recording being. And I have an excellent memory. I'll be looking for more Alban Berg Quartet recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry college lecture","review":"I was a Professor for many years and hate to say anything negative about a fellow Professor, but, this is a front-of-the-class lecture that is full of information but a boring video. I appreciate his wealth of knowledge but the examples were few, the camera never moved and the basic techniques of film making were absent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flag system","review":"Nice set.

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys music."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"It's worth the price you pay to hear this beautiful singer and the fantastic duet with Andrea Bocelli in \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\".The cd is moving with expression, clear and brillant with tones and pleasing to a man's ear. It is not like other sopranos that skreetch to sing soprano. This flows with a feminine touch.My wife and I are priviledged to have fallen in love deeper when we heard \\"Time to say goodbye\\" and saw the magnificent water extravaganza at the Bellagio the night before we were wed. Yes, I prejudged the cd because her wonderful voice and duet sang to my heart the first time I ever heard ...that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful moving music that will leave you breathless.","review":"Sarah Brightman is the most wonderful singer I have ever heard, and I have heard a lot. She touches the soul with her songs and her voice. Anyone who doesn't own this cd is missing out on a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot Me Now (Let Sarah Do It...I Luuuuv Her)","review":"Yes, yes... I am a big Sarah fan and own at least 90% of her albums. This one, however, is probably the most useless of all of them. There are only two good songs on here:1) \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\": Sarah shines in her duet with Andrea Bocelli. Both deliver powerful performances.2) \\"O Mio Babbino Caro\\": Sarah is outstanding in this old classic. Though you can hear some strange noises in the background, her performance is much better than the one used in Classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've never heard anything better, this sounds good","review":"I liked this CD for a little while when I didn't know of any singers that could sing better than her. She sounds okay on songs that are written for her because they make her voice sound less breathy and thin. Her voice is \\"sweet\\" but very thin. I have heard singers who have pretty voices that aren't so dramatic and full of vibrato as some of the other reviewers complain of opera singers.Rebecca LukerDawn Upshaw (And she's a true opera singer)Hayley WestenraAnd if you think this is real classical singing or even anywhere close to classical singing listen to any decent Soprano over 16 who is classically trained and you will be amazed and how much better they are than her."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE LISTEN TO SOMETHING ELSE!!!!","review":"Brightman is not a legitimate opera singer. Her voice is tiny, thin, and breathy. If she were to sing in any opera house, she would be inaudible. Listen to real operatic sopranos like Sutherland, Nilsson, Caballé, Sills, Price, Fleming, or even Callas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Selections; Beautiful Voice","review":"I loved Sarah Brightman in Phantom of the Opera. I loved her on this cd as well. The duets with Andrea Bocelli and Jose Cura were especially well done. I liked the mix of modern compositions with more classical works. Though, I have to admit la Wally is my least favorite of the tracks. Ms. Brightman wrings the emotion out of every note on the other pieces and really invites you into the music. A powerful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Although I am a fan of Sarah's and of classical music in general, I was very disappointed with this CD. She sounds lovely, but it's boring! There are a few nice tracks, but for the most part it just doesn't hold my attention. The modern songs on the CD also aren't very good! She should stick to the dramatic songs, it's what she's best suited for."},{"rating":"2","title":"used cd just like new","review":"i bought this cd for my dad for fathers day and he loved it.he is a big fan of hers.the best part is that i bought it used for like $2 and it plays like new.Hes happy, i am happy. thanks to you amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pop singer with high aspirations","review":"Firstly I would like to say that I am not a purist. I enjoy good classical crossover artists. The key word here being \\"good\\".Ms. Brightman sings every single song with an incredibly thin, almost unemotional voice. There is no warmth in her voice that invites and welcomes you into her world, her interpertations of the songs. Rather, you are left sitting out in the cold wondering how she got signed in the first place.This CD was not, nor for that matter is any of Ms. Brightman's singing, a satisfying experience, and I suggest that if you are considering her music that you listen to a fair amount of it before purchasing to make sure that you will be able to stand her piccolo pipes often enough to warrant buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Muzak, you'll love this CD! Yuck!","review":"Do you like boring interpretations of boring songs? Do you find yourself loving music that makes you sleepy? Like Charlotte Church? Do you want to say you \\"like opera\\", but not want to listen to an actual opera? This awful CD should do the trick. If you like it, that's great. Then take it one step further and go to the opera! Buy a CD by an actual opera singer! Popera is not opera. Popera is just muzak that deludes you into thinking it's classical music. This is no more opera than Kenny G is jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is \\"Entertainment\\" not \\"Music\\"","review":"The only reason to give 2 stars to this CD is the track 1, and Andrea Bocceli. Yeah, I just love that song... Unfortunatelly, Sarah does have nice voice, but it is not even CLOSE to what \\"real classical voice\\" is about. Just listen to track 1, and wonder how Andrea manages to dominate with almost no effort, while Sarah is screaming around trying to be 'heard'. She simply doesn't have the 'power'. And singer that needs reverb... that's not a singer. People, listen to some REAL classical music before saying how this CD is \\"great\\". Especially \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" is pathetic. I still prefer the 'original' version. This all reminds me of Clayderman and people saying how great he is - jesus, it is entertainment, not the MUSIC. Shortly: it is more interesing to listen to orchestra than her voice. Sorry Sarah :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SARA BRIGHTMAN JUST DOES NOT HAVE IT!","review":"There are two words which sum up Sara Brightman: weak and bland. She is such an opera-singer wannabe but does not have the voice. She completely lacks volume and power (the orchestra drowns her out), and might I add--any sense of dramatic ability whatsoever. So why does she even attempt such operatic masterpieces as \\"La Wally,\\" and \\"O mio babbino caro\\"? These pieces only expose her vocal shortcomings. Brightman also shows us in Mozart's \\"Alleluja\\" that extesive coloratura still does not make up for lack of voice. It is so odvious that the only reason she is famous in the first place is because she was married to Andrew Lloyd Webber. But even he could not open the door to the opera world for her with her average ability. The world is full of many artists who can sing circles around this bore.To hear geniune, gorgeous operatic voices refer to Ruth Ann Swenson, Angela Gheorghiu, and Renee Fleming and many others. Now they have talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an opera singer","review":"Sarah Brightman seems to be a matter of preference. Truly talented, trained singers quabble over Brightman's voice and technique.Personally, I think she's okay. I hated her on the OCR of the Phantom of the Opera, but she has a pretty (if forgettable) voice on other songs she's sung.What bothers me most about this CD is that whether or not Brightman has a pretty or \\"good\\" voice, she is definitely NOT an opera singer. She is attempting to tackle songs that are totally not fit for her voice, thus making her sound weak, thin, and breathy. Her La Wally was pretty horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm... I Don't Get It","review":"I enjoy Sarah just as much as anyone else, but I don't get why this album is considered her BIG album. All the songs on here are EXTREMELY slow-paced, and the only one noteworthy is the live bonus track performance of \\"O Mio Babbino Caro\\", but you can get that with \\"Classics.\\" \\"Harem\\", \\"La Luna\\", \\"Dive\\", and \\"Eden\\" were MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, there are so many better things out there...","review":"I think Sarah Brightman is great for opening the eyes of people who don't like classical vocal music, but after you hear anyone else, you think... Wow, that was sooooo much better than Sarah Brightman. She has a very limited voice. Her registers are uneven and she seems unable to bring out expression in music. Why she chose to sing Alleluia is beyond me, because that song really, really shows her weaknesses. And she is not a coloratura!! For all those Sarah Brightman admirers, I beg you to try somebody that's really talented, such as Maria Callas or any of the artists other disenchanted reviewers mentioned. I guarantee you will find that they are ever so much better, and for future reviewers of this cd, just listen to something else before you say that Sarah Brightman is the angel of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten stars...","review":"This album deserves 10 stars. Together with Bocelli's Romanza, these two albums are getting the most play time in my CD player (both in the car and at home). A must for anyone's music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, Sarah!","review":"This new Sarah's aproximation to the clasical repertory (she sang classical tittles also in 'Classics') is a really good work. Here voice is beautiful and apropiate for this arias and songs. The great orchrestra and Sarah's partenaires, here José Cura (no too good) and Andrea Boccelli (simply right) help Sarah to make a very good cd, that all Sarah's fans must have.Congratulations Sarah!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A faint shadow of a singer","review":"It saddens me that Ms. Brightman feels that the classical domain is something that she can interpret. When I first listened to this C.D. it sounded like someone doing a comedy sketch of an opera singer although dressed up in what the record company clearly feels it can 'flog' to the Bocceli marketplace. This voice isn't 'clear' it's thin, small and manufactured. Her redition of the Mozart 'Alleluja' is shocking - listen to Cecilia Bartoli and you will here what it is really about. For those looking for a TRUE crystal clear vocalist, turn to Dawn Upshaw or Sylvia McNair and listen to true beauty, and not what a record company and sound desk dress up as art. If I could send it back I would - she should stick to Lloyd Webber."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIME TO SAY GOOD BYE TO PSEUDO","review":"My God who are you comparing her to if she is \\"oh so great\\"....hm..let me think...Shania Twain? Indeed, she does have a bit more voice than Shania, maybe even Celine...but c'mon people..listen to some REAL music before you go ahead and rate this garbage as an \\"Opera CD\\"...this couldn't be more PSEUDO than it is! Comparing her to Callas is like comparing some average band keyboardist to Vladimir Horowitz..how dare you? The industry shows it down your throat and u all go buy it... Yeah, it really is a great accompaniment to some \\"bubble-bath-victoria secret\\" mood...just be careful and make sure that there aren't any serious musicians around listening to you bragg your ignorant praises for \\"angelic\\" pseudo diva. There is a very VERY thick line that divides the ART and entertainment... i think it's time to say good bye to the ignorance, can't we finally agree?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah is truely *The Best*","review":"First of all, I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of all opera.. I always found the operatic voice to be too screechy. But Sarah Brightman is the one exception. When she sings, its only beautiful and I could listen forever. Don't listen to those picky reviewers who call her voice \\"diminuitive\\".. they're only comparing her to the average opera singer, and as all Brightman fans know, Sarah is far from average! The songs sung on this cd are great.. I only knew one song \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\" but ended up loving the whole cd. It's definately worth the deniro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"first track is really good","review":"If you are an opera snob, you might find the CD is a bit kitschy and some of her 'stylizing' a bit grating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outer Space?","review":"I just finished playing my newly arrived CD of \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\". I really am disappointed at the quality of the background. Many of the songs seem to have been recorded in an oil barrel or from outer space ...far outer space! The lovely, clear sound of her voice is often lost. I love listening to her so I would probably recommend this CD but only after advising people that it's not up to the quality of other recordings I have heard of her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best female voice in years to surface as she justly deserves","review":"Sara Brightman sends chills whenever the voice is heard. Unknowlingly, she was singing A.L.Webbers long before this foolish person knew of it. She has also another CD in which she sings only Webbers music (her ex-husband) . (Sara sings the music of A.L.Webber) As an introduction to \\"classic music\\" for those that do not know fine music she captivates and causes the listener to want to hear more. No vibrato in the prolonged tones makes her sound good ? No she is great. My canary goes wild when she sings and tries to emulate her. To me she is marvelous. One of the finest voices I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This lady has the most fantastic voice I believe I have ever heard! I have several of her CDs and ,like the others, this one is outstanding. I will never tire of listening to her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet like a white zinfandel","review":"I think I finally know what bothers me about Sarah Brightman, and this album. Although her voice is pure and sweet, it reminds me of my indoctrination into the world of wine.... When I first tasted a white zinfandel, I found the flavor pure and sweet. But as my tastes became more complicated, I found it to be...... goopy and sweet. Hmmmm. Sounds like a vocalist I know of."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"I am a country girl at heart definitely not a classical fan BUT I was given this CD as a gift and it has become my favorite. She has THE most incredible voice that reaches deep into my soul and brings out emotions that I didn't know were there. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to FEEL music."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars and more","review":"This is the first time I've heard her voice, believe it or not, and I was amazed.

I got this by chance and I'm glad I stumbled accross it!Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music That Touches Me","review":"There are five or six selections on this album that I just can't get enough of. I find myself playing this album over and over and not tiring of it. I have never been a fan of Opera and in particular singing by a Soprano, but Ms Brightman's performance on this album touches a very deep emotion in me. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and touching...","review":"Time to say goodbye is wonderful and touching to the mind, heart, and soul. There is nothing greater than hearing a voice of an angel before you sleep our just want relaxation. Not only does this CD sound great but it is super cheap (should cost even more) and delivered 2 days after order. So listen to the CD and feel moments and experience an unbelievable feeling just tingling through you as you listen to Sarah Brightman's album, \\"Say Goodbye.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Brightman's music is an inspiration!","review":"My 18 year old daughter was inspired to take up her voice training again after hearing Sarah's newest CD. She just won a music scholarship & we can't thank Sarah enough. We have her complete collection and share it with everyone! I am hoping your subscribers or Amazon.com can tell us where we might purchase the sheet music, with words, for the Time To Say Goodbye CD. We have been searching for it unsuccessfully for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop listening to this album","review":"Beautiful, crystal-clear voice as bright as her name. Andrea Bocelli and Sarah are exquisite. This album has completely captivated me and has convinced me that I need more of Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loove it","review":"Very beautiful and relaxing CD. Sarah is amazing as always. This is her first hit cd in the states. \\"who wants to live forever\\", \\"blitis qenerique\\", \\"naturelza muerta\\", \\"tu quieres volver\\" and of course the Title track, \\"Time to say goodbye\\" with Andrea bocelli, are all highlights of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Brightman cd is awesome.","review":"I love the cd in fact I bought two so I had one to keep and one to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy hearing this music over and over again.","review":"Kudos to Ms. Brightman whose angel-like crystal clear voice does not disappoint us in delivery or content. Lovely.

If you love her past works in opera, classical, or pop, this is another great CD. Her title song has always been popular with many added classic songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay no attention to operatic snobs","review":"By their own admission robusto sopranos are a dime a dozen and, to compare these divas with Ms Brightman's crystalline coloratura is akin to faulting a woodland sprite because she's not an eagle. Forget that her voice is more than adequate to rattle chandeliers at the farthest reaches of any opera house -- when she wants to; let's see any of the fat ladies spin out the gossamer thread of an excruciatingly delicate ballad with such purity and numinous emotion that it gently sneaks into the farthest reaches of the tenderest heart, unleashing tears and igniting waves of ecstasy along the spine. I think there's room for such rare artistry in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Listen To Some More Music Before You Review","review":"Please people listen to some real music by REAL classical performers who have the right to perform masterpieces by prolific composers such as the likes of Mozart and Puccini before you defend your point in which you claim Sara Brightman is a great singer. As If! She has no volume, no power and absolutely no sense of musical expression whatsoever. Some ignorant fools actually think this is do to mixing. Uh.. no! I saw her on PBS and really wanted to enjoy her but she was still terrible--I had to turn it off! She had no sense of animation and the orchestra STILL drowned her out. There is one word to describe her:WEAK! I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE TRULY GOOD--SUCH AS THE LIKES OF RENEE FLEMING, ANGELA GHEORGHIU, RUTH ANN SWENSON AND MANY, MANY OTHERS. Then you will see how bland and utterly overated Brightman really is! PLEASE do this for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky album","review":"It's a gimmicky album more than anything else. The voice of Sarah Brightman is so small in size and so limited in expressive range that these aren't at all enjoyable performances. In the more classical style songs, she's just not up to standard. Despite the popularity of this album, this cannot be recommended from a musical perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAAAAaaaHHHH! HORORS!","review":"Please don't buy this CD. Instead, buy something by Renee Fleming, Beverly Sills, or, if you like darker voices, Maria Callas. The 'light opera' craze is ok, except the fact that people are looking over truly great talent in favor of badly sung \\"classical type\\" songs and \\"light, angelic voices\\" that are small and tight. Just listen to a sound clip of Renee Fleming and you will see what Sarah Brightman is missing. She is missing warmth, emotion, agility, vocal color, and, if you watched her on PBS or videocassette, animation. She truly mangles classics. Just listen to Mozart's Alleluia compaired to anyone else's recording of the same song and you will see how bad of a singer she really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Puke. This CD is just another awful example of the \\"Opera Lite\\" craze. I thought Phantom was bad, but this is worse. Programming that makes no sense, that austere, white sound, boring muzak interpretations. And Bocelli's not helping anything. I will exempt Jose Cura's performance from my wrath, but the whole thing is not worth using as a coaster; you'd be better off buying a CD by one of the many talented opera singers on the market. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice from Heaven","review":"This is a showcase to the more classical side of Sarah Brightman. I'm not a classical buff and it took me awhile to appreciate Sarah but after that, I was hooked and couldn't stop listening and bought album after album of hers. I'm truly grateful to her through her duets I discovered the magnetic talents and personalities of Josh Groban and Jose Cura."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Sure Beats Listening To Charlotte Church!!!","review":"Buy this. You will not rejret it. The first song is to die for. If you like Charlotte Church, after hearing this, you wont like her anymore! Charlotte ...! Sarah rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this album!","review":"Words can describe how I feel for her music although I have only only listened to her music for a few months. She may lack the shattering show-stopping power of say Celine Dion, but her delicate tones are very appealing in its own way.My favourite in this album includes the first three tracks, Time to say goodbye where the beginning part of this song is so pleasant and nice to listen. 'No one like you' has a gentle feel to it while Just show me how to love you is simply delectable.And try listening to Naturaleza Mueta where the tempo and style of composition that will swoon you over. It is so memorizing that I keep on humming the tune of this song.There are still tracks that you will find beautiful here, so all you need is to explore and you will be able to like her songs better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series","review":"The duology of the first two books in the Spellsinger series, \\"Spellsinger\\" and \\"Hour of the Gate\\", by far eclipses the rest of the series. This book, with its stirring love stories, fantastic sights, wonderful characters, and epochal war, deserves to be counted as one of the classics of science fiction.

Whatever positive message the writers intended just gets obliterated in the dark aspects of the story. I viewed it with my 4yr old who was physically shivering (yes!) at various points of the show. When it got too much, she told me to turn it off, something she's never done when it comes to Madeline. I watched it to the end and found it confusing that Madeline is presented here as an orphan. An earlier video, Madeline's Christmas, clearly shows her papa & mama. Overall, a dismal effort in the research, writing and presentation of a Madeline story. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a disastrous episode in the Madeline chronicles. I gave this video one star only because the posting screen will not allow me to rate it zero or negative stars! The film tells the story of the orphan Madeline being kidnapped into slavery by an evil gang of lace makers. The terrifying story line left my three-year-old twin daughters blubbering in fear! Blatantly contradicts all previous storylines by orphaning Madeline. Definitely not suitable for my children, yours should approach with extreme caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who creates these things?","review":"It is shocking that movies as frightening as these are released for children.

Imagine our dismay when Madeline is kidnapped by a man posing as her Uncle and is taken to a child-labor dungeon where sick little girls are forced to weave lace with strands cut from their own hair!

Disney really lost sight of its viewing audience this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Scary, Disturbing movie","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but since this has given my son nightmares for many days now, I'm writing. My 7 year old son saw this on TV. He doesn't normally get nightmares, and he enjoys almost all cartoons. This one was really scary. It should be called \\"Madeline gets kidnapped and enslaved by abusive adults in a sweatshop in Paris.\\" First, in typical Disney fashion, Madeline's parents get killed off. I wasn't paying as much attention to this movie as I should have been, but when I tuned in next Madeline was being cornered in a dungeon by a scary women wielding a large, sharp scissors.

I found the video delightful and moving, fully in keeping with the spirit of the Bemelmans books, even with the dark, Dickensian turn the tale takes. The \\"themes\\" are believing in yourself, not giving up, and an understanding of family based upon loving, daily practice, not mindless formality. The Lauren Bacall-voiced villain *is* frightening, but not inappropriately so.

When I asked her why it was so upsetting she told me that the girl (Madeline) loses her family and friends and has to live a horrible life. I do not recommend this movie for any young child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Frightening","review":"This is a terrible video in which Madeline is abducted by a supposed \\"Uncle\\".

She is betrayed by all the adults, and even by \\"family\\" in the person of her \\"Uncle\\". My 5 year old was visibly shaken, and we fast forwarded through the last 30 minutes to Madeline's rescue.

Notice, that most of the bad reviews are written by parents with biological children, and not by parents with adopted children. Just so you know, I was seven when I watched this movie and was not scared by it, because of that I feel like an alien. I am 16 now and can notice the movie's theme, and why the reviews are bad. This Madeline story, because of its theme, is close to my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark for its audience!","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this is too dark for its intended audience.

After a longer than usual wait on my Amazon purchase I made short work of cabinet knobs and found about a dozen other projects for my super new Dremel, including buffing out some small scratches on the car. I chose this version for power and speed control and am very satisfied. The accessories are everything you need to get started. I was rather unimpressed with the owner's manual, however. A more detailed section dedicated to matching accessories with the job would be very helpful. All in all great purchase, but my order came via Target and took FOREVER. So order early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic & versitale tool!","review":"At the time, I found this set to be the best value Dremel package The people at Dremel are very friendly & helpful to talk to as well.

It can do things no other tool can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for the last chapter","review":"This is not your typical Betsy-Tacy book. Tacy and the crowd, let alone the Ray family, make no physical appearance, and Betsy suffers a bit as a character without the familiar suppporting cast. Still, the book provides a somewhat interesting travelogue of a young American in Europe just before World War I breaks out. The final chapter finds Betsy in London as the war begins and is worth reading the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book","review":"Besty is a girl that is different, she meets Joe falls in love, leaves, and then attends school.

But if you still want to read it don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Betsy and I went to Italy","review":"I have read \\"Betsy and the Great World\\" so often that I know much of it by heart. When I travelled to Italy this spring, and stepped into St. Mark's Square, I could hear the Harvard Man yelling at Betsy's \\"tourist trick\\" with the pigeons. And when I went on a gondola ride, Betsy and her Marco were in the gondola that floated by on the other side of the Grand Canal. Any author who can make her characters live so completely deserves to be read. It takes a very special young woman to understand the pleasures of a simple life well-lived, but for her, this series will provide richness and memories to last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"This goes for all the \\"Betsy\\" books","review":"When Maud Hart Lovelace first wrote the \\"Betsy-Tacy\\" seires, did she know how much so many people, from children to adults, would love them? The series has at least one book that anyone of any age can relate to. 10-year-olds will love \\"Over the big Hill,\\" high-schoolers will love the books about when Betsy was attending Deep Valley High, etc. And it doesn't end there! Even if you're not the age that Betsy was in one of the books, you can still love all of them! Maud has a way of capturing real feelings and expiriences--even bad ones--and turning them into works of art. The \\"Betsy-Tacy\\" series really is a work of art, even if it was painted with a pen, not a paint brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary","review":"\\"Following the phenomenal success of The Gay Man's Guide To Safer Sex, the need for an equally informative and frank Safer Sex Guide for gay young men was clear. With advice from the Terrence Higgins Trust based in England, this program candidly shows the practicalities of safer sex in today's threatening world. Made by and for gay young men, with striking beauty and erotic candor, Getting It Right hits the mark, delivering timely information in a breath-taking setting. Six handsome young models explicitly demonstrate safer sex techniques in a manner that eroticizes and promotes safer sex, while clearly pointing out what is not considered safe. In Getting It Right, you'll just get the facts, not the sermon.\\" - from Pride Video"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought-provoking and hard to forget.","review":"This book has been on my mind a lot since I read it. It is funny, sad, frustrating, and tragic at the same time. I admired, but hated the ending. The book was beautifully written, but, Oh, so sad! I wish things could have gone differently for Major Joccolo. He certainly deserved better. On the other hand, he takes everything well, even his final punishment. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"A Bell For Adano is heart-warming story set in an otherwise horrific period of history.Illustrating the charm of an American soldier and the filling of the voids in a war-ravaged Italian town, Hersey makes you smile and beg for more. While the tone is ethnocentric in its portrayal of the Italian vision of the Americans, A Bell for Adano is a read that I emphatically recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINMENT","review":"I read this as an assignment from our San Francisco Mechanics Institute Book Club. Hersey worked for Sinclair Lewis and his mentor's style is obvious. It is done in the same rather superficial narrative style.as Lewis' works. Admittedly, I like a novel with psychological, spiritual and symbolic aspects. A Bell for Adano does have the the overly obvious symbolism of the connection to our Liberty Bell. Basically this is a propaganda piece for W.W.II. It did have over 20 printings in a short period of time which brings to mind the expression that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American and, in this case, also British people. Despite its triteness and thin literary veneer it is an easy read suitable for an airplane ride and a 9th grade English class."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book started of slow but the end was worth the wait.","review":"This book was o.k. for a book report or panel discussion. High school kids should volunteer to read this it is based on our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Story!","review":"The story started out slow and somewhat hard to follow. Soon after the story itself picked up and became more interesting. I soon grew to realize that this story had depth and a true storyline.

I was made to read the book for school but for once, the teachers had picked a wonderful novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Man's Anne Rice .... Disappointing","review":"While the idea is a good one, Boyd's history is shaky and her story painfully predictable. If she had fleshed out the story to include the colour of the various periods in history it might be more interesting, but as it stands, it is pretty shallow. The characters and their exploits are cliche and seemed to be taken from any one of Anne Rice's Vampire books. I was disappointed in the lack of richness and detail. This one man's redemption just isn't that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed...","review":"I also was a HUGE fan of The Promise and The Passion. I had never read 2 books more engrossing and hypnotic as those books. With The Alchemist, Ms. Boyd loses a lot of the steam she had going with her first two novels. This book was boring. I kept telling myself to keep reading because I was such a fan of her Devoncroix werewolf novels that I just was expecting greatness, but it never came in this book. The descriptives are WAY too long and at some points you feel like you are almost drunk or high from the drawn out, pointless detailings. I found myself \\"reading\\", or basically just looking at words but not taking them in for almost half of this short book. The story was predictable. I knew the therapist was connected by blood from the very start. I just hope Donna Boyd comes back with her powerful, epic Devoncroix Dynasty series! This book was a huge let down. I'm sorry Donna Boyd...I loved your werewolf books, but this was just not a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lisa from Michigan","review":"After reading the Passion and the Promist(two excellent books), this book dissapointed me.

She gives excellent descriptions of how chimpanzees interact as family members, how they feel like people do - and what people can learn from them. Her book makes us readers aware of how close animals can come to how human beings feel and act, and that man is by no means far superior to animals. It also gives us an incentive to appreciate animals and to respect them. Obviously, Jane Goodall observes and then accurately narrates. Even in the shadow of man, animals develop healthy, and man needs to respect that."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I had to read this book as a book report in science (yes, SCIENCE!). We just finished learning about evolution and the teacher thought that this was a good book to read. I borrowed the book in the library and the cover, a picture of Jane following two chimps, looked unappealing and boring. The first two chapters were bad, but that's just my opinion. The rest of the book gets better, and you learn the names of the different chimpanzees and even get to know them better. This book has opened my eyes to the world of chimpanzees and has showed me that you really can't judge a book by it's cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exposed Fails to Entertain","review":"The synopsis of this film promises to be a documentary style satire of an entireview with a gay pop band. If you're expecting a clever gay version of Spinal Tap, you'll be very disappointed. The film is nothing more than three guys recounting their sexual encounters, which of course provides an excuse to show a series of sex scenes. What you have is actually a porno film that fails to deliver any gratification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Okay... I loved \\"No, no, no\\" and I just KNEW that the rest of the album was going to be the bomb. But when I heard it, it was very safe to say that it was very disappointing. I loved the group before I heard the album- but now I view them as just another one hit wonder girlie group. They have a lot of talent- but they need to get better songs. Support them if you wish- but I don't highly suggest it. I was more impressed by the \\"No, no, no\\" single that I was with the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music is inspiring.

It just shows how easy it is to make and replace a crappy pop group. It shows how easy it is to make these silly POP bands. If two members of Metallica left people would have a hell of a hard time adjusting to the new people and the band wouldn't be the same but for crappy POP bands all you need is another pretty face that can sing. Oh and the songs like Bills Bills Bills, Bug a Boo, Say My name grow tiring so quickly after a month or two.

The vocals are exceptional, and all the songs aren't bad, but most of them are. Highlights are \\"Second Nature\\", \\"No,no, no (1 and 2)\\" and \\"Bridges\\", but when only 4 of the songs suceed to tickle my fancy, you just haven't done your job. The girls harmonize well on this album, and it's not all Beyonce all over the background. And on leads, her voice sounds pure, and not all overproduced and hollering. This was in no way special, but I've heard worse. They've gotten a lot better, and I was a fan when this cd came out when I was nine, but now I'm a die hard fan. They get a \\"B\\" for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uptempo songs are fantastic, but slow songs not as good","review":"I loved Destiny's Child the minute I heard a bit of the \\"No, No, No\\" video. But I usually end up skipping through at least half the songs on the album. \\"No, No, No\\" parts I & II, \\"With Me\\" parts I & II, and \\"Illusion\\" are very danceable and these women's voices are beautiful. Harmonies are great and the fast songs really make you want to sing along.Their voices didn't seem to be used as well on the slower songs. The arrangements didn't compliment their talents as well as on the faster songs, the backings (bass, synthesizers, etc.) were unimaginative, and overall, they just seemed flat and overly sentimental.After listening to this album many times and always skipping over so many songs, I'm wishing they'd released a shorter album with only about 5 of these songs instead of the full-length one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!!!","review":"These girls can sing but it would be nice in a while to hear them sing something new besides \\"NO, NO, NO.\\" I have listend to the rest of their CD and it was a big disapointment to what I had expected it to be. Most of their songs are really dull and not very good. I think they should work on the lyrics to their songs and think about what messeage they want to send out to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD ain't all that","review":"All the girls from Destiny's Child have great voices.

It could've been great if it weren't for a few tracks \\"With Me II\\", and \\"Illusion\\". The album didn't need those filler tracks. The ballads were great especially \\"Tell Me\\", \\"Killing Time\\", and \\"Second Nature\\". They really shined with their first single and the rest was history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful","review":"This album is amazing. There is only one song that I hate, and that is...With Me Pt.2.The best songs in my opinion are:Second NatureIllusionSail OnNo, No, No Pt.1Killing TimeThese songs showcase the talents of these four incredible women.

Is just one word I could use to describe the sometimes mental piece of plastic that is this Crocketts CD. From the soft twangs of such audio majesty as 'Survival of the Prettiest' to the less subtle trailblazings of 'Lucifer' this album was born to satisfy. Satisfy it does, and then some. Not often will such a quirky album be worth your dollarage, but this is well warranted, and will give you kudos from your friends for having weird UK music that is not the Beatles. Do it, buy it, you will be popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Condition","review":"I am very pleased with this book.

Honestly I love that song Degenerated. Which is the song they play in the movie. Its awesome and worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie!","review":"Velvet Goldmine requires a special kind of watcher. Despite what commercials or reviews about the movie say, it is about the life style of 1970's bisexual glam rocker, Brian Slade. Christian Bale play's a reporter ordered to discover why Brian Slade staged his own death. If you can get over the swearing, men in makeup, and gay sex, it is an utterly amazing movie. I would completely recomend it to anyone who loved Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge haters...stay away. Oh, the voices are off on the DVD, but you have to give them a break..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls a Bit Short","review":"The premise is a great one. Brain Slade, star of glam rock fakes his own death then vanishes with the scam is revealed. Ten years later he becomes the focus of a \\"whatever happened to\\" story being done by a reporter who sets out to find him.Unfortunately the execution of this idea falls a bit flat. The look of the movie is great with an excellent eye for glam era period detail. The performances, particularly from Ewan McGreggor (whose character is clearly modeled after Iggy Pop) and Toni Colette (as Slade's wife) are first rate and, at least at first, the \\"Citizen Kane\\" references are very sharp and entertaining.But this is a movie, despite all its best efforts, cant quite add up to the sum of its parts. The script fails to fully involved and after a while the \\"Citizen Kane\\" allusions become tiresome and come across as self important.Not a bad movie, but far from a great one. Overall 2 and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast - interesting premise - falls flat","review":"A good cast and an interesting premise should make for a good movie - not quite in this case. Somehow all the parts just don't quite come together and the end result is a long tedious movie. I think this film ran longer than the glam fad of the 70's did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I have a quest. I'm a huge fan of Ewan McGregor, so I want to see all of his movies. I was pretty excited to see Velvet Goldmine because I heard it was good. Sadly, I was misinformed. Maybe it's because I'm not into glam rock or something, but nothing about this movie really did it for me. I thought it was rather dull, actually. I expected McGregor, as the top-billed actor, to have a larger role, and while I did see a lot of him (all of him, in fact... wink, wink), I wanted to know more about his character and see more of his performance.In general, I found this movie lacking. There wasn't enough plot to keep me interested, and the music wasn't good enough to keep it going for me. I thought this movie was rather blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"All That Glitters is Not Gold","review":"As an Artist, Filmmaker, and music fan who experienced Glitter (now called Glam) Rock firsthand, I was greatly disappointed. The film is not intended to be historically accurate, and that is the only thing good that can be said- it achieved a great level of inaccuracy. The Bowie and Pop characters are so thinly veiled that they become parodies rather than representations of the time. Trust me folks- Glitter was not this shallow. The acting is wooden, the representation of the era laughable, and the original music for the film was horrible. The only good thing I can say about this film is that it used many Eno, Roxy, Pop and Reed songs. Forget Velvet Goldmine- buy the original albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought but the music's good","review":"As a big bowie/t.rex glam fan I was excited to see this film, but I have to say I was very disappointed.First, it's TOO LONG (and I fast forwarded through probably 15-20 minutes combined). It's VERY melodramatic and there's little if NO PLOT. Jeez, Mr. Director, PLEASE stop the annoying slow motion segements - especially the bad love scenes - there is no depth to this movie! Also, for a movie set in the 70's, why cast a Kurt Cobain lookalike in a main role? They may as well as had him wearing a T-shirt that said \\"think about me, kurt cobain and 90's grunge\\" in every scene. The plot twist that the film ends on should have been the main story...instead, it's never developed.I did like the main character, so it's too bad that the rest of the characters are either, overwrought, shallow, or lack development (except the girlfriend who was also good). The music is the only reason I don't give it one star. It's good even if the movie isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like to thank...","review":"This film owes a lot to Roger Daltry and the Who, Jim Morrison and the Doors, Ken Russell, and even Orson Welles. There is nothing original about this -- derivitive is too much of a compliment. Yes, three of the four leads do a fine job -- I exempt Bale -- Toni Collette is fine as always, but otherwise -- don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've suffered through this movie, don't watch it...","review":"First, let me say that Eddie Izzard's Dress To Kill performance in San Francisco is the funniest one-man/stand-up routine EVER in the history of human comedy performance.With that said, one fellow Izzardite suggested watching Velvet Goldmine. It was, by far, one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen. The plot was mirky, the direction was terrible, and I don't even remember who Eddie Izzard's character was (I've blocked it from my memory).Skip this piece of crap and buy Eddie Izzard's Dress To Kill on DVD or VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge Eddie Izzard fan and I rented this video because he was in it. Unfortunately he is only in the movie for about a combined total of 30 minutes. I thought the plot was very difficult to follow and at times, incredibly boring. I was seriously disturbed by the excessive nudity and rampant homosexual scenes. I couldn't even finish watching the film because I was so disgusted. This film was definitely not what I expected from Eddie Izzard and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This falls into my list of my top 5 movies of all time","review":"The movie Velvet Goldmine is an amazing movie as far as I am concerned. I didn't like it the first time I watched it. But I sat down and watched it again, and for some reason it clicked when I saw it that second time. It was probably because of a combination between the beautiful cinematography, and the equisitly wonderfull and trippy story. I felt that the movie was one of the more artistic movies that I have seem lately and I am really glad that it had more than an arthouse appeal. Btw: Bowie Rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best film I've ever seen!","review":"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't the greatest movie I've seen in a while. Ewan McGregor is my favorite actor. I think he's a genius. Jonathan Rhys-Myers is just as good in this movie though. It was well put together, and had a great plot. It kind of made me think of a certain glam rocker from about that time. (David Bowie-AKA:Ziggy Stardust) I would recomend this to anyone, because it's a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rich and Electric movie!","review":"This movie tells the story of British glam rock in the early seventies and you will notice the main character has a definite David Bowie look. The story is colorfully told with great actors and music. I think everyone should try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those gay guys can sure rock.","review":"Yeah it's about Gay guys, get over it because many influential artists of our time have done it with another man. I'm not gay (Maybe just not trendy).......but this movie rocks if you can find it in your fathers genes to set asside the whole, Gay thing. You have to own this trip into what makes music and film a necessary bind. Both the music and the narration don't seperate themselves and play along side of one another, rather the music consistetly weaves the narration creating a Rock'n'Roll, Sex and drugs explosion with complex characters and a kickass soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good casting and wardrobe.....that's it!!!","review":"I had such high hopes for this movie! Glam Rock! Bowie! Iggy! But, all I got was a attempt at Citizen Kane that went absolutely nowhere! With all the glowing reviews on this page I can't help but wonder if they saw the same movie.

She recommended that I rent it to see the beautiful boys in make-up. Well, this weekend I finally decided that I would rent it after much thought about whether I would like it or not. I have to say I loved it. I watched four times in two days! It's the music, the plot, the actors, the cinematography, it's got it all! Although, I was not born when Glam Rock was alive (unfortunaly) watching this movie reminded me of today's fashion and rock scene. The hippie coats, platforms, and glitter. Great film, but how could Haynes go wrong with a story about hot, bi-sexual boys wearing make-up! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jonathan ryhs meyer...ewan mcgregor...wow","review":"this movie was really good.

As for this ambitious failure, it does a good job re-creating the \\"glam rock\\" era, though that's not a particularly interesting period in rock history (despite the nice costumes). But I have to admire any movie that rips off \\"Citizen Kane\\". Ewan MacGregor makes an impression as \\"Curt Wilde\\" (Iggy Pop?), but I never really got hooked by the whole story of \\"Brian Slade\\" (David Bowie?). Still, it's always a treat to see the lovely Toni Collette."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it 2 stars, 1 for subject matter and 1 for effort","review":"Those who actually grew up during the original glam peak and followed it closely, generally don't like this movie. I give it a positive review for content and effort, but the movie is deeply flawed . Any attempt at bringing a sense of what it was like during the reign of Iggy, Reed, Bowie, Mott, Roxy, Eno, etc. deserves at least one star for subject matter. The movie's flaw is primarily it's heavy handed anger toward David Bowie for not participating in this \\"glam fantasy\\". Bowie wisely sidestepped this film. It may come as a surprise to some, but just as the Beatles terrific music was the catalyst for what made their accompanying cultural impact possible; so, too, was the brilliant music of those mentioned above (particularly Bowie)that which made \\"glam\\" possible- not the other way around. I remember it well. Ironically, in fact, many who thought the music was the best they'd ever heard, completely turned off to visual/cultural subtext."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did Anyone Get Away With This","review":"Todd Haynes should have been massively sued by the rock stars hedepicts in this film as \\"ficticious characters\\". C'mon, it's clear that Kurt Wild is Iggy Pop and Brian Slade is David Bowie, and his \\"Maxwell Demon\\" personna is clearly Bowie's Ziggy Stardust period. These character even perform music from the guys they are supposed to be. I think the ficticious artists should have performed original songs only that were written for the film. The other thing that bothers me is that the whole glam period is depicted mostly as a \\"gay thing\\", and all the male characters are shown frequently hopping into bed with one another. The inclusion of some other great music in the soundtrack (Roxy Music,T. Rex, Eno, Lou Reed)while all cool, kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth, feeling like a great disservice was done to the memory of some of my favorite artists in their prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewan McGregor-Christian Bale....ooohhh yeah!!","review":"I'm sorry, if they gave me a choice to give zero stars, I would. This was the most messed up movie I have ever seen. I love Ewan and Christian and I was excited to see that they made a movie together, but I wasn't expecting TOGETHER! You have to be either an alcholic or seriously stoned to even find a story line in here. True, seeing Ewan and Christian in the full monty caught my attention, but that's about the only part that did. I gave it a chance by watching the whole thing, but it just got stupider and more confusing (which didn't make any sense because I didn't understand any of it from the begining). If I was you, stick with American Psycho and Trainspotting, they are both still messed up, but at least they make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"This movie is so bad I felt like being sick. It tells the story of Brian Slade (a.k.a \\"Maxwell Demon\\"), a glam rock star in 1970s Britain who subsequently fakes his own death, and the journalist who tries to track him down 10 years later in the mid-1980s. All you need to know about the plot is that it is an unapologetic rip-off of the Ziggy Stardust/David Bowie story.The best things about this film are: 1) the fashion, 2) the Jack Fairy character (partly based on Brian Eno, I think), and 3) the Roxy Music, Brian Eno, and Steve Harley tunes. Unfortunately, the music written specially for the film is utter\\"ly \\"bad\\". ...what kind of a name is \\"Maxwell Demon\\"? A ridiculous one, if you ask me. Anyway, as a fan who got turned on to Bowie, Roxy Music, Kraftwerk, Japan, and the whole glam-punk-goth-New Romantic movement as a young teen circa 1984, I had hoped for something a lot better. Sadly, it was not meant to be. This film fails to deliver in a major way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble effort, ultimately a waste of time","review":"This movie has a nice premise, but the flashback narration idea is old and over-used.

Todd Hayens directs the film with lots of zooms and rapid cuts, which thankfully distract from the poorly scripted events that the cast seem to be forced through.Also the dialog was really bad. Christan Bale shouting \\"thats me that is\\" and concert hecklers yelling \\"get off you wooftah\\" both made me cringe like i was sucking a lemmon.With a better script this could have been a moden classic but as it is, its a badly written David Bowie/Citzen Kane hybreed.AVOID AT ALL COSTS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of the whole \\"70 Glam\\" era.

A worthy buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling!","review":"Velvet Goldmine, the movie loosely based on the life of Glam Rock God, David Bowie, is a wonderful portrayal of the entire glam rock era. The story follows reporter Arthur Stuart(Christian Bale) in a search for the singer Brian Slade(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who had faked his own death years before. As the life of Brian Slade is revealed, the viewer is taken to the world of glam rock's finest days in London. Curt Wild(Ewan McGregor) is an American singer that infactuates, and eventually brings down Slade. To give away any more would be to spoil the film, so let me just say that this is one of the best movies i've ever seen and I very highly reccomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!... Mr. Blinky goes to Brown Town","review":"That is what the movie title should have been. I cannot communicate how resentful I feel that this movie stole my time. In the opening scene, an alien vessel deposits an infant Oscar Wilde on the doorstep of his \\"to-be\\" parents along with a green pin. When Oscar reaches preteen age, he declares in class that he wants to be a \\"pop star\\". It was at this point that I should have turned the movie off, because it only got worse. Flash forward a hundred years to the main character of the story who now has the pin. I believe in giving the writer lee-way, but come on!! Is he trying to tell us that artisitic gay men were deposited and/or watched over by aliens? After 20 minutes, I fast forwarded over most of the movie- except for the parts with Ewan McGregor- that was another mistake! I could go on, but I won't waste anymore of my life on the stupid flick. If I could give it negative stars I would. Do yourself a favor and buy Moulin Rouge (2001) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird - Strange - Don't Bother","review":"I showed this DVD to several of my friends last weekend. We were all expecting a fantastic experience considering all the great reviews this movie received. Boy, were we disappointed! The music is overbearing. The plot - extremely thin.

Being a fan of Bowie and Eno, and having read good reviews of it, I was anxious to see this film. However, after watching it, I wondered what movie those reviewers who gave it all those stars had seen? It certainly wasn't this sad, bleak,, wretched mess of a film! The plot is completely awful, leaving some fine actors looking mighty foolish as they trudge their way through that godawful dialogue! If I were Bowie, I would hunt down those responsible for this abomination and beat them to DEATH with a platform shoe! Do not waste your time on this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cave In The Mine","review":"What does space aliens, Oscar Wilde and glam rock have in common? Absolutely nothing! And that is what this movie is worth. Yet the director tries to make you believe they are related in this story.The music didn't merit listing to and the same goes for much of the dialogue. Too many \\"flashbacks\\" for both of the major characters made the movie seem disjointed. It starts out in the 1800's then jumps around the 1950's, 60's, 70's and 80's.Put this on your \\"Do Not Buy\\" list. Don't even waste your time renting it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Velvet Goldmine...Good movie...but gets lost in cheesiness","review":"Ok, now I'm a HUGE Ewan McGrego fan, but I didn't like this movie all that much.

The movie isn't supposed to be a historically accurate. \\"The ages live in history thru their anachronisms\\" (Oscar Wilde). The movie is \\"a work of pure fiction\\", and if you try to degrade it into fact, you're missing the beauty of it. It's a fairy tale. Glam rock, Oscar Wilde, etc... are merely vehicles for it to play out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye candy, ear candy, mind candy","review":"Beautiful and appealing on all levels. Ewan McGregor as Curt Wild on stage is brilliant and breathtaking. A very beautiful screen kiss between Brian and Curt (\\"The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold.

You either love it or you hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of my lifetime","review":"Velvet Goldmine is the best movie I have ever seen. Even homophobics could benfiet from such a film.

I have always loved the glam-rock era, the costumes, the music.....IT TOTALLY ROCKS!!!! I rented it and have watched it over and over for the past 5 days, and I am definitely getting a copy for myself!!! Ewan does the vocals in a few songs and is totally amazing!!!!

I was actually surprised by that as I tend to prefer classics. The cinematography is absolutely amazing! I loved this movie the first time I saw it as a beautiful piece of fluff... but everytime I watch I notice more and more details. The story and the acting are the \\"best of the lot\\" to quote Brian Slade. And to really have fun... watch the transfer of Oscar Wilde's pin from one performer to the next. I only wish they would release a second soundtrack with more of the music from the film on it! Visually and musically and emotionally, this film is #1. Watch it and dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MUSIC AND 70'S KITSCH","review":"Don't expect a fully comprehensible plot, or that you're going to become well-acquainted with the characters, who stay as ambiguous as their respective sexualities. What you will get is an amazingly alluring portrait of glam-era London and some great music (any movie that kicks off with Eno's great \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye\\" deserves special praise). Ewan MacGregor is smashing as the Kurt Cobain-Iggy Pop hybrid Curt Wild. MacGregor and Christian Bale have a sex scene, imagine that! \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" is shallow, but nevertheless great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glitter roxx","review":"The only reason I saw this film was because one of my best friends is a raging Ewan McGregor fan. If you don't feel comfortable with some homosexual moments, you'll squirm through this movie, but if you're more open minded, you'll love it. This movie has an incredible soundtrack, songs that will get stuck in your head, but you won't mind. So far I've rented this movie approximately 25 times, so I'm glad the cheaper version is coming out April 4, 2000. If you are solely seeing the movie for Ewan, you might be a little disappointed, he isn't in it as much as he could be, and in the end he looks distressingly like Kurt Cobain, but he's still a hottie.

But this movie isn't as enduring as The Hustler, and you will grow more tired of it than you would think possible on first view.

They have the best ferret harnesses for the best price. Fast shipping too! I bought a green and blue harness from them a few months ago. I agree with the other review on here. It is kind of an orangy-pink which I don't mind too much. I have a girl ferret and a male ferret and will be getting another male ferret. The male I have now fits perfectly into the harness with room to grow. My female ferret doesn't fit into hers. She's very petite. It's okay though I just cut it and took a little section out and sewed it back together. Works great! They don't have smaller harnesses so I didn't worry about sending it back.

I'm also 5'8'' and think the length of it is great. I didn't think it would make much of a difference (it is on carpet anyway), but it did.

The amount of reprinted material can be annoying if you already have it, but the book does a fair job updating domains and prestige classes.Some other highlights include:-New and enhanced regional feats which distinctly outshine their prior counterparts.-New deity specific feats and spells.-Nice deity info-time line updates-Some comprehensive feat lists and region bonus updates-Artwork better than Wizards seemed to have been trending towards.It's a questionable buy because of its sparse content and high price. Unlike the packed FRCS (Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting) which was a great example of an awesome amount of material in a solid package, this product feels rushed and hardly the comprehensive resource that it is billed as. Try and skim it before you decide to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it should be","review":"I bought this book because I skimmed through the first section, where it updates regional feats and requirements, and the chapter on Faerunian updates. I thought that this was a solid book, though a tad overpriced (something we've all become unfortunately used to). When I read the whole thing, I wish that I hadn't taken the time to buy it. Which is why I'm writing this, to try to warn you, the reader, to not waste your time and money. As other reviews have stated, the filler information in this book is weak and unnecessary, without any real meat that I can actually use in my campaign. I have subsequently ignored all the information in this book and continue to use the FRCS as is, making the 3.5 updates as I go, without a thought towards this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"This book is short and provides only a minimal amount of information for readers.

If you can find these, snap them up. This one in particular is a fine example of NY Phil under Toscanini. The recording quality is really about the same as the NBC 8H recordings, if not better, and the orchestra is better. This is a great way to get the legendary 1936 Beethoven seventh. I don't remember a reissue of the Brahms Variations. Toscanini simply lets the piece unfold naturally. With a Rossini overture, the Traviata prelude, and Act 3 Lohengrin prelude, this is a great program of some of the master's favorites. The NBC Symphony collection is fine, too.Buy them all.

Understanding the limitations of these recordings, I still would give FOUR STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero chemistry","review":"Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, \\"Talk of Angels\\" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my two hours back please?","review":"I absolutely adore Vincent Perez. I think he's an amazing actor, I love some of his other work and he ain't too bad on the eyes, if you know what I mean...(See La Reine Margot and Indochine!) However, this movie was a drag. I am an avid movie fan, but this was the first time I had ever really noticed the effects of bad casting and NO on-screen chemistry. Nilch. The scenery was beautiful and the cast had great potential, but the weak script, underdeveloped storyline, and the director's awful attempt at the occasional \\"artsy\\" camera shot drove me nuts.

The writing style had that cumbersome approach of much older 'how to' books. In fact the book is a reprint of another book called \\"The Seven Laws of Folds\\", and I suspect it was orignally a book meant for sculptors. The examples are charcoal(?) drawings. Most of well known statues. The descriptions really don't seem to apply to drawing at all. I tried looking through the eyes of a would-be sculptor while I read. Only then did the book seem useful.Unfortunately, I have another complaint. The example sketches are, well, terrible. Many of them I could not make out. There are photographs in the book as well that are so badly reprinted I really have no idea what they're sposed to be.There needs to be a better book to help people draw 'the draped figure.'

Worth the price. The interface is a bit clunky, since everything has to be input using the little joystick on the front, but aside from that... no complaints. It locks onto satellites pretty fast, navigation works great (if you've loaded routable maps), and the display is readable all the time. I've used the navigation function outside the US in Central America, with no problems.The only part that's a bit off is the elevation measurement. You can expect to be 20-30m off most of the time, which is a general flaw present in most GPS units, caused by the angle of the locked on satellites. If you need more precise elevation, I suggest you look into the Vista HCx which has a barometric altimeter.

The battery compartment is self sealed, which I'm assuming keeps water, dust etc out. It is very easy to use and very intuitive. Lots of options for customization. Garmin wants you to buy expensive maps for this, don't. Go to gpsfiledepot.com and read a tutorial for how to get free, legal maps onto your gps. That'll save you hundreds of dollars.

It's very off beat, but if you approach it with an open mind you are in for an enjoyable experience. Gary Farmer does an outstanding job in this movie, and gives a performance that makes you laugh and cry (sometimes at the same time). A Martinez plays his role with perfection and shows the frustration we all feel at times.

Although the look of some of the secondary characters is a little bit dated, and although the tone feels a little more paranoid to me then it did ten years ago, it still rings true. Gary Farmer gives a heartbreaking performance as a man-child trying to find his way, and an early powerful performance from Graham Greene easily catches the viewer off guard. Even though I had seen this film years ago, somehow his part had slipped from my mind, and I found myself near tears as watched this future great ratchet the emotional level of the movie to a higher place."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sweet little film","review":"This film does not displace any other film about the general subject, inluding the beautifully filmed Dances With Wolves.

The Kung Fu fight scenes with the Mummie/mummies were embarasing to say the least. The Rap music played while convicts walked through the desert and the metal music played during the action(?)scenes was the most horrorfying thing about this turkey. As for the guy who was paid to do not much but laugh, one would have to conclude that he knew that the joke was on the audiance.

The storyline/screenplay was bad, the editing was bad, the acting was bad, the action scenes were shocking - some of those punches didn't even connect! And when we finally see one of the mummies, you can actually see the actor's lip/tongue beneath the mask!!I can find not one redeeming feature and I sat through 70-odd minutes waiting for one! I think it was a good idea (maybe a redeeming feature, but already done so well in 'From Dusk til Dawn') that just did not work.Terrible, terrible, terrible.

I could have videotaped something better in my back yard -- and, by the way, be ready for that actuality because it looks like videotape and not film. \\"Badly acted\\" doesn't even come close in this flick. Folks, the only reason I'm giving this one 2 stars instead of one is because the genesis of this film came from Agatha Christie. I've read everything she's written and I don't think she'd be proud of this cobbled-up, aimless mess. Unless you absolutely must own everything of \\"Christie\\", I suggest that you skip this one and go for the old B&W Miss Marple Series (which was great!).

Second, let's talk music. One OK remix of Sleep, which is a great song, but is not made any better by the remix, and two remixes of Tears From The Moon, which is my all-time favourite song, but the two remixes just KILL it.

Lately, I'm into reading about pretentious, NYC mommies, their nannies and their spoiled kids so this book seemed perfect. The sad thing is that this book couldn't even meet my low expectations!

Don't waste your precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this book but it failed to deliver. The characters were poorly developed and none of them felt like real people to me, not even the main character. The writing was transparent - I was never carried away by the story. I was always painfully aware I was reading a story about imaginary people. I expected intelligent writing and this was not.

The first half of the movie -- about a boy and horse shipwrecked on a small island -- is basically a silent movie. It is a story of friendship and trust that is told without the benefit of dialog. Deschanel's wonderful cinematography conveys both the island's beauty and Farley's storytelling without becoming maudlin or trite. The still photography alone brings to mind Adams, and the haunting score is near perfect for the occasion. The second half of the film reverts back to a formulaic Nerd-wins-Girl, or in this case, Boy-and-Horse-Win-Big-Race, but the performances are superb and the movie never patronizes to its adult viewers. Predictable ending aside, The Black Stallion is an awesome, visual masterpiece masquerading as a children's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Review","review":"I ordered this movie because I remembered the feeling I walked away with when I viewed this movie. I wathced this movie when it was first released on tv back in the 1980's. I was old enough to remember the boy with his horse on the beach and how they needed eachother to survive through an ordeal. The undying and unconditional love and respect the boy and horse have for eachother is tremendous! The boys curiousity about the black brought them together in a series of events that were meant to be. The boy Alec, and his horse, the black are an example of Alexander the Great and his horse! I disliked the fact that the boy lost his father but other than that the movie is great to share with little members of the family as well as the big members of the family. A really good movie for inspiration and courage!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese bootleg?","review":"One star is for the quality of the DVD I received. The movie gets five. Amazon customer service gets five.Received the DVD in packaging with different design than pictured on website. The disc itself was printed with a very basic, one color, title. I've seen this movie dozens of times, so it was immediately clear that there was something wrong with this DVD. The colors of the movie are all washed out and some of the scenes look like they're cut differently. A quick comparison with the version on Netflix streaming confirms this. It may not make such a difference to the casual viewer, but we returned it. Fortunately, Amazon refunded us without making us send it back.

Excellent children's movie for a thoughtful child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Farley's Black Stallion","review":"If you have never read the book, you may like this movie. It is good...as a movie. But as an adaptation it fails miserably. Aside from having the same name and the same characters and the basic story line (boy gets marooned on desert island with wild horse, takes horse back to NY, horse is fastest in the world) this film has nothing to do with the book. Having just read the book with my son I found that the changes made in the film to the story were not only bad but unnecessary.

Every horse book I've read with a boy in it is HORRIBLE. And in this movie, he is so weird I don't even know what the ending was(I didn't finish watching it). Now, Phantom Stallion, or Black Beauty(I haven't watched the movie, I just read the book.) those are good books because they're not about a BOY and a horse.

Since this said it was for beginners I thought it would be a good fit. WRONG!!!! The guy goes through the poses so quickly that you can't figure out what you are supposed to be doing, not only that but when they say to do something with your left arm, he is doing it with his right which made it harder for me to figure out. The camera angles are also not helpful as they will show the top half of the body leaving you to try and figure out what the heck is going on with his feet. What a disappointment. I stopped halfway through because it just got too frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax & Restore","review":"I agree with the other review about T'ai Chi - he goes too fast and doesn't instruct well.

Can't say this is a winner for the series. Mildly amusing on the first listen, this album becomes quickly tiring due to a combination of weak or very lame track selection (ie. \\"Ow Much!\\" by Creature, \\"Have You Seen Her?\\" by Chi-Lites, \\"Little Fishy\\" by Thomas Fehlmann, and \\"Barbie Girl\\" by Electric Chairs are all horrible) on the part of Alex Paterson. The only two [relatively] decent tracks are \\"Blue Calx\\" and \\"You Don't Fool Me\\" by Joachim Spieth. The mixing leaves a lot to be desired also.

It portrays this martial art as a beautiful, yet effective, fighting style.

What started with a scuffles ends in a brutal war between Dacascos and the drug lord and his minions. No fighter flick fan should go without seeing this movie.

It has a cool plot (bad guy rules city, good guy comes and kicks bad guys [rear]) and the capoeira is extremely fascinating and authentic.

Delivery came 3 weeks earlier than expected!! No flaws, no hiccups, I'm very impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll enjoy it if you go in both eyes open","review":"This is not a great movie. Everyone is a stereotype, and everyone takes their role in this movie waaaaaay too seriously. The plot is as believable as an oral bowel movement. But is it enjoyable? **YES!!!**I love this movie so much it's absurd. The overacting, the improbable story, the ridiculous wardrobes, it's everything that made the late 80s/early 90s great. And then, to top it all off, the martial arts are incredible. In fact the movie merely acts as a vessel for capoeira in the same way a plate is the vessel for a dinner. This move highlights capoeira in a way that is not plausible at all to the layman, but any traditional martial artist will recognize, as a way to improve lives.The movie is lovable in the same way Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is lovable, in a completely ridiculous way. Don't expect a great movie, just an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caporeia: The Ultimate Martial Arts","review":"Ex-special Forces soldier Louis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns to Miami to find his former high school overrun by drugs and violence. A master of the Brazilian martial art of capoeira, Stevens pledges to straighten out a dozen of the school's worst students by teaching them this demanding and highly disciplined fighting style. Slowly, his program begins to work, giving the students new hope and purpose. But the local drug lord, himself a martial arts expert, vows to srop Stevens' positive influence. Now Stevens must fight to save his own life, as well as the lifes of his rebelliouis young students. COMMENTS: Stevens plays capoeira with elegance and precision. It is good to see him playing this fighting style. Also,he has a cheerful face and this adds to make this DVD enjoyable to watch. I wish there are more movies on capoeira. It seems this is the only one, with the exception of a short depiction in Jean Claude Van Damme's \\"Blood Sport\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Axe camaradas!","review":"This is a charming movie with a stupid storyline like those seen in most martial arts movies. But hey, the point is to see the hero beat the bad guys with some sweet moves, right? And this movie delivers just that. So why bother analysing it any deeper?Mark Dacascos plays a young capoeirista (a guy who practises capoeira) who gets some misfit students onto the right side of the law by teaching them capoeira. Of course this leads to some showdowns between him and various criminal elements. And that's it, really. But capoeira is a beautiful sport to watch, and the movie is a good teaser for the real thing.But Dacascos isn't really a capoeirista, and the movie misinterprets some of the basic elements of the sport. If you become interested in learning more after watching the movie, look up the nearest capoeira club in the phonebook and try it for yourself. I guarantee it will be an experience well worth your while! I speak from personal experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Star Movie, but the DVD is 2","review":"Where are the special features of this movie? I remember seeing a featurette on TV, why didn't they include that? 20th Fox just slaps the movies on the DVD with no effort and thinks that's ok! Well they are lazy and could have done better. The Reality is we are in the \\"21st\\" century and DVD has many capabilities to take advantage of. A documentary about capoeira and interviews could have been nice. I hope to see more Capoeira movies with a good storyline. This is a must for your martial arts collection seeing that there aren't many capoeira movies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Known Action Classic","review":"Mark Dacascos never really made it big as an action star for whatever reason. However he did seem to have the needed requirements: minimal acting chops, a ripped body, and the ability to do some amazing fight scenes. The last reason is what makes this movie a little known action classic. The movie is completely average, except the amazing kicks & other athletic moves preformed mostly by Dacascos. The best part of the fight scenes however is the fact that they don't look completely fake. With movies today they use so many wires & special effects that they leave whatever sense of reality the movie had previously maintained behind. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes old school action flicks. If you like this movie you will probably like \\"Drive\\" another little known classic featuring Dacascos. \\"Double Dragon\\" is another movie worth mentioning of his, but only because it was one of the first movies based on a videogame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martial arts to a dance","review":"I love this Brazilain technique looks imposible. this is one of my all time favourite movie. good thing is it actually has a story line to it, it doesn't go straight to fighting.

BETTER than any Asian form!","review":"The action sequences in this film were unlike I have ever seen. Those Brazilian martial arts and their ability to flip their bodies beautifully andartfully in the air is unsurpassed in other *typical* martial arts films, (Chan movies, etc.). The only thing I thought was odd about the story, was Orlando Olivera's cousin Silverio. He was the main drug lord and gang boss, who crossed swords with Stevens (Dacascos). What are the odds that Silverio would know the same martial art as Stevens? In addition, why didn't Orlando, Silverio's cousin and troubled student, tell Stevens that his cousin knew Capeiora also?! I mean, wouldnt' Orlando rather learn from his cousin first? Hmmm, seems kind of strange. Nicely done and executed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction","review":"Years ago I woked at a bookstore and had a customer request a book on Capoeira. I was intrigued by what I read, and wanted to see how it was performed.I found info about this DVD online when I looked for an mp3 for the \\"Mazda\\" Zoom song & discovered it was a (badly mangled) version of one of the songs from this video.So this is my first time seeing the actual art...the story-line sounds hokey, but it works because everything is beautifully choreographed by Frank Dux. It was a great introduction to an art form that is still little-known in the US.My husband and I have watched it twice already tonight, it's fun,has great music, and made me wish to learn more about Capoeira."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and unrealistic.","review":"The plot line, acting and action sequences are all horrible - barely good enough for a \\"B\\" movie. This story has been used too many times and still glosses over the reality of fighting. Public fights never end like it is shown in movies - vengence and maiming and death are much more a realistic end to physical violence.Further, although the martial art style is exotic and interesting - this is not a fighting system! Sure it may have some distant roots in a camouflaged martial routine - but was and is not a true or even practical fighting system (like Krav Maga or MMA). It takes very little understanding of physics to see that standing upside down on one hand while kicking, is not the most effecient use of balance, weight or speed - all of which are required for effective fighting. Watch something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda sad when you think about it","review":"I feel that this movie was an okay movie because it is about my favorite thing in the world: Capoeira. I feel that the main character would be better if he was a real capoeira mestre, not some Karate Champion. The only parts worth watching are the first and last 5 minutes where you get to see roda in action. I am a self-taught capoeira student and I can play better than the goofs that they put in the movie. It is a good movie for capoeira newbies, but if you really want to know about REAL capoeira, research and find a mestre near you so that you can experience the exhileration of practicing such a beautiful art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing from an author known for better work","review":"This was a very poorly developed plot, and seemed to have been cut short or edited out the soul of the characters.

Luckily I have read Passion Bay and Saving Grace and realize this was not typical for Fulton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbing the Cradle","review":"I enjoyed this book, but could not get past the age difference in the characters.

The value of Hutchins' work extends beyond the time of writing, and is arguably as important today as ever.For anyone who has known the thrill of truly inspired teaching, and the pleasure and vigour of the examined life that follows from an informed exposure to classics, Hutchins' book lays a plan for their achievement and preservation at the university.

The only song here that doesn't have lyrics that are humorous or fantasy-oriented is the love song \\"Your Own Special Way\\", which really should have been saved for the follow-up, but, as is, became the only hit off this album, and the first single by Genesis to chart in the U.S., even though it was atypical of the rest of the album.

Compared to Geomag these are very low quality. The metal plating on some of the magnets was bubbling up, and on some it had already flaked off completely, causing black magnetic dust to accumulate. The strength of the magnets is a fraction of the strength of Geomag. I am still able to build with them, but the weaker magnets make some shapes more difficult to put together. The ends of the rods are larger in diameter, making it difficult to build some shapes that require a lot of rods to be attached to one ball. The balls are slightly larger which compensates for this problem somewhat, but not completely.For the price, I expected these to be of much higher quality. If I decide to make another purchase, I will either pay the international shipping on Geomag, or just refrain altogether.

The writer couldn't seem to make up his mind whether he wanted to emphasize the Frankenstein elements or be cloying and sympathetic to the plight of the scientist. The indecision costs the film dearly, as we end up mostly being bored stiff. Still, it wins a few stars for being novel for the era. Hammer fans will find little here that connects to the classics, as this film was produced in 1953, well before even the earliest hit, The Quatermass Experiment in 1955.

Regular lighters don't have this dumb feature. If you're going to \\"child-proof\\" everything, then do it within the bounds of good design & functionality - which this lighter doesn't.

Olivier does this in every Shakespeare I have seen except As You Like It, which he must have made before someone told him the Secret of Playing Shakespeare above. Watching this movie is like visiting a tomb, and it proves the truth of the statement that the only good Shakespeare is contemporary Shakespeare.

Olivier's Hamlet is quite assertive and daring, a swashbuckler in the most cinematic sense (the pirate ship scene or the breakneck dive from the stairs to kill Claudius can be used as support for this idea). Unfortunately the performances surrounding Olivier are not as strong... check out Richard Burton's stage performance on DVD for a wonderful cast production.

While \\"Ms. 45\\" may have something of a cult following, and Zoe Tamerlis is slightly intriguing in the lead, there are some handicaps the film just can't get past.Namely - a very implausible story line and some dreadful acting! Tamerlis is raped in broad daylight twice - on the street and in her apartment. And it appears as if she and her co-workers are verbally assaulted by every sleazy male in Manhattan! It got a bit ridiculous after a while and lost all credibility for me once Zoe turned vigilante against anyone male. None of the other players in the film can read a single line to sound convincing.

She is hlped by that rightwing guy from American Beauty who is a renowned hacker. Thanks to a 'great' idea they get the job done.As I said before, the concept will last a while.

I've read it twice and have listened to the audio countless times. Just listening to her is comforting. This book reminds us to question the status quo and listen to our true selves more. We are so used to doing things a certain way that we don't stop to question why some things are the way they are. Women are taught to think and act a certain way and so are men. Anyone who strays from the course is ostracized. Most people underestimate the importance of self-esteem. But if more people felt better about themselves, they wouldn't do or say the things they do.

The finale was good and pulled together the best threads of the previous seasons (I would have liked Xavier St Cloud included, but still...)I was also disappointed that, though Elizabeth and Peter were featured in the opening credits of the sixth season, there weren't Methos and/or Amanda centered episodes, except for the Joe & Methos one.There were 4 discs that contained NOTHING that couldn't have been added to the first 4.

She looks like she's in a totally different class and stage of life. The two have nowhere to meet- not even in lust. So, that doesn't work.I could go on with example after example to illustrate what went wrong, but then I'd spend more time on the review than it took to watch it.

However, they are no worse than the CIA or any other such group. I also had the feeling that he is getting revenge on coworkers and authority figures with whom he had problems. Everyone in the Mossad cannot possibly be as evil as he portrays them to be. And why shouldn't Jews in other countries be willing to help Israel? I would also like to add that this book is found and quoted on many anti-Semitic and hate websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of lies by a self hating Jew","review":"This book is a delight for all the anti-Semites in the world. The author, who no doubt was a failed officer in Israel, has come up with fantastic lies about the Mossad. In his drug induced hate filled mind, the author wants us to believe that the Mossad is responsible for all the evil in the world. He is in good company with other miserable self hating Jews who blame Israel for everything.

These instances seem to spring from the pages of By Way of Deception. It describes many ways in which specific Palestinians leaders are targeted andexecuted. Obviously, their names are arranged on a hit list, with the \\"go\\" order carried out by Israeli Intelligence operatives.The book is a good window into the evolution of the processes and \\"ideals\\" of the Mossad.

The book is filled with real events, which the author dramatically changed and turned Israel responsible for them. No wonder this book is banned in Israel. In fact, because of the ban, many people believe that this book has true accounts of Mossad activities. True, the book gets interesting, but the author's motive to run down the Israel for everything happening around the world spoils it. This book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes. I absolutely agree with J. A Magill's review, this book has no credible source of information, except the fact that Ostrovsky once worked for Mossad.Vindictiveness is the word behind this book. Absolutely one sided, and nothing to prove what author says. All I can say is that I want my money and most importantly my time back. I doubt if I can have either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality garden patio chaise cover","review":"This chaise cover has had very little wear and tear.

I have been using these covers all through the Summer to protect our lounge chairs. After about a month they started to show mold. After about 2 1/2 months, one of them got 'sun rot' and would tear or crumble where you touched it. Now both of them are in shreds and I'm left with having to go buy new covers. $60 on covers that have been used less than 6 months is a total rip-off!

While I do not have any difficulties with any tutorials released by Alias Wave-front, the exercises in this book do not match Maya 4.0. Windows that according to the book are supposed to pop up do not, and if they do, they look entirely different from the images in the book.

It contains a tear-out card of hotkeys on the very first page thus preventing a reader from having to hunt through the book for what a key does.Beginning with Chapter 2, the book walks you through how to use Maya and interact with the CD. When the information is provided on the included CD, there is a sidebar called ON THE CD and it tells you exactly which file to use. There are tips and traps sidebars as well.Know what NURBS are? If not, check out page 115 for a definition. Cameras, rendering, lighting, polygons, materials and artistry are subjects contained in the rest of the chapters.

It contains not only the working files and images you need for the tutorials, but also hours of video tutorials compiled by the author.

It goes into many details and explains the fundamentals nicely. I was hoping that it would go into bones, animation of the skeleton and skinning but as the name implies it is the fundamentals. I have purchased several books on 3Ds Max as well as Maya and this book I find to be excellent, more because of the details that is given in the CD.

This not only casts a needlessly bad light on many of the celebrities, but it also exposes the lack of effort and research that went into the writing of this book.

This is a delight!!","review":"I loved the trailer, I loved the film and I am enjoying the video over and over. Ryan & Kline make a delightful team. As a Frenchman on a lifequest of his own, Kevin Kline is the unlikely but very effective guide for Meg Ryan's journey through France to find her filanderng fiance and ultimately, to the truth of her being. Some of the best and most subtly delivered lines in any Romantic comedy. Zip, boom, Bonjour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A farcical plot (in a literal sense) that owes more to French cinema than its American counterpart","review":"A feel-good film, as many reviewers have pointed out, this certainly is. The script captures a very French essence in its absurdness which works very well. Luc, played typically over-the-top by Kevin Kline, steals the film for every man watching as the reformed rogue, but Meg Ryan is extremely lovable too as the reformed conservative and the photography makes good use of Provence and Valbonne Village (where Meg walks around saying 'B-ee-ootiful!'). This is a rom-com that appeals to both sexes, but perhaps for slightly different reasons. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Kiss","review":"Kevin Kline Meg Ryan, and Jean Reno are wonderful in this film. Their best work yet and worthy of viewing over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"needed Kevin Kline as antithesis to Meg Ryan","review":"Not as nice as \\"Innerspace\\" (really a Dennis Quaid or Martin Short vehicle) or \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" but one of the better Meg Ryan romantic comedies. Meg Ryan's sweetness balanced by Kevin Kline's vaguely disreputableness.Loved the scenes with the snooty French hotel concierge. Jean Reno was also pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"I wish there where ten more films like this.One of my favorites Sure its escapist but terrific entertainment.The actors are total masters of the genre and the sound track with the great Toots Theileman's harmonica playing is to die for.( I even liked that one of the songs seemed Italian more than french) A madcap adventure that has the power to lift you out of the daily crap we all have to wade through . My only criticism is that it had to end. Gimme More!!!!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"French Kiss is a wonderful romantic comedy that can uplift you from the worst mood. It is a very lighthearted and funny movie. Meg Ryan plays the delightful role as the unfortunate Kate who has lost her fiance and flies to Paris to regain his love. Along the way she meets Luc, a French man who takes her on a wild ride. If you have ever been to Paris this movie will make you want to go back, or visit for the first time! A bonus is the soundtrack is just as great as the movie. I have literally seen ths movie 100 times and will keep watching it forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE SEEN THIS OVER 50 Times","review":"Meg Ryan Cracks me up!! I remember being 14 years old in 8th grade and going to the theaters 3 times to see this. I have the video since.....and recently got it on DVD. I love the soundtrack!! Excellent movie, Kevin Kline's french accent is hilarious and SO NATURAL. Meg is the typical Meg....funny and the bickering that goes on between the two. HIGHLY RECOMEND!! I have been a fan of Meg since Joe Versus the Volcano"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Depardieu when you need him?","review":"Meg Ryan plays her standard role as marvelously as ever and singlehandedly earns those 2 stars, with an honorable mention to Jean Reno as the French cop. Everything and everyone else totally lacks credibility -- plot, development, dialogue. Granted that Hollywood movies demand a suspension of disbelief, but this is ridiculous. What's more, to a person who does speak French, almost every scene in France is destroyed by the phony and fractured French of the supposedly native French characters (except Anbeh who performs creditably most of the time as Juliette, and of course the few truly French members of the cast)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always makes me happy!","review":"I have watched this wonderful movie so many times I know all the dialogue.The acting is perfect! The music well choosen.This is my favorite modern romantic comedy. I make all of my friends watch it and they become fans as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been awhile since I've seen it but...","review":"From what I recall it deserves a five star rating. I watched this in French class and I remember thinking oh boy another sucktastic school movie and was pleasently suprised.At first I doodled, but you can't help but be pulled into the story and the delightful Meg Ryan. I soon was completely involved with storyline and loved every minute of it, and I for once didn't even mind the pretictable ending.A movie that is worth renting, watching, and then purchasing. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute movie - but there are better ones","review":"It's entertaining, if you're able to really suspend your sense of reality. It was really hard to fall for Kevin Kline's character the way you needed to, in order to really feel the compulsion she has to stay with him. The ending was a bit strange, as though they just ran out of things to do. All in all - rent this first or buy it used, it's not worth full price. Grab Notting Hill instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is a fun love story to watch. Katie's boyfriend left to Pairs for work. Katie is too scared to go with him. He falls in love with, what he say's, a goddess. She heads to Pairs to win him back. She get's help from a french theif, who is actually hiding a diamonds necklaces in her purse. With out her knowing. Great movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good couples movie","review":"It's more of a chick flick, but one that the guys will enjoy watching with their ladies. There is a lot of humor, and of course it's a love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, Funny and just all around good time!","review":"The editorial reviewer from amazon knows absolutely nothing about the elements of making a good movie! This movie is funny and sweet from start to finish. Filled with memorable lines throughout, from Meg Ryan's \\"I just ate that cow\\" to Kevin Kline's \\"Don't ever touch my vine\\" This is the type of movie that never gets old. It's one movie in my collection that rarely collects dust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the review given by amazon.","review":"Don't listen to the review above given by amazon.com..or chosen by amazon.com to represent this movie. This is a fun, light-hearted, comedy that can be watched over and over again. I enjoy this...It is one of the only \\"chick-flick movies\\" that I'd watch if I happened to surf to it on TBS or whatever.The performance by Meg Ryan is very good...as always...and Kevin Kline is also fun, although I did find his accent a little annoying at times. I really enjoy watching this movie. I guess its kind of addictive.For DVD fanatics...the disc is not packed full of special features, the sound isn't amazing, the picture quality is average (for DVDs), but the story is fun.Besides...this is a cheap DVD to own...and well worth the 15 bucks to watch it on rainy days."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE BLU RAY 2 TIMES!!!","review":"I ORDERED THE NEW RELEASED BLURAY EDITION AND THERE WAS A VISIBLE DEFECT ON THE DISC AND IT STOPS AT TRACK #2!RETURN IT AND ORDERED A REPLACEMENT, SAME THING!!!BUYERS BE AWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Widescreen version is terrific!","review":"DVD is wonderful! Paris through the eyes of Meg and Kevin is gorgeous. But, the best part of this movie? The end credits, where Kevin sings \\"La Mer.\\" Just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Star Romantic Comedy","review":"I had to purchase this movie so that I could fall in love with Luc over and over again. I love everything Meg does, but the musical score, it's wonderful, it's wonderful. Had to have it and the new Paolo Conte CD as well. Next time you see this film listen to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat predictable, but fun nonetheless","review":"Okay, so it's not exactly a great cinematic accomplishment. Still, the plot is fun and the characters are well-played; if you like Meg Ryan in anything else, you'll like her in \\"French Kiss\\". Think of it as a good rainy day or date film - and definitely a great value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of my favorite films ever!","review":"I am a Meg Ryan fan, so when I saw this in the TV guide, I thought great. Just as expected, she didn't let me down. My teenage daughters and I find ourselves quoting this film all the time. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Funny!","review":"My best friend and I have watched this movie a countless number of times. It has got to be my favorite movie. The funny \\"one liners\\" make me laugh till my stomach hurts, no matter how many times i watch it! Spasm! Spasm! Makes me laugh just thinking about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got going for me","review":"I wasn't expecting more than light entertainment, but I don't think the movie ever got going. I thought Meg Ryan's character just never got to be sympathetic enough to make me want to see the two characters get together in the end. I found all the anti-French jokes just painfully stupid. The only great thing about the movie was seeing Jean Reno in a small role who does far greater acting with his facial expressions alone than anyone else in the whole movie is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"French KIss","review":"please save your money I didn't. She is too young for him and he is too old for hertry too return it and couldn't the tape is damaged I had too turn up the speakersand still couldn't hear them. The beach seens were very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow Tom Keogh's Editorial Review","review":"This movie fails in establishing a story and characters one could warmly relate to. I mean Meg's character behaves too juvenile (to put it mildly) while the other lead character has no charisma even though the screenwriter tries to make him look like an expert in communicating with a flight-shy and awkward-with-men woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watched it so many times that I spoilt my sister's video","review":"This is my favourite of Meg's.I will laugh at the same lines and scenes over and over again (which my sister and mom will never understand why) simply because Meg and Kevin are both so funny. Whenever they saw me watching the video they'll say \\"Here she goes again...\\". Now that I've spoilt her video, I have to look for replacement which I still am not able to find one at local stores. Either the people here seriously need help with their sense of humour for low demand or they love it so much that it got sold out everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, loved it, loved it!","review":"Kevin Kline and Meg Rayan played their parts so well with all of the subtle cultural differences in tact for us to appreciate without tripping over. Speaking as an American woman married to a Frenchman, I can say from experience that the humor in this film definitely stems from true life! If you are in a Franco-American relationship of your own, you must see this film. We've been laughing over it for years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"French Kiss","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

The story is sweet and makes me feel wonderful. Great soundtrack as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comical Romance","review":"I just love this movie. I have seen it at least 10 times if not more and it is one that i just have not tired of. It's a great blend of comedy and romance. Meg Ryan and Kevin Klien make an interesting couple and the scattering of other French and Euro charters makes this a must have for my little library of romance movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best performances by these actors","review":"Wow, great movie! Keeps you laughing and brings a few tears as well. I think the actors do a great job and give one of their best and most mature performances ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for.","review":"Glass quality is subpar and has a slight bevel to it causing the outer edges of the mirror to appear warped. Should have just replaced my entire assembly with factory parts. Guess for the price I paid it will make due!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This series has \\"digitally restored\\" written on the box, but the quality is quite poor with static and film defects on screen at all times and poor sound quality. I'd excuse this if the show were a bit more entertaining. I had hoped that this would be similar to \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" series from the same era, which has a variety of entertaining stories and charming characters. Unfortunately, the stories seem pretty flat and contrived. Lancelot also looks completely like a 50's-style pretty boy with a bit of a pompadour rather than looking as if he belongs in the period the story takes place in. What is worse, the acting really isn't all that good.This isn't an awful series, but it isn't a particularly good one either. If you're looking for a period adventure series set in medieval times, I'd go for Robin Hood with Richard Greene. It's better value for the money and has superior acting and stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic poetic narrative","review":"Neruda's Canto General is a poetic retelling of the history of South and Central America from the late pre-Columbian era to the middle of the twentieth century. The book is set up like a novel, with chapters and subheadings, a straight-line narration, and a cast of characters. Neruda's communist ideology is visible throughout the work and is a major theme. Canto General leaves the reader with an interesting impression of American history seen through the eyes of the impoversihed people of South America, as well as an idea of how third-world communists perceive reality. This is truly an excellent work, and should be read by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful reconnection of Jessica and Scotland Yard Detective George Sutherland","review":"Mrs. F and some of her Cabot Cove friends travel to Scotland to visit the ancestral home of Jessica's \\"beau\\" George Sutherland and have a more interesting vacation than they were expecting.As usual, Donald Bain weaves a lighthearted mystery around Jessica and her friends. This book, however, really kept me glued to it's suspense so much so that I finished it in 2 days! Didn't see the twist at the end which thoroughly delighted me!Gives a good look at small town Scottish life with all of it's idiosyncrasies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotland will never be the same again!","review":"A must-read for any mystery lover. \\"The Highland Fling Murders\\" is a cozy mystery, which is best read on a cold, rainy night while the wind is howling outside the window. Eerie and suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's NOT Jessica Fletcher I like","review":"Jessica Fletcher is invited by her friend, George Sutherland, to visit his castle in Scotland. But the castle is rumored to be cursed by the witch executed centuries ago. Bizarre incidents happen one after another, and superstitious people blame George and his castle.I like \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" TV series and I expected this novelization was also nice. But I am disappointed. This book's Jessica lacks the most important quality that makes her successful as a mystery writer and a sleuth; namely curiosity. Every time an incident happens, she dismisses it to enjoy her vacation. That's not an attitude of a sleuth. That's NOT Jessica Fletcher I like. Just an ordinary amiable lady.And the truth is extremely easy to guess. I feel that the author deliberately keeps Jessica inactive to lengthen the story. Indeed, in the last 50 pages, Jessica gets suddenly active and easily solves the mystery. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"The chain looks thinner that I expected. However, the quality seems very good, although I am no jewelry expert. I got 2 for my twin boys who are 5 months old. They wear it with their Christening cross pendant and it looks very handsome. Furthermore, they are at the age where the pull at everything that gets into their tiny fists and this chain, although thin, has been up to the abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The exception to the rule","review":"If you love Greyhawk, you will love the Gord books - period. There is only one exception, and that is \\"City of Hawks\\".Gary Gygax tried to change the background of the Gord-stories in mid-stride. What originally (in Saga of Old City) seemed to be fate or cunning of the hero is now \\"unmasked\\" to be meddling of powers.It is obvious that these developments are NOT what EGG originally intended. There are major breaks in continuity and outright contradictions. In the context of the Gord-story, this book had best not been written. Anyway, since the rest of the books is 4 to 5-star reading, and since everyone owning the other books also has this one, there is just one advice: Read this one last (after Dance of Demons), so as to not spoil the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Book is a Favorite","review":"This book just goes to show that you don't have to spend a lot on expensive items in order to make your child happy! This sweet little book of baby animals, with a few little humans as well, is one of the books my daughter (11 months) goes for every time. She loves this book and when we get to the end, she'll turn it back to the start for us to read it over and over and over again. We like the book because the photos are good at depicting the animals, unlike some children's books' drawings which are sometimes lacking in authenticity. Out of the approximately 50 books that we have bought her so far, this is one of her favorites right now, and combined with other types of books, makes for a nice mix in reading for her age. I hesitate to add that the book did come apart, but we glued it backed together with some non-toxic Elmer's Glue-All, and if it doesn't hold, we'd actually re-order it. So that should say something about our recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"little board book","review":"I had wanted to give this little board book as a gift but have chosen not to because it doesn't look new.

I should not try and read these types of books because I never seem to really enjoy them, but this book just did not turn me on. It was like the author took the characters from Wall Street and gave them narcotics. It just was a slow book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got this dvd because I was interested in learning some very basic, but authentic, steps in different dance styles, and get a fun workout at the same time. If you are seeking the same things, don't waste your time with this dvd. I've studied flamenco dance for several years, and the \\"flamenco\\" she demonstrates is not only partially authentic at best, but her style is not good. I figured that the other styles were demonstrated in a similarly flawed fashion, so lost interest.If your goal is simply to get a new and fun workout, the dvd is somewhat more successful. I had a problem however with her demonstration, because she does it facing the viewer - and anyone who's taken dance classes knows that the instructor faces the mirror, not the viewer. This way you can imitate the steps easily without have to transpose them in your mind first. Personally, I found it frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Work out DVD","review":"This DVD didn't motivate me. Its not a workout DVD, however if I'm looking to learn dance moves its great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this workout","review":"It is an enjoyable work out if you enjoy dancing. it is not a quick workout if you are press for time, well over 30 minutes from warmup-workout-cooldown. There is a slight language barrier, she occasionally utilizes the wrong word to instruct you on what she would like you to do, but she is easy to follow, energetic and lots of fun. It is worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disapointing !!! Not worth the money","review":"I had a small knowledge of belly dancing and of flamenco and I both love those dances. I was very disapointed with the DVD. Not a lot of explainations, very few technique. It's gonna go in my next garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw her dance in Carnegie Hall!","review":"I saw Elsa Leandros perform with Bobby Farrah in Carnegie Hall many years ago. She looked great on that stage performing both flamenco and belly dancing. It was quite a surprise that she came out, after all this years, with a DVD. I tried taking classes with her, back when I lived in New York city, but they were too hard for me at the time. Her DVD is really good. I had no idea she could also do those other styles. In my opinion, however, I wish she'd just stuck to bellydancing for this DVD.I really don't care for salsa at all, and for samba I already have other DVDs. Flamenco is OK but it just isn't me. I'm also taking away a star because the cooldown is not that great, sorry Elsa. Anyway, it wasn't a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to say that I was disappointed with this DVD. The variety of dance styles it shows is nice, but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only DVD I've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style, which I've become interested in lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and time effective!","review":"This workout is a time effective way to both exercise and learn some dance moves that can be done easily on any dance floor. Learning this steps and following the workout was easy for me. There are plenty of other DVDs that offer a higher impact cardio exercise, others a more effective way to tone your abs, etc. However, I personally find them too challenging and it takes more willpower to actually do this every day. With World Dance Workout , I just put it in Dvdplayer and before I know it, I've gone through all the segments and I'm sweating. Elsa's dance backround is quite impressive and yet, i like the fact that she chose to keep the bonus performances low-keyed demonstrating the steps on the workouts, rather than trying to show off. Very classy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for anyone","review":"I don't ususally write reviews, but I couldn't possibly keep my mouth shut about this DVD.This is just an aweful product. Elsa cannot be a proffesional dancer, she is just awful. Her hands are way too flimsy. She reminds me of the wanna-be professional dancers at my family get-togethers. Not only are the dance steps way too basic to keep the beginner interested for more than a couple of tries, but it's just not good sense to learn from someone who doesn't have decent technique. You don't want bad habits to rub off on you and then have to unlearn that [...].It's not even worth returning the DVD. I only get 50% back because I opened it, and then the shipping fee is taken off my refund. I may get a dollar back on my credit card if I'm lucky, but I'm still doing it, just on principle.[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It seems this DVD put together by amateurs - it is organised quite clearly, but is very bland with predominantly one camera angle (as though the camera was left on a tripod while the instructor danced her routine). The instructions are fairly clear as well, but overall quite uninspiring. I normally am easily moved to dance, and I expected this DVD (at a minimum) to motivate me, but instead found myself bored and discouraged. I am regretful that I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Can Teach but Cannot Dance","review":"This DVD is great for learning the steps, and good for beginners. However the \\"performance\\" sections do not show proper technique and give poor examples of how the dances should be performed.

The makeup itself is nice, so I would recommend it to anyone who want a nice, even skin tone without the heavy look of makeup, but I am highly disappointed with the company from which I ordered it from!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I like this foundation and have used it daily since I bought it. I wish it would last all day but it seems to need a touch up by afternoon. I especially like that it isn't shiny like the regular bareminerals foundation was for me. So far I am happy and will continue to use this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Stuff!","review":"I am in love with this bare mineral foundation! It cover nicely and feel fresh all day long. Easy to applied and my skin look flawless! Will buy more from this seller. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been using the regular BE for over 4 years now. I love that product, but I have really oily skin and it just seemed to be accentuated at times by the makeup. I recently bought the matte foundation and have been using it for a few days now. The oil reduction is noticeable and the makeup looks great. Don't expect it solve all of your skin problems - ie. large pores. Also, be aware that the makeup is a little heavier that the original BE foundation. Overall, however, I will take heavier over oilier! Will definitely purchase again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast application & good coverage","review":"I have used this product for several years now and love it. It is excellent for sensitive skin. When I run out and have to use inexpensive, national brand liquid my face burns and skin becomes red, irritated, oily, and blemishes start appearing. Then I go back to using bare minerals foundation and my skin calms down. It hardly feels like I'm wearing any makeup at all. This is important if you live in a humid area during hot summer months. It feels light, matches my skin well, lasts approx. 5-6 months (per 9g jar) and covers fairly well. If you like heavier coverage (like I do) just buff a bit more on. This is an excellent product and I don't plan on going back to liquid or any cheaper brand of powder foundation again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would buy this again","review":"I bought the starter pack of the regular Bare Escentuals, which I liked, but the finish was a little too sparkly or shiny for me. I like the matte look of this powder. I can go to the gym after work, and it doesn't run off my face like regular makeup. The only thing I don't really like is the way Amazon or Sephora displays the colors. I would have bought the lighter shade, but it looked like 'Fairly Light' was correct. Just a tiny bit too dark, but it's very blendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping, great service, product as expected.","review":"Great product! The same as Ulta sales. Goes on flawlessly.

Used the regular foundation before and switched to the matte, I can't tell that much of a difference. I love this foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smooth","review":"I like this product. It is hard to choose between the original Bare Minerals and this Matte, but I think I will stay with the matte for a couple reasons: 1. I love the Matte finish. The Original leaves a bit of shimmer which is fine, but I like the airbrushed look better. 2. Personally, my skin seems smoother, maybe because there is no Bismuth Oxychloride in this formula.What I don't like is that it seems to go on much darker, so when I ordered it in my normal color I was a little disappointed. It also is a smaller amount than the original, and more pricey. Which bites.All that said, I like the feel and look of the product, the coverage is very good, and looks extremely natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not authentic","review":"Apparent Chinese knock off.

I find that over the last year or more (since implementation of the new lid) some product is left in the container that you cannot get to when using it up. I feel that is a waste of product/money...

There is no other product like it. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this is the first makeup I have found that doesn't irritate my skin. Looks natural and provides great coverage.

I have a one-year-old who I want to grow up to be self-assured. I believe books such as Happy to Be Nappy, coupled with her father's and my love and support, will help build the confidence she needs to be comfortable in her skin.The only reason I rated this with a 4 out of 5 stars is because of one line in the book that reads, \\"...all kinks gone.\\" I embrace kinks, so I could have done without that part.Thanks to the author, artist and publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry up, Dark Horse","review":"Short review-Dark Horse is doing an excellent job on their translations for Trigun. All honorifics are left in.About the actual content- This volume's mostly filler, following the fifth moon incident. Wolfwood's huge cross is revealed to be a machine gun, and Vash is still a god with his revolver. The art is pretty sketchy, but I still love Nightow-san's syle.Also, there's been some talk about Vash's 'new' look. Most Americans have seen the anime, in which he keeps his original look the entire time, before reading the original manga, in which Vash's look abruptly changes in Maximum. Vash's new coat is a little crazy looking, but/so it fits Vash's personality a bit more. What's more, does it really matter what Vash looks like? He's still Vash.9.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Hat","review":"The hat fits pretty well. She is adorable wearing this hat. It does have a bit of a problem of falling in her face.

The viewer is less \\"teased\\" than left wondering what in the world is going on in the first place! In each of the video segments the viewer is drawn into the lives of the various women and left wondering about the problems & motivations that drive each of them. In each of the segments there is limited character development so that the viewer is left trying to understand the complex elements of their lifestyles."},{"rating":"1","title":"omfg what crap","review":"Earache must have been pretty desperate for new bands to have given these wankers a record deal.The music is repetitionus and unimaginative the musicianship itself is terrible and the vocals down right boringEvery song is pretty much the same riffs in different order.

I bought this because I heard the song \\"Thrown into Oblivion\\" by itself and thought it sounded pretty good. Then I saw the CD on here for all of 53 cents and figured I might as well give it a shot. Now I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I put it in my CD player and by the third track I was sick of it. Every song sounds exactly the same as the others. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's as though they went to the Wesley Willis School of Songwriting. And that is an insult to poor Wesley (god rest), who had an excuse. I doubt the members of disgust can claim Chronic Schizophrenia caused them to commit creative atrocity.So, to summarize, don't buy it. Even though it only costs 53 cents. Don't waste your money. Your 53 cents is better used in one of those crane machines with all the stuffed animals, even though you rarely win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic and Electric","review":"Not real clear on the history behind this one. I am looking forward to hearing more of Harrison's work with Freedom and Snafu; but have yet to do so. Also, I am not exactly sure how this was marketed back in the day, if at all. However granting all that, I really like this CD. Considering the diversity of the talent employed, it does have a bit of a thrown together, mismatched feel. However most of the songs are good. Several songs have a pretty heavy guitar oriented bite to them (I am taking it for granted that these are the Tony Iommi contributions, although that's not clear from the credits). There is also some funk and some straight ahead southernish rock, not all of it heavy. If you have a broad taste for classic rock of diverse styles; this unique piece is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable tool for successful parenting.","review":"Parent talk should be in every home with children.This book and others in the (School Talk) series should be mandatory reading for all educators.Thank you to the wise authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Overview - Outrageously Priced","review":"Does a good job of providing an overview of the strategic and tactical marketing processes of companies.

It was a nice video and actually seemed to me the unscripted family project of the summer, with Mom and the girls as the stars. That being said, in this video these ladies have an enormous garden, full off all sorts of flowers, vegetables, and herbs. How long is this video? 49 minutes. I really felt like they could have chosen to show many, many more vegetables and tips, but for some reason chose to focus very narrowly on a few subjects. I did not doubt their expertise, but I just felt this very short DVD did not live up to its title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough information for the cost.","review":"Although the West ladies are delightful, friendly people, I found this dvd to have very little real information on gardening. I took away from it 2 good ideas, one for planting potatoes and the other for an \\"easy instant garden\\" but the price is hardly worth it.

So far, I'm pleased with it. We have had some very windy days, and the cover did not shift at all. The only downside to this cover is that it hangs in the middle, so I actually hand-sewed some velcro strips to each of the long sides, and attached them underneath the table, and this made the fit a lot tighter (and perhaps that is why it has not blown off in the wind). The material is heavy, so am pleased with that. It should stand up to the sun shining on it without breaking down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions are misleading.","review":"I had to return this item as it would not fit my 75\\"x40\\" table. Even though it says it is 76\\" long it was still more than a foot too short for my table. When we stretched the cover out and measured it at the center, it did measure 76\\".

I disagree. Kyo's sophmore release may not be brilliant but it is a good album and deserves a thoughtful listen. I, personally, love this album. It is dark and emotional, less sugary than the first. The vocals are melancholy and glorious. \\"Sarah\\" is the popular single release and is a fine song, but when I heard \\"Dans Ma Chair\\" I was blown away by it. The guitar intro is reminiscent of Smashing Pumpkins crossed with Bush's \\"Greedy Fly\\". Another notable track is \\"L'Enfer\\". I confess, my understanding of French is minimal so I cannot comment on the lyrical value of the music but the sound intrigues me and this is presently one of my favorite albums.

Let the lyrics speak for themselves and judge it for yourself.Mixing a combition of their KYO formula from 'le chemin' and influence from (I would say) a little more grungy avril lavigne, they've managed to produce a splendid record.

I'm no book snob - I love romance novels and I'll read anything from a 1962 Mills and Boon to Harlequin Blazes.But this? This was TERRIBLE. The characterization was paper-thin, the plotting was ridiculous. But what really killed this book for me was (SPOILER...if something this bad can be \\"spoiled\\") the inclusion of two brutal rapes committed by family members against young women. (There may have been more; I quit reading after the second.)

The story of a juniour doctor escaping 'her father' by fleeing offworld seemed ineresting. Ive since gone through the series and the books have steadily gotten worse and worse.The problem is quite frankly the plot. The basic idea is ok but the fault with this book, is that Cherijo is too....perfect. She always does the right thing, no matter how improble the choise. She is up against a mad scientist, an evil game, a backwards community and an incompetant doctor. None have any redeeming features at all.I just can't handle it because I can't see anyone being so perfect in a saddistic world like this.The only reason that I carried on reading is because it is an unusual take on the world. Every other book has the human race as the good guys and are loved by all others.I am thinking VERY hard about whether I will get the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"have all her books","review":"I really enjoyed this one. I have all of her books and have enjoyed this one almost as much as her first. The other two were a little violent for me, but her characters draw a reader into the world that the author has created. I feel this writer is very gifted and will continue buying and keeping her books, but would request a little more bonding with husband, child, family, a little less violence. Our real world has enough of it, I really don't care to read alot of it. I use books to escape the real world and go into one that is full of fun, life, fantasy, magic and a bit of unreality thrown in. people do usually read book, watch movies,etc to escape the things they don't or can't deal with at the moment. books, movies, etc help people deal with the crazy world we live in and we are very thankful for people like this author who can help us with this goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"Ok here's what you do.Go to the local book store, get a copy of this useless book and read the first couple of chapters and the last few.

The next was good, but less so. The same with the next and now we get to Shockball. For a scifi book, there is a startling lack of your typical space saga while human alien hybrids and a fictional sport seem to be the only reminders that the book is set in the future. Cherijo manages to find a disease that has long since been extinct, which of course means it is a current day disease.I liked Reever the best in this novel compared to the other three books, however, that was not enough to save the book from overall repetitive storytelling. I personally have had enough of the angst. We get it, Chreijo has a awesome immune system so can be tortured and recover. It seems all that happened in the last book was that she was tortured and then escaped. The same happens here.The characters have potential, but instead we are treated to the soap opera angsty life of Cherijo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book!","review":"Seriously, I didn't like this as much.

The storyline was a good premise for a novel of glass artist Maggie meeting up with city art dealer Rogan, however, if you are going to write about a country that is not your native own, steer away from the stereotypical tourist imagery and be realistic. Needless to say, I did not bother reading Born in Ice and both copies went to a Salvation Army store."},{"rating":"1","title":"NGC Controller rip off...","review":"I found out today, too late I guess, that this controller doesn't even work.

Danger Mouse has an amazing arrangement of beats and Doom's lyrics are genius. However most of them feature characters from Adult Swim shows. The tone of the album matches well with the wacky cameos and Doom is the only MC who could have delivered so well considering the content.

The beats and rhymes both were basic and nothing I heard really got me moving. MF Doom's raps are cheeky in that pre-schooler kinda way. Kinda weak. Andy Milinokis flows better than this cat.

When you find an album that you can put into your CD player, press play and not press the skip button until the album is finished, and then press play again, you found yourself a gem; which is what this album is. Dangermouse's production is great; every sample and instrument work perfectly. He does not just make a 10 second loop, he messes with the beat throughout the entire track, on every track. If Doom keeps getting with such great producers who exhibit his lyrical excellence, he will not be in the dark for long.

The album is very good overall with some really great tracks. It doesn't get 5 stars because I don't like Doom as much in this much of a cartoon form.

It was just one of the days, browsing through the local Hastings, not really looking for anything in particular. The cover art was interesting, a cartoon-ish vibe. I picked it up and fell in love with it immediately. Like most of DOOM's albums there is a lot going on in each song and sometimes it's hard to tell where one song stops and the next begins. It hits you from all different angles and with ever listen you find something new in the background. DOOM knows how to flow and Dangermouse is a first class DJ.

David Glasgow Farrigut, however, was to be found in the heat of battle, lashed high in the rigging of his flagship, barking commands through a megaphone, bullets flying around him, while his junior officers begged him to come down before he was shot to pieces! Farragut reached the level of a truly epic hero. Congress wanted no titles of nobility and had no rank above Captain in the Pre-Civil War U.S. Navy. Farragut's performance was so fantastic that Congress created the rank of Vice Admiral and then Admiral to award to a man who is argued in other text \\"THE DAY THE WAR WAS LOST\\" to have done more to win the Civil War than any other person.

Whoever did the DVD audio portion needs to be shot on all of these re-releases. The cd remaster sounds great, however the dvd is mixed horribly. Heavily gated compression on the vocals that dominates the mix.

I'm not saying the show was bad - Phil Collins led the audience in a truly masterful fashion. The band were clear and precise. But all of us who wanted to hear all of those whimsical, vaugely liturgical songs from the wonderful world of Charterhouse were left high and dry. I called out for 'Supper's Ready' but an informed member of the audience soon put me in my place. There would be none of that on this summer's night.So gone were the deeply moving songs from a somehow forgotten age and now began the crappy crowd pleasers for the North American stage.

The writing borrows extensively from George Seaton's nearly perfect 1947 screenplay, but discards some of the brilliant plot devices and completely omits one of the key moments which we all remember fondly. The scenes replacing them are nowhere near as clever or heartwarming. In fact this film turns very nasty and dark when it comes to the moment in the plot where Kris is framed and sent to the asylum accused of being crazy and a violent offender. The way the Original film dealt with it was sheer genious and not a bit ugly or offensive.

This remake tries hard, way too hard, in fact, but is utterly devoid of the charm and wit of the original, and adds a bit of sleaze just for good measure. It also misses one of the central points of both the book and the original movie, the very carefully unresolved ambiguity about whether the central character is actually Santa Claus, or merely a slightly crazy old man. Not worth the time to watch, much less the money to buy. Get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Why Why","review":"Maureen Ohara related that during the filming of the original, everyone knew it would be successful because they could sense how much heart was in the film. Heart seems to be something very difficult to generate in films these days and this remake is a good example. The film is competent, but heart is replaced with cutesy and smarmy. Hopefully this film will pass into oblivion. I doubt that 60 years from now anyone will be calling it a classic, that is, if it's still being shown.

I thought the cast was VERY likable, very endearing. (I think my teen/young adult kids would vote for Home Alone, though . . . more action, more laughs.)

The author tells the story from the dog's and the hen's points of view, displaying a keen understanding of animal behavior. Sensitive children will identify with the protagonists, and it is impossible to avoid caring deeply about the fate of the two friends as the reader is drawn into their world. The story is suspenseful without being too scary for young children, and also includes a valuable message about accepting those who are \\"different.\\" I loved this story as a youngster, and borrowed it dozens of times from my elementary school library.

I certainly don't expect the camera to stay with him for 1049 miles, but I would hope that the photographer would have spent the effort to film him at checkpoints and the finish line at the very least and thus spend more time on a Rookie's Journey to Nome.However, as a progressing musher, I thoroughly enjoyed what we did get to see, and to see the varying methods used by each musher.

The text is repetitive. The book is for a gift for a 2-year old, who has not yet received it, so her appreciation of it is yet to be seen.

Just exactly the book I was looking for. The subtitle of this book is \\"Inside the Well-Stocked Witch's Cupboard.\\" I think it does a pretty good job of living up to that topic! The author gives some witchy basics, but most of the book is dedicated to natural magic. The second half of the book contains an extensive listing of herbs, stones, and crystals and their uses.

Oh, how mistaken I was. Instead I was met with a plotless film, which would have been fine if the characters were developed more. The only character with any color is Hugh Grant's Lord Byron, who plays the part with delicious cynicism and wit. The rest of the cast is pretty flat--none of them show any of the intellect or personality their real-life counterparts were known to have. The so-called metaphorical monster is less metaphor and more of a big guy who looks bored and speaks haltingly. His presence in the film gave me hope that the plot would indeed show up, but alas no. Apart from fodder for Hugh Grant gazing, the film does have an occasionally topless Elizabeth Hurley in a supporting role, though it took me a minute to recognize her due to her generous eyebrows (must have been filmed in her pre-Estee Lauder spokesmodel days)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible movie.","review":"I had great hopes for this early Hugh Grant movie.

After a lot of people watched the film and the subseqent VHS, I noticed a lot of people annoyed at Jodie Foster's character in the movie, a woman who uttered constantly incoherent phrases. It became aggravating to some. I didn't find that on the first viewing but I admit, it did on the second and third.The point is, if you haven't the film, check it out, but it may not be one you'd want to see multiple times. Then again.......Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. His wife, Natasha Richardson, who tragically died just a week ago, also adds to this unique story. I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for an outstanding effort.

If you want to know what \\"putting a soul into the role\\" means, that's the exact case. She is almost always impressive, but this is a performance that you will remember for the rest of your life once you see it. The interesting plot keeps you stuck to the screen. Nell is a girl, who has been brought up in an isolated world. She never knew anyone except her mother and her twin sister. The remote forests of North Carolina have always been her home. The movie is very beautifully shot, with a lot of fantastic sceneries. Liam Neeson is another powerful point of \\"Nell\\". One of the best movies of the 90's.

I loved the interaction between Nell(Foster) and Luvall(Neeson). More so was the love triangle formed between Neeson, Richardson and Foster.

She is upset that he was made into a vampire, so now they can't be together in the afterlife, but she gets over it.The Robo Vampire is really a robocop. He is created to fight the vampires.

I really enjoyed the magical slasher element along with the humor in parts 1, 4 and especially 5. After watching part 3, I was very disappointed though. Once again, we get a change in powers and myths and the beginning of this chapter has no connection with the end of the last one. The change of setting is fine, but we definitely don't get enough of the leprechaun in the first half of the film. Instead we get stuck with lots of gambling and magic acts. The acting, especially by the lead male is pretty bad and the only thing that stands out is how underrated Warwick Davis is as he outshines the rest of the cast in the acting department. You can get this movie in a couple of different 'Leprechaun' sets. I wouldn't recommend you buy this movie on it's own even if you are a fan of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm","review":"Much like the Child's Play trilogy, the third time is NOT the charm! I really enjoyed the first and second movies, but this was a wholly unneccessary addition to the Leprechaun franchise. The plot was fairly interesting with the mortal guy gaining Leprechaun powers, but it was really hard to enjoy this movie. The best part of this movie was of course the Leprechaun himself - no matter how bad the Leprechaun movies get, the Leprechaun himself is awesome, his personality, his lines, his antics.

Does anyone for a moment believe that Brutus, Cassius, Cato or Cicero and the others were capable of ruling the entire Mediterranean world, Europe, Africa and the East? The conspirators who murdered Caesar didn't have a clue on the consequences of their actions. They set into motion events which overwhelmed them and in my view forced Octavian to wipe them out and to prevent nobles like them from ever again ruling without military oversight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lengthy reading on Rome","review":"I would have titled this book differently because a revolution is rather abrupt and his discrpition is rather long. The writing is very detailed and he is one of the leading voices for Roman history. I would only read this book if you are interested in becoming better educated on the demise of the senate, not for pleasure reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"and yet another indulgent memoir","review":"The most compelling aspect of this rather indulgent memoir is Sojourner's retelling of her life and times with her ill mother. You really feel a sense of the anguish. Otherwise, the book unveils itself in a series of incomplete vignettes that are packaged like second-rate newspaper columns at best, and generally self-righteous and lacking in introspection.Sojourner is a real stalwart in Flagstaff; she manages to raise ver voice the loudest at most rallies. In truth, though, she doesn't live in the woods, as the marketing would like to present, but right off a paved highway in a cluster of cabins for tourists, two minutes from your local Walmart. And her rants against the corporatization of publishing now ring hollow given that she avidly sought to be published by a corporate juggernaut like Simon Schuster (and its Scribner imprint), instead of a truly independent press like Seal. Bottom line: so much for taking a stand; take the money and run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD, the best by Thin White Rope","review":"I have to disagree with the Andy Gill review above. Where he hears droning, I hear some of the best hard rock of the 1980's. \\"In the Spanish Cave\\" is impressionistic and not very melodic, so you either connect with it or you don't. I connect with it bigtime. \\"In the Spanish Cave\\" is Thin White Rope's darkest, most hard-driving album, brimming with frustration, and not as \\"desert-parched\\" as, say, \\"Exploring the Axis.\\" You do have to be in the right mood for this CD to have its effect -- if you are, then Kyser's expressions of tension and frustration like \\"It's OK\\" and \\"July\\" are irreplaceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst business on earth","review":"the worst customer service on earth!!!!it took 4 weeks to get phone calls returned ,i have spoken to 5 different persons that never followed up or sent a swatch sample as promised. a vangogh customer rep just hanged up on me and never said buy when i called him back he said he will e mail me the information(it has been 2 weeks and still waiting!!).it seems like the vangoh employees love too much their sofa to sell them,they making every effort to prevent from selling succeeded i finally gave up chasing them and spent my money somewhere else.overall a very bad experience with very rude and unprofessional people"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erudite Approach to Todays' Social Dilemmas","review":"Written decades ago by Oxford scholar and Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, this masterful epistle provides the solution to the social dilemmas of today's world in a most insightful manner, calling forth a spiritual re-awakening of mankind to its intrinsic natural state...no less than the recognition of the simple fact that mankind is one family and intelligent unity is its true station. World wide unity is no longer optional, but is now a mandate of the age in which we live. It is time for humanity to establish world peace and abandon the false standards which allow prejudices, inequities and apathy with its lack of understanding compassion tempered by a sense of true justice to prevail to the detriment and ruination of human dignity. This work calls us to the highest standard and makes it attainable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Valiant Effort That Falls Short","review":"Ms. McCullough is a gifted writer who is not afraid to explore different genres. Here, she posits a United States facing a 21st Century Ice Age (when she wrote it global cooling, not global warming was in vogue). As futurism, that is one heck of an intriguing premise. But the tale falls short. She posits a new Messiah (whose surname is the rather trite \\"Christian\\") and, as his protagonist, a witch of a government bureaucrat who \\"makes\\" the poor chump into an international icon. The story plods along until its rather predictable ending. Well, not every work can be a masterpiece, and it is unfortunate that this one didn't make it because it sure had potential.This being said, I would make a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I loved Colleen McCullough's Rome series, but this book is terrible. It's hard to believe the same author wrote these books. The characters are totally cheesy and one-dimensional, and the story lacks any subtlety.

Give the readers a little more credit for being intelligent and figuring out the biblical analogy on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't forget","review":"I read this years ago and am recommending it to my book club.

It is not offensive in my mind but others who take the Christian religion seriously may see this book as blasphemy.Others like me who are not so worried will find this an easy and entertaining read that will leave you feeling a trifle sad about the world she has created in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book from a talented writer.","review":"I began this book with much anticipation, having enjoyed many other titles by this author, but was terribly disappointed.

I am a herb enthusiast and I have been using and studying herbs for several years, so I fully expected not to learn anything new in this dvd but there actually were a couple things that were new to me. I will say that if you are new to using herbs that this is the herb primer for you! The dvd is not too long nor does it overwhelm you with information but rather focuses on a few easy things you can do at home. The beginning teaches you to recognize a few common herbs and a little about growing them. They move on to instructions for herbal teas, herb storage, herb butters,vinegars and tonics. Not only is this dvd educational but the West ladies are charming and a pleasure to watch. The beautiful country setting will make you long for a simple natural lifestyle and the West ladies will motivate you to fine tune your homemaking skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Clarity, Beautiful Remixes, Love it all the Way","review":"This is another Great Remix of Partons Music-----Of Course Much of her music is just remixed - but this is Digitally remastered, and the Quality can not be beat---"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and heart-lifting.","review":"I always know I've really enjoyed a book when I don't want it to end, as is the case with this book.

Now it looks like a black box with an ipod inside with the case flap hanging open, like the the shot provided....I don't know who it was at Belkin who thought they'd replace the snap with a plastic nub, but they made a huge mistake.I have to wonder if they even bother to test these things at all.Deeply Unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother","review":"Low budget sound loops and tones played against post 911 speeches of George Bush.

The production does make one think as it plods on and on until your almost biting your nails hoping there isn't a surprise bonus track. One thought I had was ... How many prepubescent kids have chopped up clips of GW the same way just for kicks? Maybe they should all make CD's too! Another thought that came to mind was of all the things I could have better spent my money on and how much can I possibly recover when I take this CD down to the local used CD store.

They say in the book world that if you don't catch your reader by the first chapter, you've lost. This book was very confusing to me and to move on to another of my favorite authors. However, I loved \\"Moving Target\\" and \\"Running Scared\\", both connected with the group \\"Rarities Unlimited\\". I thought this book, which is a part of the Rarities would be the same quality, but sad to say, it's not.A disappointed reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly Not Her Best","review":"This book was definetly not one of her best. To me, it seemed like the ending wasn't as developed as any of her other books and came to quickly. There wasn't enough details and the twists and turns the book has left me confused at times. I have been a fan of her books for years and have always bought them as soon as they came out but I am sorry that I bought the book in hardcover. I should have just waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't have to suck","review":"The writing was okay. I've read worse stories. The characters were not great. That was probably my biggest problem with the story. None of the characters had even the slightest ring of truth to them. Ian Lapstrake was the phoniest male protagonist I've seen in quite some time. Completely unbelievable. Almost romance novel caliber. In fact, the entire book has the feel of a romance novel that has been repackaged for wider appeal. Unfortunately, it fell well short of that appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started enticingly, then fizzled out","review":"I, too, enjoyed the 3 characters of Ian, Susa and the protagonist, whose name escapes just now. Wish the story had been more interesting. The ending was fairly predictable; anticlimactic.

It's not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"no suspense, no romance, no zing","review":"\\"Die in Plain Sight\\" was the second Elizabeth Lowell I read. The first, \\"The Color of Death\\" was very good, and I was hoping for more of the same.What I got was a fluffy piece with no suspense, no real drama, and characters that were so incredibly superficial they were nearly transparent. The hero in particular is hard to believe, given he is flawless in strengths, smarts and looks it makes him not very interesting to read. Even if he had a scar or SOMETHING that made him a little more tangible, it would have helped.The heroine, a zany new-ager painting prodigy, stumbles through life as a victim of happenstance. Her adventure is a jumble of hastily thrown together occurrences which happen to end with her being the protégé of a famous and beloved painter and engaged to the man of her dreams. Never did a character in a book have to work so little to achieve so much.A disappointment for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again","review":"I truly enjoyed Ian and Lacy, but something lacked in this story. I will say that the story line that has been appearing in your Rarities Series are starting to sound predictable which leaves the reader disappointed.

Mary Howard is a fine writer, with a subtle turn of mind and phrase. If you are looking for a quick-paced, mindless plot with lots of action, then look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a novel with a psychological twist on the meaning of memory and desire, \\"truth\\" and the way we all fit into our worlds, then this is the book for you. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Skillfully Written Page-Turner","review":"Each sentence is carefully crafted, each sentence gives me a clear sense of place and character, each sentence leads me to wonder and question what will happen next -- all that means a \\"great read\\" to me.

I didn't do that and don't you do it either because you'll miss too much of an intriguing story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, gripping mystery","review":"This novel is beauifully written and highly suspenseful. The characters are so well developed that every suspect is a sympathetic character -- which adds greatly to the suspense. I couldn't stop reading it! Howard is writing in the tradition of Dorothy Sayers and Ngaio Marsh. This is not what I call the \\"salted peanut, throw-away\\" type mystery, but rather a compelling novel about memory, envy, and denial. I recommend it to any reader who enjoys vivid language, memorable characters, and dramatic tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New York Times Book Review","review":"\\"The suspense builds from the first pages of Mary Howard's debut novel--a book so sure handed and graceful that you might forget it's a murder mystery...Howard creates an intricate cast of characters, any one of whom might have killed the artistic, flirtatious victim. Strong dialogue gives us insight into the shifting relationships here, and into Linda's marriage to Charlie, Luci's boyfriend at the time of the murder. Charlie thinks Linda is being paranoid. But the reader shares her increasing uncertainty about her friends, and her facts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it.","review":"This book is written in the present tense, and that drove me crazy.

I have no doubt that I would have really enjoyed reading this book if it wasn't for the style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Probably the worst book I have ever read.

This book was great! The main charachter, Aeriel, is a good one. This girl is quite normal. If you demand a macho-man hero for a main character, this book is not for you! This girl proves that with a strong heart and some good friends you can help save the world (or in this case, the moon) no matter how big you are. To me, that is true strength. If you haven't read this book, I encourage you to read all the books in this trilogy (make sure you read them in order.) It is a fun and gripping series. This particular book offers lots of hope for Aeriel's home. It is a suspensful and happy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel","review":"While it's true Aeriel isn't the strongest or most interesting female character ever, as mentioned in another review, the incredible imagination of the author more than makes up for Aeriel's shortcomings. I wish all fantasy authors could come up with such original, intriguing ideas. I especially liked the Sea of Dust (literally a sea!) and the apricoks. Wow. Thanks, Meredith Ann Pierce. It's not quite as good as The Darkangel, but very different, more new ideas and definitely a worthwhile sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Gosh. The darkangel was one of my all time faves.I didnt realise she'd written more, and I wish she hadnt.I havent read the 3rd yet, but hope it improves.There was too much action and magic and too many characters, everything was spread too thinly.

Not only the landscapes... but the animals, the creatures, the people! No character is flat or seemingly cardboard--they all have personalities, and flaws, and strengths.This is such a BEAUTIFUL tale that NOBODY should miss! The Darkangel comes before this novel... and Pearl of the Soul of the World comes after! :3I love this trilogy so much I re-read it every year or so ^^"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Oh...I loved this second book. A Gathering of Gargoyles is probably my favorite in the trilogy with Dark Angel coming in a very close second. Aeriel's journey is one full of self-discovery and it is very touching. I felt so bad for her with how Irralyth treats her and I can tell she truly loves him. In a strange way I also believed that he loves her but just cannot show it. I am seriously considering writing a companion piece to this book chronicling Irralyth's journey. I'm writing it just for fun because I want to write more of him. I found him to be an intrigue but fustrating character. Though I must say I loved how Aeriel grows during Dark Angel and A Gathering of Gargoyles.

Even though I've always enjoyed the Cary Grant/Irene Dunne version (MY FAVORITE WIFE), it's still just wonderful to have this Doris Day/James Garner remake. I particularly enjoyed the allusion to the older film and had forgotten this little extra touch of irony.

The opening exposition was bald and bland. Most of the characters were missing something. And the ending really really sucked. The most sympathetic character was Elena, the Russian wife (via Paris and Berlin) who was full of poetry and showed, that even though she knew what was going on, she was trapped in a drama that could never end well for her. There were some interesting ideas about painting and being an outsider and love in marriage and sex (and sexlessness) both in and outside of marriage. But it wound up being unclear because the ending refused to answer questions about the outcome of the characters. The lack of an ending was a major problem for most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travaler1 movies","review":"I wasn't impressed with this movie.

The Man and Woman (who Wes Craven both casted after seeing them in the TV series Twin Peaks according to IMDB) go all out in their roles and did a fine darn job!

Although it seesaws between horror and comedy it is definately worth watching. On the surface it is a high-octane thriller about a would-be robber (a thirteen year old boy named \\"Fool\\") trapped in a house that belongs to a cannabalistic brother and sister. But this film contains a deeper message--a brutal satire about social distinctions with the villians bearing a strange resemblance to Ronald and Nancy Reagen. A.J. Langer's debut is a good one as the \\"daughter-figure\\" who also finds herself trapped in this creepy house--but in a different sense. The supporting cast is great and the set design is perfect.

The People Under The Stairs portrays a wicked little \\"fun\\" house where the insane whims of a self righteous \\"family\\" reap havoc inside. The concept of this film is remarkably unique, with a sharp tongue-in-cheek humor wired throughout.This movie is not scary in the traditional, slasher-zombie-ghost story sort of way. Rather, it bases it's terror on the absurb (like a gun-wielding, S&M clad maniac), as well as the all too real, like the issues of child abuse and poverty.Craven really hit the perfect combination of elements in People Under The Stairs. The movie is visually compelling with freakish and surreal images, the acting is fun and devilishly brash, and the social commentary is obvious, but light-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The People Under The Stairs","review":"I have always liked this movie.

It was released on 01.25.2006, with both sides of the single being used on the soundtrack of the popular video game 'Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus'. The single peaked at #3 on the Oricon charts. This is a non-album single, meaning that it does not appear on any of Gackt's studio releases; however, it is scheduled to be included in his upcoming 'The Eleventh Day: Singles Collection' due out in late July, 2010. A limited edition was also released and includes a bonus DVD with the music video. Even to a huge Gackt fan (such as myself), 'Redemption really stands out as one of his better tracks and even though it's a pain to pay that much for a single with only 2 songs on it (not counting the instrumental/karaoke releases) it's definitely worth it to have the music.Tracks:1.

That is great, but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer! I taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version I taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv! In reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better VHS version and I would recommend that over this.

However, when Van Stratten goes out to interview people, they all turn up dead. SUSPENSE!The DVD looks exceptionally poor, mastered from terrible source material. But being an independantly financed Welles film, I'll assume there was little better in the way of source material. The distortion of the score is inexscusable, however.As in most Laserlight 'Special Edition Classics,' a black-gloved Tony Curtis gives an introduction.

His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer. The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad. It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly.

Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to \\"Angel heart\\"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer.

It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo \\"Delta\\" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term \\"special edition\\" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).Don't buy it.Maybe there's a better version (I read talk of a \\"Critereon\\" disc), maybe not.

The image looks horrid and the sound is not much better. Laserlight really just dumped the picture and ran. Is the film good? Yeah, it's not his best film, but it's still entertaining.

Although there are three versions, the 'comprehensive' version is the only necessary one. The movie has to be viewed as an 'indie' film, rather than a big studio release. Viewed in that light, the production values don't seem bad at all. Still, I'm rathere severe in my judgements of movies, and can only give it a \\"C\\"-rating. On the other hand, the extras in this set are so large that I give them a \\"A\\", making the whole package a \\"B\\". The characters are strongly drawn; the direction and photograhpy are excellent. And the improbabilities (such as Arkadin personally seeing to many distasteful activities) are not at all fatal to the story line.

But after a second and third listen I started to appreciate its subtilties more, and now think it is just as good if not better than No Angel.

So 'what's the problem?' you say.Well, to be honest, There's nothing particularly \\"offensive\\" about this album, but that's the problem - it's in no way challenging. It's just, well... bland. The lyrics are pointless, the melodies are overly naive and easily forgotten, and the chord changes just plain uninspired.If you want a good bit of background music, do yourself a favour and buy this album, but personally I'd recommend something with a bit more flair like Gillian Welch's Revival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd!","review":"Dido has done it again!

And Dido enjoyed the wave of success the album received ie. it gained more interest in 2001 and 2002. Over three years later, Dido releases a long awaited follow-up \\"Life for Rent\\". My first thought was \\"Why such a short tracklist after keeping fans waiting so long?\\".The first listen of \\"Life for Rent\\" left me thinking \\"this is a bit dull\\". But the second listen, the album began to take shape. The actual single \\"White Flag\\" becomes the least interesting track which is amazing in itself - perhaps it has suffered from radio overkill?Despite the many negative reviews of this album, I urge all Dido fans to buy the album and give it a chance. Upon second and third listen, all the tracks start to take shape. Just a pity we only get 11 tracks. I consider that after three years of waiting, fans deserve a few more."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was too similar and still lacking","review":"I found this CD a disappointment.

This album feels much more trip-hoppy than \\"No Angel\\", which to me had a more acoustic feel (even if it wasn't).My favourite tracks are \\"White Flag,\\" the title track, \\"Sand in My Shoes\\" (almost a club beat on this one!), and \\"See the Sun\\". Everything else is solid as well, though - \\"Who Makes You Feel\\" is the only one that drives me nuts (that sample!). These songs are meant for calm, and Dido's lyrical voice definitely doesn't hurt. Great writing music. :) Overall an extremely solid effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there an \\"L\\" missing?","review":"Some might say that would add a bit of excitement, but serious, I've always wanted to ask that question! I don't understand her name and certainly find it attention grabbing.

Makes for interesting marketing. Anyway, now that I've finally gotten THAT out of the way!On to the music, it's some of the best haunting music you will listen to, not irritating, a bit like Enya vocally, a bit like a dreamweaver. The only complaint I have is that she sounds a bit too much like Sarah Mclachlan, other than that she's got some good stuff on here.

I don't think this review will win an autographed pic or free cd, but frankly I don't care. Anyone with the ability to hear can attest to the fact that \\"Life for Rent\\" is a mundane, boring collection of pathetic, whinny ditties. The music is so whimpy that I'm embarrassed to own the cd. The melodies are bland, the music is redundant and the vocals are lax. The first single, White Flag sounds like elevator music. The most ironic aspect of this cd is the copy protection. Dido has no problem begging her fans for good press, but she blocks those who may have wanted to transfer the disc to their computer, mp3 player, or even to an interested friend. Dido appears greedy, this cd is the biggest sell-out I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would it really matter if Dido died?","review":"The answer is no. I like many different types of music, covering most genres. Dido's songs, however, are an exception. It amazes me that people purchase these records after hearing her music on the radio. To say it's wet is an understatement - her songs are so soft when listening to them I feel like someone's pushing a marshmallow in each one of my ears. The emotion is pathetic and not only pathetic... it's fake. Have you ever seen her interviewed? She's as common as nostrils. If you do purchase this album (which I didn't and never would, unless I knew I could make a profit from selling it) I strongly suggest you seek treatment for your emotional frailty - either that or get youself a new set of ears.

In the corporate music factories of the world, they remove emotion from music to make it more palatable to the masses; Dido must save them a lot of time and effort as she comes already emo-lite.Let's hope she settles down and starts a family soon as it is clear that music is her hobby , not her passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Music with Angelic Vocals","review":"Although I liked her \\"No Angel\\" album better, \\"Life for Rent\\" is pretty good. Her voice is subdued and airy and aside from the hit single, \\"White Flag\\", I loved \\"Who Makes You Feel\\"...It has a bluesy/jazz element to it and is very sensual. The beats in all her songs are great and her music is enjoyably minimalistic. She proves that sometimes less is more.

If you are expecting the same \\"catchiness\\" and full of \\"content\\" as the last, you may have to really dig deep, I can't find it. And, I really dig her too. (Plus, this cd?

Except the leading single, each piece here is boring to death and smells cheap inspirations.

Every song is great, including the \\"secret\\" ending song. The only song I skip is \\"Mary's In India.\\" It's slow, but certainly still not even close to bad or average. I skip it because all the other songs are so great.The best of the best on this album IMO are- White Flag, Stoned, Life For Rent, Don't Leave Home, Sand In My Shoes (favorite), See The Sun, and Closer. These are absolutely fabulous tracks and are such a joy to listen to. Any song from LFR would make a great single. It's to say that with any other album...I'm probably in the minority, but I think Life For Rent is a lot better than No Angel (which I heard after LFR)."},{"rating":"2","title":"They wonder why I'm sitting in my cube with tears in my eyes","review":"Once again, a gentle tribute to love's pain and freedom.

I liked the White Flag vocals but found the hook a little wimpy conceptually. It was an overplayed concept. The songs do not stay in my head or inspire me after the CD is done and I do not have the urge to put it back on again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up-Beat and Good for Any Mood","review":"Didnt listen much to Dido but fell in love with 'White Flag' on the radio...

I sure do ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Emotion","review":"I was not a fan of Dido until the Life for Rent CD came out. At the point where the lyrics to more than one song may as well have been hand written by myself, her songs hit a chord with me. I think that's the key to her music, relating to it. The beats behind her cool soothing voice are beautiful. Granted, there are other CDs with greater impact, but Life for Rent strikes at deep emotions with an honesty not always heard or felt in modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dido acoustic","review":"Dido returns with \\"Life For Rent\\", the follow-up to her debut album \\"No Angel\\". Similar to \\"No Angel\\", some tracks on the new album I will listen to over and over while the others I will likely not listen to ever again. White Flag (track 1) has been on the radio here for quite some time and definitely deserves a listen. I also enjoy the title track Life For Rent (track 3), Mary's in India (track 4), See You When You're 40 (track 5), Sand In My Shoes (track 8), and the incredible album finish See The Sun (track 11). Many of the tracks are an unlayered Dido singing over drum loops, accompanied by just keyboards and/or an acoustic guitar. The lyrics express a lot of shared heartbreak (tracks 4 & 11) and broken life expectations (track 3). There is also a 'hidden' track. See The Sun ends about 5:00 into track 11, and at about 7:04 another song begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is no \\"one hit wonder\\"","review":"I knew that Dido was here to stay and here is my proof! No Angel is still one of the albums I listen to often and Life For Rent will surely follow in the same footsteps.

Her voice is amazing, so calming, and soultry with exotic sounds. You can just picture a scene in your life, with every track on the cd. Some of my favorites are, White Flag, Stoned, and Sand in my shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"When I first listened to this CD, I thought it was really dull.

It's great to listen to when you're looking out the window and seeing what's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflective, not sombre","review":"The lyrics on this CD may be reflective, but they are not sombre or sad.

The world needs your music."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Song Does Not A CD Make","review":"The only good song on this CD is \\"White Flag\\". The rest of the songs are unpleasant to say the least and not what I expected from Dido. Her vocals are anemic and at times almost impossible to hear even when the volumn is turned up. I tried listening to the CD more than once in hopes that it would grow on me but instead it became more annoying and I put the CD in my charity pile to give away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it me??","review":"Or is the girl outstandingly over rated. From my estimation her voice is dull, monotonous, tedious and samish. Unfortunately I feel the same about her penmanship, her songs are morose and are so similair in nature that they bleed into each other. I find the sentiment behind them worryingly self indulgent too and suspect that this may be at the root of her mass appeal. I for one one am waiting only for her bubble to burst so she will go away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Give it up, Dido...It's been done before, and much better...Her name is Sarah McLachlan -by the way, don't try so hard to copy her mesmerizingm haunting voice cause it just DOESNT WORK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'1st Album Was SO Much Betta - This album isnt worth a rent!","review":"So sorry, but I despise this album.

Could somebody ask her to stop and get on with her life! A middle class dancing queen from Islington, a role-model for all those nice 30-somethings working in the City, who really always wanted to work in the music industry- because it is so hip and because they've once learned to play the piano- but never actually had the courage to as it is so very difficult to give up the lifestyle. And Financial Times. And the prospect of a banker-husband. So now they buy this cd instead. Safe and booooring."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear soothing vocals","review":"Very good album. Clear soothing voice with meaningful lyrics. Slow, without being depressive (like some \\"soothing\\" tunes). Great listening for chilling out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and worthwhile CD","review":"After purchasing her first CD a few years ago I fell in love with it. I just knew that I would have to get this one as well. It received fab reviews in People magazine, which are terribly hard to come by. I have practically worn out the CD as I listened to it over and over again while I refinished some furniture. She seems to take her music personally, as if it reflects something extremelly meaningful in her life. This CD will age well, so if you are considering adding this to your collection, do not wait any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sophmore Outing","review":"Dido gets major points for consistency, not the greatest vocalist, fair writing skills and yet she understands her skills well enough to maximize her abilities. The music here is very solid and consistent with her last outing. The writing again is fair enough to give some good stories for the music to support. Dido is great background fare and I do means this as a compliment. Sometimes, you need music and vocalists who work well behind the scenes of everyday life not as the focus, ladies and gentlemen I give you Dido."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome","review":"There is no better CD 've ever listened to that this one. It has everything. It makes you think, it makes you fell, and it makes you smile sometimes. There is not only one or tow songs that are good on this CD, every song has something special to it and you can listen to it again and again. The tracks are all of a different style, and you can relate every song on this CD to something in your life.Dido has an awesome voice, but she is an even better songwriter.This CD always fits with the situation your in and can be listened to again and agian. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Relaxing, Satisfing Music","review":"Wow, this a great album. I got Dido's first album a year or two ago for one song and fell in love with the whole album. Her voice is just so beautiful and I really appreciate a lot of her attitudes toward life. She's very free and that often is a breathe of fresh air in the world we live.Anyways, got the second album not expecting too much, and it blew me away. I love the cd. No need to fast-forward any tracks. My favorite track has got to be Life for Rent - the title track. It's got an excellent message and a catchy tune.I encourage you to go and get this album if you've liked any of her stuff. You'll love it. A lot of people are scared of buying a chic/pop album because it just doesn't look so macho, but hey - what's music really for? Enjoyment or status? You take your pick. But go for it if you like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better","review":"I will be one of the few who writes a negative review for this album, and I consider myself a Dido fan. Her debut album was wonderful. Therefore, I expected some great new stuff in this one. There is very little to none at all. No new ideas, no experimentation, no pushing the limits, not variety. Great filler material but nothing compared to her first work. Welcome to the world of commercial success, where you have to push creativity aside to keep the dough flowing. Dido decided to play it safe and remain very Dido'esque on this one. Yes, she is original; yes, she has special sound, but too much of it twice in a row gets a bit boring. Some nice Dido-like tunes, but no serious work here. Move along. Even the hyped White Flag is nothing special. Do yourself a favor and get it for $1 at iTunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sets The Mood - Very Relaxing - UpBeat","review":"Starts out with the hit WhiteFlag - and doesn't stop - its not really deep lyrics - just a variety of upbeat beats and clam music - like a re-invented enya - well maybee not that relaxing but you get the idea...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Music Critic","review":"Honestly no one's review that I read gave a reason why this cd was bad or good. Now if you noticed I gave it a 4 star rating, because compared to her last albulm there is some more emotional depth in this one than last. Instrumental-wise it might not be very strong, but notice this coming out of Arista Records, so its not as much instrumental focus. Now for 1-star, I'm not attacking anybody, but for heaven sake. I would hope this guy at least gives 85% of the other music we hear today worse than that. Seriously I'm not a dido fan, but I bought this CD. And even thats going out of my genre spectrum(Jazz,heavy metal,R&B, and Rap). I agree that i might be generous with 4 stars but come on look at a singer like Clay Aiken (notice I did not use artist) out there. Your telling me this is worse than that garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like this then you just didn't get it!!","review":"Well, coming from the UK and having read a few reviews for Dido's forthcoming album 'Life For Rent' I was all too ready to dismiss this album before hearing it... I finally gave in and bought it and am so glad I did! Firstly, if you're expecting another 'No Angel' then you will be deeply disappointed!This is very much a more raw, edgier and experimental album than 'No Angel' was; gone are the catchy choruses and polished production values and instead we get a myriad of eclectic styles which are all so poignant. Standouts are 'White Flag', 'Life For Rent', 'Do You Have A Little Time' and 'This Land Is Mine'. She is a singer/songwriter of the highest calibre and is to be treasured"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cool to be sad.\\"","review":"Life for Rent by Dido is just worth buying for three tracks, the first single, White Flag and the delriously good Stoned and See You when You're 40. The last two songs I mentioned are about 5 minutes each and they are brilliant and her best work to date. The rest of the album is awesome as well, Dido's voice is really soothing and I love her songwriting, very catchy and intelligent. Buy this album today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"I will admit that I was originally slightly dissapointed in Dido's second album. I only was instantly drawn to a few songs. I guess I had hoped she would have made a few more upbeat songs (#12 on her first for example). However, I found that the melodies did grow on me and once I actually LISTENED to the lyrics, the album actually started to become art. Now I have become quite attatched to the album, finding it a great CD to listen to while driving in the rain (it has that feel to it). I highly recommed it to anyone that enjoyed her first album, but be warned it is less \\"pop\\" sounding and more \\"real\\" than her first. Also, if you own it and it didn't instantly excite you, I do suggest you listen to it and actually LISTEN. You may be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Special Place and Time","review":"The FIRST Album by Dido that I own. For me a very personal and inmate album with a sensitivty of thought and feeling: perhaps akin to a period in my life. I listened carefully to the lyrics as much as the music. This is very sophisticated for a pop album. Cleaver is not the word to use for the song writing. This is more than cleaver. The lyrics and the music will hold a class beyond time. Its an album I go back to time and again...a MUST BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's no angel..but close to it","review":"at first listen, i thought this not as good as her debut..but after a few times.i was hooked..its definitely more poetic and subtle than no angel..the big difference i see is that the desperation and anger in dido's voice has been replaced with..dare i say it..an angelic one? thank god for artists like Dido ( fiona apple, tori amos, bjork, and norah jones) from saving us from the mediocrity of mainstream pop music"},{"rating":"2","title":"AGAIN!","review":"She's great.......again. This CD is one of the best I have. I really like it, specialy \\"Don't leave home\\", \\"Mary's in india\\", \\"Closer(Hidden track)\\", \\"Life for rent\\". I only don't really like \\"Stoned\\". It's as good as \\"No angel\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good second effort","review":"I am, overall, impressed with \\"Life For Rent.\\" I was expecting to give the album 5 stars, but I find myself just a bit disappointed with the album. I can't quite explain what it is; all I know is something is missing. I think the stripped down music is a bit of a jolt when compared to \\"No Angel.\\" Nonetheless, I am pleased with the CD. Standout tracks for me are \\"White Flag,\\" \\"See You When You're 40,\\" \\"Who Makes You Feel,\\" and \\"See the Sun.\\" I am not too impressed with \\"Sand in My Shoes\\"--sung too quickly for my taste. \\"Do You Have a Little Time\\" is MUCH better live, although it is nice here. Actually Dido live is better than any album.She should seriously consider a live album. She is a much better live performer than studio artist. The songs transform into something much more beautiful and haunting when she is on stage. Oh, the album!! I recommend it---you won't be disappointed :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice; although not as strong as her debut","review":"I very much like the new album. The songs carry Dido's trademark laid-back acoustic/chill sound. Dido deserves credit for being a very good songwriter. Her melodies are always pleasing and her lyrics are witty. That said, I find that the songs on LFR are much more similar in style to each other than the songs on NA. The music here just isn't quite as diverse. For example, there are really no harder-hitting songs like \\"don't think of me\\" or \\"take my hand.\\" Still, the music on LFR certainly has merit. \\"who makes you feel\\" is incredible with its tight and original instrumentation and swanky chorus. I think I'll always love Dido."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lackluster sophomore effort.","review":"I'm very disappointed. I had such hopes for this album-- I was infatuated with No Angel, Dido's first CD, when it came out. There were so many songs that had me addicted to her voice and melodies... But if you're hoping for another \\"Here With Me,\\" \\"Don't Think Of Me\\" or \\"Take My Hand,\\" you won't find it on Life For Rent.These songs seemed very lifeless to me. \\"White Flag\\" is dreamy enough for my tastes, but the other songs bored me, even the first time through. \\"Mary's In India\\" seems unfinished, or somehow under-constructed. Songs like \\"See You When You're 40\\" and \\"This Land Is Mine\\" are bland and similar-sounding. In fact, many songs on this album sound alike; not in a cohesive way, but in a tedious one.I really wanted to like this album, but it just isn't very worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im a big fan of Dido...","review":"She's an amazing singer and songwriter. I liked \\"life for rent\\" but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have the same flavour as \\"no angel\\". In this albumn, I feel that Dido has softened her music. Her ability to convey emotions and feeling through her music is still there but I felt that there was a lack of \\"edge\\" in her music. I kept expecting her to blow me away during a chorus (like how she wailed on \\"here with me\\" in the last minute of the song. now, THAT was amazing!), but I found myself being let down. However, Im recommending this album to any Dido fan anyway. I love Dido's voice and introspective lyrics. She is a musical genius and even with the softer, somewhat sadder sounds of \\"life for rent\\", Dido is sure to be a good listen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Change it if it isn't broke?","review":"This is a wonderful cd and a great follow up to \\"No Angel\\". This cd is a learning factor for record companies arista got it right when they signed Dido.Never change a great thing until it is broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smooth, very new, but maybe not fresh enough","review":"We all loved \\"Thank You\\" from dido on her last album. This album boasts of course the title track \\"Life for rent\\" and \\"white flag\\". Both are songs that have a good melody and beat. The album focuses more on acutal sound, than music. When dido sings \\"with\\" the music. It is definitley a very, very good album, there are just a few tracks that aren't very impressive. Lyrically Dido, is obviously trying to set a theme with this album, what that theme is, is not very clear. It could be her expressed love to an ex- lover. But you have to have your own opinion on that. As I said before, Life For Rent is a good album, but don't expect to be AMAZED when you hear it. It is a very relaxing album that anyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"If you enjoyed No Angel you'll definitely like this one. A much better album, Dido has extended her range and produced an album that is not quite as dark as her first one (at least I thought the first one was a bit dark).Track 10 (See The Sun) is interesting because at the end of the song there's about 2 minute's of silence, then you get a bonus track. There is no mention of this on the back cover or the booklet for the CD, however it's another great track."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, but it's No Angel","review":"It is a really good CD, although it's not as good as No Angel. Fans waited a long time for this, and I guess we were expecting something better. What we got was good, but it definately could have been a lot better considering how long we waited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard Dido on Tarzan...","review":"I didn't know Dido had come out with a second album and then I heard \\"White Flag\\" on the WB show Tarzan and ran out to get a copy.

I was blown away by it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"angelic voice","review":"For a pretty girl, with this angelic voice, who only wanted initially to make music that she could listen to in her car....she has done amazingly well with this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for accountants","review":"I don't usually get worked up about music and pretty much have a live and let live attitude. I can live with teenie stuff like Busted and Britney as it's clear that they're aimed squarely at kids. But Dido? This is classic coffee table music for the bland and the passionless. If it was a colour it would be beige. It's music for accountants.Some reviewers have called it a great/fine 'sophomore' effort. Soporific more like. Dido is the one female artist who makes the Corrs sound like L7 her music is that insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"my fault","review":"I was very dissappointed with Life for Rent.I purchased Life for Rent hoping that it would be another No Angel but willing to accept a more dancier album. With recent singles such as 'One Step Too Far' and Rollo working on the project I incorrectly assumed that the music would be driving.Nothing wrong with her music, I was more dissappointed because it wasn't what I thought it would be. Now I have a CD I opened and can't return. I doubt I will ever listen to it again.On a side note, I hope some of Europe's leading DJ/Producers get her in the studio because her voice is perfect for a dance remix. Not the soulful housey kind, but the dark techno type."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I give it one star for one good song!

And the trails he's chosen offer great variety--I usually hit the trail in spring with the easier ones then graduate to the tougher ones in early fall. But the best part, I think, are the maps.

This is a good one! The driving directions and hike maps are easy to follow and very informative. Each map stands alone with its own micro-legend. The rating system and elevation profiles provide a good starting point. There are gps coordinates for each hike for folks that know what to do with that info and for those who are just learning.

Amazing - I did not know John had been a fighter pilot or about a horrific accident on the carrier he served. - All he went through.Being a P.O.W. and some candid remarks he makes of moments he is not proud of in his life (but learned from).I recommend this documentary!!Scott MacNeil"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing Sarah Palin changed my vote.","review":"I always held John McCain in high regards. He even had my vote until he chose Sarah Palin as his running mate.

After seeing this Bio, I think I might have changed my mind sooner. There were alot of things presented in this bio that I did not know McCain had previously done. People can call him a war hero all they want. But he is little better than John Carrey. If I had seen this video sooner, it would not have changed my vote (considering I did not vote) bet it would have my mind up faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Written SO well, so detailed yet concise, packed with information and loads of photos. Definitely great if you're trying to understand the history of Bauhaus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmm... An educational book about design history.","review":"Let me begin by saying that this was a required book for a class I am taking. I probably would not have bought this otherwise. With that preface in mind... the book was pretty good. It gives a thorough history of the Bauhaus. That is why it gets high marks from me; it does what it was supposed to do.Now for the problems. The book reads like an art history book: very dry. A few of the students in my class had trouble getting past the first few pages. Second, the book is broken up into chapters based on content area. This makes it difficult to understand the whole timeline of the Bauhaus. I had to create my own timeline to help me understand the context of all of the information.To sum up, this book is not for casual reading. If you already know about the Bauhaus and want more details, you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to say hello","review":"A dreary adapatation of Hewingway's novel \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" by Selznick, starring Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones. It is a disaster that ended Selznick's career. Jennifer Jones at 38 is simply too old to play the heroine, who is supposed to be 23 or something. Hudson and Jones lack chemistry, and Hewingway's essence is nowhere to be found, this is a movie that was simply doomed. The Gary Cooper version is probably better. Selznick's decision to cast Jones was a fatal mistake. Don't bother to say hello to this movie, it might drain the spirit out of you, don't let the DVD cover of Hudson and Jones kissing fool you. This is a romance without any romantic elements, don't even compare this to \\"Gone with the wind\\", which is Selznick's calling card."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER AGE JENNIFER","review":"...Hemingway would have nothing to do with this adaption from his novel but the main criticism levied at Selznick is his wife at 38 was too old to play a young British nurse in Italy during WW1 opposite Rock Hudson as the American male nurse.The landscape and battle scenes were good but he was not being realistic casting his wife in this role.Selznick was still lookong for a sequel to \\"Gone with the Wind\\" which he had previously just failed with in \\"Duel in the Sun\\", but this film drags and the birth scene despite edits, remains too long.So much of the plot seems to have been truncated and reduced to a mere orthodox love story so there is not enough in the plot to sustain the time it runs.Incidentally the year \\"1932\\" that hangs as a title above is incorrect.This filmed version was made in 1957.I believe the Gary Cooper version was made in 1932 and in B&W not in colour as here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun films for kids","review":"This pack has the Land Before Time films #s 5-8. My preschooler especially enjoys #5: The Mysterious Island, and #8: The Big Freeze. The only film I thought was particulary lame is #7: Stone of Cold Fire. That one has a particularly poor storyline, the music is a bit too melodramatic, and the supporting acting is just a bit too over the top in my opinion. The other 3 films are pretty good and there are even some scenes that can still make me laugh after already seeing them probably 100 times at this point. I don't think I've met a kid yet that wasn't entertained by the majority of the Land Before Time films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"We have the whole series.

But, when I did, I couldn't believe what I was reading. Some of the stuff was a bit too graphic especially about the bordello incident. Too much information!I'm not saying that everyone should be perfect either but come on! I guess that type of life comes with the territory especially when you're in the music business. I really felt sorry for Linda Evans because she deserved a man that could really be \\"there\\" for her and not be so full of himself. There are alot of \\"takers\\" out there in this world and very few \\"givers\\".Overall, I wish now that I hadn't bought or read the book because I would have rather kept my good opinion of Yanni."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yanni In Words book","review":"After several weeks waiting for this to be mailed out - it never arrived. Must have gotten lost in transit. Seller did immediately refund my money which I appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My review is a bit biased because I am a true Yanni fan that has been very moved by his music. His book is a candid look at the artist with fascinating details of the music business and the arduous road to stardom. Yet I have found its greatest value in the example of Yanni's pluck, drive, and determination to create his own musical genre and to have it heard even against insurmountable obstacles. A true \\"believe in yourself\\" kind of book that will encourage the reader to appreciate their own journey and to live with no limits. While his words can never compete with the depth of emotion and awakening his music gifts the listener, it is still a fascinating read of an exemplary life. Hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has no soul","review":"A thoroughly bland book, written in a matter-of-fact, flat narrative -- sorely lacking depth and dimension. There is no sign of introspection or personal reflection, only Yanni's inflated ego. The book is a simple-minded retelling of his life. Yanni's self importance and arrogance lurk throughout. While he purports to \\"tell it like it is,\\" it is apparent he is most concerned with portraying himself in a certain light. Even when he talks about things like his rock 'n roll days, he makes sure he doesn't come off looking too bad, i.e. \\"every one was doing it then\\" and \\"I was always upfront with the girls before getting intimate with them.\\" (Hmmmm). It seems his ego is such that he can't really reflect upon his own weaknesses and mistakes - he can only make excuses. His memory and accounts of some of the facts in the book are equally biased and inaccurate. One can only hope that he isn't as monochromatic and one-dimensional in his own mind as he comes off in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Work!!!","review":"...I have found that this guide documents alot of the climbing at Vedauwoo very well, but misses the mark entirely in some cases. After getting to know the long time local climbers it is really sad to find out that Skip Harper has taken lots of liberties with renaming routes, or assigning grades to routes that he abviously has not done. I give his book a two star rating just because of the lack of investigation in some cases and the complete disregarding of history that he puts forth in his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK ON THE TOPIC","review":"This is the best book ever written on independent film. I wish I could give it move than 5 stars, because Celluloid Mavericks is a pure pleasure to read: witty, informative and always extremely entertaining. No other book comes close to its breadth and detail, especially in regards to the previously uncharted territory between 1896 and 1960. This is my all-time favorite film book, well deserving of its many raves reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"among the best film books","review":"This is a very thorough book. I liked the way it covered most everything from the lowest trash to the highest art--as long as it was made outside of Hollywood. Whether or not you're a film fanatic, this is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive book on non-studio cinema","review":"This is an excellent history which covers everything I love: offbeat art films, sexploitation, documentaries, cult flicks, EVERYTHING that Hollywood doesn't dare to make from \\"The Birth of a Nation\\" to \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" I was continuously astonished at how complete this work is and how well it reads. The gobs of rare photographs throughout and informative sidebars also work real well. Put simply, I love movies and I love this book. It's scholarly yet very, very cool. Like the cliche goes, I couldn't put it down. (And now I have a list of about 250 movies to see!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"It's my favorite tea and no grocery stores have it near me. I have to order tea on-line, which seems crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muted story","review":"In Deadeye Dick, the underlying messages shine through Vonnegut's words, the morals of innocence, the corruption of being etc. etc.But Vonnegut forgot one thing in this book. The story. What is in his other books a perfect mixture of story and the underlying morals, here it is a decidedly lop-sided affair. The story is very unengaging and I found it quite tedious, to be frank. And unfortunately, it went downhill after an ok-ish start. Thankfully, those recipes he throws in very frequently at the first part of the novel are toned down because what was a good idea would have turned into an annoying one if continued too frequently.This is the most disappointing Vonnegut book I've read so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight wacky but hey, we're talking Vonnegut","review":"Deadeye Dick is the kind of thing that your average person might write after a prolonged lack of sleep when the 'giddies' sets in. It doesn't entirely make sense, and some of the themes are a little wacky, but it is still very entertaining and fun to read. Vonnegut manages to use plenty of his traditionally biting humor throughout the book and deals with neutron bombs, eccentric artists, criminal coverups, and life after Ohio is obliterated. I am already biased because I am a big fan of Vonnegut's style of writing, but I found the book to be consistently interesting and can't wait to get another of his books"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his surprises.","review":"I happen to be in a Kurt Vonnegut stage a few years back and was reading through his more famous books when I came upon this one. I think this is one of those little surprises in his career. Much as Vonnegut's work is this wonderful mix of sadness and humor, pain and suffering with a sprinkling of depressing . I can only say this about Deadeye Dick. There are moments, sentences, coincidences in this book that I remember years later, when I've forgotten many of the specifics of his better known (and for me 5 star) books. It's because of those moments, those things that stay with you, that I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think the book's strong points are.","review":"I loved it. While this is not Vonnegut's most powerful book, this is still a great read. The characterization of Rudy Waltz (aka \\"Deadey Dick\\") is touching and funny. Vonnegut's absurd tale of Rudy Waltz's accidental shooting of Eloise Metzger could happen to anyone. I also liked Vonnegut's X-Files touch of having Rudy's hometown of Midland City, Ohio hit by a neutron bomb explosion that probably came from the government in attempt to oppress it's people. Vonnegut's book offers something for every reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"As much as I love Kurt Vonnegut, I failed to be moved by this book. It lacks the energy needed to hold the plot together, and it was only a vague curiosity and feeling of obligation which kept me from abandoning it halfway through. Hardcore Vonnegut fans may appreciate it regardless, but for anyone else I would recommend The Sirens of Titan (my personal favorite) or one of Vonnegut's many other wonderful novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This is not among Vonnegut's best. The plot rambles, the jokes aren't very funny, and above all it's pretty depressing, and lacks meaning. I would recommend Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse Five, but this one is best left unread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Galapagos was worse","review":"With so many books under his belt, Vonnegut was bound to write a dud. The characters and storyline were boring.

While not one of his best works, it's quintessentially Vonnegut\\" Life in Ohio, suicidal mothers, massive destruction and loss of life. No Kilgore Trout though. What I liked the most was how one doctor had proscribed speed to many of the people in town, and how they were all starting to lose it. The doctor's wife, especially, in one scene, tears up a pharmacy wigging out trying to get a refill. Sounds like most of the people I grew up with back in the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is everyone's problem?","review":"Do I agree with the order of the top 100? No, not necessarily but it is not my top 100 or yours. If you don't agree and you think you know, write your own book. This book is about the 100 people he feels are historically the most important and he gives good information on wrestlers and includes American, Canadian, Mexican, Japanese, and others. Plus there are many wrestlers who were way before our time who may have paved the way for others. It gives good insight of all the wrestlers so just enjoy the book and figure out your own top 100.

Slow. Dang slow. Really, really slow. So slow a lot of the Water Music takes a while to even recognize. It would be interesting to get a better understanding of the cultural context here--Baroque was not commonly played anywhere in the middle of the last century, back when Haydn and Mozart were considered quaint and lesser known spirits were known only by scholars. Heck, the Four Seasons was new to everyone! Not anyone's fault, most music before 1700 is a complete mystery to modern-day listeners.Regardless, listening to this, after years of hyperactive baroque performances, is a lot of fun. Easy listening almost. Recommended to the curious and--seriously--to those who think of Classical music as something to unwind to, or put on in the background when working.

His style of writing is pondering and lacks the zip of the pop culture, but his theories and the subsesequent content is the freshest, most probably of any I've heard, and sure does explain a lot of what we could only shrug about before. With another good writer or editor and a reprinting I think Patten's two primary books could really shake up the status quo. Like he said, the evidence is not as much found in looking down, but up. I imagine our scientists could learn much more if they could think outside the box they've put themselves into.

This is a book that Machen cites in his classic, so it gives you a sense of how old it is, but it is quite useful. This is the smallest Greek text book I have ever seen (it literally fits in one's back pocket) but the font for a lot of it is really not too small, so it is a useful text to carry around. It contains all of 1 John, the Lord's Prayer and 1 Cor 13, so on top of everything else it can be used for a tYPE of portable NT Greek prayer book. It has the complete grammar and seems to actually use the same paradigm charts that Machen would later use. The exercises are all from the NT but are short and the glosses are kept to a minimum.

This film is tweaked more than a little - but it's not bad, and a lot of the dialogue is lifted directly from Wade Davis' book.

Easily one of the best albums of 2004, and one of the few hyped up albums that lives up to that honor. This is nice electronica music. It's hard to describe, but it's very chill, but not just chill. I think of it as a chill album in a way because the vocals are very calming and so are the beats and the soundscape of the music in general. Some will love it, others won't.

Jackie Collins is what I would call a great storyteller, she literally took me by my hand and lead me into this world that she imagined and soon, I was her willing captive. This book has it all, love, sex, tradegy, joy, the good, the bad, the heart wrenching; it is one of the best books I have read in such a long time. I highly recommend it!

At its heart, Chances is a story of the relationship (or lack thereof) between a father and his daughter; not to mention the repercussions of their life choices. This book is also a great historical novel that begins in 1913 takes us through prohibition, the founding of Vegas, through 1979. In between there is love and loss, children born, loved ones killed and a rollicking good time. Of all Collins' novels, Chances remains her best example of character development and well-developed plotting. The story hooks you from page one and charcters are the kind that actually make you root for them to succeed.

I peeled the sticker off so the name of it does not show.I think this company should stick to making electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Kenton had a few good albums in the 1970s and this isn't one of them. In fact, this is perhaps the weakest due to the material and the performances. The band is extremely sloppy (especially the trumpet section), the saxes are under-recorded, and everyone, including Kenton, sounds like they can't wait for it all to be over. You might feel the same way after a listen.I have this CD because I'm a Kenton completist, but there are some worthwhile moments, like \\"Body and Soul\\" (that's completely out of place on this record), and Peter Erskine lays down a nice groove behind the trumpet solo on \\"Blue Gene.\\" \\"Being Green\\" would've been a nice dramatic chart if not for the embarrassing, monotone group vocal...just try and concentrate on the flugelhorn solo in the background of the middle eight.Fans of rockish stage band charts will like this album, but put purists be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenton goes funky!","review":"I am often disappointed by Kenton albums, but two of his albums stick out as amazing... and this is one of them. The recording quality is amazing and captures the vitality of a well rehearsed and very able funky big band. Blue Gene is the funkiest big band tune I've ever heard... absolutely brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another post-prime Kenton let down","review":"I got this as a gift because I enjoy Stan's work. What a bummer. Any true Kenton fan knows that when Rugolo and Maynard left, Kenton never had original stuff anymore, and this album was an attempt to make another ill-advised come-back. If you like Kenton, get the Progressive Jazz albums cut before 1950."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive text on boatbuilding","review":"The Boatbuilding Manual is essentially a text book, in all sense of the word, of boatbuilding. It's a great introduction to boatbuilding for beginners and amateurs. If you're looking for a quick, purely instructional guide to building a seacraft, this might not be your cup of tea. But if you are looking for an in-depth, well-researched and well-presented book building a boat, then you have the right book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Introductory Text","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction and reference work on the art of boatbuilding. Although I would love to see Mr. Steward do an online version of the book so that the techniques and materials would remain up-to-date, his methods and materials are time-tested and proven to work as is. There is no better work for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and enjoyable...","review":"John Keegan is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors, and with good reason. \\"History of Warfare\\" and \\"The First World War\\" were tremendous books, with fantastic research and probably the best writing I've read from many a history writer (it's fluid, concise with only the occassional straying, and precise).This book details what Keegan considers to be the four major styles of leadership, using Alexander the Great to personify Heroic Leadership, the Duke of Wellington as the Anti-Hero, Ulysses S. Grant as the Un-Hero and Adolph Hitler as the False Hero.The history is very well researched, and the discussion very interesting. The most fun for history buffs lies in arguing with Keegan and his choices, though in the end, I find his choices were as good as any I could come up with.Highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book on leadership","review":"Keegan writes a very informative book about not only differing leaders and leadership styles, but the different needs for various leadership styles throughout history. The changes in the way that war is fought altered the traits that made good leaders of armies. His analyses of Wellington, Alexander, Grant and Hitler are insightful. My favorite book by Keegan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, succinct, and thought-provoking.","review":"I have always viewed fans of military history with suspicion, having known too many who are weapon-fetishists, power-worshippers or simply ghouls. Fortunately for me, a sane, gentle friend read and recommended this book (thanks Mike Malcolm, where ever you are), introducing me to a now favorite author. MASK analyzes and contrasts the military leadership of four men: Alexander, Wellington, Grant and Hitler. Each profile is fascinating in itself, but what impressed me profoundly was the final chapter, in which Keegan brings everything together, enumerating the \\"imperatives\\" of military authority throughout history, and finally asking how those imperatives can be met in the nuclear world, where the civilian population is on the front lines and generals must necessarily \\"lead\\" from behind. I recommend this book (and all Keegan's work) wholeheartedly to anyone who would never dream of reading \\"military history\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Book on Leadership","review":"Keegan does a fine job looking at what makes a good leader. Keegan is an excellent writer and prehaps the premire military historian of our day. The book looks at how a general must be a good communicator in order to be successful. Anyone interested in military history will enjoy this book. I especically like how he used examples from throughout history. The Ancient World, the Civil War, Napoleonic times etc. If you like military history, then you will like Keegan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book uses outdated concepts proven to be ineffective.","review":"This book will try and convince its readers that they have some sort of mythical disease of addiction. For years and millions of dollars the organization of NIDA has tried to prove that such a disease exists but has failed to do so. This book also goes on to claim a non-religious stance but yet suggests a contact with God be established. It is supposed to be a book that tells all how to end their addictions but yet never mentions how in one of its 'twelve steps.' I feel this book would do well in the fiction, faith healing, and how to be a cultist sections, but other than that, it is worthless. I only give it a two as opposed to a -2 because some of the stories in the back are quite humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hocus Pocus","review":"Just more of AA's nonsense only replacing alcohol with drug. Still asking the reader to become a we people and give up their identity to that of an addict--for life. No where in the book is it shown how to end an addiction other than a suggestion to turn our will over to any god \\"we\\" so choose and do a bunch of silly busy work. Same boring stories that try to sell the program using an emotional slant.Just another attempt to proselytize folks into a religious and spiritual program. \\"The Real AA\\" by Ken Ragge and \\"The Diseasing of America\\" by Stanton Peele are must reads before selecting a recovery book, especially this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Strokes for Different Folks","review":"Does the NA Basic Text work for some people? Of course it does. This book is well-written and practical. The only thing that I would suggest is that if you are in recovery, you check out all of your options. Another book I would suggest is The Small Book by Jack Trimpey. It is based on a program called Rational Recovery. Also, if you are going to get into Narcotics Anonymous, it can't hurt to pick up The Big Book(the \\"basic text\\" of AA). But, overall, this is a must-read for anyone addicted to anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A START OF RECOVERY-A LIFE TIME OF HOPE","review":"I had no one or no place else to turn when I picked up this book.

They might call it \\"Hocus Pocus\\" or refer to it at spiritual jibberish. To them I ask, \\"Why then has this program helped millions get clean and stay clean?\\" It you struggle with drugs (alcohol and marijauna included) then read this book. Miracles do happen and it will happen for you if you want it. I dare say that all of us, whether we struggle with an addiction or not, can benefit from the principles laid out in this book. Certainly it is geared toward the addict, but these are life principles none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter loves dinos","review":"My four year old granddaughter loves this 9 volume set of \\"Land Before Time.\\" She has learned valuable social interactions from watching the characters interact.

Stick with the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches children bad behavior","review":"My almost-three-year-old had been watching these movies for weeksand I didn't figure out until recently that they have been teaching him bad behavior. First of all, one of the little dinosaurs screams constantly throughout these videos and this teaches little kids to scream just to make noise. The movies are also filled with smart-alec, bratty language that kids watching it will pick up on, like: \\"See you, wouldn't want to be you\\", and screaming, \\"Its not fair!\\" while stomping their feet. One of the movies has a scene where the kid dinosaurs are going to \\"Show the grown ups that we aren't babies anymore\\" by disobeying their parents and venturing into a dangerous swamp that they were told to stay out of.There are so many good children's movies out there that teach good values and behavior. This is not one of them, however, andas a parent I recommend not bringing it home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of cinema","review":"This movie was shockingly great, Gary Oldman excels in one his first and only comic roles, and with cameos by Micheal J.

All he gets is a trip in an unexisting road with mysterious people, some of them are good actors like Patrick Swayze or Ann Margret (what is she doing here?). In fact, the movie explains how a boy becomes and adult and a risponsible person with an inmature script. You better forget this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film that makes You wonder every time You watch it","review":"Excellent film; it has a degree of reality, meta-reality and fantasy in it. It has a conclusion(s); you decide what these are. This is not a typical Holly Sci-Fi with a typical action/adventure common factor. It makes one wonder and ponder about everything one perceives every day. It reminds people how important small decisions may be. It ridicules what we \\"learned\\" to accept as something \\"normal.\\" Again, this is an excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"It has the feel of one of those 50's instructional videos. It's very predictable and horribly cheesy. It has a few good ideas in the story but those ideas are badly portrayed and the actors say their lines like they are just lines. They swear a lot but not out of strong emotion maybe just to give the movie a rough feel which it fails at doing. I hated it. It was horrible. If you're thinking it's worth a shot it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cute movie -- nothing more.","review":"A formulaic fantasy movie that's been done before, but mildly amusing nonetheless. not the kind of movie that you'd like to see more than once, however, because you've seen the formula before in other movies. If you've never seen this movie before, it can provide a mindless distraction for about 90 minutes, but don't expect anything original or profound.The reviewers who give this movie the type of rating that should be reserved for \\"Citizen Kane\\" really need to get a clue, or perhaps they just need to outgrow their teenage years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interetate 60--Never shipped","review":"I placed the order and then several weeks later I got an email saying the order had been canceled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Glowing Reviews.","review":"This is probably (easily) one of the worst films I have ever seen. There are many fine actors in this film, but the script is undeveloped and boring. It's pretty obvious that filmmakers, producers, and studios are using venues like this to place fake positive reviews for their own films.If you read review after review that has statements like \\"This film is a gem, vastly underrated,\\" \\"It's a must-see,\\" or uses the phrase \\"excellent film\\" more than once in the same review, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Not the Worst Film Ever Made","review":"Bow wow. The protagonist's 'gosh gee whillikers' presentation might be appropriate for a 12 year old; here it just seems bizarre.

Therein lies the tale. Barbash and Lutnick have artfully exploited the suffering of others -- one to write a book (and to promote a novel), the other to strike an innocent pose. It worked! Look at the reviews that blindly defend the book and charge that any criticism of it is tantamount to insensitivity toward the victims of 9/11!This is wonderful propaganda indeed, and if I were to grade it on that scale the book would get five stars. Lutnick's obsession with looking good and Barbash's equally atrocious commitment to whitewashing exploits grief as it turns anger onto others. Sickening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"The book is riveting to read. It is full of the emotion; of family, friends and employees who either lost loved ones and/or co-workers inside the North Tower of the WTC. No Cantor employees in the building survived. Some fel guilt because they did not go to work the day of 9/11. It is a story about those dark days when all was feared lost. The CEO desscribes how he felt during this time and the guilt he felt about not being at work that morning (took his son to 1st day of kindergarten).

However, these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase. The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material, I was shocked and in disbelief. Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time. Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly? Now I have the joy of sending them back. I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions, not sure why the hesitation. I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid shoes","review":"These shoes are great for walking, good staple for any wardrobe.

They went from the East coast to the Midwest, and were five miles from my house on Friday, but UPS charges extra to deliver on Saturday. If I had known there would be an extra charge, I would have paid it, but wasn't given the option. The shoes arrived on Monday, the day after the wedding. I emailed the company to voice my displeasure, and was informed that I actually received them before I was supposed to! My advice, great shoes, great prices, just make sure you plan ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome shoe... poor service","review":"I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue.

Not to mention, they were VERY fairly priced. They came in a day early. Which, I was extremely pleased about. But, they managed to send me a size 10 in mens. I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens. So, they are not one, not two, BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG. I loved the color, and the price, and the shipping time. I was extremely disappointed in the size. Four sizes is a bit ridiculous. One or two isn't as bad. For such a horrible mistake, they are NOT getting 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product","review":"The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered.

I expected them to be made in China. They looked real...but upon very close inspection, I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger. The real converses' are pointier and smaller. The material also feels cheaper. Another dead give away was the color. The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color. This one is more of a faded navy blue. There are tons of fake converse out there, some look almost like the real thing. I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website. Hey, maybe even the seller didn't know. Like I said, no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it, but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know. I suppose these'll fall apart within a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I bought these for powerlifting, as an alternative to much more expensive lifting shoes. They are legal in the organization I lift in, and they are exactly what I need. The flat, thin sole is perfect for squatting and deadlifting with stability and safety.I could see durability of these shoes being a problem IF they were worn as an everyday shoe, i.e., outside, or to work / school. The canvas material is thin, and this is by no means a rugged pair of shoes. But for what I uses them for - strictly in the gym - they are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party idea became a great shoe to wear","review":"Got this pair for my girlfriend as I got a pair myself for a themed party we had and well party is over and we are still rocking them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes!","review":"My husband loved them.

I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another, someone in my home owns a pair. My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas. The picture of the \\"unbleached\\" pair, looked white, so I purchased them. When the box arrived, I wrapped it and placed it under the tree. Can you imagine my disappointment (and most importantly, my son's), when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck's?DO NOT BUY This \\"unbleached\\" color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time, sizing was as issue, as well. Runs almost a whole size larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"run very large","review":"these shoes are classics and I can't fault the style. My son actually wore them for a wedding (with suit and all), however, they run large (long) and had to be sent back. I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size. We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5. It cost me $12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake. Always get free return shipping where you order.

My manfriend and I are huge fans, so I scooped him up this blacked-out pair for work (he is a bartender). Not only do they look good, but they are holding up magnificently, showing little signs of age, despite all the mixers, juice, and other bar sludge that they see on a regular basis. And because of the canvas, if they do start to smell like the floor of the bar, in the washer they go! Pricing and delivery on these bad boys was on point and I would not hesitate to get another pair from this distributor again.And, if you do not own a pair of Chucks, get on the wagon and buy a product created in the USA, my friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I got them today around the time they said they would be here.

Robinson Movies","review":"I am a huge fan of Edward G.'s, so I admit I'm biased. However, \\"Scarlet Street\\" is one of the finest examples of film noir I've ever seen. The camera work is extremely clever, using mirrors to reflect images that would not otherwise be seen if shot head on. It certainly gives the viewer a different perspective. There is a great story line here, and lots of suspense. \\"The Stranger\\" is a suspenseful war crime story with Edward G. Robinson playing a \\"Nazi hunter\\". In my opinion, this is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie, horrible edition on a DVD-R","review":"This is a great movie and the second version of this I have bought on DVD. I was mislead on the \\"remastered\\" part of the description. The video quality is worse than any version I have seen broadcast. This edition is a DVD-R. It looks as bad as a third generation VHS tape. I have the Ovation one as well, and the video quality is pretty poor, but it is MUCH better than this, and cost much less as well. I have thrown this one in the trash. What a waste of $14.95.TCM showed a vastly better version that I caught a few minutes into the movie, so better quality versions exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wells was a ham on purpose","review":"He realized Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young could steal films from others easy so he had to make sure his character (who isn't in every scene) counted for a lot. Besides he maintains quite a stiffness through several scenes to make sure his Rankin-Nazi character never becomes too likable (unlike Charlie Kane in Citizen Kane). As for the plausability of the plot. It may interest everyone to know gangster Al Capone's own brother, Richard Hart, was bodyguard to President Calvin Coolidge in real life. Excellent film with (then) state-of-the-art camera angles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware-Scam DVD","review":"Buyer Beware! This so called collectors edition is a fake. The transfer is godawful, especially for such a high price and the special feature is non existent! While it is a fine fine film, it fell into the public domain and this company seems to have downloaded it from a VHS transfer and is now trying to scam the public into thinking it is a \\"collectors edition\\". Please don't buy this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film-Noir from Orson Welles","review":"Legends like Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson working together is always awesome to see. Add in a supporting cast that includes Loretta Young and a storyline that is fascinating to say the least, and what you have is \\"The Stranger\\", a Film Noir thriller. In a \\"Cat-and-Mouse\\" game, Robinson and Welles chase down a former Nazi who is held up in a small town in Connecticut. As the wife of Welles, Loretta Young as a pretty difficult role but her performance is credible and as important to the story as any. It's all about \\"time\\" in this movie so pay attention to the use of the clock tower, along with related time themes. Sure to please, The Stranger is great Film Noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a very tight movie and is very typical of Orson Welles style. Heis the director, and while it is not \\"Citizen Kane\\", it is a very goodmovie."},{"rating":"2","title":"POST-NAZI FILM","review":"This is a post-World War II 1946 film starring well-known and talented actors. A notorious Nazi war criminal escapes to America, becomes a teacher and marries a local woman. But as the plot unravels, a federal agent is hot on his trail and the rest is an exciting, suspenseful story. I liked it and would recommend it to others. The photography and lighting is innovative and adds to the drama of the ex-Nazi getting his just reward for his evil acts against humanity. I imagine the satisfying ending in 1946 movie theaters got a loud cheer of revenge from the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stranger - Disappointing Blu-ray Quality","review":"My rating is not for the movie (which I like very much *****), but for the lack of HD quality. Although I was very much looking forward to watching this movie in the upgraded Blu-ray format, I was extremely disappointed in the picture quality. This Blu-ray version is extremely soft and overly bright, and lacks HD image depth throughout. Bottom line - because there is no noticeable upgrade in picture quality, if you already own MGM's 2007 release on DVD there is no need to purchase this Blu-ray version. Let's hope Citizen Kane & Magnificent Ambersons Blu-ray releases will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Photograpy, Illogical Plot","review":"Amateurish and outdated by today's moviemaking standards, although the black and white photography with dramatic lighting is, indeed impressive. The plot, however, has very serious logical flaws which renders it to the realm of the unbelievable. Perhaps worth seeing for the nuanced performance of Edward G. Robinson--who, for some odd reason, looks exactly like Charlie Chan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Contrived, I Think","review":"Edward G. Robinson is a Nazi hunter, hot on the track of one of the Big Guys. The trail leads to a sleepy college town, and don't you know it, that new German professor Orson Welles, the one that's getting married tonight to Loretta Young, he's the guy! Wow. Seems there's a few strangers around this place. Who is this Edward G. Robinson guy, asking a lot of questions? Who is this German professor guy, with his tell-tale clock obsessions? But strangest of all is the terrible over-the-top performance of Loretta Young. She starts as the happy go lucky bride, but in no time flat is popeyed and hysterical--she's starting to resemble poor Basil Rathbone in \\"The Son of Frankenstein\\". Maybe you should watch it anyway, if only to check out the ultra absurd clock tower climax==that's one way to wind up a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loretta Young Drives The Stranger !","review":"Loretta Young was Hollywood Royalty. In the Stranger with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson she gives a luminous performance. This is a real thriller as the Nazi is tracked to the small town where the action takes place. See it for an unforgettable film. True Stars,talent,and a great film. I loved it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value in toddler swimwear","review":"I was extremely pleased when this product arrived super quick, just in time for my daughter's weekly swim class. She's been wearing the suit for nearly two months and it is holding up nicely - the material still looks new even after many dips in the pool. One of the snaps along the leg seam no longer snaps securely but the others hold well. That is my only complaint. Otherwise, a great toddler swim suit, and the price was definitely right."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this suit!","review":"I love this suit! I was looking for a suit for my 4 month old.

However, for us, on first attempted use, the snap for the top strap broke. Not impressed with the quality, nor with the foam used behind the ears, which come in direct contact with player's skin instead of having a wicking fabric cover. Seller is providing replacement strap at no charge, after which we will see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Tragic yet hilarious, \\"The Color of Summer\\" is a bitter frolic through the lives of homosexuals in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Opening with a stunning 50-page play, the farce continues to sing throughout the remaining pages. The ill-fated sojourns of so many characters are detailed, but always with a willingness to see the humor within the suffering of men who seek pleasure despite the risk of punishment by a tyrant and his faithful firing squads. A nice piece of political commentary aimed at the seat of Castro's olive-green pants, \\"The Color of Summer\\" reveals the leaks in the dictator's \\"air-tight\\" oppressive regime, leaving Castro at the center of ridicule. With wonderful character development, gleaming threads of honesty appear within the blanket of mischeivous men whose tales are told in the most amusingly crass manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raunchy, irreverent, Reinaldo","review":"This is one of the most unusual and wonderful books that I have had the pleasure of reading. This book begins with a play then has many small chapters, filled with wit, humor, and all manner of unbeleivable images. Reinaldo makes no apologies for his sexual leanings, or spare the feeling of the dictator Fifo (Fidel Castro) or his brother Raul. Many people are mentiond by name, and many have mulitiple names, sometimes male, sometimes female. This book is enertaining, tittilating, and wonderful. I would reccomend this book to anyone, but not for children. There are some extremely strong sexual images. Read it, it is truely unique.

However I was 80 pages into this book and I realized I hadn't read anything of substance, nothing that made me interested in Gen. Butler. The book is extremely dry and the author uses sophisticated phrases that left me bewildered as to what I was reading. Gen. Butler was a great man who deserves much better than this. If you want to learn about Smedley Butler, read Jules Archer's book; because it offers much more than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching Resource","review":"This book isn't really a how-to-guide in the sense that it gives you one method to build a \\"perfect\\" test (which does not exist). The text does give you ways to think about what kind of information you want from a test, how to structure effective tests, how to use the information from proctoring the test, and so forth. I find this text to be a great resource for teachers both new and experienced. The text shows great examples of the process of building useful tests in a language learning situation.

It's an early film by emerging directors and it weaves a narrative thread akin to another young filmmaker Shinobu Yaguchi's films \\"Down the Drain\\" and \\"Adrenaline Drive.\\" In these characters fall into a bizzare series of events driven by coincidence that test thier moral fiber.In \\"Fangs\\" we add a layer of supernatural--but more accurately a magical realism with So Cal flavor. But the film isn't about the lycanthropy or ganster edge so much as the daily struggles of working in a cubicle and surviving an undesirable marriage. This film was a perfect escape from my cubicle and it doesn't matter if you're gay, straight, Asian or Latin, we all want to escape the cubicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Asian American flick!","review":"This a great movie about a werewolf, a depressed woman, and a lying waitress who always wears dark glasses. It's stylish and funnny with a theme of finding identity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too similar to Wong Kar-wai","review":"This film tries very hard to look smart, but the effect might be sadly the opposite. Clearly this film is inspired by Wong Kar-wai, but it is too overshadowed by Wong, especially Wong's CHEUNG-KING EXPRESS. To say this film is a copycat might be not just, but to say this film is brilliant is also not proper. Or we can say this film shows how Asian American (artists) are anxious with their cultural/nationalistic/ethnic identities. However, sadly, this film is not smart enough to explore much. Everything is on the surface. Not smart, let alone wise.

BUT: it's time that consumers start sending a message to CD producers that stupid packaging is going to cost them ratings points. Instead of built-in plastic hubs to hold the CDs firmly in place, this set has those idiotic rubber hubs from which the CDs are easily removed, but not so easily replaced. You've got to push and wiggle and prod to seat the CDs when you're finished listening to them. I'm amazed that nobody else was annoyed by this (except for the poor guy whose discs fell out, probably as a result of the hubs). Come on, Rhino, don't do this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too little Diamond","review":"I bought this set with hope and excitement, knowing that not only was I hearing a great band exit on top, but also a great singer and songwriter in his prime. And what does he get? That's right, one song. That's right - I'm talking about Neil Diamond. It seems a bit of a waste to invite the man and hardly use him. After all, how much did the Band liberally borrow from Mr. Diamond? I don't think I'm a fool for suggesting that \\"The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\" owes more than a little to \\"Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show\\".Until Rhino sees fit to include more Neil (and I don't mean Young), I won't be buying this.

Read Loraine Heathe or Fern Michaels instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"This whole book is just plain disgusting! Talk about rape and the fact that it's a romance book! What sickens me even more is their consummation at the end of the story. Eww! Witnesses? Her relatives? Is such thing even possible? I did really tried to hang on to this book from the begining but i just can't believe this was how it ended. The heroine's is playing this denial game that is so frustrating and the hero is no help at all. In this sort of story, i wouldn't really say they are heroine and hero. This is not a romance book! And also, this is my first time reading Claudia Dain's book and i simply lost all hope on her other books. I can't imagine reading another book by her and not think of the previous one i just read that had been so bad. What if it happens in this other book also? Hopeless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even the sex was good!","review":"Brutal rape, a \\"hero\\" whose impossible to like, and a \\"love scene\\" observed by the couple's family and friends.

The author also seems to add Wicca into the book too much and adds some of her own chants and opinions which I don't really think is necessary, but many Appalachian ancestors were Celtics with Pagan beliefs though. All in all it is a good book with some great information and some practical magickal ideas that you could try for yourself from the most interesting Appalachian region of the United States!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Sue Your Parnets for Malpractice?","review":"This book is about a 14 year old girl named Lauren and it seems like her life is falling apart.

Lauren's parnets fight all the time and Lauren going out with a younger guy. Everyone's teasing her because her boyfriend's in 8th grade in 9th.

Jodi the other main character is out to save this reclusive stranger even though her uptight boyfriend the mayor doesn't like it.

My fears were groundless as the Sharp functions every bit as fast the older one. I like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle. They recommend two people to mount this oven, however since I didn't have help available I was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought. If I were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas, mainly in the venting info.

What better way to re-release them than alongside \\"The Thing\\" - arguably Carpenter's masterpiece?I'm also aware that \\"Village of the Damned\\" is considered one of the weaker Carpenter movies, but it has its moments and overall, it's fun. The set is also a great price! I look at it this way: Even if you don't like one of the titles as well as the other three (whatever your Carpenter preferences may be), you're basically getting three good to great movies at a low price and a fourth one for free! You can't really go wrong. If you don't like John Carpenter, stay away.

The wire slips off the side when you start to pull tension and is dangerous when stretching barbed wire. All it needs is one extra bend in the base plate to keep the wire from slipping off and I would have give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mending Fences","review":"This is really a great tool for tensioning (stretching) barbless fencing wire when used in conjuntion with a good sturdy come-a-long when fencing in horse or livestock pastures. It would work equally well for barbed wire, but that requires tougher gloves, clothes, and eye and face protection.Once you insert the wire in between the jaws and hold it in place until you get a little bit of tension with a come-a-long it will never come loose while you apply a lot more tension as needed until the wire almost sings. Then it's a simple matter of stapling the wire to your corner or in-line heavy duty wooden fence post (RR tie) and releasing the come-a-long release lever.I used it for fencing a little over 7 acres with a perimeter of about 3200 ft. I used 10 plus rolls of 1/4 mile rolls of barbless fencing to get'er done.Thats about 2 1/2 miles of wire and the Maasdam Pow'r Pull 8050 got a grip and kept a grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Piece Of Jazz History","review":"This is another album I avoided in my youth but now own and cherish.

I find myself grabbing this one often to take in the car. The minor technical grievances by both Mulligan and Monk do not really detract that much. Both of these jazz giants had better days - but not together. Monk's rhythm section was great here.I suppose it was the assumed clash between styles that I feared most when I was learning the sax and acquiring a jazz library. Somehow it comes down to the fact that Bop meeting Cool still = Jazz. DownBeat magazine had it about right at 4.5 stars when it first came out. Most fans of combo jazz will appreciate this recording.

There is a short segment for abdominal at the end of the video, but I feel it is not intense enough, nor long enough, but it's okay because I always add extra abdominal workout when I'm done with the video.Unfortunately, I will no longer be able to use this DVD as much as before because each time I have taken breaks from using this video and go back to doing it, my knee starts to hurt.

Don't expect a lot of mat work - there's actually very little. The majority of the workout is done standing up. As far as low impact cardio goes, this one does quite well. While it's not going to get your heart rate up as high as say running or cycling, it does better than I expected it to. Nothing is overly challenging - most people should have no problem doing this one - but you do feel like you accomplished something by the end.

The back cover of this dvd claims that it is a \\"low impact\\" workout, well thats a lie. This video is for people who already workout. Why do they keep making videos for people who are already in shape??My personal impression on the instructor: She is very impersonal and has a fake smile plastered on her face. I liked her better in another workout video, but she still isn't known to explain workouts clearly. She has a lot of videos out right now, she should stop and focus on the quality of her instructions instead of making hundreds of videos just to make money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't really Complain.","review":"I have to admit if you put all you've got into it you will get a fine workout and drop some sweat while you're at it.

The only thing I'm disappointed about was the actual mat workout where you relax and breath kinda like the 'yoga' portion of the video, which lasted only ten minutes. I was annoyed. I wanted to do more of that. So it's mostly cardio and carrying weights throughout and then she finished with a ten minute mat workout. No too bad at all.

But with Amazon it is so simple to stream every season to my Roku player, so I have every episode already uploaded and streamed to watch at my leisure. I hope more people take advantage of Amazon's Video on Demand and streaming Tosh. He is hilarous and no topic seems taboo. Even after watching every episode several times, I find myself laughing again and again.

Once installed, they look nice and perform their function, but installation was a pain. It was not possible for me to get the latches and posts to line up using the factory holes, so I had to drill additional holes in each fender to make everything line up. The included hardware for attaching the posts uses a large, cumbersome square piece in place of a simple nut and washer for underneath the flare. Because the piece is so large, I couldn't get it to lay flush against the fender so the posts stood at an angle making it impossible to fit them in the latch. I had to replace included hardware with nuts and washers I picked up at the local Home Depot. Finally, once everything was installed, to get the hood to close you now have to set it down on the posts and manually move each post to fit into the latches. Overall, I like the way it looks but the installation and function makes it not worth the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad deluded and bitter rantings","review":"What a shame this author dose not recognize the real fulfilled and powerful women abundant in our society or those past.An altogether poor ,under researched and very dated account of women and love save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"le ripoff","review":"the music is great but the band took the cheap way out and used cdr's so the disc skips in just about every song. save your money and try to find the import."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a work of plagiarism","review":"Nitzan and Bichler, authors of the groundbraking book, \\"The Global Political Economy of Israel\\", wrote a detailed article showing how \\"Retort\\" massively and repeatedly plagiarized their original work and presented it as their own.

Probably better off spending a little more money to get one that has better drainage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but low quality","review":"I purchased two because the price was great. However, the quality is low due to large manufacturing tolerances. On one unit, the top did not fit the base, making the spinning difficult. Oddly, by swaping the top on one unit with the base on the 2nd unit, both could be made to work adequatly. However, once you have spun your greens, there is no way to remove the snapped on top because there is nothing to grab on to. You have to pull up on the spinning knob, which means the unit will not last long. I would not purchase again because it is so difficult to use. Perhaps the unit you buy will fit better. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product at nice price","review":"Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't find any problems with the fit of my unit. It spins very well and I like the large comfortable handle. The size is also perfect without taking up too much room in the kitchen. The 6 clear rubber feet does a great job of keeping it in place on the countertop as you turn the handle. I find that if you pinch the outside of the opening in the cover, the top pops right off. I wouldn't use the handle to remove the top because that will eventually cause it or the gears inside to break. The price is better than the other brand of salad spinners with the push down spinner and the handles allows the contents to spin in either direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy product","review":"It works but its not well made. Its hard to get the top on and off. Its nearly impossible to get the inner basket, the outer bowl and the top to snap together properly. Not much thought was put into designing this device.

I think it might have upset his stomach because when we switched him to formula, he was much better, and that shouldn't be the case with breast milk.

Characters were introduced without any detail and numerous references wee made to previous stories. What happened to the wonderfully named Troy Trueheart? He vanished after a few chapters. I agree with other readers that the cover design is an improvement on the naked lady, of the earlier US editions, however that design is better than on the UK editions. They have a woman supposed to be Eve, wearing mini skirts and sun glasses! At least the person who commissioned the US covers gave the impression of having read the book. Finally, whilst the picture of life in the mid twenty first century is believable does Robb really think that there would have been virtually zero inflation between now and 2059.

The protagonist is not sympathetic; the only way I know she's so great is the other characters keep saying it's so. The way Eve and Roark always know what the other is thinking, and know the right thing to say and do for each other is a bit unrealistic. The plot itself was rather obvious. The book is much longer than it needs to be. I got really tired of hearing that Eve wanted to hit someone every other page or so.

I'm a hopeless romantic. Although, I'll admit there are some things that make me role my eyes, such as: 1. The sci-fi element only because she has mass-space travel & colonization, human droids, flying vehicles, etc. and the books are only set about 50 years from now. I don't see that as a realistic possibility. 2. There's a not-so-subtle liberal slant to her stories, such as a national gun ban, legalized prostitution, etc.(And Conservative politician or their supporters are the villains in more than one book in this series, including Conspiracy in Death.)The relationship between the hero and heroine though are the selling point for me. And in Conspiracy, Eve is forced to face her worst fear ... being without her badge, which for her equals her identity. It's a powerful struggle and makes this book worth reading. The rest, I can overlook. It is fiction after all! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How does she do it?","review":"J.D. Robb! One exciting writer.. this series is great and every book is better than the last one. Power, Fame , Money & the Medical Field is the pivot for this latest set of murders.

New cast members have been added, & I hope to see them in the future, as we have Peabody ,McNab & Monroe.

In Conspiracy, followed by Loyalty In Death and Witness In Death, Robb gives the characters we know and love new depth, making us, if at all possible, love them more. In addition, Robb begins to break away from what was threatening to become a formulaic plot, that of a mentally disturbed person who kills because he or she enjoys killing. She begins to give her villains motives other than insanity, and keeps the series from becoming an endless repeat of the same plot, predictable and stale.
