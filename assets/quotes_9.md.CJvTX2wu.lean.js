The little girl was very cute but her acting wasn't anything special and the rest of the cast were bums and misfits. There is nothing noble or heartwarming about this story as some have said its kind of pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Although the movie may portray some form of realism of life in the bayou, I still find it hard to believe. I found the young girl's thought process too advanced for her age, and the characters themselves boring and lifeless, which I guess is exactly what the director tried to convey. I would not recommend, and I fail to see how this movie could be nominated for an Oscar or how this young actor could be nominated for best actress (sorry for you PC people, but actress still sounds appropriate to me. What's wrong with using words to identify the sexes?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is tripe","review":"Fard to follow.

The main character played by the 6 year old was believable and she was good but overall the movie was just strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost nothing to like.","review":"Pros:The little girl put on a good performance.The title is apt. The entire movie reminded me of the opening scenes of \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" (The Dawn of Man)Cons:Mediocre to poor photography, camera wobbled all over the place, bad editing.Often-indistinguishable dialog.No character development. One feels sorry for the girl but not because one gets to know her.No real story, per se, just a sliver of a common thread across many confusing, disjointed scenes.Mostly a \\"feel bad\\" theme (some graphically unpleasant moments).Comment:Perhaps this movie merely intended to portray a few days in the life of the Bayou in all of its primitiveness and ghastliness. I suppose it succeeds. You don't know what they're saying or doing and, presumably, they don't either. Beasts obeying their primordial instinct to survive. Point made but who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what makes this oscar worthy","review":"Hearing this was nominated for an oscar, I decided to give this movie a watch. I won't say this movie was bad but I don't get what made this oscar worthy. A muddled story with hit and miss acting, the girl was good but not oscar worthy.

I would suppose that many Americans have no idea of how these people live and survive. So, for those people this movie may be enlightening and shocking. However, I couldn't wait for it to end.

How do you still resist? This is a fine work, moving and complete"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Beauty","review":"A movie to see and love. Hard to believe these were untrained actors, their acting is as natural as the woods and water backdrops. Little Hushpuppy, a wonder to view, will steal your heart. I was enraptured, glued to the end with a big eyed sense of wonderment and awe. I give this film a much deserved 5+ out of 5. I had to own it...the blu-ray dvd...so as to return to the people of the levees with their struggles, multiple warm engaging hearts, and unpretentious lives. This dvd is my ticket to be transported back to their world and lil Hushpuppy.:}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"*spoiler*I've been more bored, I guess.I really wanted to like this film, but it's pointless. Stories come from the basics of entertaining and having some kind of purpose. I ask you, after watching this... could you tell this \\"story\\" and have people entertained? A poor child lives with angry, stupid and lazy people who live their life as a party all of the time and put their lives and those of their children in jeopardy because of squalid living conditions. The predictable storm occurs, they get rescued then escape... just to live in the mud again. The metaphorical beasts rush towards the girl, then Kneel? For what? Because she watched a prostitute cook Gator? I'm sorry... what a complete waste of time. I had just watched Shawshank Redemption last night, and maybe that killed any redeeming qualities this movie may have had for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting a good movie, but it was a disappointment......","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this film, and was very disappointed. Though I loved the little girl, and the beautiful cinematography, the story was disjointed and forced, and disappointing. The child actress carried the film, but some of it did not make much sense, etiher literally or symbolically. It has been a long time since I so looked forward to a movie that diappointed me so much. I see some others found it uplifting; to me, it was the total opposite...depressing as well as lacking a meaningful message ( that I could discern.) I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my time","review":"The film is trying to tell us that people choose to live in miserable conditions. I do not believe it. Besides this film is not artistic at all.The actress of the little girl performed very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and un-engaging. Could not even watch it all.","review":"Another dull movie glorifying what is actually a poverty stricken and pretty dreadful existence. If we spent less time romanticizing this stuff and more time fixing it we would be in a better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"insanely boring","review":"I've seen a number of the 2013 Oscar nominees --Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, Silver Linings Playbook -- and enjoyed them all. So I decided to check out Beasts of the Southern Wild. Horrible and utterly pointless -- just a bunch of hillbillies living in squalor. If you like movies with a plot, skip this one. No idea why this got nominated for anything, except perhaps to please pretentious film critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused about all the hoopla","review":"Not worth the time to watch it. No acting involved on the part of Ms. Wallis. Interesting premise, but the promotional hoopla about the production does not reflect the quality of plot, characterization, nor symbolism. Cinematography was quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"The story-line, such as it is, is nonsensical. The characters are a bunch of low-lives. The much-touted child actress has basically one expression. Much of the imagery is unpleasant. Its only redeeming virtue is that it runs just 93 minutes--but seems much longer. This is Hollywood going ga-ga over a film because it punches all the PC buttons. Don't waste your time watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEASTS RUN UNEXPLAINED","review":"I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HATE THIS PIOCTURE BECAUSE IT DID INTRODUCE ME TO A REGION OF THE COUINTRY ENTIRELY UNFAMILIAR TO ME. BUT I DO LOOK FOR SOME SEMBLANCE OF PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHICH PROMPTS BELIEVABLE MOTIVATION FOR THE ACTION. IT NEDED A COHERENT SCREREN PLAY AND EDITRING THAT MADE SOME SENSE. AND WHERE DID THESE BEASTS COME FROM? MY FRIEND, WHO WATCHED IT WITH ME AGRERED THAT WE TURN IT OFF ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGFH. THEN WE RELENTED AND WATACHED THE ENDING. STILL MADE LITTLE SENSE. THE YOUNG GIRL DID TURN IN AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR HER AGE (6), BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HOLD MY INTEREST. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story & Acting Overrated","review":"After seeing the movie I was surprised that the little girl who played the principal character was nominated for an Academy Award. I suppose if her performance were being compared to other six year olds she'd come out on top. It was a good performance in pedestrian story. Her scenes were short as would be expected in someone so young and much of her contribution was in the narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this emperor wear any clothes?","review":"Sure is getting a lot of rave reviews. The last movie that I disliked this much was Little Miss Sunshine.

It makes you marvel at the human condition and contemplate the meaning of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"The film was interesting but I am confused as to why it is receiving such accolades. I have a good attention span but found the film tedious to sit through. Too long and to disjointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quvenzhané Wallis...","review":"Give the kid a \\"mini\\" Oscar... but movie is too slow paced. Great insight into the \\"bathtub\\" society and how they survive without any government help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There seemed to be no plot, yet the movie was seeming to include too many and too varied themes. Overall, I find the movie depressing , not inspiring as I had heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"Despite a charismatic child star, this movie didn't engage me. What is the point of the story? What is the past/present/future of the cast of characters. How do these drunks and castoffs feed themselves or maintain their supply of fuel and liquor? Why should we care? Where is child protective services?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Award!!!","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! No plot, horrible disgusting characters and ugly back ground scenery. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy! I really can't think of why this movie was made or who would finance such a stupid monstrosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie? Yes. Oscar Nod? Hmmmm","review":"I am no expert on the Cajun wilderness, but I couldn't help but enjoy the main character's adventures and grand imagination. She pulls the viewer into her world that is a mixture of fantasy and harsh reality. The movie was well made, and the acting was solid. Some found the voice over to be over the top, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie's attempt to see the harsh Cajun backwoods through the eyes of a little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild about Southern Wild","review":"I am wild about this movie.I found out that this little bit of a movie star lied about her age, she was onlyfive when she tried out and needed to be six and they changed the script around her fiercesome character.She IS the man. What eyes and yes, what muscles. I have been walking around for days tackling my ownlittle problems with her big attitude. The mythic stories and the music soundtrack add layers to this movie.I don't watch movies twice but this one is definitely worth a second or third viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart felt","review":"This is a star movie it was heart felt and you felt like you were in the movie watching it. So many people have gone through this with all the storms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wild for me","review":"This was not entertainment of any kind. Not quite sure why it is getting so much attention. We were disappointed and have already told people not to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetarians beware.","review":"If you're a vegetarian, have a weak stomach or both, you're going to have trouble enjoying the movie. The gruesome visuals details were not featured in the trailer. Sometimes the food scenes were just reviling, other times the director seemed to take pleasure in submitting the audience to up-close food-related cruelties that appear to be happening to actual living things. I did not stay to the end of the credits but I am reasonably sure that the array of life forms scooped up out of the murky water for dinner were real. Other than that, prepare for a grim, claustrophic visual domain, a glum plot and unlikeable characters. The kids were good, yes, adorable, but the in-your-face, depravity slice-of-life angle was too far over the top to appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much publicity","review":"There was just so much publicity surrounding this movie because of the Oscars, and I found it to not be worth my time at all.Very disappointed, the Oscars have to do much better, but for an Independent film, I guess it was the best out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headspinning story with little rhyme or reason","review":"Interesting enough diversion, but a story that never really went anywhere.A very poor US family leaving on the bayou in LA.A daughter and father that have no clue how to survive in the world as most Americans know it and when given the opportunity turn that down for their run down humble home presumably because they will be taken advantage of if they do not. It's an interesting peak into the lives of the less fortunate without a compelling argument for why many stay that way although that seems to be the only possible message of this movie. Did not move us to cheer, cry or even think that much except to wonder about the character's motivation - i.e. \\"What were they thinking?\\"This is not something I would recommend to most movie goers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't engage us","review":"We couldn't get past the first 15 minutes of this.

I tried it 2 weeks strait and got nothing but complaints about my snoring the entire time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is a Horrible Product","review":"There are several things wrong with this product: 1) Price. Absurdly overpriced, even if it worked. It's over $40 an ounce, people - That's over $5000 a gallon. 2) Product design. It is unbelievably difficult to get the spray to dispense properly. 9 times out of 10 it does not spray at all, just dribbles out a drop or two. I've tried it from every conceivable angle and position - no better luck, and no consistent way found to get it to spray. 3) It simply does not do what it claims to do. I used the product until the bottle was empty with no noticeable reduction in snoring.Do yourself a favor - save your $16+ and either buy one of the mouthpieces being advertised all over the internet (I'm looking at either a PureSleep or a SnoreRX) or go get a sleep study done. Either option is an infinitely wiser choice than this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I tried it because I thought it would relieve my wife from using earplugs.

HOWEVER, one concern a consumer should have is that the \\"medicine\\" in this product may cause a \\"rebound\\" effect; i.e., if you stop using it, the symptoms may reappear even worse than before.Bottom line: Consult with your doctor.I stopped using the product after a week and went on a doctor prescribed medication that, from a safety (FDA tested) point of view, I'm much more comfortable with; and the price is comparable given my health insurance coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I tried this product and my gal said it didn't work.She got no sleep.Im moving on to a sleep apnea mouth piece.Dont waste your money with silly mouth sprays."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've GOT to be kidding me!","review":"Bought from Walmart in hopes it would work.

My enthusiasm died very quickly when I did the research and found the ingredients Belladonna and Ephedra. If you look either one of these ingredients on WebMD, you will find that they are widely considered dangerous and the FDA has put out various warnings on Ephedra.To be fair about this StopSnore claims very little use of these drugs (about .42) It DID work for me and I did not have a terrible reaction, just felt very jittery and anxious.The other side of this is that you will be taking drugs that are banned for professional athletes and the side effects include death.I think the good news is that now that I have been reminded how great it feels to get a good nights sleep, I will immediately turn around and look for non-drug solution, like a mouth-guard or nose piece.

Speed? Not if you are making Snore Stop.I tried this once. Within 15 minutes I was drenched in sweat, my heart was racing and I was nauseous.

The first Laura songbook was gorgeous from cover design/photo, selected drawings, photos, and great arrangements. This is a poor, poor sequel.

This is the vampire Eric's story. The heroine, Donna, is amusing but, at times, seems to swallow the unusual events around her a little too easily. Or maybe it's just because Eric's so hot! There's humor and intrigue and a killer fantasy sequence. I didn't quite buy the love story but Donna certainly brought out Eric's protective nature. Some of the secondary characters, like the wizard, were laugh out loud funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Hot... But...","review":"I'm a fan of Nina Bangs and have been reading her for several years. This is not her best effort. The characters are a little flat, and the secondaries are just annoying. It reads like it was thrown together in a hurry. I was very disappointed, in fact I put it down twice before forcing myself to finish it. It's been on my shelf for a long time so I don't think it was my frame of mind while reading it. I'll continue to read the next 2 in the series (I already bought them) and hope the slump is a one time thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bites...and not in the good way","review":"I ended up skipping huge chunks of this book due to characters like Sparkle Stardust and Asima.

Skip this book and go read Unwed and Undead by Davidson instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was so funny and very out there.

I'm willing to use a little extra imagination, but these were just too way out there. I read Night Bites first, and names like Sparkle Stardust,Ganymede, and Woo Woo Inn were just the first clue. I'm afraid Wicked Nights wasn't much better. Neither the characters nor plots had any substance. I don't think Nina Bangs would be an author on any of my future reading lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Wicked Fun","review":"If you liked Master of Ecstacy by Bangs, you'll be glad to know she's given us another hot vampire book. This time the setting is an adult theme park and the sexy setting is just the start. Cosmic troublemakers are at it again to bring two unlikely lovers together and Bangs trademark humor will keep you laughing. I give it two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Nights","review":"Vampires normally want to avoid publicity, so falling for a talk show host is rather against their better interests, you would think. However, Eric is learning that every rule has an exception, and Donna is his. With a full complement of cosmic troublemakers and a couple of hormone driven plants along, a good time is sure to be had, if the pesky little ancient feud Eric has with a slightly anti-social vampire doesn't get in the way of romance.**** More people would be cat people if there were kitties running around like the ones in Ms. Bangs' world. Since Eric's \\"brothers'' look just as intriguing as he does, I think Sparkle, Deimos, and Asima have a long career ahead of them. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorably cute!","review":"I have been getting the Zelda calendars for the past several years, and they never disappoint.

The story line is engaging. It teaches a wonderful lesson about tolerance and understanding of differences. Carly Simon's soundtrack is catchy, memorable, and generally outstanding--you'll find yourself sporadically marching about singing and whistling highlights (\\"In the naaaaaaame of the hundred acre wooooooood, we claaaaaaaim you in the naaaame of the hundred acre wooooooood!\\"). Last and by no means least, the whole production staff appear to have been pirated from Miyazaki-san's studio with the result that, atop all this movie's other splendid characteristics, the animation is thoughtful, detailed, amusing, and insightful. The kids will enjoy watching this over and over, and the adults will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for all ages!","review":"This is a movie that even adults could take a lesson or two from.

In this movie at one point Pooh Rabbit and Tigger are chasing the baby heffalump and there is bad music playing. They have actually made these beloved characters into villians. If you are not familiar with the old pooh stories this may not bother you but if you are a Winnie the Pooh lover like my family this is a sad sad thing they have done. Not to mention the moral basis for the movie seems to be dissobey your mom because she doesnt know that people who are different are fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooh Characters Mean?

And its the \\"adult\\" characters being mean and the \\"child\\" characters are going to correct the \\"adults\\"? Disney your not helping!!! The age group of Pooh needs to see mean or unkind acts immediately corrected. My 4 year old was bored, except a few scenes of the little Heffalump playing with piglet. The movie's point was over his head. Once again, Disney puts adult themes into a child's movie and once again they fail to connect with the child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!","review":"I Think it is a dumb movie.

I enjoyed the movie it was funny and taught kids the importance of friendship. The movie showed kids that they need to understand their fears. The hundred acer wood group is afraid of the heffalumps but the heffalumps are also afraid of the hundred acer wood group.The movie begins with the hundred acer wood group hearing a strange noise early in the morning. The group decides that the noise is from a scary heffalump. The gang decides to go one a search for the heffalump so they can be the first to capture one. The only problem is the group will not let roo go with them. Roo sneakes off early in the morning to find his prey. He later meets up with lumpy. Lumpy is so adorable.

I used this book for two semesters worth of beginning French class at a university, and must say that if used with the proper teaching skills, students can certainly excell quickly in learning this fantastic language. There is a cassette tape included that helps develop troublesome accents for newbies to French, and after reviewing the book once again after having taken the class about a year ago, I have even more appreciation for both the book and the language it instructs. It contains conjugations in all forms, great lessons, eye-pleasing references, problem issues with different words, and a great gradual learning process to keep the interest of students first learning this beautiful language. I would certainly recommend any French teacher or professor to examine a copy and quite soon I think they will agree with me.

This single can also be found on the groups first full-length debutCome Touch the Sun. The single has a upbeat, torch song quality.

In addition, these are the only recordings I have ever purchased which list no details of the recordings - not even the composers or publishers!

The acting is superb from all the actors (even down to the bit players), the music is superb, and the writing and direction are first-rate. The ending is also the best in any movie I have ever seen, and comes round too soon. For me, the story is about the relationship between two heterosexual men following the death of their wives - and how they both come to terms with their bereavement. Tom Courtney's Southgate (which won him the Best Actor BAFTA award) grieves immediately after his wife dies. However, Albert Finney's multi-layered Sgt.Major (also nominated for the Best Actor BAFTA) takes longer to come to terms with his life and loss. If you want to see the Best of British, this movie is one of those surprising little gems that only come around so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veddy nritish","review":"Nicely done view of two possible ends of senior British behaviors.

It was a comforting book, showing just how strong friendships can become, even with people that at first you don't think you'd like (when you read it you'll see that I am talking about the Massies).

From other reviews most people LOVED it, giving it 5 stars or a few rated it very POOR. Neither rating captured my sentiments. Two other reviews did capture it's essense-NO FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and another that explained-it's not a bad novel and if you're looking for a quick, light, southern cozy/light mystery read this is for you. I don't believe it's an \\"If you loved Divine Secrets, you'll love this.\\" I don't think it's as good as the Ya-Ya's.

The characters were incredibly flat, and the story contrived. The twist at the end was such an artificial plot device, it seemed more of an afterthought than a closure. I was truly amazed to see people liked this book in the other reviews. I hated it, and our book discussion was about 10 minutes long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Title Please","review":"Queenie Bean is a likeable protagonist. The location of the novel in Harveyville, Kansas, during great Depression of the 1930's, depicted a quaint farming community. The 8 women of the Persian Pickle Club were delightful. Each one of them was more peculiar than the next. Picturing them quilting together was lovely. In our busy impersonal lives, such a thing would be impossible.Rita tries to solve the murder of a member's husband. In doing so, she faces the complicated relationships of the Persian Pickle Club members, their loyalties and eccentricities. What a great read!I have tried to get others to read this book and the minuet I mention the title \\"Persian Pickle Club\\", they ignore my suggestion. I know the Persian Pickle Club was named after a coveted paisley print, but it is a turn-off title.

It's a wonderful example of how women of all ages and backgrounds can come together under one common element, such as quilting. The book focuses on Queenie Bean, a young wife and quilter who takes you on a journey of loyalty, compassion, friendship and love. Queenie's newly acquired friend Rita is more interested in solving a mystery and making a name for herself than making friends. She soon learns just what true friendship is all about. A beautiful story that will leave you wanting to join this remarkable group of ladies who call themselves The Persian Pickle Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quilting, mystery, women's issues -- this book has it all","review":"At first I was fascinated by the names of the characters -- Queenie, Septima, Ceres, Forest Ann, and more -- were those common names in Kansas during the Depression? I don't know, but that is just one feature of this book that is thought provoking. Sandra Dallas deals with many women's issues in this book that are still with us today -- single mothers, unwanted pregnancy, domestic violence, career fulfillment, adoption -- it is humbling to remember that the baby boomers didn't invent theses issues and that feminists haven't solved them. This book is good on so many levels, I think it is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the odd title put you off","review":"An excellent author will lead you to their other novels, as Ms. Dallas did for me.The Persian Pickle Club is a 1930 depression era quilt club, but the soul of the club are the women of the town in Harveyville, Kansas. The club is a friendship foundation, support group and charity network that goes beyond these implications. We are allowed an extremely poignant glimpse into the lives of these women, and the unique pecking order, so to speak that has been established within the context of the club.While somewhat annoying, certain characters that make up the group will certainly grate on your tolerance. But a subtle understanding is promoted as one continues to unravel the secrets and relationships that the group protects. Friendships within the group mean everything to these women, and the sacrifices they go through on behalf of each other is truly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books ever","review":"I rarely give books as gifts because I feel that reading material is a highly personal thing. However I have given this book to women friends a number of times. The phrase \\"breathe life into characters\\" is trite - but so applicable in this case. Ms Dallas makes me long to sit and stitch with these women from Kansas who go through good times and bad together, always together. The one thing that these women could count on was one another. The novel has a mystery, charming characters, and a interesting setting. The writing flows so easily that each page is a pleasure to read. I can't speak highly enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Companion to the Ya-Ya Sisterhood","review":"If you liked The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, you'll find this book very satisfying. Set in a different place and time it also recounts the trials and tribulations of \\"sisterhood\\". It is a short read but worthwhile.

The little gossipy asides - not necessarily \\"catty\\" - made it realistic : no Jerry Springer - just an honest interest in the others' lives because of the all-too-human connection. All the sewing details just made it more authentic ! A quiet little gem of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quaint, with pasteboard characters","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, saying that it was a wonderful book about women's lives. Unfortunately, I found the characters to be very flat and entirely unbelievable. In addition, I had in mind that this book would show some positive aspects about housewives and farmwives. However, the goals and ideals of this club seemed to reinforce the negative stereotypes of women, both who work outside of the home and those who stay at home. The context showed Rita who had goals other than babies and bottles, to be a hussy. While, Queenie Bean was the epitome of the perfect woman, thus reinforcing stereotypes.

When farming was more of a hardship than an occupation and isolation for the women was a reality. The warmth and companionship and the depth of the characters not only allowed you to get to know them but root for them as well.

Well I should be fair; we couldn't even make it to the end of this movie.Surprisingly bad acting is coupled with random sentences which try to sound intellectual; however, in practice this \\"intellectual\\" part is probably the deeper dumbness you can find in an already dumb script.As if this wasn't enough, the movie is wrapped in an unpleasant sexist concept around sex scenes, which gets to its climax in a trivialized rape sequence which made us viewers think now the movie wasn't even worth to make fun of anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth spending money on","review":"Be thankful if you watch this on a Showtime premium cable channel, because if you spend cash on renting it you would probably become angry.

If you have an alternative, take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Film!","review":"This was an intriguing movie. It was well acted. It was a great story. The only thing I didn't like was the resolution of the apocalyptic theme. Kind of cheesy. Watching Bacic throughout the film is quite a bonus. He's extraordinarily hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"As close as you can get to a good Uwe Boll movie","review":"This movie came SO close to being something decent, which is surprising considering Uwe Boll's name was attached. It seemed like he was trying for a character-driven story about a fractured family struggling to reconnect in the face of the (apparent) end of the world, and for the first two acts that's what viewers get. It's not perfect in its execution, but it's promising enough.Then the third act comes along, and the plot thread involving Luke Perry's character takes such a wild left turn it derails everything the filmmakers built up earlier. It certainly wasn't a predictable twist, but from a characterization standpoint it made no sense, and the climax as a result feels like a huge letdown.Overall this was more palatable than most of Uwe Boll's movies, but a botched ending rather ruined the whole thing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOLL OF CRAP","review":"Uwe Boll is back adding another disaster to his filmography.Ultimately the movie makes no sense and its slow meandering pace has no climactic payoff. Why has everyone but our three leads and a handful of ruffians vanished? Where did they go? Who is Silas really? Tim McGregor's script is far too ambiguous and unbelievable and Boll's direction pedestrian. Oddly enough, the performances from Steve Bacic, Lauren Holly and Luke Perry rise above the material. I vow to avoid any more Boll movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have seen in long time","review":"This movie has no plot!

Though merely live versions of a handful of tracks from Soft Black Stars, this album achieves a melancholic beauty missed by the former. Songs like \\"Anti-Christ and Barcodes\\" as well as \\"The Signs in the Stars\\" possess an honesty and haunting spatial resonance here totally lacking in their original form. Tibet sounds as if he's struggling not to sob on stage.\\"Gothic Love Song,\\" the stand-out track from Soft Black Stars disappoints here, largely because it sounds exactly like the original (save for Antony's annoying and barely audible background vocals).If you're new to Current 93 this isn't a bad place to start.

I couldn't help but recommend BUCKINGHAM NICKS as a great learning tool. As a fan of the Buckingham-Nicks era of Fleetwood Mac, he was unaware of their earlier eponymous album.

I got it, and did the obligatory tomato slice. And... it didn't cut it. I had to saw like the dickens and ended up with some hideous slices. For comparison, I have an Oneida Performance santoku. It's seriously a $15 knife. I also have a Gatco carbide knife sharpener, which cost me $13 at Cabela's. With a few quick swipes across that sharpener, my Oneida cheapo blade is MUCH sharper than the factory edge on the Shun. Sure, the blade doesn't stay sharp as long, but it literally takes me 20 seconds (that's not an exaggeration) to sharpen it, and it performs much better than the price-inflated Shun.Stay away from this knife.

I thought I was in a bad movie after cutting 3 pounds of Sirloin beef for Baeuf Bourguignon on a \\"Butcher's Block\\", I had to use a sawing motion to cut through the last few pieces.This is unequivocally the worst purchase of my life, and I am 60 years old.

It went through the RAW potato with very little resistance. So, the next day, we were bragging about it to our friends and joked that it could probably slice through an apple in mid-air. Just out of curiosity, we took an apple outside just to see how far into the apple the knife would stick. I tossed the apple up and swung with the knife. THE KNIFE SLICED THE APPLE COMPLETELY IN HALF as easy as if it were slicing through butter! It was so amazing, I went in and got another apple, a pear, and a lime, each of which became a mid-air fruit salad.This knife puts your whole knife drawer to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Knives","review":"I have been using the Ken Onion (Shun) 8 inch Chef's Knife, Santoku, and Paring Knife for about three months. I have twenty-five years experience as an avid home cook and 20 assorted forged Henkels, Wustoff and Lamson knives.Since purchasing the Ken Onion knives they are almost the only knives I reach for anymore. They are remarkably sharp and remain that way longer than any of my other knives. I am surprised by the entries that state they are hard to keep sharp. I find that they respond better to a couple passes on my sharpening steel then the European knives. When I get to the point of needing to do anything more than minor straightening of the edge I will buy a Chef's Choice sharpener. While they currently have one designed for Asian knives, they are rumored to have a new Asian sharpener coming out soon that will have one stage for fine sharpening and another for polishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A. Matthews","review":"This isn't my first Shun knife and probably won't be the last. Shun knife technology, in my opinion, is more advanced than that of any of the good German steel knives. They are super sharp. This particular knife is designed more for chopping, It is not as well suited for slicing as, say a Santoku with cullens. I was surprised to see the \\"bolster\\" was not a solid forged peice of the knife, but rather two separate pieces fused to either side of the blade. Also, I have always been told that a sign of a good quality in a knife is when the tang goes all the way through the handle and this one does not. The design of the knife is an aesthetic knockout and I love seeing it on my counter but in my opinion, it isn't as versatile as a regular shaped chef's knife.I have been a restaurant owner and chef, now retired, I have had recipes published in San Diego and Kansas City newspapers, an international BBQ newsletter, and a couple in a Martha Stewart magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea","review":"I bought this knife as a Christmas present for my wife at the recommendation of a friend, and it was right on.

This is a remake of an earlier movie and although there are no major stars featured in this movie, it was far better than expected and well worth watching. The main characters are well-rounded and even subtle subplots are woven into the main plot almost effortlessly. There is a twist at the end that was unexpected, which made the experience even richer."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE REMAKE","review":"This adaptation of the wonderful Daphne du Maurier novel is pathetic. Dona St. Columb is WAAYY too much of a witch in this movie and SMOKES which is NOT in the book. She also seems to like flirting with Rockingham whom she despises in the book. The movie portrays Dona as very self-centered, and although I think she is a bit selfish in the book, she is not as selfish as this movie makes her out to be.If you want to watch a movie that is true to the novel, rent the version with Joan Fontaine and Arturo Cordova. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood style trash unlike BBC movies","review":"This movie is nothing like the typical proper movies from BBC of the 17th and 18th centuries such as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. It is full of sexual lust, poor acting, and conduct by the characters which is so unsuitable and improper for the times. It reminded us of Kitty on Gunsmoke, a woman just walking into a bar and stepping up for a glass of booze, in 1689? Ridiculous.The supposed French accents are amateurish. Marriage is scoffed at and mocked like a 21st century piece of Hollywood trash. We stopped this movie before it was half way through and discarded it. Bad show, totally not believable nor credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little slanted","review":"I wrote a review for this film which was a little less than flattering. I notice that it doesn't appear in your review line up. Instead Tom Keogh writes a review which claims that it's, \\"far more engrossing than one might expect.\\" No, it isn't; it's seriously flawed and doesn't read well at all. I am disappointed in the slanted approach to the reviewing. I get so tired of corporate dishonesty. And you wonder why the children are around shooting up the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful adaptation.","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was younger and this adaptation was just lovely. I was so thrilled to finally have the opportunity to replace my VHS tape with the DVD. This paired with a copy of the book would make a wonderful gift for any lady who appreciates a fantastic, romantic period piece. Don't miss out on this version especially if you enjoyed the original book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I'd been waiting a long time for a remake of the story. I was never pleased with the Joan Fontaine movie, but now I'm beginning to think it has merit. This new production deviates so much from the book that it's unbelievable! I've read the book more than once and was outraged with what they've done with it. Tara Fitzgerald is not at all like Dona St. Columb and looked more like a kitchen wench than a lady. Both she and the Frenchman could have used better hair styles. Daphne DuMaurier would be appalled if she could see the \\"liberties\\" taken with her book. I just watched about 20 minutes at the beginning and then the ending just to see what they did with it. Changed it too. This has to be one of the worst interpretations of a book I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this version of Frenchman's Creek. The heroine's acting abilities were fine but the hero's ability is something to be desired. Definitely a B film, not impressed at all. I actually stopped watching it half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Version","review":"Many times I watched the 1944 version, it's o.k., but not great (if compared with \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"Forever Amber\\" or \\"Désirée\\").A few years ago I finally discovered to my delight in Netflix that there is a remake with Alain Delon's son Anthony Delon. The actress who played Lady Dona St. Columb (Tara Fitzgerald) was somebody I had never heard of at that point.Well, I instantly enjoyed this version and was so thrilled that it has been filmed where it should have been filmed in the first place: in Cornwall where all those fascinating stories of Daphne DuMaurier take place.Of course the 1944 version could not have been filmed in Cornwall as WW II was going on, but it always bothered me to see the Californian coastline which is very different from Cornwall's coast.I wish somebody would finally make a movie from \\"The House on the Strand\\" (my favorite DuMaurier novel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"I loved this book.

It seems to have one cliche after another. First there's your uber-asassin, which seems ripped out from a James Bond movie and to a lesser extent, Frederick Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal. Then, there's your money-grubbing conspiracy to rule the world using terrorism, extortion, etc. Does this sound at all like SPECTRE from the old James Bond movies? Perhaps the author should have considered making an original plot instead of trying to make just another lackluster spy novel. In conclusion, if you want a good suspense novel, stick to the works of Frederick Forsyth or John Le Carre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, contrived, improbable, and predictable.","review":"Readers of \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" will be disappointed by Silva's latest work.

Wouldn't even recommend this book for a long plane ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner!!!!","review":"The Mark of the Assissin was a true page turner -- nearly impossible to put down. It is a fast-paced, enjoyable read from the very beginning. In the story, CIA agent Michael Osbourne finds himself pitted against a ruthless assassin with the code name \\"October.\\" The battle is emotional, psychological and physical. The supporting cast of characters are diverse and quite extensive. While keeping track of the long character list is sometimes an effort, the total package provides a story with action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists. Chances are that once you start his book, you will want to read it in big chunks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with an ending that surprised me.","review":"This book has a lot of suspense that kept me turning the pages. The ending, however, surprised me. Osbourne and Delaroche are by far the best and most interesting characters in the book. Although, Astrid Vogel is a nice addition to this good thriller. Overall, this book is one of the best assasin books I've read in my life. I am about to read the \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" to see if it is as good as this book. For readers who like action or assasin books, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from Silva","review":"This book is a very good read.

Throw in some female careerist infertility and you have the makings of yet another Silva thriller. Can't say I got beyond page 100 in this one.

Here is why: some main characters in the book committed some horrible crimes. Guess what? The two worst killers got away with it! They suffered some minor losses but were never punished. This is not the kind of fiction universe I want to live in. In addition the au. seems to have have an hysterical hatred for capitalism, or last least capitalists who are successful. He considers all of such people to be criminals (i.e., thieves, not producers). If that were true, then where did all the wealth we enjoy come from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"We've seen this mark before . . .","review":"I read this book at at the same time I was reading Silva's other novel, The Unlikely Spy. I was very disappointed in the same cliche descriptions and character lines. His use of virtually the same description and lines in both books surprised me. Also, the ease with which the assasin dispatched people is lame. Silva tries to give Jean-Paul some depth, but his methods of killing and his thoughts are very predictale and disappointing. If you have read the Unlikely Spy, dont bother with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Recent Spy Thrillers","review":"Silva's book isn't perfect, but it's a darn good read nonetheless. His writing is far better than most spy thriller writers and is peppered with exotic European locales and interesting characters. This is a thriller for those who snooze through all the techno mumbo-jumbo of Clancy's books and their ilk. This is more of a character-driven thriller in the tradition of the better Robert Ludlum books. Excitement without the special effects. There are, of course, a few overused plot devices in this one, but all in all it's quite a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knowing what I know now...","review":"If I had read this book when it was published I'm sure I would have had a much different response to it. If, for instance, I could still regard the CIA as a credible agency and not a useless, terrible joke I might have found the premise of a dynamic, competent CIA agent believable. Since the average CIA agent has been proven to be an inept bureaucrat the entire concept of the book is laughable.

After about 100 pages, though, the writing fizzles. While this is by no means a boring book, it lacks the expert research and background knowledge of a Clancy book.

A major disappoinment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"A lot of stereotypes here - the educated, mature CIA agent, his beautiful lawyer wife, a goodlooking international killer, a Ronald Reagan type of US President....

Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer read!","review":"My first time reading Silva, I found \\"Mark\\" to be a quick and entertaining summer read. The action was compelling and his decsriptions of locations (having been to most) were dead-on. The ending seemed a little rushed and predictable - but most of this genre do. \\"Mark\\" is a page turner like early Clancy; lets hope his future work don't begin to bloat with extraneous detail as Clancy's has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I thought this book was great for fast moving adreline rush people like me.

It's not here.","review":"I was expecting a good spy novel like Silva's previous The Unlikely Spy, but it definitely wasn't in this book. The Mark of the Assassin is not much more than a cheap knock-off of a Tom Clancy novel -- it even has a whole lot of stock stereotypical characters (the traitor, the love interest, the religiously ferverant crazy person). And if dumb action, stock characters, and impossible situations won't sell this book, why not stick in a whole lot of gratuitous sex? This book is a let down and I'm not look forward to Silva's new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Five stars for descrpitions of world geography - the author is evidently well traveled - but the story does not hold up. Can't give away too much to those who want to read it, but most of the key moments in the homestretch defied credibility.I may be getting jaded.

Why must the novel be \\"trailer-trashed\\" with the \\"F\\" word every other page?3. What happened to the bad guys (and gal)?I hope these books get better.

I won't waste my money buying another Silva book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Allon character prequel","review":"While not featuring as strong a protagonist as Silva's later books featuring Gabriel Allon, it does introduce characters that will be familiar to readers of Silva's Allon novels: the CIA's Adrian Carter, Mossad's Ari Shamron, and others.By itself, it's a solid if unspectacular thriller. But for fans of the Allon series, it has the added delightful dimension of providing backstory to several continuing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining plot ruined by trite domestic subplot ...","review":"This book could've been a fantastic thriller. All of the ingredients are present: a ruthless and brilliant assassin and a capable protagonist as his foil. The book was greatly diminished by it's portrayal of its protagonist's marriage to a high-powered lawyer obsessed with getting pregnant. It's artlessly handled and derails the pace of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having loved \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" for its depth, subtlety, and complexity, I was especially disappointed by the shallow, cliched characterizations and predictable plot of \\"Mark of the Assassin.\\" Taken on its own, it has a compelling premise - political and economic intrigue surrounding a terrorist attack on a commercial airline flight. The author raises interesting issues but doesn't go anywhere with them, staying instead with a race-against-time or chase-scene type approach. The ending set the stage for a sequel, but I'm not in a hurry to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to force myself to finish this book.","review":"When I first saw this book at the bookstore, I thought it would be a good read. Was I disappointed. Like other reviewers, I thought the plot was weak, characters lacking substance, and the ending of the book was a joke. I wasted my money on this book. The climax of the book was a major let down. I kept looking for more action, but there was none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"According to amazon.com this is a Gabriel Allon book.

You never feel that \\"Oh, I've read this or something like it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mark of the Assassin","review":"Excellent book written by Daniel Silva. The plot was well written. It kept me in suspense and was easy reading. His main character, October, kept me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller That Will Keep You Glued To Your Seat!","review":"The Mark Of The Assassin (originally to be titled The Society) is an exciting, fast-moving thriller that is well-worth reading. It has it all...interesting characters, good plot and sub-plots, lots of action and some good surprises. Silva can expect another bestseller when this book goes on-sale in March (possibly April); however, it is not without some minor flaws, such as occasional weak dialogue and a few secondary characters which could have been developed more. I think you'll be able to easily overlook these flaws.The Mark Of The Assassin is a very good second effort by Silva, but it is not as good as his previous thriller, The Unlikely Spy (which is now out in paperback). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiratorial nonsense","review":"I didn't get far with this story. When a bunch of unlikely conspirators from democracies and tyrannies meet in a luxury villa on a mountain top, indulge themselves inordinately, agree to kill a great many innocent men, women and children for their own profit, then leave and let the villa burn to the ground, I gave up and threw the book away. This author can write a good spy story, and has written several that are both gripping and sufficiently plausible, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, old-fashioned, lucky protagonists","review":"Not a very believable thriller, the field agent who only did research now can take out terrorists with a gun? And without combat training, he continues to survive assassination attempts? I found the dialogue repetitive and old-fashioned...who writes \\"he would have called his wife, but he didn't want to quarrel with her\\"? On top of that, there seemed to be a big focus on smoking (maybe Silva has a product placement contract w/Benson & Hedges and Marlboro?). I didn't care about the characters at the end and felt as if this was too easily written...like a movie where everything conveniently happens in the protagonist's favor. Vince Flynn's writing is much tighter and more thrilling, and his characters have much more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Spy Thriller, No Gabriel Allon","review":"I enjoyed two other of Silva's books about the artist and spy Gabriel Allon (The Messenger and The Secret Servant), but this one was a disappointment. It is not a spy thriller so much as a political conspiracy tale -- and a heavy handed one at that. Silva doesn't do politics as well as he does espionage. Just in case you want a synopsis, Republicans are evil and controlling the world. Wow, never heard that one before. Also, the female characters in this book are really distasteful. The one we are intended to sympathize with -- a Washington DC corporate lawyer -- is a whiner. Oh honey, how dare you go off to prevent terrorist attacks when you promised to be here to support me? Sheesh. And the other females are worse -- cardboard bitches and temptresses. The Amazon description says this is a \\"Gabriel Allon novel,\\" but as far as I can tell, he's not in the book at all. (I'm not all the way through the book, but I would be suprised if he showed up at this point.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"pine veneer roll","review":"Great product! Super fast and safe delivery!

Money well spent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musical- Great Book- Few Songs.","review":"Although 'Closer Than Ever' is one of my favorite Broadway revues, and all the sheet music in this book is very good, there aren't that many songs included. The songs are: Miss Byrd, One Of The Good Guys, Life Story, If I Sing, Back On Base, and Closer Than Ever. 'If I Sing' is an amazing piece. That alone is worth the price of the book. However, I would've given the book a fifth star if it had included more songs from the show. Such as... You Want To Be My Friend?, What Am I Doin'?, Three Friends, Another Wedding Song, or Father of Fathers. As I said, 'If I Sing' is absolutely amazing. If you have a tenor range and are interested in singing 'If I Sing', buy this book. If you want a taste of some great sheet music from an impressive revue musical, buy this book. But if you want to have a more complete collection from 'Closer Than Ever', buy the vocal score instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angie Houseman Abduction","review":"The information published in Through the Window by Diane Fanning regarding the abduction of Angie Houseman is incorrect. Angie Houseman was abducted from St. Ann, Missouri, not O,Fallon. There is a 20 mile difference in the locations of these two towns. This information should be verified for accuracy before being printed.I have not read the book. I came across the information about Angie Houseman while looking to see if there was any new information regarding her case on the internet. Sadly her murder remains unsolved 14 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenging Story and a Captivating Read","review":"I cannot imagine the research that went into this depiction of a serial killer's twenty year trail of murder.

I guess I may be spoiled by the best true crime writers, Ann Rule, Jack Olsen, and Jerry Bledsoe. They know how to tell a good story even with the most wicked, evil deeds. While Tommy's story is indeed horrific and disturbing, there was nothing to draw me in. I actually stopped reading it because it was so bad...which I never do! Pass on this...wait for another author to write Tommy's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real account, but not a great book.","review":"I bought this to do research about Tommy Lynn Sells for a grad school paper. The descriptions of Sells' crimes and thought processes are clear and specific enough to give one nightmares. In terms of its writing style, however, it's nearly childish, with phrases such as, \\"The monster under her bed was real!\\" to describe a victim's reaction to Sells' criminal behavior in action. The description of Sells' panic during his trial and longing for his wife's love feels like crocodile tears after the graphic descriptions of his crimes. For the investment of unpleasant detail, the writing style isn't strong enough to provide a payoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not a book I'll reread","review":"I'm a big fan of true crime but I wasn't enthused about this book. I found myself skimming pages, a sure sign that the author wasn't holding my attention.

The first part of the book moves rapidly from crime to crime. The author, Diane Fanning, talently holds the attention of the reader by documenting the who, when, where, how, and what of each of the crimes Sells has confessed to having committed. This part of the book is impossible to put down.However, once Sells is arrested and his trials begin, the book crawls along at the speed of a snail. It's dull, boring, and repetitive. All the information we've already been given is rehashed over and over and over again. For this reason, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sympathy for a devil","review":"Fanning wanted to tell a story and wanted to tell it fast. To do that she had to cooperate with the killer to get his version. Tommy Lynn Sells is a con man and he conned this writer. The book is entirely too sympathetic to Sells and has next to nothing about most of his victims and little about the police and prosecutors who worked to put him away.How distorted is the book? Well, Fanning worries that poor Mr. Sells and his \\"wife\\" (he married her while still married to another woman) were cruelly forced apart by the legal system. That is, a judge threatened to to give custody of her children to their father if she maintained contact with Sells. To Fanning this is persecution. To most people it is in the best interest of the children. What kind of parent pines after a serial killer who murdered children?Fanning even includes a letter from Sells as an afterward to this book.For those who read this book, google \\"Tommy Lynn Sells\\" and see how much Fanning distorted her portrait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untrue","review":"Diane Fanning does not check out her information before she publishes it and this is a grave mistake on her part.

Though this series of books is generally fantastic, I am terribly disappointed with the eating habits this particular book seeks to instill. Many prominent table problems among toddlers and young children are ignored. Healthy eating and eating until one is full should also be covered, but the author is completely oblivious to modern medical opinions on nutrition and diet. I am dumping this book ASAP.If you are desperate to teach healthy eating habits, trying new foods, and nutrition choices to your young child, I suggest Eat Healthy, Feel Great by William Sears. As far as table manners go and behavior management go, I am still looking for that book.Please don't espouse outdated attitudes about eating to one more child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book for my son","review":"I got the book mostly for my son.. who gives me a hard time when is comes to eating his food.

If serious about doing research, look to other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time for serious scholars","review":"Plant's writing is, first and foremost, dry and ill-organized. He dances around subjects at random without making any points, and instead has just collected a hodge podge of information concerning Nazi persecution of homosexuals. Secondly, his research is typically not correct, and colored with an all too present bias. Plant's only qualification for having written such a book is that he was a homosexual man living in the Germany at the start of the Third Reich.While there is always merit in reading any source, I would not recommend this book to scholars with many other sources at their disposal, or those with extensive knowledge on the Third Reich. The book's facts are nothing new, and are often better phrased and organized in other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The silent holocaust","review":"This work is a great eye opener for those wishing to discover much of what I have come to call the 'silent holocaust'. The treatment of homosexuals by the Nazi army was harsh and cruel yet the names of the dead resound silent throughout much of history. Through this silence we can see how our society has not changed in it's compassion and cultural 'taboos' even when bigotry reaches into mass-killing of innocent peoples. Today the murder of innocent men and women for their sexuality continues as the mentality of ethnic (and thus \\"moral\\") superiority.This book should be read by anyone who desires to learn about this 'silent holocaust' and how to prevent history for repeating itself.Namaste and Peace to all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much action","review":"OK, we know what the Nazis thought of Jews, so woowoo, it does not take a lot of imagination to figure out what they thought about Jewish homosexuals. With a title like \\"The Pink Triangle\\" one would expect a lot of antidotal stories of Third Reich horror. Unfortunately you will not get that here - not even the usual pictures unidentifiable starved dead bodies stacked up all over the place.This is more of a one man's search for his long lost childhood buddy. The author was separated from a dear friend in the early 1930's and began a search for him long after WWII ended.

It has info on tons of different strains and species of the plant, but that's exactly where I think this book has it's weakness.This book is very much quantity over quality. The author covers many different types of poppies but doesn't give too much information on them other than a basic overview. I was hoping the book would focus on the few popular species of poppy (rhoeas, orental, somniferum, Eschscholzia, etc.) giving thorough information then dividing the various species into less detailed strain descriptions.The pictures are nice, but I wish they were with the various sections and not only in the middle pages.Overall I say this book isn't that great.

This album is real punk, and much more. From the pounding & unwaivering drums, the searing sonic guitars, and the forceful and melodic vocals, few albums from the early 90's keep up the pace, the complexity, the heavenly noise, and the overwhelming driving beat of this album.

It also goes to sleep when not being used and wakes up automatically when addressed. I'm very pleased with the drive so far.The Bounceback software on the other hand should go right in the trash.

The intensity can almost be too much.

Based not just on these but his other recordings recently, Colin Davis seems to be softening in old age. Leslier Gerber's statement that these recordings are *more* aggressive baffles me. Compare literally any section side by side and you'll find the climaxes here more muted (the tympani is particularly dull and \\"thuddy\\"), the string-playing less taut, and the overall conception far less edgy. The sound is a little fuzzy too. When the complete set, plus overtures, tone poems and violin concerto can be had on Philips for about thirty bucks, there's no contest, and no reason this cycle was even necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lasted less time than it took to ship","review":"I ordered this pot and was very excited for it to arrive.

Difficulty in placing the carafe back under the maker to catch the coffee. Have to push hard, and then the coffee maker would move across the counter. Irritating, as if it was filled with water, it would splash out the back.4. Two holes in the back where the water reservior is...for what???? besides spilling?5.

That's just not enough for therapeutic use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thera bead pad smells","review":"The reviewer who complained of the smell is right but doesn't know how to avoid it. The smell comes from food residue in your microwave. The thin \\"cover\\" provided is to protect the skin from direct contact with the hot pad. I have had these as long as they've been made--have had back (disc) pain for 40 years. The answer I have found is using a thin towel wrapped around the pad while in the microwave which absorbs smells from the unit and can be kept afterward when hot, instead of a useless cover, while applying it to your body. The additional advice is to clean the microwave and especially the glass rotating plate and to wash the towel after 1-2 uses, or every time. Do these things and you will have little or no smell and no need discard the pad before its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book as beautiful as its main character","review":"The art of Pocahontas is, to my mind, one of the most beautiful books about animation art. Its composition following the making of the film step by step helps the reader to understand how a huge production such as Pocahontas is made and all the production aeras are represented. The pictures taken from the film and the artist's sketches shown in it are so great they could make anyone that did not like the design of Pocahontas ( and god knows they are a lot in France ) loves it. The only thing that could be improved is about photos of the artists in their work environment, there should be more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, deliberate and disturbing","review":"This isn't a remake or a sequel. Instead it is a good movie. Sticking quite faithfully to the original short story by Clive Barker, this is a well made and often disturbing film. Great performances by the cast, an excellent script, a haunting score and some moody photography all work together to make this one of the better adaptations of a Barker story. The Bluray, while not exactly eye candy, is a faithful reproduction of the directors intentions and all the scenes are sharp and decent looking. Not much in the way of extra features but the included documentary is fairly thorough if a bit short. All in all a great film and an excellent transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax, it's good fun","review":"Okay, if you are looking for a deep and intelligent film this is not the movie for you. But then again, horror is probably not the genre for you. However, if you are looking for a movie that makes you scream and laugh (mostly unintentionally, but that is another joy of the genre) then I think this movie is a perfect fit. I love this movie - it entertains me. It also doesn't hurt that Jonas Armstrong is a fox.Happy watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little thin, but worth the time","review":"In order to flesh out two stories \\"book of blood\\" and \\"on jerusalem street\\" a subplot was added to a very basic story. The original tale is no more than a college student tries to channel spirits in a haunted house, he succeeds and they inscribe their stories into his flesh. The stories, are the books of blood that follow. In the film he's a fraud who used to be able to commune with the dead, but then he get's it back and is hunted for his flesh and the stories it holds. The first paragraph of Barker's story is repeated over and over in unatural dialogue but other than that it's a fairly solid ghost story. This is an old school gore shocker, the type that try to build character and story to get the audience involved so the scares are scary. It doesn't work 100%, it's a bit thin on character and story, so the slow my turn people off. Still, for oringal concept you can't beat it and any Clive Barker fan should be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to this movie, after being entertained by the recent Midnight Meat Train release. Sadly, I was quite disappointed. Certainly not one of Clive's better works. It moved too slowly and the romantic connection between the main characters were overplayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dead end film about the dead having highways","review":"I'm a fan of Clive Barker, but as one of the other reviewers stated the lulls in this movie were too many and too long. BORING!! If it were not for the gore I would have dozed off watching this mess. Aside from the bad adoptation, what I found very annoying was the darkness of the movie- and I'm not talking about tone- I'm talking about the fact that I couldn't SEE about 1/3 of the film. The use of shadows and darkness always work well in horror movies but in this case I think they were using it to cover up cheap sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of Bland","review":"I can't believe Clive Barker let his name be used anywhere near this movie. One cool scene at the beginning and then an hour and a half of some boring love story. John Harrison and Darin Silverman did a terrible job at writing the screenplay from the original stories. I've read Clive Barker for years, and if he is anything, he isn't boring. Good luck making it through this one...I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Absolutley horrible.","review":"This movie was revolting. The people that made it should be ashamed.These wonderful works by Clive Barker have been violated by this movie. I am proud of Clive Barker for not actually directing this.It never touched on a single actual \\"Book of Blood\\" which are short stories, since the movie didn't even allude to that.Also, the sex scenes were too racy and normal to even remotely be attached to Clive Barker's name. If you follow his work, you know that it is a rare occurrence that simple heterosexual sex ending in orgasm and a night in bed together happens. Clive usually throws in a cenobite or at least minimal mutilation.I believe that these people that made this movie, slapped \\"Clive Barker\\" on the title and figured it would make money. They didn't get my 18 dollars.Also, the \\"how books of blood were made\\" idea of the movie, was not enough substance to even make four paragraphs in a book, let alone a movie.I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"This movie is so lame.There is to much useless gratuitous sex that has no point to the story.Simon sleeps in the nude and has no problems undressing in front of people, which is stupid.

This may be a hangover from its AutoCAD roots, but it really needs to be addressed before this product could be described as user-friendly. My other gripe about CC3 is the relative lack of content, such as textures and icons. Don't get be wrong, it has quite a lot, but less than some free mapping products and a lot less than I was expecting. I get the impression they have an eye firmly fixed on selling add-ons.

I was very disappointed that the book was so short with very little detail. Normally Sylvia describes the afterlife and the ornate buildings and duties and way of life in great detail, so my expectations were high.

I needed some kind of comfort that he was okay without us, tho. The book is written in such a way that a child could read and understand it, and I know that children can be just as grief stricken as adults when they lose a pet.

Is it really necessary to tell children that griffins and unicorns are real and go \\"home\\" when they die--and that we can telepathically communicate with them and other animals after we die and \\"go home\\", too? Browne would do well to remember the physician's oath, \\"Do no harm\\". This much-too-expensive 32 page book could upset and confuse children instead of helping them cope with loss.

Also, I prefer that the protagonist in the books I read be female. Contrary to the cover blurb that indicates the female police chief is the protagonist, the real main character in this book is Paul Osborne.

Throughout, the English curators and other academics emphasised caution and even suggested other interpretations (such as the 'incriminating objects' found with her remains being related to her faith or funerary ritual and not her profession - both eminently sensible, I would think) but Zoll seems fixated on a sensationalist approach which has little to do with archaeology and more, I suspect, to do with box-office and book sales.

I ordered these, and yes they are cheap and yes they came fast. THESE ARE NOT WONDFO TEST STRIPS. These are Clincal Guard. I got 5 false positives from the Clincal Guard test strips, which are super skinny blue handled hcg strips. Upon talking with some women on my TTC website, I was informed from several women that the same thing happened to them with the same brand and style test. SO BUYER BEWARE!!! I have re-ordered from another listing on here that says from Wondfo and they really are the pink handled Wondfo's. I love Wondfo's...so do try those.

These cheapo tests were still coming up negative three days past when I would have expected my period. I started to question whether the tests were accurate and so I went out to buy a regular pregnancy test. First Response came up positive 3 days past my missed period, as you'd expect a pregnancy test to do! and I have no doubt if I'd used them the previous day or the day before, it would have shown me a + result then, too.To test whether it was just a matter of my hormone levels increasing, I then went back and tested again with a cheapo. Still negative, 4 days past the time when my period was due. Not a recommended product for this reason. Buy a good test; these guys seem like a good buy but they just don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"False negatives for me","review":"On 14 dpo, I tested with these as well as with First Response. First Response showed a slight line and two of the wondfo's showed absolutely nothing. We were a little confused and didn't know what to think.

I received the same style tests but they were manufactured by clinical guard. These tests did not work. They hardly picked up the HCG after my ovidrel shot let alone when testing for pregnancy.

They were always sensitive and never gave false positives or evaps. This batch was my first experience with the pink handled Wondfo strips, so maybe that has something to do with it. Out of a pack of 25 Wondfo strips, 4 of them had obvious pink lines almost immediately, and all 4 were beta-confirmed false positives. I got 3 before the beta (one the day of); the 4th came AFTER my beta with hCG confirmed at zero. I should note that these lines are thinner than the control, like the dye is pulled to one side. (This is the same type of line many of the cheaper blue-dye tests tend to give). I suspect those with thicker pink lines should be a great deal more hopeful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"After one of my friends purchased this item I did as well.

It was advertised at Wondfo.I took a test and got a line SO faint, I was holding it up to the light and squinting. Well, I took a first response immediately after and got a DARK line immediately. (With the same urine sample).I went to the doctor that day for an HCG blood test, and my level was 223.1. If this test is sensitive enough to register 25 mIU/L, why was my result SOOOO ambiguous when my levels were 4 times what was necessary to get a positive? I tested 2 days later, with the same faint line (only I swear it was more faint) and HCG was at 400+.Please, just cough up the extra money for the First Response tests...no pregnant woman should have to deal with the stress and uncertainty of these ultra faint \\"is it or isn't it\\" results."},{"rating":"1","title":"False NEGATIVE. Urgh.","review":"I am a POAS fiend so these are naturally perfect because I can use a crap load and not feel guilty. Well, the problem is that they arn't sensitive enough detect a pregnancy until a WEEK after a missed period. Um, that is soooo not okay when you are trying to get pregnant. I relied on these to tell me if I was..and a couple days after my missed period I felt like something was amiss so I took a \\"real\\" test (First Response) and it was a big fat positive and these cheapos were still negative. So as a test I kept taking them every day to see when it would actually turn positive and exactly a week after my missed period I got a faint line.

Ive used other cheap HPT's like this (sold by Formosa LLC on Amazon) and have never had a problem with them until I got these.UPDATE: I did send an email to the seller and they refunded me for the product very quickly although I will not by from this seller again.

I was extremely disappointed! All except 1 were duds not even showing a faint line, and some with a control line so faint I could hardly see it.Except for one single test that showed 3 lines!! Yes 3 and anyone who has ever used a pregnancy test knows they are supposed to only have a pregnancy line & a control line - this test had what seemed to be 2 perfectly formed pregnancy lines and one slightly darker control line. Neat I must say, but still why did all the others say negative when only one said positive??

My doctor isn't tracking my HCG levels, so I am using these to find out when I get close to zero. Although you have to pee in a cup to use these, it is worth it for the price. I took the first one last night and it showed up positive. The only complaint I have for this product is that the positive line is very faint compared to the test line, but I expected that from reading some other reviews. Also, nowhere on the packaging or tests does it say the word Wondfo, but they do look just like the picture. Other than that, these are great to use every few days without breaking the bank.

Anyways to make a long story short, I tested on the Wanfu tests and it looked negative; after confirming with a blood test I was indeed pregnant I went out and bought a First response test & the test line was almost darker then the control line it was so dark.

I tested my tap water to make sure - negative on the tap water. The sixth day I got a negative. I thought I was having a chemical pregnancy and was devastated. I tested the next day and the following day and got the faint second line again. I checked the batch number online and sure enough this batch (many a few others) had been complained about by several women as giving false positives.

I do have some ClearBlue digital tests on hand to confirm any positives I may get, as I was the unfortunate victim of a false pos in the past with another brand of test.What I can say is they are a lot easier to use than I thought they would be, I hesitated and must have spent more money than I'd like to admit on midstream tests thinking they would be less mess. Not so. These are actually less messy in my opinion and by using cups, you can immediately confirm results without waiting. This is especially good for using FMU.The cost can't be beat either. I'm a very impatient woman and can test as much as I want without spending a fortune. I can save the more expensive ones only to confirm positives and a neg result only costs like $0.60 vs $6+ per test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a BFP 13 days after ovulation!","review":"I purchased these tests a few months prior to getting my BFP.

Had the pregnancy confirmed by my doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes cheap....","review":"Yes, these are cheap. But they aren't particularly sensitive.

Then my husband bought a Blueclear test , and it indicated that i am not pregnant . But the funniest thing that during my menstruation a did one test and very faint second line appeared , and after that 10 tests showed just one line !

I thought to myself maybe this one was more sensitive and maybe I had a chemical pregnancy after AF showed up. So I decided to give it another go and the same thing happened the next 2 months.I dont think I would repurchase these tests, you get so excited only to be let down in the end.

I read reviews they detect early pregnancies but they didnt even work when I was over a week late for my period. I tried using them and thought I wasn't pregnant. I was confused that I didnt get my period. I used 3 within a week period (all on different days and in the morning) and they all had the same result, negative. Then a few days later when I still didnt get my period I tried a store brand pregnancy test and it was positive. The next morning I tried to used the strip again and it still came back negative. I wouldnt waste your time or money on this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me false positives","review":"I am unsure what is going on with the wondfo tests lately, but I am not the only one who got a false positive with this brand. I had two tests that I took that showed a faint pink test line within 3 minutes of testing (test calls for you to read within 5 minutes). It was there as clear as could be but when I tested with a more expensive brand of hpt they were negative. A few days later my cycle started. I don't know if there are bad batches out there but I will not get this brand again, it completely crushed me to see that second pink line pop up in the testing time and it be a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Work.","review":"There is a bad batch of these going around at the moment.

I've read reviews on here before where people purchased Wondfo's and received other products instead but it never happend to me until now. I contacted the seller and they replied that the strips are manufactured by Wondfo but they put them in their own packaging.. I just don't believe it. Buyer be ware and read reviews.

These are a total waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 False positives","review":"I have used wondfo often in the past and never had a problem. The last two batches I have purchased, I got two very clear positives from each batch. The only problem is I keep finding out I am not pregnant. One of my close friends has also been getting false positives on a recently purchased batch. I will no longer be buying these as its quite heart breaking and frustrating to get all excited after seeing two lines not once but twice and finding out there will be no baby. I thought it was just bad luck the first time but now that i got burned again, I'm done with this brand. Hope this saves someone some heartache."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Hopes and Positives","review":"This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon. My husband and I started trying to conceive this year, and I purchased these strips because the deal seemed too good to be true. It was. I tested for four days in a row before starting a new cycle. Each day, I had one positive and one negative. Some days I had two positives. Then I used name brand tests to back up the results of these ones, and all name brands gave me negative results. Alas, I am not pregnant. The false positive is supposed to be rare; they are not so rare with these tests. I would not recommend buying these to anyone, and I will not buy them again. I'd rather buy the $1 tests from the dollar store than purchase these. They gave me a terrible emotional rollercoaster.

I got 25 of them and started to use them at 9dpo, when I started to show pregnancy signs. BFN all the way up to 12 dpo. I had a left over FRER from the month before, so I used that and got my BFP within seconds. As of 15 dpo, the Wondfo has just started to show a very very faint line that can only be seen when tilted a certain way and it took nearly 5 minutes for it to show. I don't recommend these to anyone unless you really are addicted to POAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad batch","review":"I had ordered this product before and was very happy with them. This batch that I just got is horrible. The tests are full of indents and pits, making it impossible to read the results. I guess if you had a blaring positive it wouldn't be so bad but when you have a faint positive, it's nearly impossible to read. Plus, the dye doesn't clear all the way through making it even harder to read.I'm hoping I just got a bad batch, it would be great if the company would replace them but I have no clue how to contact them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for early detection, but not progression","review":"These tests are great for early detection and for people that like to POAS constantly. However, if you want to continue using them for progression I would be leery.

This is rock and roll to rattle your windows with.\\"Faith Like That\\" is far-and-away THE standout track on this disc, even though it's mellower than many of the songs surrounding it. This song, and the CD's closing songs, show that this band can also handle the softer tunes with talent and taste.This whole CD is a fantastic first album, and reveals that Jonah33 has huge potential. I look forward to seeing them grow as songwriters and musicians in the future. For now though, buy this CD and set your volume to 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome if you like creed or bush","review":"I got this cd after somebody brought it to my work and let me have a listen.

It is a very preachy CD so people not into christian rock could get grumpy if you make them listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative and arresting debut... ****1/2 stars","review":"The debut album from Jonah33 is simply arresting at times. While a few of the lyrics fall into conventional Christian parameters, the group does find a fair amount of poetry to wrap driving guitars around. Bands that this recalls include Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and rightly so... I wouldn't lump this material with 4th or 5th generation grunge, but would place it closer to the source.\\"Faith Like That\\" gripped me from the first listen. Beautifully orchestrated, it combines the elements of dynamic percussion, sweeping strings, driving guitar and visceral vocals and a heart-felt plea for something better.The other tracks are also worth the purchase, ranging from good to great.Honestly, the guitar work alone is worth the buy.-Matt, from The Tricycle Wipeout http://myspace.com/thetricyclewipeout"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from this seller.....item cannot be activated.","review":"I ordered this as a new item however it had been used and the startup page with the confirmation number was never included and therefore the item is totally useless.

Can't really blame them; look what they did to Archduke Ferdinand. The Yugoslav boy had a JAMMED firearm and was surprised although happy that he hit his mark. There has to be an intelligence report at the time and Winston Churchill must have seen that report and NEVER forgotten its contents.

This young boy got to enjoy himself. He didn't have the stresses that others in his family had. In fact, he really had few worries, at a time when everyone was filled with fears of war and destruction.There were times when I wanted to just shake his mother. His father was clueless and I didn't think even shaking him would have done much good. I loved Georgie, Prince John's older brother. Throughout the movie I wondered who the strange woman was who befriended Prince John, \\"Johnnie\\" and found out only by watching the extra section after the movie that she was just added for effect. It's almost as if she represents all of us, who wish we could have been there to smile, wave, and appreciate this young boy.I love history and this movie was helpful putting some faces and situations to some names.I found it enjoyable, and not at all depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERRATED, LOVELY FILM","review":"This is an underrated film with lovely, heart-breaking performances.

Watching it makes one appreciate--among other things-- the privilege of being born a commoner. The addition of a brief but pithy epilogue showing more of the historical and social context would've been helpful to make the theme even clearer. But the dialogue and acting were excellent. The rather slow pace of the story gives viewers an opportunity to reflect on the significant convergence of events revolving around Prince Johnnie.

I used it daily and for the first month it was great, very accurate and easy to use. The feature that allows you to put a plate on the scale and then zero the weight was great and it was very easy to use. Unfortunatly after only 3 months of use the scale started acting crazy, it would turn off and on intermittantly and the weight would change while the food was on, at first this was occasional but it happened more and more frequently and by the time I had the scale for 4 months it didn't work at all. I would expect somehting like this to last more than 4 months even with daily use. I will definatly be trying a different brand for my next scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performance","review":"This scale resets every time you add or remove an item from it. Very frustrating.

Put in a brand new battery (thinking that maybe that is what it needed) and it will not work. I turn it on, it shows the 8888 and then immediately goes to Err. Cannot figure out what would be wrong with it and since it has a battery that obviously works because the numbers show in the window, all I can figure is that I got a dud. The box is gone and all I have is the directions anymore. Very unhappy with my purchase. Now I have to buy a new one and it definitely won't be a Taylor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use for a long time","review":"I have bought it for 3 months. The string is also in very good condition.

It's because he is a fabulous musician and probably the most underrated singer in the world today.I also have a feeling that no small measure of the success of this effort is the incandescent conducting of Richard Bonynge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too long...","review":"The premise is decent, but the execution is not very well thought out, particularly concerning the supernatural elements. Overall, the film feels too long, with many scenes ending up very wordy with characters just standing around talking endlessly and unrealistically to each other. There are a few good performances, including those from Jeff Boyet and Josh Childs, but a few good characters can't save a whole film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Shoes","review":"They are very stylish but are not the most comfortable shoe I've wore.

The title role is sung by an outstanding Samuel Ramey, who is the undisputed star of the evening. Vincenzo La Scola gives to Faust a genuine Italian voice, even if he lacks the drama that the role would require. On the other hand, Michele Crider represents probably the only weak link of the performance: her voice hardly supports the roughness of Marguerite and Helen. The orchestra and chorus of Teatro Alla Scala are brilliantly conducted by Riccardo Muti, who imposes a trembling and involving rithm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This was an absolute waste of money, the number 2 ingredient?

At times it did get boring, because it seemed like in every chapter scoot and amber had the same discussion, trying to determine whether or not Scott killed Laci. At first I didn't really think this issues was a major problem, I never really paid attention to it. I don't understand how you could kill somebody and then act normal likes its nothing. This book is good if you like mystery. It keeps you wondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im impressed","review":"From what ive read and seen about Amber Frey im impressed ................. the fact she could put a sentence together is very kudos for a woman like her. I wonder who her ghost writter was?"},{"rating":"1","title":"judge this book by its COVER!!! Horrible!!!","review":"This book contains 224 pages. Pictures take up quite a few pages. Lots have been on the news for a long while. Some stuff is already on the internet for the public to read!!!!! Amber brought out some facts about her family and childhood that I have not heard about. Being betrayed, Frey talks about a few difficult months during the trial on SCOTT PETERSON. I was sorry for her, especially since she revealed to have gone out with Scott. Her words were a repeat of the trial testimony. I am glad that Amber Frey helped to convict a murderer. Thanks to her. Bad thing is, this book is dissapointing and dull and flat. The publisher rushed this book and it is obvious, especially sicne the trial only ended a little more than a month ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"More editor than Amber","review":"Life is complicated and I have sympathy for Amber and the situation she was in but this book is a loosely thrown together patchwork of her real voice in transcripts, and her editors voice using a style and phrasing and language inconsistent with Amber's voice.It tries too hard to justify her which she seems to sorely need."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"Amber Frey is a money hungry, sad little person. It's really too bad that she felt the need to cash in on the tragedy of others. Luckily I was able to borrow this book so I didn't contribute to feeding her greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it and took it back...i should have known...","review":"it would be so damn boring. My whole interest was in Laci and all Amber goes on about is her and Scott, everything basically i got already from Courttv...in book form. It sucks do not buy it instead get Ann Bird's for her perspective and then Catherine Crier's for the court's perspective.

She should be ashamed of this book...witch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a good cat litter liner.","review":"I don't know what I was expecting when I started to read this book but I am sure it wasn't what I found. The book starts out with a length bible verse and there are numerous references to the author's strong christian faith. Somehow we go from strong christian woman to pages containing partially clad pictures of her in a nightie. I found this very hypocritcal and do not recommend this book to any of my christian friends. Watch out litter box, here I come..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self serving","review":"Amber Frey had sex with Scott Peterson the very night she met him.Before her child had even been introduced to Peterson she had him accompany her to pick the kid up from school.The only thing that really ended her romantic invovlement with him was finding another man.All these facts are all too unpleasantly on display in this self serving and obfuscatory work by Amber Frey.Though I'd picked up this book hoping to gain some insight into the mind of Scott Peterson from someone who had unique access to him in the days leading up to and away from his wife's disappearance, I was severely disappointed. That's because Frey was more interested in making excuses for what should have been obvious lapses in judgment.Unintentionally Frey revealed the intellectual abilities and life style habits of the type of woman Peterson would be interested in. But aside from that readers were left just as much in the dark about who Scott Peterson really was as they were when they originally picked up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K. BOOK IF YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE CASE","review":"This book was o.k. It is not too informative however. You don't learn anything different from what you've seen or heard in the media. I feel bad for Amber, but I feel even worse for Laci's family. This whole book is about \\"poor Amber\\". Yes, Scott was a real jerk and a compulsive liar, but there are lots of guys like that in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember Laci Not Amber","review":"There couldn't be two women more different than Laci and Amber.I think of Laci's sincere love for others and devotion to herfamily,then I look at Amber's inability to put two words together without the help of a ghostwriter and it makes me ill.Amber tries to make herself a hero but it all falls short.Her mention of her high moral standards are constantly mentionedmuch to my horror.I can't believe how she plays the victim yetshe repeats the same mistakes over and over again.Her usage ofmen is astounding,but she's always the victim in any controversial situation she finds herself in.Remember the realvictim Laci and you'll soon forget about Amber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"If you want to enable someone to profit off a tragedy, then buy this book. The book contains nothing that will not be heard on various talk shows Amber is making the rounds on, so save your money or if you must read it get it at the library. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I checked this book out of the library and I am so grateful that I am able to take it back. All I got out of this book was one big pity party for Amber and no respect for the dearly departed Laci or her grieving family. It's very sad that Amber slept with a cold blooded killer and she wants to profit from her terrible experience to help support her daughter but she shouldn't do it by exposing Laci's family to more pain by telling the whole world about Scott's marriage to Laci. Maybe it's a big wakeup call to Amber that you shouldn't jump into bed after one night of knowing the person and heavy drinking. People make dumb mistakes but Amber just needs to move on and keep her mouth shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amber On Amber ...","review":"I followed the Scott Peterson case on and off while it was going on. I could have an intelligent conversation about the case, but could not give you the little details that many could. This book didn't give me the details.Witness came across as a book that was less about the case and more about how great Amber Frey was for coming forward and impacting the case the way she did. That's a fine concept for a book, but not when the person who is getting praised is also the person writing the book.I'd be lying if I said that this book didn't give details about the case, it did, and if you're someone who just wants the bare bones of what the case was about then this is the book for you ... but the majority of the book focused on Amber Frey talking about how great a person Amber Frey is. The book was a good enough read, but it could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genuine Trash","review":"Terrible writing, blatantly opportunistic and not worth anyone's time or money. I read 15 pages, my disgust level rising with every word, and finally threw the book away. It's barely readable - clearly the work of an individual motivated by profit. Initially, I thought her brave to step forward and speak up; however, this piece of junk changed my mind. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even bother","review":"why would anyone even want to spend a single penny on a book like this? we have all heard the story and we don't need to hear it again from some barbie doll. i just looked at the cover and i knew she was just trying to get more air time. hey amber, WE GET THE PICTURE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I still say not worth the money!!","review":"If you've followed the trial and read the transcripts don't expect to find anything very compelling in this book or learn anything new. You may find some very \\"telling\\" inaccuracies between the book and her testimony though.In the book she says Scott sent books to her daughter by fed-ex in February, the 20th I believe. She states she turned them over to Buehler. Funny though his car was confiscated with those same books just days before. Did he then run out and buy new ones to send to her??? In fact the same books were in his car when he was arrested.Also how did he communicate with email after his computers were confiscated and why weren't these emails introduced into evidence? One would think they would be evidence of showing his obsession with her and would have made it into the trial.I am left with many unanswered questions by her book leaving me to wonder if she really had any input into the writing of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"judgment","review":"One Amazon reviewer cautions: \\"Judge not lest ye be judged.\\" Fine. I am willing to be judged on the morals and the values underlying the decisions portrayed in his book. This woman is an opportunistic, vain, self-serving, self-involved, boringly promiscuous, lying lover. My astonishment is that people who are readers read this! People pay a significant amount of money to read this trash. Meanwhile literature...fiction as well as non-fiction...suffers from publishing houses' overweening attention to supporting this prurient junk. Go figure. And Amazon sends me a special email encouraging me to buy it. Why would anyone spend good money to read this crap? I champion a million hardworking prostitutes before I support a woman who postures righteousness while she parades a series of dishonorable men through her children's home, and then, when it profits her, betrays them. So he's a jerk. So is she."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't America Great!!","review":"Everyone who buys this book has been ripped off! Demand a refund!Interesting little story, this Petterson case. But how much can Amber really add to the story, especially the part that hasn't already been told a billion times over? We need a book by Scott detailing all the incredible complexities and psychoanalytical issues with his sick, twisted brain. A real medical study and much meat that would produce! Amber is a side-kick who in the end is laughing to the bank! Don't fall for her fake crying, thinking this book carries any dramatic value!! She learned the acting method via Scott! I've read thousands (literally!) of books and this is the worse! Ever![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Just a money maker for another \\"victim of society who slept with the wrong guy.No one will believe the vivid dreams she claims she had, and no one feels sorry for someone who kept contact with this guy even after the cops left her home.She was after the cash on this one. DOesn't come across as a really bright individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Two Cents' Worth","review":"I have never read any other Laci/Scott books, and happened upon this one at the library, I read it in a few hours. I found it absurd that Ms. Frey kept on re-emphasizing her religious faith, her old-fashioned values, and her desire to start a traditional family, when at the same time she slept with Scott on their first date together, and then fathered a second child out of wedlock (the same way she fathered her first).The fact that she doesn't seem to see her actions as inconsistent with her professed beliefs makes me doubt she has a good handle on reality, and I had a hard time believing anything else she recounted in her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful for Amber","review":"I admit I have not read this book but I am going to buy it now and read it. I followed the trial. No one has died so that I can judge Amber Frey or her motives, that is not my job.I do have to say that if it were not for Amber Frey, Scott Peterson would have walked. Whatever her motives were or are, it took guts to step forward and tape those conversations. If she makes money on it, so be it. This is America. Amber was another one of Scott's victims.I am a mom, about Laci's age and I have a child with one on the way. I respect that she told her story and I am grateful that there was someone to help deliver justice to Scott Peterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness","review":"I just finished reading Witness and I must admit it took a lot of courage. It takes a lot of courage to face so many critics especially in this high-profile case. It was very tragic, about Laci and her baby. Like Amber my friend had a similar relationship. Starting from the meeting, the whirlwind romance, phone sex and then the horrible nightmare. This is what a sociopath is all about.This book will keep you on the edge, and open your mind and enlighten you to some men out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amber has a right to tell her story","review":"I cannot say I enjoyed this book as I too was a victim of a narcissist/psychopath and to read about Scott Peterson's lies and manipulation of Amber was a trip down memory lane for me. Amber has been ridiculed and her character assassinated because she fell so quickly for Scott Peterson, but unless you have experience with one of these personalities, you cannot possibly judge her or understand. Do I think Amber made some mistakes, big and small, yes. I have compassion for her as a somewhat naive young woman caught up in a tragedy not of her own making. It was interesting to get some background on her and helped me to understand why she made some of the poor choices with men that she has made. I applaud her for having the courage to come forward and assist law enforcement at great personal cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful excuse for a book - Total Waste of Money","review":"Amber's dedication of this book is to victims of domestic violence. She says her book will help others to not fall for someone like Snott! Is she serious? If she had really been interested in helping others by publishing this book she should have taken more time with it and put some information in it that might actually be of value to a victim. How can pictures of Amber in a scant nightgown help a domestic violence victim? The only person this book helps is Amber (and maybe her attorney)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"This book is tired. My wife likes it though.

One thing I'd like to point out - In the book, Amber says she didn't have a MAKEOVER just after she hired her attorney - YEAH RIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN A BLOND MOMENT. She says that she didn't have the time to get ready or fixed-up. Oh boy, her hair and appearance sure changed from the photos I have seen of her with Scott - oh wait! she must have not had time to get ready for her dates with Scott. She is all about herself in this book and making money from it. Sick to think that she is making money off of Lacy's story. This is about Lacy. If she didn't really want photos of herself (if you know what I mean) then why does she put it in her book. She is all about herself in her book. It's obvoius. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, REALLY!

I'm so glad that I didn't dish out any money for this stupid book. Amber is nothing but a hypocrite. She is judgemental of so many and yet, she doesn't see herself in all her descriptions of Scott Peterson. The only difference between them is that she didn't actually do away with Laci. She doesn't know if \\"she's made her mark in this world?\\" Please, give everybody a break. You don't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Laci Rocha Peterson. Keep any other info (if you have any left) to yourself, Amber Frey.

Her book was written not to inform and instead was to make money. The content was boring. She also portrays herself as a victim yet she is not a victim. Laci and the baby are.Overall I would rate this book a -1 but that rating is not available so I gave it one star. Save your money. It's just Sensationalized Trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and desperate just like its author","review":"Waste of time. Boring. Need I say more? No probably not but I will. Amber Frey is not a writer and it shows. Compare her interviews on television with the writing in this book and you'll soon realize someone wrote this for Amber. Poor twit. Everything in this book is already known. No-one cared for the \\"feel sorry for victim Amber\\" fest. I know I certainly did not. Amber is a media whore who is still in love with Scott Peterson. This book like many others about Laci's death are simply cashing in on the Rocha family tragedy. The girl has some serious issues with need for attention.So, if you buy this one, hopefully it will afford her some excellent therapy that she desperately needs and deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and hard to swallow","review":"I gave it a chance, but it doesn't make a lick of sense to me. Hardest to swallow is the claim that she never heard that Laci Peterson was missing starting Christmas eve until December 29, 2002. Sorry, Amber, that's just not washing with me. She was on every national news show over and over and over.An editorial note - next time the publisher needs to actually use one or use a better one. The book is riddled with passive voice and makes a sluggish read even more difficult to wade through.Verdict - this read is the best evidence Scott Peterson may not have killed his wife. Frey provides not a scintilla of real proof he did anything illegal.

Well, I was sadly disappointed. This is nothing more than a very long magazine article with no new information, not very well written and a story about a person who is so naive it is unbelievable. After seeing her interviews on many tv shows I can see how easily she could have been duped.It is a sad story but do not waste your money on this book. Everything you need to or want to know has been said in her tv interviews....I am thankful that she had the courage to come forward and testify but I feel sorry for Laci's family that this woman is making money from her part in this sad story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"She readily admits that this book is to secure a future for her children. It's all about money, and it would take a fool not to see that she saw dollar signs in Scott, too. Now she bemoans HIS motives? Puhleeeeze.I wish I had read the reviews and seen Oprah before I laid out money for this garbage. It's hypocritical, thrown together, has extremely poor editing, and reflects immaturity and intelligence levels of the author that boggle the mind. If you saw her on Oprah, or any of her other interviews, you realize that she can't put two words together, much less a coherent response to the questions of interviewers. Likewise, her attempts in this book for sympathy fall flat. She quotes the Bible, yet sprinkles the book with her own obscenities. I wonder if she's considered another Bible lesson: \\"You REAP what you SOW\\"? But then, Scott wasn't looking for a Christian OR intelligent conversation, hmm? This book proves he had found the right gal. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read at all","review":"First of all, I do not consider Amber Frey a \\"hero\\". Any person who is brought up with any morals and who knows right from wrong would do the exact same thing Ms. Frey did by coming forward and cooperating with the police. Also, she says she was raising her daughter while going to school and doing this \\"all by herself\\". Excuse me, but collecting AFDC is not \\"doing it all by yourself\\". The constant quotes from the Bible and the references to God throughout the book are a bit much.

First his half-sister and now this. I would have stood up and applauded Amber Frey had she done her civic duty to help put this man in jail and left it at that; but no, she decides to cash in with her tell-all book and movie of the week.

An appropriate title would have been \\"Amber Frey's Awful Modeling photos\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning Tragedy Into A Personal \\"Cash Cow\\"","review":"This woman's insight into Scott Peterson & the murders of Laci & Connor Peterson is neither important nor relevant. Her relationship with Scott Peterson has already been beaten to death by the media. There's nothing left that anyone with any sense would care to know. Not that there was anything interesting about her, or the two of them as a \\"couple\\", in the first place. This woman is turning a tragedy into personal gain. She now claims that \\"some of the proceeds from this book will go to charities\\". That's because she knew backlash from this swill would be inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dumb is this woman?!","review":"There isn't much more in this book to shed light on the Peterson case than there was in a recent issue of People Magazine. Amber Frey clearly has extremely poor judgment, horrible parenting skills (she describes herself as \\"fiercely protective\\" and then has some guy she's known for what, a week, pick up her daughter from school and take her home, alone), and portrays herself as a martyr throughout the entire book, which gets old really fast.

Laci, Connor, and Scott, who is now on death row. Amber Frey was the catalyst that destroyed that entire family. If she was not tangled in this weak man's life, this obviously confused man would not have turned on wife that way. (I have witnesed that phenomenon before, and the wife was pregnant also).It saddens me to see the anguish Laci's mother is going through. This might even kill her.I wonder, how can these professionals (Gloria Alred) and the like could have allowed this female to publish this mess. Well, I guess our priorities in the society are pretty confused. Look at what we admire.

Amber deservers anything she can make off of her book, her interviews, etc. How dare people judge her and accuse her of trying to make money off of the deaths of Laci and Conner. WE SHOULD BE THANKING HER, FOR COMING FORWARD, ALLOWING HER LIFE TO BE MADE PUBLIC. HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOU AMBER, A KILLER WOULD HAVE GONE FREE TO KILL AGAIN! Buy the book, share it with friends, NOT A WASTE OF MONEY! Wish I could get a signed edition! YOU GO, GIRLFRIEND! I am apalled at the negativity I have read here.

One should really step away from the media circus and the trial and read this book, and I mean really read it. Too many are quick to say she is just some \\"dumb blonde bimbo\\" without really understanding the whole thing from her perspective. What happened to her reminds us all too vividly that we are human, and that we are susceptible to conmen like Scott Peterson, and we don't want to admit it. Here's a quote from her book, from one of her church friends, \\"Amber, the only difference between you and everybody else is that your life is on public display. We all have skeletons in our closets.\\" How true!She saw the white fella on the horse and thought she had a wonderful chance to be happy. But he wasn't the fella on the white horse, he was the wolf in sheep's clothing. It took a lot of guts for her to come out with the story. She could have sold out to the tabloids but she didn't.

If you followed the case you will not learn anything new in this book except Amber Freys poor choices in relationships and how she might be dealing with her own mental illness that she is notaware of. This book was a waste of time and she just repeated her same story for monetary value. But I do give her credit for standing up for herself and helping the police with these cold hearted murders Scott commited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I think it was important for Amber Frey to get her story out, and I think she is a victim in all of this, but this is a shoddy attempt to profit off of the whole situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is less than one star possible?","review":"With the publication of this book Ms. Frey has truly prostituted herself in the eyes of the American public. With shoddy writing and extensive use of information already in the public domain, Ms. Frey uses her book as a means of generating sympathy for her as \\"the other woman\\" while providing useless and insipid insights into her own little life. Her use of the photos of Laci and Scott Peterson divided by Ms. Frey's picture is ironic in its image of Amber coming between Laci and her husband. Ms. Frey has managed to join the ranks of other women who enjoyed the pleasures of a married man and then sold out to the press. I can only wonder if she too danced in a G-String and used a cigar?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"This book is of two parts. The vast majority of it is made up of court, phone and police transcripts. All of which is available on courttv. The rest of the book goes into details of the relationship she had with Peterson.. Aside from the emotional aspects, all of this is also detailed within court papers.Since Ms Frey has no direct knowledge or experience of the actual murder and no contact with Laci Peterson, then what we have left is a scorned woman who was lied too. Yes, she did help the police. There are pictures of her as an 18 year old model and of her child.There is so much more that I can write about this book, but every comment I can think of touches on Ms Frey's character and therefore will be removed my Amazon.com like most of the other previous review of this book. My recommendation is not to purchase the book. There is nothing new in this book regarding the case and there are far better books out there that detail emotional challenges."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it, sorry I bought it.","review":"I was looking for something that would shed new light or at least make interesting reading - I found neither one. But I am disheartened at the suggestion that Amber should be sharing her story with teens as though she is a role model. I don't think I need that kind of role modeling thank you! I'm an abuse survivor, and if you want to learn more about the real victims of domestic violence, read, \\"Beneath Wings of an Angel.\\" Here is a woman's story that is making a difference for other survivors as she travels all over talking to teens about the perils of dating violence.

It is a quick read, with a lot of phone transcripts, quotes from news show interviews and pictures already seen. For the most part, I didn't learn much more than I already learned just by watching Court TV and Fox News. I do admire Amber for doing what she did to help the prosecution, it had to be extremely stressful, but I think this was a way to cash in and make money off the case. Sadly, most people would probably do the same thing in her shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"As I read through this book, sure it kept me going, but it turns out that Amber Frey is really a joke. She seems to have enjoyed her \\"fame\\" during the Rocha's time of crisis. It seems as if she has taken this situation into a money grabber. I have learned that she is devoted to herself, and she seems very promiscuous and flirtatious with many men she has encountered.The writing in this book has many repetitive words as the chapter unfold, and yes, it seems as if she did not write from her heart, but she rushed through it as quickly as possible. In addition, there are numerous pages filled with her photos, modeling ones too!Not a very good book; if interested in reading about the Laci case, I prefer you purchase the book written by Scott's sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions left unanswered","review":"I felt like Amber portrayed herself constantly in the light that she knows her daughter will someday review. Throughout the book she constantly professed her belief in the lord, but her daily life did not justify it.

In other words; \\"the dirt\\", \\"the skinny\\", the details on what he said and did in the privacy of their relationship that might give us a window into how his warped mind worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Case about a Sad Case","review":"I am so sorry I bought this book-it appears to me to have been written with one intention in mind and that was to make money.The book is poorly written-Amber is constantly seeking the readers sympathy-and quotes the bible on far too many occassions-yet her unchristian like behavior is repeated throughout the bookI hope Amber find happiness-but i also hopes she goes away from the public eye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Side","review":"I enjoyed this book. I didn't follow the trial so the info was mostly new to me. I did hear people on the radio bashing her for sounding dumb on the taped phone calls. After reading the book now I understand why she sounded that way. She was helping the police nab this sick-o. They told her things to ask and say at times. There is nothing wrong with her giving her side of what happend. She fell in love with him and had no idea he was married or watned by the police. Its a story that could happen to anyone, man or woman. We will never know how a husb/father could kill his own wife/son. He was not the same person inside as he was outside. I don't see any reason why she can't write a book about how she felt and what she went through. Its a free country and you can speak your mind. No one forces you to read a book. Its your choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brave lady","review":"This is another book that I do not understand why it got such bad reviews.

I didn't review it at the time,but a recent headline about Scott Peterson on death row nudged me. The book itself was just okay. It held my interest for the most part and I got thru it without too much skipping ahead. The writer herself was very annoying and that did color my perception of the book. She went to bed with this guy on the first date, knowing virtually nothing about him, a friend of a friend. She trusted him alone with her small daughter after going out with him a couple of times. She comes across as being this person who is all spiritual and good and noble, just a poor, helpless victim.... I personally think she was looking for her 15 minutes of fame. Well she found it. I'd skip it. There are much better books about this crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book","review":"All she does is wine about how her life is so bad. The book was written so bad that I had to stop reading after the first two chapters. I can't believe she let him pick her daughter after the first date! she's so dumb!

Why should it be any different for witnesses or jurors.

The other reviewers are correct in saying there is not a ton of new information here if you were following the case in the media. But it read like a woman telling her girlfriend all about this guy she met, and that was fun. It's a very easy read, and kept me interested until the end.

I thought her behavior before and during the trial was commendable. However, when I heard she'd written a book, my opinion of her lessened. When I actually read the book, it lessened still. Modeling photos? Abortion? Out of wedlock children? She was upset that some of her \\"friends\\" labeled her a party girl, but seemed more upset that her hair didn't look a certain way when she gave her first news conference.This book was definitely a disappointment.

She simply tries to confuse her audience about the kind of person/mother she is by citing the bible and referring to her faith in God. She talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk. I saw nothing new in this book and what's there is obviously hastily thrown together (I understand she wrote it, had it published, printed and shipped in 30 days). AND IT SHOWS. No go Amber!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Read!!","review":"This book was a waste of time and money! Very poorly written, no new information other than Amber's personal problems and long phone conversations between she and Scott, she is sleazy, and then claims to be religious.

She's also very naive and needs to learn a thing or two about the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book","review":"I was an avid watcher of the trial and the events leading up to it. I knew before reading this book that there might not be alot of new information. I am a real Amber fan for coming forward. However, she seems to have filled the book with incredibly boring details just to fill pages (\\"We got into Scott's truck\\" and then \\"We got out of Scott's truck\\"). We learn that she is a serial non-user of birth control. I'm not making a moral statement-just saying that there are things in this book that aren't relavent to the account of her relationship with Scott and subsequent events. In addition, the book is an extremely DULL read. Finally, I find it very offensive that she uses the pictures of Laci, Sharon and Ron on the jacket of this book. Sharon Rocha asked Amber to remove Laci's picture and she refused! I am ashamed that I contributed to lining Amber's pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witness is whiny and self serving","review":"This book sort of reminded me of the whining tone of a high school cheerleader's diary.

Like I said, whiny and self serving. Just a little pep talk from Amber, about Amber, to convince us what a fantastic person she is and how strong she is and how everyone thought she was so great for coming forward (as if she really had a CHOICE!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother.","review":"I watched the trial unfold off and on, and was HOPING once this book came out that I would get some additional information.After all, the title \\" Witness, for the Prosecution of Scott Peterson\\" would mean something.Don't hold your breath, OR stay up late reading it, there is nothing new.It is weird though, watching the author jump from quoting the Bible, to jumping into bed with her blind date, to her publishing her photos of herself, ( why? ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...who knows, they have NOTHING to do with her being a witness)She turns it into a very poorly written bio of herself, a lot of self whining and wondering why the men in her life always seem to turn on her.I'd save my money, and wait until it's in the bargain bin ( if you REALLY want to slog through it) if not, don't lose any sleep, it's not worth it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrible","review":"Amber Frye's book shows just how desperate and needy she is.

They are not a great fit, a wee bit small even though I ordered them 1/2 size larger than I usually wear. I just get tired of sending things back sometimes. The truth is they are way too ugly now to even wear outdoors so I can't recommend them for fit, style or decent good looks. Once I jumped in the car and to my horror had to get out to shake hands with someone new and I felt immediately terror-stricken about these ugly things on my feet.

The first session was in 1972, where all the songs Elvis recorded related to the dissolution of his marriage, with the exception of \\"Burning Love\\". A few days after this recording session, Elvis and the band returned to the studio to rehearse songs for the upcoming spring tour. Seven of those rehearsal songs are included here. The rest of the songs date from a 1975 recording session. Elvis was not happy about being forced to record another album. Unlike past recording sessions, where Elvis would record a song over and over until it was perfect, this time Elvis recorded as few takes as possible just to get it over with. I like this CD a lot, and I think other Elvis fans will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"If you want to get a compilation of songs that are wellknown and a bit over done... this is the book for you.

For an experienced coach, there is also a lot to learn from the finer points of this book. While being simplistic enough to grasp and teach, it delves into every nuance of basketball that can only be told by a coach who has had the experience to explore it all. It is apparent that Coach Leibowitz knows what he is talking about, has had success with these methods and knows how to speak to his reader and fellow coach. He delves into the x's and o's of the game, as well as many other psychological and leadership aspects of teaching basketball, along with many other intangibles and unforeseen situations. It works perfectly for any parent, coach, or just interested spectators.

Based not just on these but his other recordings recently, Colin Davis seems to be softening in old age. Compare literally any section side by side and you'll find the climaxes here more muted (the tympani is particularly dull and \\"thuddy\\"), the string-playing less taut, and the overall conception far less edgy. The sound is a little fuzzy too. The most interesting item is Kullervo, where Davis fares better than the rest, but overall these strike me at least as anonymous, faceless performances--fat and plummy and boring. Maybe Davis said it all in his first outing with the BSO. I wonder why he felt this set to be necessary.

However, I was not impressed with the author's sketchy views about channels. In live trading, we can get self-sabotaged if the set of beliefs about the market is not clear nor logical. You ought to know more.Channels are overlapped. Channels are nested. The usefulness of channels is to extend them into the future. You should recognize a channel in the making before its trend line can be draw. The major character of channels is their slope. Slope can be flatten or steepen before the channel turns into another channel into opposite direction. Price bounds between the left and right boundaries of channels. Inside channel, the volume trend direction relates to the price trend. figure them out one by one you can make trading a piece of cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"The book lays out how to trade an uptrending, downtrending or range bound channel. It asks for the practitioner of it's methodology to believe in the nature of price to move from one end of a channel to another and to do so quite often. I found the channels to be subjectively drawn and of no value. That describes the first 2/3 of the book.The final 1/3 of the book is a mish-mash of nonsense concerning Gann angles and a ton of other subjective nonsense. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"These other reviewers are overly generous","review":"Basic stuff. Channels and how to use them.

In a very simple method you draw a few lines on a price chart, and you can tell when to buy and sell that stock. Granted I have a degree in physics, but you could teach a 7 year old child how to draw these lines.The book has clear and well notated stock charts which make the material easy to understand. The book gets more complicated the further in to it you read.

I wouldn't think a piece of classical music, normally considered snooze material, would have such an impact. We were inspired and awed. We felt the music, especially since we've played it. The speed, agility and variring nature of the piece brings you up in the 1st section... slows you down in the second with beauteous harmony... brings the pace back up in the third for the final heart-wrenching finish. Buy this piece!!! You'll be happy you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent game","review":"I have to say that I loved this game.

Version 1.2 fixed many bugs, and you're able to get the clues from Wahooka if you don't foul up, plus Enigma doesn't prevent players from entering the Faerie Realm in that version. However, I have seen two problems that have been occuring. One problem is new in Version 1.2, the other has been there from day one and should have been fixed by Interplay long ago. The door to the gate in the Gate of the Ancients is supposed to be locked when you first arrive. Also, the very first group of shadow-skulls in the Palace of Shadows never appear properly and never attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DOS, Bad DOS.........","review":"I found out very fast why I hate playing games that still have access to the DOS system. I have played quite a few games via DOS, and never really liked it because we had to keep loading DOS and then restarting computer, but you get the idea. This game, StoneKeep, I guess would be a good game if it wasn't misleading. It says that it works on Win 95, 98, 2000 and Win ME. Well, I don't really know as we have a new Gateway, and it doesn't really like playing DOS games. Either that, or after trying for an hour, I just gave up. But, if you enjoyed it, I'm glad that you were able to. I wasn't, but just wanted to let others know that this game is slightly misleading.

Every level seemed like it was the same, only good part was the neat movie at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way a PC RPG should be!","review":"Stonekeep is an excellent RPG. Not many people have heard of this game, and I don't know why. The graphics are top notch (for a game designed during the time the game was released). The storyline is very well written. The magic system is done well. The combat system is not unique but done WELL! The ability to have other (computer controlled) charters to fight next to you is a nice feature. The puzzles make you think! The overall atmosphere draws you into the game.The only flaws are the game is to short. In theory you can finish the game in a day. No replay ability (one ending). You might want to go back and look for hidden magic weapons you missed before, though. And you have to work a little to make it run on newer systems.In the end this should be the standard as far on how a RPG should be made. You simply have to play this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME GAME!","review":"This game is the best! Good engine, great graphics, and the best point and click item menu.

In Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind: A Biography, Charles Nicholl delves into the information of da Vinci's colleagues as well as translations of da Vinci's notebooks in order to innovatively discuss the mysterious man behind the curtain who defines the Renaissance for many modern day historians with his revolutionary ideas and techniques. From his birth as the illegitimate son of the Tuscan Caterina to his death in the arms of King Francois, Nicholl modernizes the life of Leonardo da Vinci and insightfully answers many controversial questions, including his alleged homosexuality. Although the information is quite qualitative, the biography offers a new and exceptional perspective on da Vinci's character, personal life, and works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but boring","review":"The book \\"flights of the mind\\" by charles Nicholl, it one that has a lot of research behind it. I respect that, although when reading, I found a few problems. First of all, nicholl throws facts at you like a text book, and so you can lose track of where you are, and how it adds to Leonardo's legacy. Nicholl also tended to get sidetracked when explaining in depth something that had nothing to do with Leonardo. He also made a lot of assumptions that I feel he didn't make. I think he used a lot of information directly from other books, not that theirs anything wrong with that. He also would at times begin to repeat himself. The book had a huge amount of information within it. I found it was hard to pick out the important information and the information added as an overall picture. All in all, the book was heavy in facts, but with this it became a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a text book","review":"I was looking to learn more about this fascinating man. This book gave me details, but really no story. It was a laborious read. It read like a text book. It is filled with so many facts, that you lose track of what da Vinci accomplished.

Robb and his cohorts lack all the charm, wit, and skepticism of Jay, Grant, and the crew of Ghosthunters. Barry is the absolute worst - he is quick to identify every wind or noise as paranormal activity, then he almost injures his fellow investigators as he runs over them to get away from some proclaimed demonic activity.

I hate that these idiots have their own show, but at least they aren't ruining the great one anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"I have to disagree. This performance is best characterized by the old joke: \\"they're playing Bartok, and Bartok is losing.\\" It's not the fault of the core TSQ members, but rather that of Oundjian, whose playing I find agressive rather than spirited or assertive. Better to save your money for the (also OOP) *first* TSQ recording which was released, for about fifteen minutes, by Deutsche Grammophon in the early 1990s. It's worth a long crawl through broken glass: luxuriant, warm, extremely intelligent, and reasonably well recorded. The only other performance that does these pieces justice - by making them beautiful as well as dynamic - is an LP released by RCA Victor in the late 1970s. The performers? The Guarneri String Quartet, whose performance may not be the equal of that put out by the original TSQ, but it is quite good. Too bad it has yet to be released on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious mismatch of artists and repetoire","review":"I've listened to this album repeatedly and can find little to recommend it. The playing is, for the most part, soft focus, with retrained dynamics, slow tempi, and little understanding of the ethnic music basis of Bartok's composition. On the other hand, the performance of the 5th quartet, which was the last recorded, is good. However, there are much better two disc sets of the six Bartok quartets by the Berg, Emerson, Keller, and Takacs Quartets. Similar reservations apply to the performances of the Janacek quartets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing \\"all-around\\" CD","review":"So, obviously from the above title I LOVE this CD.

His study of the Second Temple Period along with his insighful parallels between Judaism and Christianity are worth more than gold in my opinion. In this book, Young examines Christ's parables from both the Jewish and Christian perspective. What I like about this book is that it helps the reader obtain the correct context of the readings, something that I push for with fervor. Just published, this book is a good read and an excellent resource for future study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of information","review":"If your like me, your always looking for deeper insight, deeper meaning.

It violates Christ's words: John 7:16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me. Mr. Young tries, and fails, to put Christ into his proper cultural and historical context. I love learning about the historical context of the Bible, but this work de-glorifies the omniscience of Christ and His Holy relationship with His Father. Being continuously in intimate union with His Father, and being taught by His Father, Christ NEVER relied upon the wisdom of men, to be His reference point in any or all of His teachings. \\"I have given them Thy Word\\" was the all sufficient prayer of our Great High Priest.Save your money for another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isnt what I waited!","review":"The jewish tradition about parables are an effort to defigure the Christ meaning.

It was only a couple weeks ago I learned a more faithful version was available on film, so I watched it and it does indeed stay far closer to the novel. True, it's less spectacular than Kubrick's relatively glossy and hyper effort, but if you enjoyed the novel, definitely check out the miniseries. Both films are worth viewing, but keep in mind that what Steven King wrote is a very different thing from what Stanley Kubrick filmed, don't confuse them.Note: This is a three episode anamorphic 16:9 widescreen presentation with commentary -- each episode occupying a single DVD side (side four being blank). Total duration is 273 minutes and although the picture is a little on the soft side, it's not excessively so. The DD2.0 sound track quality is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truer to the book","review":"I have the other version of the Shining, own the book and am a great Stephen King fan. Even though, I have seen this before I needed to own the DVD version ( have VHS but players are gone).

I was bored to tears. This movie was sappy to say the least. Ms. Grant is definitely not an actress ! Her performance was hollow, with little or no emotion.She acted as if she was reading from a teleprompter . The story line was not inspiring nor entertaining.

Amy seem like a nice person in the role, but she wasn't convincing in the character of Mary Ann. The supporting cast around her was pretty decent, however.I agree with another reviewer who was disappointed by the cuss words which, for me, removes it from the \\"clean\\" movie category. I think part of my disappointment was that Amy didn't use her gift of singing in the movie (which would have likely earned another star).Though I appreciate a good \\"sweep off the feet\\" romance, I did appreciate the take on what real love looks like. Shown in the character of Oliver, it is patient, kind, not rude (with the exception of his obvious rivalry with \\"the other man\\"), not selfish or boastful... present in time of need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I always like D.

Jonas Kaufmann is so well suited to the role and the entire cast is stunning vocally. The stage direction and sets and marvelous.But, the distracting video direction kind of pissed me off the first time I watched. It actually shows people behind the set or in the wings with a stage director waiting to come on DURING THE OPERA. It's weird. The Met broadcast viedos show behind the scenes between acts, but during the show. Come on.Without the distractions of the horrific video production I would give the production 5 stars. But 4 is as good I can come up with. All in all, some of the best singing available. It would make for a terrific CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance, Filmed With a Genuine Theatre Feeling","review":"The two leads are extremely gifted acting singers, and the support is excellent. Plasson andhis orchestra are wonderful, too. What sets this apart as a DVD is the theatricality of theapproach. This is not a \\"souvenir\\" of the performance, but the performance itself, withoccasional shots of the singers getting ready to enter or coming off the stage, of thestagehands readying the next set, and of the front of the stage with the orchestra at workwith the singers. This roving camera is used sparingly, in order to keep the emphasis on thestage, but it adds greatly to the experience. There is one very odd moment, though, at the endof the first disc, when Charlotte is preparing for the start of the third act(the \\"letters\\" scene). An assistant rushes up, as if to make some last-minute adjustment inher toilette or whatever, and Sophie Koch rather brusquely shoves her away.

Jonas is probably my favorite Werther -- he looks and acts the part, and his voice ... well, those of you who heard him at the Met in \\"Carmen\\" or Covent Garden in \\"Traviata\\" know what kind of power and dark beauty this guy sports. My only reservation about the DVD, which has nothing to do with Kaufmann and the rest of the excellent cast, is with the camera work. Pretty poor -- be prepared to be disappointed at the end of Act I when the camera give you only Kaufmann's chin, and no pan shots, as he emotes the hell out of the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of charcoal incense","review":"Charcoal incense is basically dipped in scented oil.

It has some of what happens behind the competitive and touring scenes. Still, though, the incessant self-touting never ceases to become bothersome.

Really, those that enforce totalitarian indoctrination must have him as a poster child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only readable for the mildly humorous writing style","review":"What a disppointment! As other reviewers have stated, I too enjoyed Mr. Cranston's skating. I had read this in anticipation of his new book coming out, but now I will save my money.There are some moderately interesting descriptions of skating tours in Japan and Central America. There are some vague descriptions of salacious or bizarre encounters with famous people. It should be a lot more interesting than it is. But Mr Cranston fails to make his era live for the reader, and he fails to offer any analysis of his decisions, making the book essentially pointless. Furthermore, any humor he achieves is ruined by two parallel themes: How great and Artistic Toller is, and how much he has Suffered. These themes were singularly unconvincing. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting if it's not quite \\"non-fiction\\"","review":"Toller is his own unique person, and some of his anecdotes are extremely funny.

But they should stay clear of jazz. The musicians don't and apparently can't swing! The opening cut, Stan Kenton's \\"Artistry in Rhythm,\\" is one of the least inspired renditions of the piece I've ever heard. Things get worse. At one point we are exposed to a 1950 recording featuring Roy Eldridge, playing, it seems, in another room. Brubeck's \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\" is just embarrassing, especially the trombone solo. Avoid this one, jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story and beautifully told","review":"Years ago I showed this as a projected film to my 7th grade students with good effect. The colors and animation are superb. Its theme is a welcome antidote to the harsh judgment children often pass on those who don't fit a common mold. Rip is a misfit among the solemn Dutchmen of his time and place. His gifts are not practical, but rather sympathy, warmth, and song. When Rip swallows a magic draught his world unravels and swirls about him in brightly colored clay bits. It is a visually impressive and artistically astute performance. His world is stitched back together with a new slant when a wise old mountain gives him some advice about values along the lines of the lilies of the field. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No,no,no","review":"I bought this to show my students after they read the short story. They asked me to stop the movie. Really. They would rather take a quiz than watch this. My students are in high school and they played along for a while but then things got crazy -- bizarre music, acid flashback scenes, and the worst part is that the movie tried to justify Rip's inability to take care of his own business. There was a whole segment where a talking mountain let Rip know that some things are just in this world for the delight of them--in song-- hmm, no. Rip's family doesn't even make an appearance. Very disappointed with this. Unless you are into early claymation, no, even then, skip this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"This is biggest rip off in years.

The movie is soap opera formatted, then old reels are thrown in, such as scenes from actual movies the above stars were in. Slapped together garbage.

What little \\"encouragement\\" as a busy mother and housewife I found in this book was quickly stamped out by the authors' extreme bias against anyone whose life isn't as perfectly balanced as her own. In fact, I have been extremely offended by many of her views as to what a mother and wife should be, as any woman who has had to work in order to feed and clothe her children would be, and her ignorance and snobbery towards those who have not been as blessed in life as she is is apparent within all she has to say, even as she claims to not be \\"condemning or judging\\".

I was wrong, and the music was wronged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Recording Of One Woman Singing and Acting Her Heart Out","review":"I've read many reviews complaining of the sound quality of this recording. Am I missing something? I think the recording is excellent. You can hear every word that comes out of Bernadette's mouth. Now, onto the show itself. It's brilliant. It's an acting and singing tour 'de force. One can either choose to listen to the entire recording from beginning to end, and get a great story set to exceptional music. This is where one can enrapture one's self in her Tony winning performance. If you aren't interested in the story, you can enjoy this for the many showtune standards sung with extreme passion by Miss. Peters, including \\"Take that Look Off Your Face,\\" \\"Tell Me On A Sunday,\\" and \\"Unexpected Song.\\" If you've read this review, don't hesitate to get this ultimate recording of the show, before it's out-of-print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who can tell?","review":"I have never reviewed any item that I gave less than four stars, so this is a first for me.

No criticism against Ms. Peters -- I couldn't tell if I liked her version or not. The sound quality on this recording is the worst I have ever encountered. This CD is for me, completely unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A star can shine through the thickest sludge","review":"Song and Dance is without a doubt a bad show. I won't reach for any zinging insults; it isnt worth it. The show is just bad. A dumb story (which, as Frank Rich pointed out, is brimming with overt misogynism) told entirely in Mr. Lloyd Webber's oh-so-special brand of europop. Bernadette Peters actually makes us care what's happening; she is excited, she is upset, she is happy, she is distant, she is wonderful. She needs better material! For every Sunday in the Park with George there is a Goodbye Girl . . . its a shame. Anyway, thank goodness the recording doesn't show off Mr. Lloyd Webber's Paganini variations; the piece is nearly unlistenable, although i didn't expect much more. Do not waste money on this relic of the 80's unless you are a sincere fan of Bernadette Peters. Even then, don't buy it - you will only feel sorry for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor recording of a great performance","review":"i saw ms. peters in this show. what a mess this recording is. total distortion at the end of both her big ballads. i cannot recommend this cd unless you are going for a complete collection of b. peters recordings. otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"I looked for this for awhile till I found a good price.

Webber's music, although familiar, is his best as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEP and Dance","review":"I fell asleep listening to this drivel. Bernadette is good, the music is O.K., the new lyrics stink. Buy it only for Bernadette Peters. The London cast music and lyrics are superior, but Marti Webb is not that great, or not nearly as good as Bernadette. You should buy both, or the London Cast if only one. The London cast is recorded live - bonus - and has the 2nd act dance music, which rocks the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE take that look off your face","review":"This is a turkey. Possibly the worst show recording ever made. I like Bernadette Peters, but here she sounds like she's just come in after a night out and can't even be bothered to sing the words. Presumably it's how she was directed. Marginally amusing on stage perhaps, but a loser on disc. Her accent veers around from Dick van Dyke-esque Cockney to Australia via South Africa, and to add insult to injury, the story and lyrics have undergone a dreadful rewrite, including all the textbook stereotypes you could think of about the English (drinking tea, being reserved, how original...), and all the best songs have been butchered.

Other than the scale of the trip, he takes few risks. And since he rarely gets out of his boat, and never for any length of time, he relates few interesting experiences. The terrorist attacks which happened while he was on his trip could have provided something to write about, especially later in his trip when people seem increasingly suspicious of him. However, he never explores this or any topic in depth here.Someone may find the campsite coordinates and packing list useful, however that content itself doesn't seem like enough to justify a full-length book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"If your interested in a Mississippi River trip, Byron Curtis certainlylends a hand with his book \\"Bluffs to Bayous\\".

His thoughts regarding faith, hope, trust, courage, being one's true self make for excellent reading and reflection.

I could stop there, but it would be the shortest review ever. This book is not just for religious. Br David takes one far beyond the basic levels of prayer and intercessions, taking the reader to the better realms of gratitude that teach a life to be lived in holistic fullness. While contemplation is not everyone's approach to God, this book enables an approach for people of any tradition. It is about the heart and mind and soul, alongside the realities of life - if there is any difference. I agree wholeheartedly with the dust jacket: enriching and enlightening. A must on the bookshelf of every religious/spirituality scholar - whatever your level.(Br Graham-Michael)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Hurt","review":"These recordings were made for Audiograph Records, they are not the original Columbia Recordings. 8 of the tracks are from Barbara's 1982 album The Biggest Hurt.

There is only a scant record of sources used throughout the book. As someone who has studied Russian history, I view this book as full of false assumptions and even propaganda. Of course, the book does contain a few true facts about Russian history, there are too many errors and misrepresentations to count.

The peltier technology pulls out about ten drops of water in an hour, not even close to enough to make a dent in the humidity level.

We've only had this dehumidifer for a week, so no opinion so far about its robustness, but so far it seems to be doing an excellent job: when showers make it very humid in there, this dehumidifier is taking a good quarter-cup of water out of the air over the course of maybe 3 hours. It's also quiet, certainly less noisy than the existing ceiling fan, and it doesn't take up much space.

At least it's working.I don't know whether or not it will die in a year like other reviewers have stated. If it does though, I will update this review.Oh and by the way, this unit is not loud by any means. Don't get me wrong, it isn't silent (you can hear the fan whirring) but unless you are a VERY light sleeper, I shouldn't think this would keep you awake at night.

The cost of running a pint unit was eating me alive, and it was difficult to move from one room to another. I bought the Petite for the bathroom. It worked well, so I got one for the kitchen. Finally I got anoher for that damp corner in my workroom. Just about then, the big unit died. Before I had time to replace it, I found that I didn't need it. These three little ones do as good a job and aren't in the way. This summer they run 24/7 but increase the electric bill only about $2.00 monthly. The big item ran the bill up about $50.00 a month.

This dehumidifier doesn't dehumidify. It's super quite, mostly because it's not really doing anything. And super compact, again because it does nothing. It sits in the corner, plugged into the wall, and sucks out maybe one cup of water per week. Pointless.

I was hoping to avoid having to use a full-size machine because of space constraints but it seems to be the only way to get this job done.I can't imagine this machine working for any purpose because it just doesn't have enough of a surface area where the air is sucked in to really do much good.

Towels in the bathroom stayed damp.As a comparison, a large Zenith dehumidifier was run in the same space for about three hours each evening after showers. During that period over a gallon of water had been collected. Towels dried, mold growth was minimized.Since the Zenith worked, there was obviously moisture in the bathroom. Even if the Eva Dry didn't have the capacity to dehumidify the space, it should have been collecting moisture. The bathroom had lots of moisture.

I have closed my bathroom door after a shower and allowed the evadry to go to work. Three hours later, it is still obviously much more humid in my bathroom than the rest of the house.

We sat it in a downstairs bathroom of small-to-average size, and after 1 and 1/2 full days of use, the unit collected about 1/2\\" of water in its tiny tray (in a very humid bathroom). On top of that, it made the bathroom hot with its fan. So the room was made hot, but no less humid. Not exactly why I bought this unit. I think a simple fan would have actually done better.

Good for year-round use; in the summer to reduce uncomfortable humidity and in the winter to prevent dampness and mold. While the fan isn't silent, it's very quiet.

This didn't change the humidity of our drafty damp kitchen a bit, so I returned the units to Amazon (that part was great). My recommendation: The EVA dry works but slowly, so it is of no use to dry a room, even a tiny one, if there is any draft. It would probably keep an equipment cabinet dry.The other problem: there is no drain plug by which it could drain into a sink.

It worked fairly well until about four months ago. Last summer I emptied the bucket every other day. This summer, it ran the same amount of time, but the bucket never got full enough for me to empty. You can still hear something working inside the unit, but you don't feel any air coming out of it. Now I'm back on amazon trying to find another bathroom dehumidifier.By the way, this product doesn't clear the air in a small bathroom like an installed bathroom fan would. The dehumidifier is not powerful enough. The mirror is still very foggy when you get out of the shower, and it did not fix my mold problem (even when the machine was functioning properly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"We needed a small dehumidifier for our 5th wheel trailer in the winter.

It is used in a closet at the end of my office in the basement. It's purpose is to keep the room dry and protect my coin collection and photograph paper from humidity. When i placed it in use i placed humidity detector strips around the room (7' x 11' with concrete walls on three sides). Since that time no strip has reached 30% humidity. I am very pleased with the performance. Easily emptied, and whisper quiet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dehumidifier","review":"Granted, I just started using this but it's been great thus far.

I can't even tell there's a fan in it. The unit moves a fair amount of air for the size but not really enough to handle a full room. It should work fine in my closet once I get a power receptacle installed in there. After having it running for only an hour I saw about 1/8\\" of water in the container. It's been running for two days and the container is about 1/4 full now. I'll be buying another one for the other closet after I see how well this one holds up. So far so good.

It's far too small to produce any noticeable change in air humidity in even a small room.

It comes out of the box a little smaller than I expected, but when placed in our small, unventilated bathroom, it sits there and quietly hums away, sucking a considerable amount of water out of the air. Every morning or so I turn it off and drain the little water collection tank. Kind of impressive (and oddly unsettling) how much water is in the air. I'm hoping this will diminish breeding grounds for mold and rot in the bathroom and make for a healthier environment. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta tell you!","review":"I play guitar, I own two. One happens to be an expensive Taylor \\"400 series\\". That guitar has to be kept in an area where the humidity is between 47-55%. I happen to live in Puerto Rico, where high humidity is a norm. My bedroom temp. is maintained between 64-67 degrees constant. However, the humidity level was always between 70-85% much too high. I unwrapped my Eva-dry Petite, placed it on my dresser, plugged it in and walked out and closed the door to the room...At the moment the humidity level was 79%. A few hours later (41/2-5hours) I checked in to see how the little puppy was doing. The tank contained approx. and inch and a half of water, and the humidity level was down to 74%. I was delighted! Can't wait to see the reading in the morning. By morning, based on this I expect to find a reading of 65% humidity, and it should all be downhill from there. I think this will be money well spent. You can register it on line for a one year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great -- until it doesn't...","review":"I thought this item was incredible, until two units in a row died just out of warranty. One day they work, and then they just don't -- still get power, but the heat sink doesn't cool and the fan no longer runs. I feel a little cheated since these aren't cheap, and they manage to fail when I have no recourse. I'm disappointed since I have to find another solution for my small laundry room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe 1 cup per week","review":"This machine fits fine in our small bathroom, but it doesn't take much water out of the air.

After about 4 hours, nothing. After bout 8, a very small amount of water. The positive is you can barely her it run. I am guessing it doesn't draw too much power, however, the amount of time it would take to actually dry out an area would equal out to just using a much higher powered unit for a much shorter time.

Fan inside misaligned somehow. Important to note the fan is not held down by screws but rather notches. So if you drop this unit it might dislodge the fan and make it terribly loud.Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to take screwdriver and re-adjust the fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I use this in our boat's cabin - prior to buying this product we were using crystal moisture absorbers. And while these work nicely it gets quite expensive to change every few weeks. This little unit has been removing a pint about every three days and the interior of the boat has not felt better. So far it is operating flawlessly - we think we have saved a great deal of money by purchasing this product. I am not sure why others have had the problems they report - but we couldn't be happier. Perhaps they were expecting this petite unit to work like a floor model - we gave it a reasonable assignment, a limited closed space on a boat, and it has been performing as promised. Don't ask it to dehumidify a huge space and we think you will be surprised by it's performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $","review":"Does it dehumidify? Yes, maybe a little in a small space. Not really enough to make much a difference though. I'd say maybe like a 1/2 cup per day max on very humid areas.It also is not durable enough for continuous use. Ours broke very quickly. So if you want to occasionally put it in your car to dehumidify it, fine. But if you want to run it constantly in say a bathroom, it's really not suited for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware No free shipping","review":"I read some of the reviews about the eva-dry and thought it might be good enough for me. When i got the product i turn it on and decided it was too weak for a bathroom. So i returned it only to find out that since i returned it, it doesn't qualify for the free shipping.

Unfortunately, access to the sump is in this space and the room would always get musty. It's small, about 10x10 with only about a 6 ft ceiling. I put a small conventional dehumidifier in there, but it heated up the space a lot, which is not great for a cold storage. The Eva Dry completely solved the dampness and musty smell in there without heating up the air. Because it's not in a living space, noise isn't a big issue (but it's nice that I can't hear it). It fills up about once every couple of weeks and has made a noticeable difference in the air quality down there. For the right application, this product works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I bought this for a small 12x12 bedroom that I was having moisture problems with & it works great. My towels wouldn't dry before & in the morning there would be a light mist on top of my blankets. I was worried that this dehumidifier was going to be too small but I also have a bathroom without a vent that I thought I could always use it in if I needed a bigger one for my bedroom. It handles the bedroom fine & I'm going to pick up another for the bathroom. It's amazing the amount of water it pulls out of the air!

A has an amazing amount of energy for a band that's going over well tread ground. Lyrically, I find this album insulting. Not in any outraged way that I would react to someone like Eminem. Instead, I'm insulted by how little time this group seems to have spent coming up with words to their songs. Chants like \\"the old folks are losers. They can't work computers!\\" are part of what makes this one of the dumbest albums I've ever heard. They might be able to make up with this with the sheer energy they seem to show while playing, but there's another major drawback: the lead singer has one of the most obnoxious whiney voices that I've ever heard.

I also own Claudio Arrau's full recording of all the Etudes. Both Arrau and Kissin, (and most others,) blow through this piece at astounding speed. Yet Watts on the other hand slows it down and lets the listener feel and hear every single note. The melody when played slower has a totally different effect on the listener and I find that it is more emotional than just agitating, which is how I believe Liszt said it should be played.

Most of the questions in this guide were not even in the books we used for class. Using this review guide made me feel like I never passed the course in the first place as I got so many questions wrong. I knew the course material. I got an A- on our final and a B in the class yet taking the tests in this book I kept averaging only half the questions correct! This couldn't be right. I couldn't have taken the course and come out of it not prepared and knowing nothing.I stopped using it and instead got: SUCCESS! For the EMT BASIC: 2nd ed. I passed the National Registry Exam after answering only 71 questions (you have to answer a minimum of 70 so that means I did VERY VERY well). After taking the exam and looking back the SUCCESS book is far more worth your time as it also adheres to the the style of questioning that the NREMT test gives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your MONEY!!!","review":"Today (Dec. 03 2009) I took the National Exam for EMT-B and I used this book to study for the test.

If you're looking for a book that's very helpful and encourages you to continue to learn new materials I highly recommed \\"EMT-Basic Review: A case-based approach\\" by Kaye Nagell and Neil Coker.

Tracey Ullman is over the top and annoying. (As a huge Tracey Ullman fan it is hard to watch her clod her way through each scene.) Dawn French carries the weight of the show, but the scripts are pretty bad....I was bored by the predictable plots...i have not been able to watch more than 3 episodes, unfortunately I bought both sets 1 and 2.

The kids jumped for hours on that one and even the adults got in and got their fix and burned off some calories. The Jump 'n Slide has the bounce equivalent of a mattress (I think that might even be generous to say). It's definitely not a replacement for a trampoline. I called the company to discuss this and they explained that the materials do not allow for a bounce. I'll be returning mine this week and will put my money towards a real \\"bounce house\\".For those who aren't concerned with bouncing, the toy is okay.

It has a great amount of space inside and my husband or I often go in with the kids so it can definitely hold a good amount of weight with no issues. We have low ceilings in our basement which is not a problem with this jump n slide. We did receive this with a few minor leaks, but not enough to worry about. We figure our kids will make it leak more. I read the reviews that mentioned the issue about the back door. We put that side up against a wall and don't let the kids use it.

We have now returned 3 of these because of poor construction. The product does not seem to get firm enough, and on each one we have had we found a place where air was leaking out of the seams. My three year old was very disappointed because this is the only model we have found with a slide (which she loved) and we had to return it for another brand.

My kids love running up it and falling into the jumping area. The blower isn't very loud. My only complaint would be the back door. I just worry about someone falling out. AS I'm writing this my son almost fell out the back door. We haven't tried putting it the bag yet so we'll see how that goes.

And, of course, Cranston's opinions on the world of figure skating--warts and all--are worth the price of the book alone. He's not afraid to criticize a sport that he helped to make popular--he sees the problems, and tells it like it is.

I could tell no difference in performance. Neither oil tastes of coconuts but is simply healthier to use than highly processed vegetable oils. My only complaint with this oil is that it is sold in a plastic container. I've never understood why a company would choose to put an organic product in plastic. The container is the reason I deducted one star and is the reason I probably will not buy this oil until or if they choose to sell it in a glass container. Either can be recycled but glass is free of chemicals. Otherwise, I recommend the oil itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle flavor with varied applications!","review":"I have used this in a few recipes that require frying or with foods that absorb flavors. We used it to sautee kale, potatoes, and chicken to start with. The kale's flavor didn't seem affected much from our typical olive oil. The potatoes, however, picked up a slightly sweet flavor that we weren't crazy about. The chicken was just... slick? It was definitely different than olive oil, but we used garlic and some other herbs, so the flavor was the same, just the texture was different. When we sautee chicken in olive oil, it's not slick like it was this time. It wasn't slimy, but it was a definite difference. Overall, once I got used to having it be a solid that I had to scoop out and figure out how much it would spread as it melted, it wasn't a bad change. I will probably still have olive oil on hand for a few things, but knowing how much better this is supposed to be for you, I will probably make this the staple in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, reasonably priced organic coconut oil","review":"Coconut oil has become widely promoted in recent years as a health food. It has components that support multiple body systems, and can help fight infection, help prevent or treat Alzheimer's, improve skin health, and assist in absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Coconut oil is a saturated fat, one which is generally a healthier alternative to saturated animal fats. It doesn't degrade quickly like many vegetable oils do, and it can be used for a variety of things, both internally and externally. When consumed in food it can be hard for some people to digest (particularly people with weak gall bladders). Thus, be conscious of how well your body handles this concentrated oil and don't overdose. Jarrow's organic coconut oil seems to be of similar quality to other respected brands of organic raw coconut oil - at a competitive price. If you are looking for a coconut oil supplement Jarrow offers a good option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try It Once, You Will Turn To It Again and Again.","review":"I have been using coconut oil as a skin and hair treatment for quite a while, and loved it. I finally decided to jump into a new adventure and give it a try for cooking too. What a surprise! Tastes great, not overly like coconut, low melting point, and really seems to soak into food less than other products. The real test, fried chicken. Used less than regular oils, and found it to crisp the chicken more evenly, and did not hold the oil, even when warming a leftover piece the next day. Normally, I found fried chicken to be greasier and less tasty the second day, but this really surprised me. I keep some in the bathroom, and some in the kitchen. Love that it is multi use and healthier to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This coconut oil is perfect for times when you don't want any coconut taste.

Coconut oil isn't something you'd want to eat all the time, due to the saturated fat; however, it's mostly good fat that it has and it tastes frickin' awesome. Good to cook with on a pan too. It says it has a \\"neutral\\" flavor, but to me you can definitely taste a distinct flavor. I guess that it may be considered neutral due to being able to mix well with other things, but you can still taste it's richness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels good on my skin","review":"I use this on my skin and feet before i go to bed to keep my skin soft.

We used it to fry shrimp and it was great, high smoke point so great for high heat frying and no taste just as promised. I think that was what I worried most about it, I'm not a fan of coconut and I didn't want my food to taste like it. If I'm fixing Thai that's great, but southern-fried shrimp with old bay seasoning should not taste like coconut and it doesn't. Also works great as a fat replacement in baking recipes. It's solid in the container (at least at our house in winter in NC) and easy to use. It melts quickly in the pan and cooks evenly and great.

This coconut oil has been around a long, long time and I have tried it many times.This, like all coconut oils has a very high heat tolerance. What does this mean for cooking? When you cook something, like a piece of meat, or do a stir fry, where the heat needs to be extremely hot, and most other oils would burn and thus deteriote, this stays true.I use it to cook almost everything. There is never any smoke and the flavors it produces is exceptional. Try it with white or brown rice for a truly authentic taste. Sear your meat in a little of it and you will take out 90% of the fat and what you're left with is a beautifully chared piece of meat with no over-powering coconut flavor. Just a lovely hint.I highly recommend that you buy this and give it a try.

Eva Braun did write 20 pages of a real diary in 1935 and these torn-out extracts survive and are authentic. They reveal several things: Hitler was completely normal sexually (though he did ignore her for long bouts) and he did care for her, though he wasn't passionately enamored with her. She was with him, however. They had a normal, prosaic relationship, devoid of sado-mashochism or other ridiculous perversions detailed here.It obviously bothers people that a mass murderer could still function normally between the sheets with his mistress and for this reason, trashy books like this are written and find a market. Anyone who lays credence in the idiotic nonsense between the covers of this tome need to seriously consult a non-fiction source on Eva Braun. This is the nadir of published material on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged to the end","review":"This book came to me because I picked it up and was curious of this woman. I was greatly disappointed. Gold portrays Eva Braun as one of the most selfish, arrogant, stupid people of her time. Thus suiting her position with Hitler. It is bias. An author deeply analyses what a woman wants with Hitler and uses Braun's diary as a tool to use against Braun and Hitler. Eva's character is utterly unbelievable. She is the worst character I have read. Braun and Hitler are portrayed as deeply perverse at times. If the book was fact, the writing style is understandable but it is not the case. The writing style is too tedious and I only kept reading to review this. She dragged everything slowly. It seemed the 40s would never end. During this long drag of days and months, Gold depicts a horrible/loathsome-worthy Protag. Her true intention in the end.

While historical facts are sprinkled throughout the diary's entries, these only serve to sharpen the shallowness of the author's perception into the psyche of the woman who not only stayed loyal to Hitler for so many years, but also flew to Berlin against the Führer's express instructions to marry him and commit suicide. The placid, dependent Eva sketched in this supposed diary lacks the passion and determination that the real Eva must certainly have possessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly biased, unimaginative, boring...","review":"I picked this up because it was in the autobiography/biography section in my library, causing me to believe that it was actual nonfiction, based entirely on factual evidence.

A kind of paralysis sets in immediately after the brilliantly-written description of the horribly real people who sell the author the \\"Diary.\\" Alas, these are the last horribly real characters to appear in the novel. The unrelenting banality of the \\"Diary\\" entries seems to owe much to a reading of Hannah Arendt, without Arendt's originality. Alas, it not only makes dull prose -- it offers nothing new. This was an opportunity for Gold to say something about a much-neglected topic, offer some insight into a notorious but little-understood relationship, but she has largely passed up the opportunity.

In her book we get to read the somewhat fictional diary of Eva Braun, and we not only learn daily routines of Eva but we also get insight into what kind of relationship(or so-called relationship) she and Hitler had. The woman Gold introduces to us is pathic, greedy, cruel, souless, and above all a person who could never be admired. Not only is she the devil's mistress but she too can be considered a devil herself.Her only interests are in herself. She hordes jewels and furs, trades rationed food for shoes, and even whines about herselve when her maid kills herself...what will happen to her.I felt Gold did a great job at creating the character of Eva Braun (becuase that is what she tends to be in history).

How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together. If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.2) Page 130 - \\"There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.

After trying to ignore, deny, confront, forgive, explain, rinse and repeat--well, I truly thought I was the definition of insanity. Doing the same things, over and over, expecting different results, with no idea how to begin to really heal.Since reading this, we have done more receiving in six months than we did in the year before. Dr. Glass is compassionate and logical in her presentation. I truly appreciated her approach to this subject. It seems like so often, the betrayed partner is victimized by what they should or should not have done. Not so in \\"NOT Just Friends\\".I highly recommend this if you feel like you are going completely insane.

Needless to say, i am not the trusting person i once was.Shirley Glass' work is thought provoking because she shows you how infidelity can happen to some basically good honest people. I also enjoyed her work because she guides you in some techniques to help you through the healing process.I also highly recommend \\"Meeting, Mating and Cheating,\\" by Andrea Orr, a new book about infidelity on the internet. It contains some more intriguing stories about men and women who cheat all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for Good Reason","review":"Excellent.

It does a great job of explaining how a platonic relationship can turn into an \\"emotional affair\\" which will likely lead to a physical relationship.

It was a good read but one thing I would suggest is not to venture into territory you do not belong in. You would know the signs of something changing in you towards another.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would have liked even more profiles. Each chapter deals with a silent star, some quite well known, some not so. There is also an excellent overview of silent films in general. The author writes in an enjoyable, easy-going manner, but there is plenty of information, and great photos. There are wonderful takes on Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, The Talmadge Sisters, Lon Chaney, John Gilbert, and so many more, even Rin Tin Tin! Really a great read, with some unforgettable tid-bits. (You'll never believe what Pola Negri said she would always remember Valentino for, or where Rin Tin Tin drew his last breath). Wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for anyone","review":"like all Basinger's books, this imparts lots & lots of info and is a fun, often funny, read. it does not, however, go as deep as her other books and is just a selective introduction for the non-specialist to the world of silent films thru its actors: brief bio-critiques, of varying degrees of rigor & interest, of Mary Pickford, Mabel Normand, Douglas Fairbanks, Norma & Constance Talmadge, Tom Mix, Wm. S. Hart, Gloria Swanson, Pola Negri, Rudolph Valentino, Marion Davies, Lon Chaney, John Gilbert, Clara Bow, Colleen Moore and Rin-Tin-Tin. some chapters are very rivetting & enlightening [Lon, John, Rudy, Wm.], others ho-hum [Mary, Marion], and one [\\"Doug\\" (sic)] so vapid that one must turn one's eyes away and blush. the photos, however, are altogether gorgeous. a lush book of high general interest & many hours of perusing pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent but not Forgoten","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

It is a thought-provoking tale of facing one's mortality. Tolstoy demonstrates incredible insightful in this story; it will cause you to reflect on your life in terms of the certainty of death. Of the other three stories, \\"Family Happiness\\" is the strongest. Tolstoy again presents a story that will make readers think--this time in terms of considering their own values concerning marriage, love, commitment and children. The other two stories, \\"The Kruetzer Sonata\\" and \\"The Devil\\" are well-written explorations of similar themes (lust, jealousy, infidelity, etc.). While still vintage Tolstoy, these stories are weaker than the other two and show his darker side.

I've bought him each one of them. He carries them around the house with him, sleeps with them in his dog bed, amuses himself with them, and makes them talk sometimes - for ten minutes in a row. He does eventually destroy most of them, pulling the ears off the parrot, destroying the sound mechanism inside, ripping some of them apart. They last him one to several months. His favorite of them all seems to have been the pup from Multipet - not pretty much destroyed after three weeks. They are his pets. But this monkey, though it's absolutely adorable, more adorable than the chimp, has the most annoying screeching sound I've ever heard. I haven't given it to him because I don't want to hear that awful screech all day. Something to be concerned about. The sounds the other Multipets make are tolerable, or even cute. Nothing cute about the screeching monkey sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great due to the voice, but harder for small dogs","review":"My dog has a monkey toy she shakes and it makes a monkey sound so I thought ordering some of these would be the same brand...they are her favorite. Unfortunately, these won't make a sound unless she squeezes them in the middle and for a smaller dog that's pretty hard to do. She gets her fun by me squeezing it as we play fetch but she still tries to shake it to get it to make a sound which I prefer as that was easier for her in the other brand (which I have no clue what brand it was so I cant recommend it; something I found at Wal-Mart that is no longer there.)That said, she still has fun with it and enjoys the sound when I squeeze it for her...if you have a medium or large dog they'll LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves it!","review":"The monkey is very entertaining and my lab loves the realistic sound it makes.

A successful player in the telecom industry (among other things, he was a senior executive of Global Crossing: so draw your own conclusions), the author presumes to set himself up as an expert on great management and negotiation technique-- but the book seems to be more an excuse for name-dropping and self-congratulation than an attempt to provide any original insight or advice. A notable example of his vaunted negotiation skill is that, in connection with a merger, he did not disclose material information to an acquirer, because the acquirer didn't ask precisely the right question. Thus, a key part of his strategy is to know when to keep his mouth shut: too bad his editors didn't remind him of that.

But deals got done.I wanted to know who the author considered \\"great dealmakers\\" and what they had done to be so named. Some are household names. He focused, however, on those in the Media World, where he has established himself.The chapters on Mike Armstrong and Barry Diller are of special interest to me.

After one day of wear, they already look torn up on the outside.It makes me wonder if these socks really are made by the same Wigwam. They are far inferior to the other wigwam socks I've had. If I can return them, I will be. I've only used one of the pairs, but have zero desire to put another pair of these socks on again.

In a world full of money-making and talentless hacks this is one talented lady who really deserves commercial success.This entire cd has a laidback, home-grown feel. The material is uniformly strong. Johnny Met June and Rainy Night in Georgia are particularly strong. The supporting musicians are first rate but never intrude. If you know Shelby Lynne then I am preaching to the converted.

'Cities of the Plain' was absolutely terrible. I can't believe I managed to make it through the whole thing. I listened to it on cassette so I guess it must have been Brad Pitt's voice that kept me going...because it sure wasn't the writing. It was overly descriptive of background stuff that wasn't essential to the plot and that I didn't care about. The plot was flat and predictable. Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Correction","review":"Cormac McCarthy did not write \\"The Unforgiven.\\" It was written by Alan LeMay in the 20s. LeMay also wrote \\"The Searchers,\\" and the screenplay for the classic Ford western of the same name (and the only flick in which you'll see a decidedly un-heroic John Wayne shoot a man in the back).Reports that McCarthy was influenced by LeMay remain unsubstantiated"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epilogue makes it the best","review":"I didn't read any reviews until after I read the book, so when I say the epilogue was incredible I 'm not parroting anyone. The story proper was the weakest of the three, but read with the epilogue in mind the book is the most compelling, the most honest. If you started the book and put it down at least read the last chaper, OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More philosophical than the previous installments.","review":"Mr. McCarthy's writing remains powerful and his gifts evident. The epilogue adds a mystical slant to the story that is very thought-provoking. The dialogue betweeen Billy and the dreamer alone is worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trilogy","review":"I have read all three \\"trilogy\\" novels. I thought all three stories were worth telling and I have taken something away from all three readings. The Spanish never bothered me although my knowledge is rudimentary. Character, dialog and setting are wahat matters here. Cities of the Plain like the others is not very much about plot...dialog and voice, however, are McCarthy's chief gifts. The epilog of Cities reminded me of Jorge Luis Borges a great deal. I am wondering if professional reviewers ever really read McCarthy's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm flying solo","review":"Well, I suppose I will be the one to stand against the stream on this one. McCarthy was a little disappointing in his third installment of the Border Trilogy. It was well written, but he fails in Cities much the way other writers fail in making their books much too predictable. All the Pretty Horses was excellent because you did not know where you would end. By the end of The Crossing McCarthy had started his characters down the path of destruction, and we knew it.By the way, do not become too enchanted with Cormac's descriptions of life as a southwestern cowpuncher. His verbal paintings of the geography are fantastic, but his understanding of the people are simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cam Clarke can sing!!!!","review":"I found that I wasn't the only who loved Cam Clarke (as a voice actor) since the days of Robotech. I never knew he could sing. I always wondered about that. (Just for the record and so no one makes this mistake again: in response to anharmyenone's statement, Cam Clarke NEVER sang a song on Robotech. Michael Bradley was the singing voice of Lancer/Yellow Dancer.)Just hearing how different his voice is from singing and acting is surprising. His songs incorporate his rich, deep tones and that soothing country flavor. Plus, it gives a surprising twist to his cover songs that you could enjoy. And some songs give \\"gay pride\\" to those who feel the norms of society prevent these kinds of songs from getting airplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Singer","review":"He is perhaps one of the greatest male singers to come along in a long time. His rendition Of \\" Son of a Preacher Man is a must hear. If you like handsome powerful singers then by all means by this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cam does them better then the originals!","review":"I've been a fan of Cam longer then I can remember, so after following his voice acting career for so long it doesn't surprise me that he put out such a good CD. I honestly thought that he sung these, for the most part, better then the originals. Even though it's sung from a gay perspective, and that im not, he doesn't go over board with the gender's. I would defiantly recommend this CD, straight or gay, you defiantly wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD","review":"The direction and editing of the DVD is the worst I can recall. The camera rapidly jumps around left, right, up, down, back into the audience and even has the image rotated sideways now and then. Enough! I want to see the performers, which is hard enough with all the strobe lights in a live performance. Reuben jumping is all that is needed. No other word for it - the DVD is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can only agree ...","review":"With the reviewer from April 6, 2004.This is exactly what this book is. A sort of guide to how the brain works, with some \\"exercises\\" thoughtlessly thrown in when the authors remembered that it's supossed to be a book on \\"Building Mental Muscle.\\"I, too, am surprised at all the 5-star reviews. I wouldn't throw the book away, though; I'd say you can glean some pretty interesting information from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Terrific read, if you want to know how the brain works, and how to be aware of it to your advantage, ie acheiving near-to or photographic memory, and increasing you math, verbal, and spatial reasoning skills, then i reccomend this book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Mental Exercises","review":"This book is entertaining. It contains a mix of puzzles, exercises, research studies and explanations. Also, the information on how the brain functions (how it can become more/less powerful) was exactly what I wanted to know. Other interesting points: how the Hippocampus routes and retrieves data; how stress interferes with memory and how exercise helps the retention of mental function. Probably my favorite parts are those that explain the underlying logic needed to work through and solve the exercises, like in the \\"Familial Dilemma\\" exercises.I give it four stars because some of the information and recommendations have been proven to be incorrect. For example, the book recommends that men take the supplement DHEA (for various benefits) BUT DHEA has been proven in medial studies to do more harm than good."},{"rating":"2","title":"best scissors ever","review":"perfect small pair of scissors.

I love being able to view my spices easily and being able to adjust the holders to the sizes of them. Just be sure to determine if the door will be able to close before applying them. Once they are on, they are on! I had to move items around in my cabinets for the best fit before applying."},{"rating":"2","title":"User","review":"If you have a RV of any type these are a must. Perfect for medicine cabinet and kitchen cabinets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works wonderfully until you have to remove them","review":"I thought these adjustable spice racks were wonderful. I had a very small kitchen and using wall space for my spice rack was great. My spices were very convenient and they looked great. I got lots of compliments. Loved them until now. I have had these in place for almost 3 years and now moving. The tape works too well - Ripped chunks of the wall right off! Unfortunately I put up 2 sets of these so have quite a bit of wall damage to try to repair. I used my steamer to help dissolve the tape, but now there are some bubbles on the wall as well as a bit of removed wall and paint. What a nightmare! I will not buy these again and would not recommend them anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book has all the romance and drama of fiction, and yet a powerful sense of authenticity. Because it is a novel, I felt I was able to get close to that legendary figure of \\"Madame X,\\" and to understand her, in a way that would not have been possible in a conventional biography.I loved her in all her glamor and complexity, and I learned so much about the art world, and about Paris of the 19th. century. The novel gave me everything I would want in a work of fiction, a sense of being inside the characters, and at the same time, I gained an education!I really couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I love the artist. I love the painting. I love Belle Epoque Paris (and actually, Paris in general). I love good historical fiction. I hated this book! I looked forward to reading this more than anything in a long time, and am utterly disappointed. The stars I have given it go to what I believe to be Gioia Diliberto's talent as a researcher. As a writer of fiction, (once again, in my opinion alone) she is sorely lacking. The character of Virginie that Diliberto fashioned is so unbelievably self-absorbed as to be one-dimensional and her tale is told in clunky, graceless prose that I frankly found nearly unreadable. The cover is by far the best thing about this book. If that's what fascinates you about it, go find a book of Sargent's artwork. Whatever you imagine about the figures you see in his paintings will be far, far more rewarding than anything you glean from Diliberto's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"This novel is simply a great story, written in crystal-clear prose. The bottom line is, you'll stay up all night reading it. One of the book's pleasures is the extraordinary research that Diliberto clearly did - about the life of the real Virginie Amelie Gautreau, (who was referred to by her nickname Mimi;) about daily plantation life in Louisianna before the War, the community of souther expatriates who took shelter in Paris afterwards, the techniques that of 19th. century painting. Every detail has authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever idea, poor execution","review":"I have to give the author credit for the idea, but I found the book impossible to finish. The tone is unsophisticated and anachronistic, and the character never comes to life due to the lack of rich detail. Considering how little is known about the real woman, the author could have let her imagination run wild, but this effort is stilted and flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The main character, Virginie Amelie Avegno, is underdeveloped. I lack empathy for this narcisist and hardly care what becomes of her.While I truly enjoy that bring a sliver of history to life, such as the \\"Girl With A Pearl Earing\\" and \\"Vindication\\" (two books I would strongly recommend over this), this book lacks the spark to generate my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD... just missing a few songs","review":"Of the three \\"Bye Bye Birdie\\" CDs, this has to be the best one. It has a lot better sound quality than the Broadway version,and unlike the 1963 CD there are no annoying orchestra bits that have NO CORRELATION with the upcoming song. Most importantly, everyone can sing. As for the three new songs, \\"Let's Settle Down,\\" \\" A Mother Doesn't Matter Anymore,\\" and \\"A Giant Step,\\" I liked the a lot, espcially \\"A Mother Dosn't Matter Anymore.\\" But the biggest thing that irked me about the CD was that it didn't have EVERY song from the movies such as \\"What Did I Ever See In Her\\" which I found quite funny, and that some that the girsl sang in the beginning in the sweet shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I loved Bye Bye Birdie","review":"My favorite kinds of music are those that you can remember and sing word-for-word when you hear the 3 opening notes. Bye Bye Birdie is one of those musicals. The chorus of guys and girls is great, and Jason Alexander's voice in \\"Rosie\\" is amazing. The support vocalists are astounding, and this music isn't some you'll soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Remake","review":"I recently watched the video of Bye Bye Birdie and had to purchase the soundtrack. Jason Alexnder blows me away with his amazing talent. I wish he would record a solo album. Chynna Phillips is very convincing as the teen ready to explore new worlds.

This TV production was like a high school production. Jason Alexander can't sing, can't dance and his hair piece kept falling all over the place. Conrad looked like an old man, and Venassa Williams, though she sings pleasantly, was ok. The girl who played Kim was terrible. Though this TV production followed the original broadway show and had all the songs from the origianl show, plus they added 2 songs which didn't measure up the to rest of the score, the singing is bland and poor in some cases. As for the movie cd. Though not as good as the original broadway cast album because they dropped some of the good songs, it did have a lot of spirit, and who doesn't love Ann Marget. Music wise, talent wise, you can't beat the original cast album and the cd is just grand. I never get tired of listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary","review":"Why is there a soundtrack for this wistful movie and not one for Cinderella (1997)? It is a shame.

Well neither goes in its favor. Half assed low budget animation is accompanied by bad music and voice overs. both light hearted and seriousness is the tone thats deployed...which people nowadays think thats a good idea in anime (in reality its creaters lack of scope and understanding of either). Plot suprisingly is almost work-man like and slightly better than usual for this kind of thing, although the sell is saying \\"more plot,to acompany the sex\\".It generally though never atemtps to find a happy balance, the drama and plot never take off, and the sex never explict enough. This anime isnt completely rapped around fan service or hentai autopilot,it just as a whole its bad, and at 60 minutes character development is silm to none, theres no vision or scope or even taste to recomend this flat liner. as if it were souly designed for the bargain bin"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome peeler","review":"This is a sharp blade and works effortlessly.

You can almost hear his tongue smacking in his cheek as he spills little tidbits about show biz icons while regaling you with stories of his and his peers' latest exploits.What I really enjoyed about this book, other than the obvious, is that the man wasn't afraid to: 1.) Tell on himself, showing us some of his real blunders, and 2.) Tell on others honestly, showing some understanding of where they were coming from, rather than just stepping on their memory.This is a fun, easy ride through the heyday of Broadway and a touch of musical Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and unorganized!!!","review":"This book should have been much better. I feel it gave no justice to the film it was supposed to support. Too many interviews which seemed to focus too much on these individuals histories than with the making of the film in question. Derek Taylor spends very little time discussing anything of interest of the making of the picture at all. At one point he seemed to talk more about his vacation to tunisia than actually reporting what was going on with the filming of Raiders!!! A terrible waste of time and highly unorganized!!!

Eddie Miller was 70 when he made this live recording in 1982, his last (he died in 1991). The ballads (STREET OF DREAMS and LAZY MOOD) don't fare nearly so well as the quicker tunes. LAZY MOOD is a bit of a shame, since it's a song so connected to Miller's career with the Bob Crosby band. But the reedy, warm Miller tone is still there (so close in sound to Bud Freeman's), and he plays well on SUNDAY, I NEVER KNEW, and LINGER AWHILE. Pianist Johnny Varro is excellent throughout as is bassist Ray Leatherwood. Miller played better earlier in his career, but it's a competent CD, worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest way to get the best tea","review":"We love this tea, and everyone else must too because the stores always seem to be out of it.

This cookbook, however, changed my mind as I have found most of the dishes to be delicious successes that are faithful to traditional tastes. This should come as no surprise, of course, since the book was compiled by real Greeks (most of whom are moms and yiayias no doubt) whose families have probably handed down and improved upon those recipes generation after generation.

When I used the phone, the other party could barely hear me. I could hear them reasonably well, but I would sound distant and cut in and out. The quality was not good enough to hold a conversation. Skype doesn't always provide perfect call quality, but I was able to get great sound quality on the same call with my USB headset so I was convinced that it wasn't Skype causing the problem. This was a consistant problem on all calls over a one week trial. I tried increasing the microphone level in the Skype options, but it made no difference.

My only quam with it is that you have to have the card list if you ever want to take it out of your AH deck, because unlike goat of the black woods, this does not have a marker, but it's not that big of a deal. Playing just the pharaoh game is recommended when you first get it, then you should probably just integrate it into your deck, especially if you have Dunwitch, Kingsport, or both. The ability to take the relic cards instead of the magical items it's pretty interesting if you want to risk it, because some of the relics aren't that great, but there are some that are quite excellent.

Even though I've read the predecessor books in this series, it would have been more effective if she had shown Annabelle in all her glory and up to her devious tricks, instead of just telling the reader about them. Yes, this was very effectively done in the previous novels, but I believe each book needs to stand on its own and not assume the reader is familiar with prior work.Also, while I thought that the psychological and relationship development of the protagonists was excellent, I would still have preferred to see a little more of the plot and action at which Layton excels.These are minor complaints; this book is still well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blade...for wood","review":"These blades are very good.

Overall, I appreciated the detail to which this survivalist wrote and am inspired by his illustrations to tour the Virginia countryside and read every historical marker available.Sneden maintains a predominantly factual tone with little mention of personal thoughts. He vividly describes the hardships that his fellow inmates endured but he does not extend mention to the toll that those hardships must have taken on him. Sneden seemed unfeeling, intelligent and quite arrogant, which undoubtedly enabled him to witness first-hand so many crucial historical moments and to ultimately survive.From an historical perspective, Sneden's insights on Union decisions that resulted in battle losses were right on target. He apparently had a strong 'war-sense' making this read informative from a tactical view as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selected praise for Eye of the Storm","review":"\\"What makes Sneden's history remarkable is his attention to detail...

It is astonishing that such valuable experience could have remained hidden for so long.\\" --Michael Larkin, The Boston Globe\\"This is quite simply a wonderful book.... One can virtually hear the soldiers snoring and the mules braying.... Especially moving is [Sneden's] account of the horrible months he spent in Andersonville....

An excellent pianist whose reputation speaks for itself. The cover of the CD has a quote from the Penguin guide praising his \\"characteristic finesse and beauty of phrasing...\\" The RCA Victor Symphony and Wallenstein's conducting are good. They do a fine job creating a stormy atmosphere in the 20th and accompanying their distinguished soloist. Rubinstein captures the joyful spirits of the 23rd well also. These concertos complement each other...the 20th dark and stormy, the 23rd graceful and full of joy. The only thing missing from this fine CD is the date when it was recorded, but the recorded sound is good, so don't worry. By the way, if you have never heard the Rondo in A Minor, it's breathtaking...a masterpiece similar in its tone and style to the 20th Concerto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silicups are a life saver","review":"I actually had purchaced silicone muffin pans and did not like them.

Then at Christmas last year, I was at my daughter's and she and her sister-in-law were making Yorkshire Pudding. She had enough paper muffin cups for one pan of the pudding, but had to use the silicone cups for the second batch. Amazingly, the puddings in the paper cups did not rise, but the ones in the silicone cups were big and beautiful. Well, I was sold and I love them.

Its not as high-speed as say Crank or Transporter movies, but good story, some CSI genre thrown in as well as Stathom at his best when he fights. Its definitly worth seeing. The 2nd main cop he works with is a strange looking English actor, but he is believable and does a fine job. Every movie he does cannot be all explosions and breaking legs, although he does do fighting in this one, give the man break and he can act too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Rogue Cop But Well Acted","review":"Pretty typical rogue cop handles crime his own way in this suspense film of a police serial killer with some revengeful issues he's aiming to satisfy. The film makes no effort to hide the identity of the killer but weaves it's story around a few of the murders and Jason's attempt to identify and find the killer. Pretty straight forward but what makes this film worth the time is the acting for all involved was good+ enough to be entertaining and engaging. To illustrate, visualize Jason's usual disheveled raw urban persona during his interview of a witness. The witness asks, \\"Ain't you gonna take any notes?\\" to which Jason replies, \\"Do I look like I carry a pencil?\\" That sums up the movie but of course you have to see and hear it to appreciate it's import."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star power is not enough","review":"I like mindless violence as much as anybody.

From the creative mix of keyboards, strings and vocals in \\"I See Stars\\" to the stream of consciousness alternative rock sound of \\"Dresden\\", this recording is a wonder.

Her songs can make me laugh (Sick of myself) or cry (Time falling down), they evoke so much emotion. Suprising that such a powerful voice can come from such a petite person. This first album is definitely worth owning- a mixture of softer ballads and upbeat songs with unusual lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, witty, sassy chick music!!!","review":"I don't mean to limit Cindy's music by saying that it is awesome for me as a woman. I love to turn up the volume in my red mustang and sing along! The lyrics are a great mix of melancholy and spirit. \\"Sick of myself\\" is a true gem, and expresses the inner conflict that so many of us face at one time or another...in an almost comic way. You won't hear cliches in Cindy's lyrics. They are fresh and powerful, even though they express themes we all love to ponder. Personally, there is only one drawback to this album for me. I find some of the lyrics a bit too sexual for my taste.Overall, this is a great purchase at a great price, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard but needs a chance.","review":"Scott.

So if anything I am biased toward HP. This was a gift from my wife to replace the HP5455. It seemed great at first, but when I placed a SD card (512 Meg) in the unit it got so hot I had to take it out of my pocket. It was locked up and after a soft reset it came back, but the battery that was 100% 15 minutes before was down to 30%. Next day same thing. The problem is with the SD card reader in the unit. The unit heats up, locks up and only with the SD card in place. It has done this repeatedly. I did a Google search and found this is a problem many people are having not only with HP units but others with Windows Mobile 5. Not just similiar to this, but exactly like the problem I described.

I know that's enough to give all you indie/Punk/Post-Punk elitists all the more reason to buy this album and pretend you like it, so proceed to buy your tasteless little hearts out. But this fact remains: Second Edition is a waste of money. The semi spoken-word song called \\"The Suit\\" is interesting and worth hearing just for Lydon's rare, non-shrieking monotone, but screw the rest of the album. I prefer Lydon's melodious wailing from PiL circa 1983-1992. His solo dance album is tops as well (Psycho's Path, I believe). What else can I say; I'm happy with his lovely pop-infused work. I suppose I'm easy to please (unlike all you embittered pricks pretending to like something like Second Edition that Lydon purposely made to be unlistenable)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time classics","review":"This is one of the definitive records of the late 70's. 20 years later it still holds up, although I wonder how it would be if you didn't catch it the first time around.

Each cut cuts. Lydon's voice is in supreme 'gargled with broken glass' shape. \\"Poptunes\\" and \\"Careering\\" are shattering tunes, and yet things cool down, down to the near hypnotic \\"Radio 4\\".

Levene's guitar mistakes as riffs, along with Lydon's shrieking, make this one of the five most unlistenable for the masses masterpieces ever made (along with Capt. Beefheart's \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" The Stooges \\"Fun House,\\" Velvet Underground's \\"White Light/White Heat\\" and the Godz \\"Third Testament\\").

If you love the Sex Pistols & The Clash first albums but were disappointed with the pomp and preening of the 80's then this is where it could have all gone right. This album has all the energy of punk, all the space of Dub Reggae, the foresight of electronic music and the experimentation of an alchemist. This is really aspirational and inspirational. You need to set some time aside to appreciate the denseness of \\"Poptones\\" or the odd noises of \\"Careering.\\" There is so much going on that it can't hope to cover every base to the satisfaction of everyone. If you buy a PIL album make it this one as it wants to be listened to more than heard. It can give you an aural experience that covers many influences rather than a rock genre trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"POPTONES-More than punk, better than new wave","review":"This is the best band musically, John Lydon ever assembled through all the Sex Pistols/PIL permutations. And, aside from some of the writing on the Pistols \\"Bollocks\\" cd, this is far and away the best writing and singing he recorded. The band lays down a low funk, dread bass drone, repeating lines in a sort of musical hypnotic mantra. \\"Careering\\", with it's CHIC inspired bass line is about the Northern Ireland conflict. No preaching,no corny dogma, just ,\\"careering across the border\\". But it is \\"Poptones\\" that is a masterpiece. You can hear different vocal takes being punched in and out like a sound collage, but it's not a punky flip-off to studio etiquette, rather than a search for the version that matches the song's lyrical intent. You'll need a good stereo to hear all the thought and musicality (yes) that's on this transcendent cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is smart & funny!","review":"This film is a modern-day spin on \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", and it is extremely well-written & well-done.

I was lucky enough to catch this fantastic movie while it was in limited release in Los Angeles, and went back to see it 3 times because I enjoyed it so much. I'm excited about this DVD release of \\"New Suit\\", because I want to hear the commentary track with the writer, who seems particularly astute at knowing what really happens behind-the-scenes in Hollywood.

In this CD Bud Powell plays some terrific piano. You will find him swinging and improvising at length. This version of Bouncing of Bud turns me on everytime I listen to it. Bud's playing, indeed, is very emotional. This is music plenty of life, as only big masters like Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker or Bud himself, could create.This album ranks there with the most brilliant piano performances in jazz, and I would prefer it to Bill Evans' Village Vanguard concerts.Besides the music, the sound quality of the recording is very very good.If you are a jazz piano aficionado, it will make your life more pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad Read","review":"Anthony Swofford really gives the reader an inside look into his head. He's an angry, confused guy with a big dose of self-destruction and loathing. Good for the reader he's also thoughtful and deligent about putting those feelings onto paper. And as a bonus, he's actually a good writer. But if you're looking for an anction-packed book full of combat and running and gunning, read Blackhawk Down. Only the last 20 to 30 pages are about the actual war. The rest of the time it's about the nerve shattering waiting and buildup that drive young men, trained to kill better than anybody else, to disentigrate, inside and out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not anything","review":"I wanted to like this book badly, because I am married to a \\"Jarhead\\". Unfortunately, I simply did not enjoy the style of writing. He writes with an almost Hunter Thompson quality, just not as good or engaging.I was not offended by any of it, I know the Marine Corps, and his descriptions of his buddies rings true of most Marines I know, with some exceptions.The main problem with this book was that I was simply bored throughout. I should say however, that a Marine I find to be relatively intelligent said, \\"This is the best book ever.\\" That being said, if you're in or connected to the USMC, you'll probably enjoy it, at least marginally. If you're not, in my opinion, it can be skipped. Read Evan Wright's _Generation Kill_ instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"What's labeled \\"A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War...\\" is actually a wierd guy's dark ramblings about life as a marine.

Reading a first person narrative by someone not likable is a difficult task. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Thank God our military does not consist solely of individuals like the author. An extended profane navel gazing exercise, this book has nothing useful or interesting to say about the Marines or the first Gulf War.

Based upon the book I bet the Corps reciprocated the sentiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some urban legends do change!","review":"I was a Sergeant in the Corps attached to Marine Aviation Logisitics Squadron 16 (MALS-16) during Desert Shield/Storm when I heard story of the personal sex tape from the wife of a Marine.

When he was watching the movie along with other Marines, the tape switch to a man and a woman having sex. The woman had a mask on which she then took off to reveal being the Marine's wife. She stated that this is what he gets for cheating on her many times. The story goes further, supposedly after he watch the tape, he shot himself in the head with his M-16 rifle when he went back to his tent. Now when I was told this story, supposedly it happen within that same day. But the part of him shooting himself the same day I heard it 6 months later. Hey, Swofford, when did the story reach you? You, sir, are a SH*T BIRD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Swofford is a DIRTBAG!!!!","review":"Tony Swofford spends most of the book discussing his emotional problems growing up as an Air Force brat and then details the chicanery he pulled in an attempt to get kicked out of the Marines. While he's \\"pouring out his heart,\\" he continually jumps back and forth to his Gulf deployment (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm). Very poorly written.Overall I found this book to be 257 pages of pure and unadulterated CRAP about a self-centered jerk. It is not worthy enough to be compared with other USMC books such as, \\"A Rumor of War,\\" \\"With the Old Breed,\\" \\"One Tough Marine,\\" or \\"Marine!\\" just as Mr. Swofford isn't worthy enough to call himself a Marine.This is the first book for which I ADAMANTLY AND VOCIFEROUSLY DEMAND A REFUND.

I also know something about today's Marine Corps and have yet to meet a Marine with this guy's attitude toward the Corps, his country or life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and juvenile","review":"I bought this book and was hooked in the first page. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. You never get to the fighting, since he didn't do any. He trained to be a killer and never took a shot; just wept over dead Iraqis. This guy probably took a lot of heat from real Marines, since they don't tolerate whiners who think the're better than their rank. And he didn't measure up to his. (Oh, my -- are you and your broken, drunken buddies going to look me up and beat on me for \\"a day or an hour or a lifetime.\\") This guy is a disappointment to the Iowa Writers program as well as to the Marine Corps."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is therapy for Swofford","review":"Swofford gives his account of his experience in the Marines and the Gulf War. He reduces his exeriences to the rawest of emotions and his descriptions are never sugarcoated. It was obvious (even by Swofford's own account) that he was not only dealing with the hardships of life in the Marine Corps and war, but he was also fighting internal battles from his childhhod - mainly issues with his father. Some Marines can handle the cards the Marines and war deal him. Others, like Swofford, hold on to all of the negative aspects and allow them to fester. The result? Swofford sticks an M16 in his mouth when the going gets tough, pisses his pants when he must actually perform on the battle field, and then writes a book about it. This book was mildly entertaining, but being a former Marine made it clear that most of what Swofford cried and whined about, the majority of Marines would laugh about in retrospect."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this book is true then why isn't the author in prison?","review":"Most of what the author describes in this book should have gotten him courtmartialed and thrown in a military prison.

Don't waste your time.","review":"Having wasted my time reading Jarhead, I feel compelled to post a review to hopefully save others from a similar fate. Although he had the opposite intention, Swofford succeeded in convincing me that \\"other people's oil\\" as he put it, was indeed worth more than his useless, degenerate life if even half the things he wrote about himself are true. His pretentious, pseudo-poetic writing style almost made me throw up. It must have been easy for him to write, though, since half of the words used in the book consist of the \\"f-word\\" and derivatives thereof.

So-So","review":"Luckily, due to the above reviews, I picked this book up at the library rather than purchase it. It began well with the attitude of this being the \\"real\\" story of a marine rather than the usual gung-ho, go-get'em book. However...after only reading one-half of the book, I find it terribly \\"bitchy,\\" with lots of day-to-day standard \\"griping.\\" Maybe the last half will improve but I think I personally will set it aside and read something else right now instead.

Having Served in the Corps from 86-92 as a \\"Tanker\\", I really think he showed what the bottom of the barrel looked like. I served in Saudi and yes there was some factual information within this book although I think the hooch and depression Swofford had greatly [messed] up his perspective of the Corps in general. The best part of this book is his contempt for the pogues, isn't it ironic that he's become the king of them?The timing of this book with it's left coast slant is questionable. Don't waste your time or money on this book unless you're a psychology student wanting to have a look into a troubled youth's mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all a good book","review":"Swofford is a braggart, a probable liar, and as such is an example of all that is wrong with American military culture.His platoon seems to be populated by overgrown, scatological fifth graders, hopped up on whatever hootch they can ingest and hyperdeluded by an aggregate of Hollywood war movies, from which they get their twisted self-images.If this is the message Swofford is attempting to send, then he's done an adequate job. Unfortunately, he is a terrible prose stylist who prefers to tell rather than show, and whose strange compulsion to list things is to say the least annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"really, really good","review":"Swofford's account of the war is sometimes funny and sometimes sad but always gripping and never dry. The account is fascinating, but what puts this book on top is Swofford's eloquence and way with words.Jarhead is made even more relevant given the situation in the world today. This is a beautifully crafted book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Former Marine - 0351","review":"I served in the Marines from 93 to 99 and read this book just last night.

Sounds like pure BS. What do the other Marines from his unit have to say about the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails on multiple levels","review":"This is not a particularly good literary work, nor is it of much historical value. It is also not a particularly interesting personal memoir.Swofford comes off more than anything as having been an immature jerk who wallowed in self-pity while in the Marines. And one has to wonder how accurate are his recollections from Gulf War I and earlier, considering the number years that elapsed between the events described and his committing his thoughts to paper. Many of his recollections smack of embellishment for literary effect.Swofford also has the annoying tendency to equate his perspective with that of all Marines who served throughout history. While there have no doubt been similar Marines, it does a disservice to the Corps to imply that all have been like Swofford - drunken, undisciplined malcontents who regretted their service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Chronicle, More of a Monotonic Litany","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, based on the reviews on the back cover. Unfortunately, I didn't check what other readers had to say, and this should be a must for this book. After reading the first chapter, I realized that this was going to be a long read, due mostly to his whinning style that distracts and bores the reader: hardly the warrior spirit. If you want to be his shrink, then this book is for you. Otherwise, skip it. I gave it two stars because some parts were interesting, but overall, this is not a good book. I find disturbing his general irreverent attitude towards the Corps.Notice two things: (1) none of the critics on the back cover had military background that I know of, and (2) he refers to his fellow brothers in arms as \\"marines\\" (not as \\"Marines\\"). That's a sample of what's inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten to the Corps","review":"According to Bing West, a former Marine combat infantryman and assistant secretary of defense, far from telling the story of The Universal Soldier -- the grunt's unadorned truth, as reviewers have intimated -- \\"Jarhead\\" is the over-written memoir of someone who did not experience any serious combat (Swofford experienced no firefights and only two shellings in Desert Storm).During his short stay in the Corps, Swofford, according to his own story, either told tall tales or committed criminal acts under oblivious leaders whom he does not name. Either way, this is not how combat soldiers behave. \\"Jarhead\\" is to nonfiction what \\"Platoon\\" was to the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"more \\"and other battles\\" than combat","review":"This book has polarized more readers than it should. As an active-duty officer, I can tell you that the military experience varies across services, ranks, duy stations, and individuals. Judging from the book, Swofford was one of the bottom 10% guys that drags down the military. Herein lies the only real value of the work--it proves a decent case study of a leadership challenge. Many junior enlisted service members enter the military with the same emotional baggage that Swofford did. Most cope well, but some don't. Jarhead is subtitled \\"and other battles\\" for a reason: the Gulf War \\"combat\\" plays a minor role in the text. Is Swofford representative of the vast majority of service members? No. Does he take liberties with the truth? Probably. Would I take his writing seminar? Hell no. This book will be quickly forgotten, but it's worth borrowing for a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three words: Bitter Lance Corporal","review":"Swofford managed a rare feat: writing a widely-read memoir of war without ever actually seeing combat. If you want to read the bitter and often fabricated ramblings of a young man who believes the Corps and the world owe him something, buy this book. If you want to read *good* fiction regarding the Marine Corps, try W.E.B. Griffin or (better yet) Owen West and his tale of the Marines in Somalia (Sharkman Six)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolutely Terrible Book !","review":"Swofford has himself confused with a narrative writer (someone who organizes and communicates a coherent body of experiential information). According to the duskjacket he has taught at several colleges and had his works appear in major literary publications but one would imagine this book to be the stream of consciousness ravings of a junior high school male. If this book is to believed, the only thing established as fact is that Swofford is the guy you pray gets assigned as far away from yourself as possible. Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody needs a whaambulance.","review":"I'm glad I picked up the audio version of this for a couple of dollars in the bargain bin, I still feel cheated though. This is NOT the Corps I knew at the time he tells of.Swofford whines like there's no tomorrow, he takes some truths and then writes complete BS around the truths. About 98% of this story is either completely untrue, urban legend or his skewed view of things. This guy's got a serious chip on his shoulder and thinks the world owes him everything, utterly self-centered without a semblence of honor in his being.Read this book if you hate the military, it's all the untruths you want to hear. If you want a real account of war and the Marine Corps, warts and all I'd recommend Generation Kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"A friend loaned me the unabridged book on tape. I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. It seemed to me like Swofford started whining right from the start. He told us numerous times that joining the Marines was the worst mistake he'd ever made. I agree, and think the Marines would agree too. He certainly didn't seem to bring any positive energy to the table. We were treated to lots of \\"other battles\\" and little Gulf War, but always, whining. In short, I would simply not recommend this book to anyone, though I'm sure there are others out there like Swofford who might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to a real Marine","review":"I think this is the kind of young man that I'd like to meet, and set straight. I read the book and couldn't get past 15 pages without throwing it down in disgust. I only kept trying to pick it up hoping for some revelation....there isn't any. The author is no Marine just a pathetic excuse who got suckered in. This is not factual, it is not even a good sea story, it is a sad account of the inner voice from a confused liar.

It should be titled Jughead.","review":"Oh thank God Mr. Swofford is out of the Marine Corps. I am grateful for all the lives that have been saved since he is no longer in the Corp to steal from the very Marines that would give their own lives to save his. What type man would gleefully and proudly boast about selling out his comrades for profit? The book's lack of direction is glaring but I would imagine that would just be a reflection of Mr. Swoffords lack of character. It is no wonder he is such a hit in France.Fortunately, I borrowed the book from my daughter and didn't waste a cent on the tripe Mr Swofford is spewing. My recommendation would be to stay as far away from the book as humanly possible.Shame on Anthony Swofford for attempting to profit from his proud betrayal of the sworn oath he took when he became a United States Marine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM EMBARASSED TO HAVE READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Cry baby Swofford depicts the US Marines as a dirty, filthy bunch of guys who are born to kill and cuss and drink.

After Sept. 11, we took our kids to a baseball game at a local stadium and our son noticed the guy next to us with a 'towel' on his head. He got very scared and wanted to go home. He thought the guy was there to 'blow the place up'. This instance alone is why I support the Marines, and the fact that I haven't seen my husband in 9 months.

Although some of the events and feelings portrayed are candid and dead on, the book as a whole is still lacking, and reads like something you'd hear at group counseling.The author seems to want to make the reader feel some sort of empathy with him, and his particular situation, as he sees it. I am sure this book will create all sort of empathy, hand wringing, and literay buzz among those who have a particular view of war, the military, or current national policy. But for those, like me, who have been there, seen that, and have the t-shirt it all just sounds like whining.Either anti-war or pro-war, I was hoping for something a little more solid.Sorry, I can't recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I read a lot of books, especially History and in particular, books on War. I was so disappointed from the very beginning and kept thinking it would improve. Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse. Why did this guy enlist?

I just read \\"Generation Kill\\" and would highly recommend it as a great \\"real\\" view of Marines in battle.

We all set off down the road of life, some stop along the way in the military where we are forever changed. This is a difficult stop if you are a thinking man, as the military does not like you to question what is going on at all. Swofford thinks; a talent lost in much of America.Swofford is a young writer with great promise. I got to know him from his book. I liked him and the book and hope this is not his high point, I hope he goes on to write more with the same gutsy style and honesty.

This was my favorite book of 2003"},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest account","review":"I have to admit that many of the anecdotes relayed in Anthony Swofford's JAR HEAD made me uncomfortable. I have very few ties to the military--no family there, only a couple friends, no one involved in combat--so for me, this book was the first personal window I had into the world of Desert Shield/Storm. I appreciated Swofford's honesty, and feel that I learned a lot from the book. Though I still find it difficult to understand the mentality of fighting for the sake of fighting, even when disagreeing with the motives behind a war, Swofford has drawn a world in which I can catch a glimpse of the pressures and conditions in the military--as well as the lasting effect military service can have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic!

This book is all about making money with sensationalism, exageration, and down right lies. The most heart breaking thing about the poor author, is that he leaves the military without the one true thing that makes that journey worthwhile; pride and honor of having gone the extra mile that civilians will never know about. He could have writtent the book without the lies, and without thumping his chest over a war that many consider a minor skirmish in the history of the US military.

The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised this was a 'best seller.'","review":"While I have not served in the military I have the utmost respect and gratitude for those who have, especially those in Iraq and Afghanistan. I respect Swofford's service of our country, but I found myself having pity for him as a human being both before and after his Gulf War experience.I thought this book was fair entertainment and semi-interesting at times, but I certainly wouldn't consider it great war literature along the lines of Hemingway or Dos Passos. I'm sure that those currently in Iraq or Afghanistan will have stories that will blow Swofford's away. Had it not been for our invasion of Iraq in 2003 I doubt that this book would even have been published.I would only recommend this book as casual entertainment. If you want a great account of a real event I would suggest reading (not seeing - book better than the movie) Blackhawk Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply OK","review":"This book is simply OK.

Also familir are some of the feelings, and he does a good job at articulating them. While my tour in the USMC (and life in general, apparently) was not nearly as depressingly hellish as his was, it struck a bone or two. I caught myself feeling rather torn while reading this book - on one hand a little angry at him for painting such a broadly negative picture, on the other, proud of him for having the stones to air it out.Over all, good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent example of a Marine's experience","review":"Having also served during that period in 1/8 STA, I can personally tell you that this book moved me from page one. Reading this book not only brings back memories of my unit but also reminds me of my own personal experiences. If Swoff hadn't written the book from his perspective, I would have thought it to be my own. From cover to cover, this book portrays all the experiences a young Marine goes through in a Victor unit. From the most fleeting thought to the greatest aspirations, Anthony Swofford has captured something intangible by most writers in this genre.

Not a single Marine who's read this book likes it the very least, not because this book makes us \\"look bad\\", but because he is not telling the truth. He's simply telling a story that he knows some civilians want to hear. It's almost funny when he tried so hard yet unsuccefully to establish a relationship between the Gulf War and oil companies. He knows some people just are dying to read that part. If you want to learn about the Marine Corps, this book is definitely NOT what you want. Most of it is about his own reproductive organs or constant swearing.

Swofford shows you who he is and tells an amazing story using the war in Iraq during the first Gulf War as the linear part of the story, cutting in to tell the story of his life. Why he joined, his family, his girlfriends, and about the Marines (the real Marines) and the difference between trained to kill and warrior.

The rest of the book is written in the style of an angst-filled girl in her early teens. I frequently found myself rolling my eyes at the way the author would describe a particular situation.The book is also horribly overwritten. Chapters are devoted to relationships that have no bearing on the overall story. The book has a schizophrenic feel with chapters jumping between the past, present, and future. This shouldn't be surprising as the author seems to suffer from a dozen psychological problems.The only reason I read the book to the end was so that I could write a review here and warn others that the reviews you heard on CSPAN and NPR were horribly wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Pretense","review":"This book is sold under the pretense of being the memoirs of a jarhead.

Furthermore, he had problems with his father, his mother, his sister, his brother and with God. Should it be a shocker that he problems with the Marine Corps?

But anyone of of his mates or those in other wars could have written the same stuff. I came to the conclusion that this was a therapy session for the writer, a catharsis of sorts, that gave him meaning to decisions that he made in his life that go him into the Marines..maybe stating wiht his father?

For the last year and a half I have interviewed my uncle and many of the Marines who served with him on the front lines of these brutal battles and not one of them has anything to say that remotely resembles Swofford's assertions.Most of these battles lost more men in five minutes than was lost in both Gulf Wars combined.Yet I have not heard the cynicism or bitterness from these heroes which seems to consume Swofford. The book entirely misses the essence of what I have come learn is the essence of a Marine. Swoffard certainly has no esprit.

A couple of the reviewers compared this book to a Rumor of War or Friendly Fire. Not in your wildest dreams. I kept waiting for the book to develop into something more than a puerile confessional until I realized that it wasn't going to happen.

I was hoping to read about a grunts combat experience. What was provided was scant and really only limited to GW1. Unless Swofford's \\"other battles\\" were the one's in his head you could say that the title is a little misleading.

Instead the book turned out to be a novel of the soldier's confusing thoughts spilled on paper. Not only was it overly perverse, there was no plot and no flow to the story. I'm sure the perverseness is what some people think as \\"hard core truth\\", in my opinion, it was just a waste of ink. Anthony Swofford's stories did not tell me anything of importance other than what messed up thoughts and going ons were happening to him and his fellow soldiers. I was completely disappointed.

This is trash!","review":"All the hype makes one believe that this is a unique first-person literary account of what it's really like to be a soldier in the Gulf War. In reality it is a trumped-up profane and highly exaggerated load of trash. Anthony Swofford is in dire need of help and it isn't because he served in that war. Making him some sort of after-the-fact hero for writing this tripe will only serve to make him even more sick. I pray that he is an aberration and that most of our soldiers are not godless, profane, psychotics that he portrays himself to be. If most of our soldiers are like him we are in serious trouble as a country. Unfortunately, I believe that the vulgarity and psychotic ramblings of this profane man are the very reasons the 'literary world' has embraced his garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I gave this one star only because I couldn't give it zero.

I hope the book was good, cuz the movie was atrocious. I never go to a movie wishing for it to end as much as I wanted this one to. Are marines really this bad. I cant beleive that the Staff Sergeant played by the overacting Jamie Fox can be responsible for an innoculation range in which a soldier gets a bullet thru his skull, and subsequently dies, can then go on with his career let alone serve on operations. What kind of trust would his soldiers have in him? Is this the way marines act in real life? Apparently this is a true story, god help anyone serving along side these poor excuses for soldiers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Although the anguish of combat and graphic scenes of death and devastation that the author encountered must have been overwhelming (and I fortunately have never had to deal with such awful circumstances), I found myself wondering what the book was telling me. Was the author disturbed by his wartime experience, or before it by his own life experience?He makes the case that Marines, or \\"Jarheads\\" must all think and act like hard-living drunken killing machines, but many of the Marines I know and have known were simply not cut from that cloth.I certainly hope for the sake of our military that there are finer examples of proud Americans serving their country (in peace or war), that are more worthy of our respect than the soldiers the author describes."},{"rating":"1","title":"View from the bottom 5%.....","review":"In the Corps, the saying goes, \\"5% of your Marines are bad, and they will eat up 90% of your time.\\" As a Marine Leader of 12 years, I can tell you that the first thing one does is develop the ability to spot that five percent in about ten seconds. Reading Swofford's book, he jumped out immediately as one of those less than stellar Marines. The same has been noted by other Marines who have written reviews here. While his writing is clear and colorful, his \\"problem-child\\" preoccupations prevent the book from being considered with the classic war memoirs, such as The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer or Fields of Fire by James Webb. If you have not read much in the way of military memoir, there are many other options. For those who want something more recent than the two excellent books I just mentioned, young Nathaniel Fick's One Bullet Away is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary look at the military and war in general.","review":"This was a harsh look at the first gulf war.

The chapters at the end, and his descriptions of the end of the conflict especially, whoa. Powerful stuff. Very stylish, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dialogue","review":"I just recently bought the book and read it in a few days. I do not think it is particularly strong on character development nor do I think the plot of the book is going to surprise anyone; it is, afterall, a chronicle of an already very well chronicled war. BUT, the dialogue is excellent, it had me chuckling and laughing several times, and the writing style is strong and engaging. I would compare it to Pulp Fiction, Full Metal Jacket and Training Day where the dialogue of the characters, along with a standout performance here and there, is the backbone of the movie. I read an excerpt of this book in the CalAggie alumni magazine (I tried to join the Marines in the summer of 1990 and went to the Oakland MEPS only to be declined on a medical technicality. A few days later I was a freshman at UCD)and decided to buy it because it sounded interesting and because Mr. Swofford had spent some time in this area.

I remember seeing this movie when it came out a few years ago and not thinking much of it, then decided to read the book over the holidays. My first warning sign was the repeated use of 'marine' and not Marine, as every Marine I have ever served with knows that amongst Marines at least you always treat it as a proper noun. Grammar lesson aside, I am just surprised at the overall tone of the book; Marines I served with and come in contact with were always motivated and dedicated to the accomplishment of the mission and treat all fellow Marines with dignity and respect. Some of the stuff mentioned in the book is spot on, but I doubt I will finish reading it because this is just not the same Marine Corps I fondly remember. Of course I don't think I was in the same Marine Corps as John Murtha either.Vincent PagnoniGunnery SergeantUSMC (Retired)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom 10% speaks","review":"This was a difficult book to read because lacks mature analysis. In the military, platoon and company leaders complain that 90% of their time is taken by the bottom 10% of the Marines, which are those who think being a punk and being tough is the same thing. Swofford appear to be one of the 10%. Swofford lays the \\"troubled youth\\" on thick. An adolescent thinker, Swofford spends more time talking about drinking, acting suicidal/homicidal and other complaints than on thoughtful analysis of the topics he raises. A Marine reading the book will see this fast. There are a host of better books, so do not be lured in by a desire to learn about the Gulf war.

It has it moments, mostly later in the book, when the author begins so show a bit more humanity. I must have run with a different group of Marines or maybe it's a generational thing, but none were as raunchy or vulgar as those Swofford describes. Sure, we got drunk plenty of times and our language sometimes was 'not for publication' (in those days, anyway), but nothing so much as his buddies in this book. For someone who only spent a few weeks in actual combat, Swofford comes across as very bitter and angry. I admit I might have felt that way if I were in the current mess involving an unjustified invasion of Iraq, but Desert Storm was reasonably justified. I was disappointed by Jarhead but would like to know what other Marines think about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story, by a poor Marine","review":"After the first couple of pages I was ready to throw the book away. If you are looking for a story that regales the Marines this is not it. I was going to send it to a friend of mine who is a true Marine serving with a Scout Sniper Platoon; he had already read the book along with several other Marines in his unit, every one of them disliked it. It is unfortunate that the author did not have a more positive experience, maybe its because he hasn't had a positive experience with life yet. You get out of the Corps what you put into it. Obviously he didn't put much into it, it shows in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"FUBAR","review":"Swofford paints himself as everymarine.

The best thing about this book is that you can read it in about 45 minutes. Absolutely depth-less, the author seems to have an attention span of a gnat, which coincidentally matches his intellectual level. Do not waste your time with this nonsense--I think the only reason this was published is that the publishing world was looking for a negative spin on the Middle East \\"wars\\" the same way they did with Vietnam (no, I refuse to use the \\"L\\" word to describe the media) and this clown delivered.

I have been in the Marine Corps far longer than the author and served in the infantry, at the same times and places as the author, particularly with 7th Marines during Desert Storm.The book is a disjointed series of anecdotes relating the author's time spent in the Marine Corps and after. The stories seem selected with shock value in mind. The book has no message that I can find, and is needlessly overflowing with profanity.Someone loaned me a copy of the book at work and after slogging through the first chapters, I checked the endorsements on the dust jacket - not one Marine endorsed this book.

No, I do NOT think Catcher in the Rye is a good book!Usually the movie is not as good as the book but in this case I'm willing to bet the opposite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for looking into personalities","review":"This book was wonderful. I can't give it 5 stars for two reasons: 1, it's not a must read and 2, I wasn't in the military so I can't say what is and is not accurate. However, I think all men between 18-30 should read it to get an idea of how your personality may change as you grow older. I'm 30 now and I can picture how I would've been taken with all of the military sales pitches if I were in the Marines.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get into the mind of a maturing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overdone but largely authentic","review":"I served in Desert Storm, in the USMC infantry similar to Swofford. This is the first book on the subject that I could stand to read. Parts of it I hate because Swofford stole from fellow Marines (that makes him a scumbag more than a sniper) and he exagerrates (which means lies) a bit on the tales of drunken debauchery.But . . . when he tones down a notch and writes about actual operations - his accounts ring very true and compelling. Further, I found a lot of his psychological insights and reflections on becoming a Marine very compelling. I felt like this book helped me verbalize my own very complex feelings about the war, our country, and manhood in our age. Swofford does capture the essence of serving in the Marine Corps in those years.I recommend this book for Gulf War veterans and as a psychological history of this period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read Jarhead based on the recommendations of a writing instructor, and was greatly disappointed. I like good memoirs, but Swofford's book is an exercise in self-absorption with no intellectual leap beyond immediate experience, and by misrepresenting the full gamut of military life, it panders to kneejerk antimilitarism.Yes, full disclosure, I'm a veteran, but not from the Marine Corps. The armed forces are no less dysfunctional than any other human institution, but the reality of military life is far more interesting and complicated than Swofford portrays it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put this Mother Down","review":"I am not a student of military history, nor have I been particularly interested in the US or any other armed forces. But I do appreciate good writing and storytelling, and let me tell you without a doubt Mr. Swofford will kick you in the butt with his lively narrative and insight. Now get this...Swofford is a guy who reads Celine in his spare time and otherwise is trained as a sniper. Wow! This book is too much, and I have read it now several times, with Fox News in the background. Good solid writing, funny and informative. Buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should have minus (-) stars!","review":"Despite all the good reviews this is a poorly written book. I think the most effective review of this book is written by one of the members of his STA platoon, who gave it 1 star and a stinging review. It may reflect the \\"modern day\\" Marine Corps but, if that's true, then God help us. I notice there was no mention of the Lt. who normally commands the platoon and only scant comments about the platoon sgt. This STA platoon sounds like a mob, not a Marine unit. Don't buy this book, don't read it and don't believe it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Misses the Target like a Scud","review":"Don't let the movie dissuade you from reading this book.There is not one \\"hoorah\\" in the book, like that one that's been re-run all over our television screens - not to mention any character that remotely resembles Jamie Foxx' character. There are several more gross adaptations from the written version of the story. I perceive the film as just another Hollywood insult to the American intellect. I suggest that you read the book if you like the previews.Swofford said it best in an interview: \\"The movie only captures the psychological perspective and some entertainment from the book.\\" In other words, the book has more to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"jarhead","review":"As opposed to all the multi-star reviews of recommendation from the book reviews, I fully agree with one posted reader review - This title (Jarhead) was ...! The book's cover referenced the Marines and their experiences during the conflict, however, the vast majority of the internal prose were about barroom and bedroom achievements - none of them particularly exciting and certainly not noteworthy. When purchasing this book, I was anticipating learning something noteworth, which certainly wasn't the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Being highly rated by the NY Times should have made me suspicious, but I fell for the war theme and expected all you would of a superior chronicle of man's nobility in and the futility of war. Instead all I read was an expletive laced, poorly written version of one loosers attempt to come to grips with himself among real men.This was about as pathetic a diatribe against what little battle this sod saw.If I wasn't so disgusted with the quality and quantity of this screed I would have paid money to return it to the publisher.Instead I'll content myself with tossing it in the garbage and hoping my review will trash anyones desire to read this. I wish there were a negative star I could assign this book.Simply one of the worst things I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"I don't know what Marine Corps this guy was in, but it wasn't the same one I belonged to. I was a grunt, and I knew some STA guys in our battalion. I have no idea where the tales in this book came from.Did our Marines have some problems? Sure they did! They were human! We drank too much, talked much trash, (...), just like he said. Some of us had seniors appointed over us in accordance with the \\"Peter Principle.\\"The things he tells about in this book, though, are outlandish! The attitudes and activities he attributes to the men of the 7th Marines are disgraceful. I have no idea how he managed to get as far as he did, but he is a perfect example of the 1% that always slip through.I read this book against my better judgement. All it did was p*ss me off. This is decidedly not an accurate portrayal of this nation's Marine Corps."},{"rating":"1","title":"question of character","review":"I'm a former Marine (13 years) and Desert Storm veteran and this book absolutely sickens me. My military experience is something near and dear to my heart because of the many friendships I made. I'll never experience that kind of camraderie again. So, it really disgusts me to read such nonsense. In my opinion Mr. Swofford is corrupt of any morals and character. He certainly doesn't represent the Marine Corps I knew or the men and women I served with. God help you for selling your soul to make a buck. The book is pure garbage and lacks any sense of truthfulness. I just can't grasp the reason why he would do such nonsense.\\"Tucked away in the folds of my life are discipline and determination, a refusal to quit when the going gets rough, a love for our country's freedom, a respect for authority.

A couple chapters was enough for me. I just read all the reviews on this book. There were a couple from former Marines that said they never saw any of this behavior while they served in the corps. This author tells his story, not the story of all our Marines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Unimpressive","review":"Could we have any more run-on sentences, poor grammar, or poor sentence construction? I find it inconceivable that any decent publisher would pay this guy money for what he puts on paper. I was given this book from a publisher to proof the galleys before going to print and I wanted to rewrite the whole thing! By page 20 I wanted to throw it out and by page 60 I wanted to... It's also a great game to count how many times this guy can use [profanity] per page. If you don't mind reading the [sad] self-pity party of an immature whiner, then you might like it. Otherwise, don't bother. Good thing I was paid to read it; I wouldn't have spent the money to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first hand account","review":"Although some would say this book is a bad \\"coming of age\\" story, I chose to be open and soak it in. The author describes his life in the Marines, the close freindships that develop, and the many disappointments. What it does best is express the \\"dark side\\" of being an American marine. When the author is finally deployed to Iraq, it may not be what you expect. Readers looking for combat stories will find there are few. The one engagement has the author in position to snipe Iraqi targets, but he is not given permission. Instead the marines want \\"action\\", they want to move in and attack rather than snipe from afar (lives are lost because of this) A must read for anyone thinking of joining up. In my opinion Jarhead should have been titled, \\"Jarhead: Inside the mind of a Marine in the Gulf War\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst war book ever","review":"Completely dissappointed. This is one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read. SWOF writes like a suicidal depressed teenager who has seen to many introspective black teen angst movies. His 'war stories' are laughable - he never fired a shot. Ok he saw a tank and some planes and was in the vicinity of real fighting. Ok he saw dead Iraqis after the fact. He plays it up like Iwo Jima. He knows the 'horrors' of war now. Please. Dont buy it. Read 'About Face\\" by Hackworth, or \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" by Guy Sajer or....any other book for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jarhead","review":"I read this book on a recommendation of \\"Christine\\", the cheating girlfriend that Tony refers to in this book. I have also met the post war Tony on a few occasions as I was \\"Christine's\\" roomate for several years. I was disappointed that such a talented writer would sell out on his first book. He hated the Marines which is evident in the book and never mentioned it after he was out of the corp. But it was good timing, with another war starting, to write this one. Just the easy road to a quick half a million $$. The more lies I read in the book the angrier I became. It was entertaining to read how a man justifies his numerous cheating escaped by saying his girlfriend was doing it too. Which she wasn't, at least not with who he thought. But I guess, this again was a good way to sell books, with sex. I did learn a lot about war and the Military from the book. I just can't determine which is fact and which is fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time. Should be called Blowhard instead of Jarhead.","review":"Of all of the self-indulgent drivel I have ever read, and there is much to choose from in the warrior memoir genre, this book has all of the excitement of picking lint out of your own belly button. Anyone who has ever raised his/her right hand and sworn \\"to support and defend the constitution etc.\\" knows full well that becoming a warrior is a license to be killed, not a license to kill. When Uncle Sam owns you, he will do with you what he will. It's not a secret, and millions of sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines will gladly tell you the same; all for a lot less than the purchase price and the time this book will cost you.Most of this is typical marine mythology, of hard drink and prostitutes, of the depravity of the PI, of hardd*** Marines. Mr. Swofford, get over yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"JarHead Is The Story Of A Marine Who Sold Out","review":"I wrote an earlier review, but it got pulled. Hmmm, I wonder why? Anyway, I'll sum up what I said before. Other Marines and armed forces reviewers pretty much backed up what I wrote. Many of the tales in this book are urban legends. Although one reviewer said the tales of whoring are 100% true, I wonder if some of his encounters were. I found it odd that one of the girls he shacked up with happened to be a virgin, and that there was so much drama over it. His actions as a scout sniper, as others have said, are grossly misrepresentative of the real deal. As I've said before, Swofford is a liar; you don't have to be in the Marines to see that. He's a real embarassment to anyone he's ever worked for, even McDonald's. He'd sell out anything to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Account Doesn't Tell Entire Story...","review":"Admittedly, Swofford's book is well-written, but as a former marine and Desert Storm veteran I found myself wondering if he was talking about the same war. I have like stories of hazing, drinking, etc., but these are hardly the highlights of my career in the marines. It does not surprise me that Swofford did not attain a higher rank as his line of thinking is quite low-level. The average marine understands the need for strict dicipline, does not mistake hard training for abuse, and most assuredly DOES NOT stick the muzzle of his weapon in his mouth and contemplate suicide.Swofford's free-thinking is commendable, but just because you agree with the military's objectives doesn't mean you are \\"drinking the Kool-Aid\\" and lack independent thought.My honest assessment of the author is that he is a disgruntled 10 percenter who found catharsis through talented writing. I am embarassed by his depiction of both the Gulf War and the Marine Corps in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Tedious","review":"As an ex-Navy guy, whose son is a Marine aviator, I got this book expecting a real interesting look at the inner workings of a ground pounding Marine in the organization. I'm a third of the way through the book and have found it tedious and disappointing. It is more a rememberance of his love conquests and inner emotions than anything related to the warrior. Perhaps I was expecting too much from the hype, but the book was not what I expected or wanted. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summing it all up","review":"I'm a former Marine and I recently saw the movie and read the book. Basically, I can sum up my feelings about the entire Swofford story in this: \\"He never capitalized the word Marine.\\" If you're a Marine or even a civilian, this should give you an indication of what this liberal \\"bird\\" did by writing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaming Liberal Jarhead","review":"Anthony Swofford's book, Jarhead, is a complete waste of time.

Material is presented by giving an example, history and finally the scientific concept meant to be grasped. Makes for a great mystery, but this is science and a subject that scares students anyway. A concept given first is seldom followed by a thorough explanation.

Do not believe the quote on page 23 about the actual test being easier than the practice tests. I did not take the test until I was scoring in the 90's on every practice test.

You can't take a break between them because so much is left in the moment at the end of Golden Fool.There are a few major plot lines that run through Golden Fool, however Hobb interweaves them with long wavelengths, such that one plot line is left hanging for very many chapters while another is addressed, and you being to stop caring about the other plot line, and even wondering if Hobb plans to pick it back up at all.I was also disappointed at the lack of another Fitz witbond. His Wit usage was always one of the most interesting aspects of the books, and the current disuse leaves a void in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great -- but definitely a trilogy's middle volume","review":"Robin Hobb's characterization and writing are excellent as usual in this second volume of the Tawny Man trilogy. However, the plot did not advance much. Not all series have to be in trilogy form! I had two specific quibbles, which I will describe, but try not to give away anything that would spoil people's enjoyment.First, I found it hard to believe that with all the spying and observation that goes on in this series, there was a failure of intelligence to locate a large one armed man and a war horse in a small town.Second, there was an instance in which Fitz went running to give away a secret told him by a friend. I found this to be very much out of character for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"Robin Hobb is as good as any fantasy/fiction writer I have ever read, and I have read some of the best including Robert Jordan and George RR Martin.

Almost all of them require kombu, whatever that is. Other oddities include agar flakes, shiso leaves, dried arame, agave nectar, kaffir lime leaves, tamarind, maple crystals, jicama, spelt pasta and amaranth seeds. Maybe some ingredients could be substituted, for example regular rice vinegar instead of brown rice vinegar, regular radish instead of daikon radish, regular yams instead of garnet yams, regular molasses instead of pomegranate molasses and regular bulgur instead of medium-coarse bulgur \\"found in Middle Eastern markets\\". But what is the substitute for gluten flour? Or beet juice? Or umeboshi paste?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try this at home","review":"I read the enthusiatic reviews before buying this cookbook. I was disappointed. First of all, the recipes are very difficult and time-consuming. It would help to have a staff of kitchen help to do all the required prep. Secondly, the presentation is lacking. But the worst problem of all is the exotic ingredients called for. It seems that every other recipe requires \\"kombu\\" which is apparently some kind of seaweed. I searched high and low and checked out every oriental market in town, to no avail. Nobody knew what I was talking about! I still don't know what kombu is. Similarly, many other ingredients are generally unavailable. Maybe these things would be easier to find on the West Coast where there is a large Asian population, but you just can't get them in Texas.All that said, I did have some very delicious results on the \\"Acorn Squash stuffed with sweet rice.\\" I only had to make a few substitutions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book if you have way too much time on your hand!","review":"This is a solid cookbook for vegans or anyone who would like to venture a little bit out of their \\"ingredients comfort zone.\\" What I clearly did not like about this cookbook was that the recipes were very time consuming! Sometimes you even had to prepare some ingredients, like for example, Tofu Whip (another two-page, two-hour recipe), in order to make a small snack. While I love to cook even if it takes effort and time this book pushed me a bit over the edge.One final thing I thought was quite amusing was that the author claims in the introduction, that organic produce contains more vitamins than regular produce. While that might (or might not) be true it is slightly beside the point. I choose to eat organic food because of the things it DOES NOT contain (pesticides and the like) and because it saves our environment.Anyway, I would not recommend this book unless you don't mind spending hours on preparing these dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"I was looking for a cookbook with vegetarian recipes containing lots of vegetables and not too difficult or time-consuming to make.

Anne Gentry's book is full of vegan delights that are so flavorful. The barbequed tofu is fantastic and will please the staunchest tofu-sceptic. Seitan recipe is wonderful and versatile. I really appreciate her bent towards whole grains as well because that is how we eat.There are a lot of spices to add and veggies to chop for some of the recipes- like the tacos which take hours to prepare but for a special meal for guests your payback comes when people start digging in.

It is by far the BEST VEGETARIAN/ VEGAN FOOD OUT THERE!!! The Real Food Daily Cookbook does the restaurant justice by giving us many of the secrets that have made the restaurant so successful. The Golden Gravy and the melted Cashew Cheese recipes ALONE are a MUST for any self respecting vegetarian who still likes to participate in Thanksgiving dinner or avoid buying the sub-par soy cheese at the local natural food store.

In addition, why are there almost no recipes for cooked leafy greens?? ...very sad. I am reminded of the former FDA commissioner's 2009 book on the food industry's goal of addicting customers to unhealthy foods: The end of overeating -- taking control of the insatiable American appetite, by David A.

All of the recipes I've made from this book so far have been every bit as delicious as those we've had in the restaurant. The BBQ tofu sandwiches are one of our favorites and, as everyone says, the golden gravy is divine. Many thanks to Ann Gentry for sharing these recipes.

Basso is articulate in his writings and pays attention to the details of the scenes or the topics he is discussing.

I would not recommend buying this product unless you have spoken with Harmen Kardon first on compatibility and checked the voltage output of the car power source you are attaching it to.I attempted to install in a '97 Jaguar XK8, and the unit would switch on and then go dead. Harmen Kardon Tech Support stated that this is a symptom of the car voltage dropping below 11.5 volts. The voltage of the car checked out fine, and the unit worked through the cigar lighter in another car. It seems that the unit is extremely sensitive to voltage and will not work effectively in all cases because of this (an internet search revealed others with similar problems).Shame as it looked like a nice product, but clearly not compatible with all vehicles, and a one star rating partly due to the unhelpfulness of Tech Support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"I was really ecstatic when I bought the Harmon Kardon DP 1US Drive and Play in-vehicle interface and controller for my husband.

It may work better for others but we had a bad experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I purchased one of these even cheaper than this for use with an iPod touch (original). Calls to the company gave me the info that it should support basic functions on the touch. And mostly, after debugging a LOT of problems, it does work basically. Looks nice. But my ipod touch kept totally discharging, and is very hot when connected. Eventually, the wireless card fried. Apple replaced the unit, but now I really distrust this HK device. Even if it didn't actually fry the touch, its workings are badly off. Something is wrong.This is a wired unit - current ones are wireless and supposedly support iphone/touch. But I'm not going to chance it. This unit is really not-ready for prime time - I had to fix a couple of things they didn't design right (after calling them - they seem resigned to it's problems). Anyway, maybe for an OLD iPod you don't care about, but otherwise, don't chance it. I know my ipod is worth too much to risk again with it's weird behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service and a shabby product to boot","review":"This is a great idea in theory. Unfortunately it doesn't completely work as stated. Everything works fine except for one flaw that makes it an annoyance. There's no problem when I connect my iPOD through the connector and the user interface is pretty straight forward. The problem lies in the quality of the sound that comes out. I haven't tried using the FM transmitter so I cannot comment on that aspect. I do have an auxiliary jack in my car which produces crystal like sound when directly connected to my iPOD. Now when I connect the auxiliary cord from the car to the module that relays all the information from your iPOD it produces a static sound that is very noticeable and progressively gets worse as the iPOD remains connected. I contacted Harman Kardon to see if there was anything they could do and I have yet to hear back from them. Therefore I cannot recommend this product to anyone. Poor customer service and a shabby product to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice look, poor performance","review":"The product has a great outward appearance and is very easy to use. The problem is the background noise/interference that can be found on any of the pre-set settings.

This basket has been perfect so far!The liner is reversible. The basket is is not the best made, but for the price it is done well. The hood is put in place and held by Velcro. That is about the only thing I don't like about the basket. I am thinking of taking out the threads that hold the Velcro and then just using ribbon to tie the hood in place.This will be used as long as it can be with her. I would buy this Moses Basket as a gift and would also recommend it. I priced others and the ones that where less expensive looked cheaply made in the photos.

Might be good to present gifts at a baby shower but not very appropriate for your baby to sleep in.Overall, the basket option (instead of a bassinett) sounded like a great way to save money... Well, I'm not fully satisfied.We ended up putting the basket in our stroller set at a flat position so we could roll it around the house without carrying the heavy load of a 9 lb baby and the basket.

The fitted sheet is kind of loose and could probably use a new elastic. The fabric is as thin as can be. The basket itself seems sturdy and has been very useful. It looks nicer in person than online.

At the price paid it is a very good value. The only reason that this does not get five stars is due to construction quality.

Overall, though, we have been very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend at all.","review":"I should have read other reviews more carefully - this product was NOT what I expected. The color is not natural - looks like it was dipped or sprayed in an odd pink/orange combo. The velcro that attaches the hood is very cheap looking and rough to the fingers. Doesn't look at all like the picture where the hood attaches. Would have been much more attractive attached with ribbons or woven (as it appears in the photo).

He was the saint who spoke to the birds, animals and plants, and whose statue people like to put in their gardens. It is the story of some folks in a sandy strip of wasteland in a trailer park in northern Scotland who produced a garden that to this day astounds farm and soil experts. How they did it is the story. Though it was written decades ago, it is very timely in that it shows us how we can reconnect with the life that surrounds us in the world of nature instead of mindlessly destroying it. Because it points the way to a conscious appreciation for the earth and its gifts, I think it ranks with the greatest wisdom/spiritual classics of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Findhorn Garden; a model for optimizing our relation with the natural world","review":"What were the odds three to five people of advanced spirituality would meet at this time and place to participate in the miracle of Findhorn Garden?

As someone with a background in urban and regional planning, I believe the Findhorn Experiment - the cultivation (by purely natural,organic means) of a garden of incredible vitality and diversity from an area originally devoid of topsoil - is our common future, and it is a bright future indeed!

In Eddie's Name deals with a nightmare event in the life of a family, and yet leaves the reader with hope. Once begun, it is impossible to put down. Although the subject matter is difficult ( the murder of an innocent young man by a gang of thugs) the way it's handled takes you beyond the violence. It's about strenght in the face of terrible pain, and faith, and real family values. By the end, I felt I'd gotten to know Eddie and his family. In a small way, I went through what happened to them and came out a richer, better person. On my strong suggestion, my 18 year old son also read it.

But, he seems content to just be her protector while attending the balls of the ton. But, is this how he really feels? About the time that they figure out what they both want she is kidnapped.

Bad editing or just lazy?","review":"I read this book over the weekend. The storyline was ok, though I think this series may have run its course. The editing was terrible.I was really disappointed at the end of this book. I am wondering if they had published a draft version instead of the final version. One page has a 'Insert Techno' sentence, meaning they intended to describe some tech information, but never put it in.There were also several starts at storylines that just ended. Several hints that Tomboy was on the russian carrier for some reason didn't go anywhere.The worst part was that the end of the book as two badly conflicting sections. In one section, Tombstone lands on the ship after being shot up. In the other section, he sees Tomboy's russian bomber shotdown. It was very confusing. I think he was trying to work the Tomboy character into the book, then left for vacation without finishing.Not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the story???","review":"I have read most of the books in this series and have rather enjoyed them. But how did we go from an unfortunate series of events that led to the sinking of an American cruise ship by either a Russian or American missile, to the rest of the story? The book attempts to find out whose missile actually hit the ship, then drops it. Why did the Americans all of a sudden want Pamela Drake to steal the crystal from the Russian laser, and for what reason? How improbable is it that Tomboy would be on the Russian ship, then ejecting from a Russian bomber with no further development. Then the President appears out of nowhere on the carrier to present Ms. Drake with a metal(book's spelling), for what??? Not a really coherent plot for the last third of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending made no sense, poor editing, magic stuff happens","review":"This was one of the poorer books I have read.

There were two endings, neither of which made sense and both were rushed. Terrible editing, including the reference in the last sentence to a reporter wearing the 'defense metal' she was just awarded.William Keith started the series as 'Keith Douglass'. The publisher fired him off the series for wanting money after 7 books and farmed the work out to whoever was cheap.

It is the vocal gyrations, the pure sounds, that carry the recording forward.Unlike other recordings, I cannot pick out any particular song that stands out - they are all superb. The lush, symphonic-like arrangements (I love 'em) are missing as are the ballades that soar to the stratosphere with ebullient sound. Nor do we find any of her now-famous Portuguese renditions that seemed on yet another plane. Instead, this is vintage jazz, excellent intonation (a skill she shares with Tierney Sutton and Cheryl Bentyne), and a sense of rhythm vaguely reminescent of Sinartra's. But all that aside, Ms Monheit is a wonderful performer in her own right. She has withstood the slings and arrows of those who do not recognize potential greatness and she did this with grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billie Holiday??? Ella Fitzgerald???? Whaaaaat????","review":"Despite having a beautiful, God-given voice, this girl has problems and they are all of them readily evident in this CD.First of all, she sounds NOTHING like Lady or Ella. NOTHING!! Which is fine, but she and others need to stop making this comparison.Secondly, she is most definately NOT a jazz styled singer. She is a pop singer who does standards. If you want to know how a jazz singer sounds, check out Paula West, Dianne Reeves or Allan Harris.Third, as Stephen Holden FINALLY pointed out in the NY Times, Monheit has problems when she sings songs she cannot connect with. This is her biggest problem.Finally, the cd is more often than not flat and uninteresting. And as for Mr. Buble, I shudder to think that people have been conned into thinking HE is anything more than a below average wanna-be Sinatra."},{"rating":"2","title":"JANE is sweet, and I would recommend you look at GENIE","review":"Nice singer.Sometimes the arrangements seem a little stale, although very nicely recorded and played- just kind of stock NYC jazz.I just have gotten so much into this little unknown AMISH singer from NOrth AMerica named GENIE that I am longing for more music with a fresh and spacious imaginative sound. You would do well to search for Genie's 4 CD set if, like me, you are looking for a twist of something new in your easy listening collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"It has become apparent that Ms. Monheit doesn't have enough of a voice to do ballads, and this CD is mostly ballads.The first cut is a jazzy little riff, and it's quite nice.

AND you can understand every word unlike the aforementioned f-i-t-p gimmick singers of today. Brava Ms. Monheit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE NEVER TAKES A CHANCE","review":"BORING! Every Monheit Show & CD I have seen & heard is boring and she sings every tune, every show exactly the same; same notes, same non-commital way of singing. She sounds well rehearsed. She does sings in pitch and is breath-takingly drop deap gorgeous! But her CDs are simply boring. I think there is a real market for jazz singers that sing the standards and sing them fairly melodically straight and Jane fufills that need. However there are tons of under-publicized jazz vocalists that are heads and shoulders above her. Try buying TERI THORNTON (the first place competition winner; jane was second)!

The more this pretty girl with the pretty voice is gilded as the next Ella, Sarah, Norah, Billie--whatever--the less remarkable she seems. She is bland. I actually laid our some cash to see her live. Lively, pretty--but the constant brushing her hair out of her face (get a clip, Jane) and pouty facial expressions reminded me of a child acting out burlesque. It was a cartoon. I would have laughed out loud if I hadn't been so queasy at the sight. Now she has big $$ behind her and the relentless hype goes on and on. She is perfectly fine--but she is not, by any means, what she is made out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen. Don't Look.","review":"I sense that a lot of people are holding the fact that Jane is gorgeous against her, as if talent and beauty were incompatible. That idea went out of vogue (pun intended) about the time these songs were written and first performed. Yes, she's beautiful but so are her voice, her low key interpretations and the mood this CD creates. If you have a problem with beautiful people, don't look at the CD cover while listening. And, no, I'm not influenced because my name is Bill . . . which, by the way, she sings marvelously. I must admit that I sat by the phone for three days after listening to her sing it waiting for her call. Must have been about another Bill.

Here she sings movie musical tunes, that have over the ears become jazz standards, highlight include I Wont Dance, Bill, and many others, her best, so far. She keeps maturing as a jazz singer, and is now scatting with ease, and showing some improvisational skills. The times when I've seen her in concert, she seems to really enjoy what she does, and that is giving superior readings to old standards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows real promise.","review":"As a longtime jazz fan, I'm pleased to see more and more jazz artists receive recording contracts. I'd never heard Jane Monheit sing when I picked up this CD, but was pleased to find that she definitely has talent.Her style is satisfying and her song choices leave little to be desired. Her voice is reminiscent of Maureen McGovern's, but of better quality. Unfortunately, she sometimes has a tendency to be nasally; this is annoying, but doesn't happen so frequently that I abandoned the CD. Monheit also sometimes sounds like a country singer, riding hard on her Rs. Nonetheless, she is mostly pleasant to listen to, and I will consider buying other Monheit CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very helpful","review":"Ok, look, if you are the high libido partner, and your goal is to get sympathy and understanding, acknowledgment of your needs and relief from your loneliness and hurt feelings of rejection, read this book and hope for mercy sex.If you are the low libido partner who loves her spouse, you probably feel bad enough about the situation anyway.

Someone is speaking the truth about men who just aren't interested. All you ever hear is that women aren't in the mood for sex. In my marriage of 28 years, it's always been my husband who has no interest in our sex life. This has been very painful and made even more painful by the fact that I have felt so alone. Because no one else talks about men not craving sex, I've spent that last 28 years wondering what's wrong with me! Now I know I'm not alone. This book really gave me a boost.

I found the book to be very condescending and dismissive- breathtaking actually in it's ignorance.

Andre Norton has set her story straight after the triplets defeated Oragastus (the first time). But J May wrote about two further encounters with this dark magician. And M Bradley set her story far far into the future (generations after the Black Trillium) and made no mention of the loss of the talismans.I suggest that people read J May's Blood Trillium and Sky Trillium first before reading A Norton's Golden Trillium and, lastly, M Bradley's Lady of the Trillium to get a better feel of the stories without being time warped.A must read for all Trillium fans and Norton fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy","review":"I loved Black Trillium, and found Blood Trillium a worthy, if darker, sequel, but reading Golden Trillium only reveals what a thorough editing job May and Bradley must have done on Norton's text while writing the first novel.

I've often used this book in its earlier editions, and now this one -- it's never failed me. Even when I thought I knew everything about a particular city's architecture, I've found new discoveries.

The maps are wrong in places ... cant forgive that. Also it needs a severe update as far as contemporary work goes to include work by HDM, Holl et al.

If you speak the language, it's for sale for ~18 euros (~25 dollars) - still expensive, but not the crazy prices you'd pay for a used copy of the out of print english edition.http://www.amazon.fr/Lhistoire-3-Adolf-Caroline-Pellerin/dp/2759501388/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1230606292&sr;=8-1I haven't researched other countries, but I strongly recommend reading this volume first - it really sets up the rest of the excellent story very well.

Shame on you for calling her a \\"big yawn\\". Here is a girl, who has more talent in her pinkie finger than most pop stars now a days who is pouring her heart out in a simple album. Yes, it's not the greatest quality recording, but I can hear past the mistakes and glitches (she doesn't have a million dollars to tweak and over produce like the others!)Meredith has put her heart out on this album. I bought it because I saw her on Broadway. I know she's going places. And with only 1,000 copies in existence, EVER, I think it's a no brainer investment. I look forward to her taking another leap and making a real album with a label. Then she's blow all our socks off! She's got a surprise around every corner. I LOVE MEREDITH! Shine your light all over Broadway and then all over the world! I know your time is coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true talent...you will not be disappointed!","review":"A glimpse into the talents of a soon to be household name, Meredith combines both her singing and writing prowess together in this shocking debut. Her voice and knack for creating catchy, yet truely beautiful melodies make this album what it is...a harbinger of things to come, and a chance to get in on her career at the ground floor. But don't believe me...listen for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Soothing, Beautiful","review":"The above are all words that describe Meredith Patterson's music. Anyone who finds the flaws in this demo album too hindering should take a second glance at the title of the album. The purpose of all music is to create an emotional responce, which her music does. You don't have to look for perfection, but sentiment and feeling is everywhere in this album. The music is beautiful and the lyrics are insightful. Meredith's broadway background gives her the ability to write more than bubble-gum pop, in a fun style.A definite must-have, and I eagerly await her new albums!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow... it sucks. No originality.","review":"I think that she could have used different vehicles to carry her voice. The music was too mainstream... too easy-listening.

It is an excellent movie with actors that were perfect for their parts. I consider this and \\"Havana\\" as the two great films about the end of the Batista Regime. I don't know how in America we suddenly forgot the atrocities of Batista and decided that Castro was an abomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"When on DVD, MGM?","review":"I've seen this movie twice, on late night exhibitions. No, I wasn't drunk. The movie certainly has a mood that will keep you tuned. At least it kept me. It's not about historic facts, but relations and how important they may become in an uncertain situation. I'm surprized such a joy isn't available on DVD yet, as we see so many trash being offered on this new format. Hope they don't wait to launch it until nobody remembers it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hear it for the location scout!","review":"This awful adolescent drivel is saved only by Sean Connery and the breathtakingly accurate scenery. The late 50's interiors are dead on and throughout the movie, I kept wondering, how on earth did they get permission to shoot in Cuba? Of course they didn't - it was shot in Spain.Despite the interesting atmosphere and backstory, the story itself isn't cohesive and there are holes in it big enough to hold one of Batista's white baby grands.Perhaps the story would have held if the female lead had more strength. Brooke Adams portrays Alejandra Pulido with a here-again, gone-again Spanish accent and a weakness that betrays the character as written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuba, don't bother","review":"I love movies, books and music...anything about Cuba and other caribbean cultures.

This film is just such a one and you have every cliche that any totalitarian-loving liberal will love. It doesn't have any truth with the reality of Cuba? Hey, when did that stop liberals? Like all good Marxists, they will simply rewrite history (in this case via film) in order for \\"history\\" to conform to their totalitarian ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total mess - and not always in a good way","review":"Richard Lester's Cuba was rushed into production with an unfinished script and more memorable for a troubled shoot that saw Sean Connery and Richard Lester at each others' throats than for anything that made it to the screen. Set in the last few days before Battista loses power, shown with such authentic period detail that no-one seems to remember it's supposed to be Christmas (the title card even gets the year wrong!), it's a plotless mosaic disinterestedly following Connery's mercenary supposedly advising the army but in fact doing nothing much in particular before falling in with old girlfriend Brooke Adams for a love story that doesn't really happen either before the revolution sort of happens because they've got to end the movie somehow. Then he goes home alone. Hector Elizondo's aide and Chris Sarandon's cheating husband are the closest the film gets to rounded characters but everyone else just phones it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what mama needed!

I would have to reapply more or add water, both of which ruin the thrill of the moment.I ended up using quite a bit of the bottle just after a week of having sex with my wife, and it didn't seem very economical for me to continue using this product.From the other reviews, it seems that this product is great, but if you're seeking longer sex and don't want have to deal with the hassle of reapplication of any kind, consider other alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"top quality","review":"this lube is great.

Yes I would. Over and over and over actually. When I need to use lubricant this is the only stuff I will go for. The price is great and it only takes a few drops and your good to go for as long as your body can last. If it starts to dry up all it takes is a little saliva and your set.

Their standard is in my mind the better. On devices of a self gratifying nature you really don't need much compared to some where you're constantly reapplying and 'interrupting' your activity. That it goesa long way and works well to boot adds to the value. I bought the little 2oz bottle first not paying attention to the fact that the bigger bottles were a better buy. Read all the offerings and pick the one you're comfortable with.As with everything personal choice is subjective but at least for its purpose this is not a overpriced rip-off like some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out too fast","review":"It felt really cold on the skin.

It gets a little tacky, but nothing to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This stuff works pretty good. It's much better if your girl has a bit of lubrication of her own but needs a little extra. If used with a toy or for anal you may have to add a bit of water to re-slick things up. Keep a small squeeze tube of water around and you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries quickly and leaves sticky residue","review":"My partner and I used this lubricant on multiple occasions and the first several times it seemed fine and lasted as long as we wanted it to but recently it seems to dry very quickly and becomes very sticky and useless far too soon.

My wife is very delicate and there is not a lot of products on the market that she does not have some kind of reaction to or objection to. With the ID Glide Sensual Lubricant we have finally found something that meet all her delicate needs as well as mine. The only thing that I would change is the shape of the bottle. Round bottles tend to roll away from you, so a bottle that was more op-lone, vice round would be helpful. Also, if there was some kind of pump dispenser instead of the squeeze the bottle type.The product works as advertised and has been a go to item for my wife and I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"This arrived quickly and was just what we were looking for.

This lube doesn't give me any issues, and works well for anal and vaginal penetration. I've never had a water based lube that worked well for anal, but this does somehow! This is, in my opinion, the best multipurpose lube we've tried (meaning for toys, anal, vaginal...it works for everything). There are better lubes on the market, but nothing quite as versatile for the price. JO lubes, for example, are hands down my favorite lubes, but each seems to be more specialized for a specific purpose, and are all quite pricey. Overall, if you are looking for a high quality, well rounded lube, I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lube.","review":"Feels natural and doesn't take a whole lot.

Leaky wing nuts...","review":"This is great for one person. It pours straight down over the top of your head nice and smooth. The adjustable arm can swing up and down so you can have the right height. The wing nuts also let you adjust the angle of the head. But! you can't angle it side to side at all. So mine hung a little crooked, closer to the wall. The only way to adjust this is to tighten or loosen the actual thread part on the wall, which is no solution. I also found that adjusting the wing nuts when the shower is on, leads to water spraying up at the ceiling.Another note... I'm not always a single person shower type. I might have company, therefore they are left out in the cold. I'm trading this model in for the wall mount aquascape by the same company instead.If you shower alone and don't change your water direction much. This is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"This shower head is great! I was a little concerned about the water pressure not being high enough after reading some reviews of more expensive 'Downpour' heads, but it works great.And you don't even need any tools to install it.

Installation was easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to get a good seal. Other showerheads I've purchased have come with the tape included which is why I took off one star. The arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall. It creates a soft fall of water that I really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim.

I had tried the Cascadia Showerhead by waterpik, but the darn thing kept falling. I am glad I found this one. The showerhead was easy to install and now i got my bf hooked on it. If you're looking for a shower head that doesn't spray too hard or too much at one time, then this is your new best friend. When I eventually get a house, this showerhead will be in every shower.

It was obviously done on a limited budget but that just means a person has to work harder to make things work rather rely on the effects to save the show. The stories were quite good and had a nice twist to them that sets them apart from many other shows in this genre. One of the things I really liked about this movie was that the actors look like real people, folks we work with and talk to in everyday life, this makes the film more believable and realistic to me.My best to Director: Jim Haggerty and Actors: Suzi Lorraine, Tina Krause, Nathalie Bryant, Jae Mosc, Pooya Mohseni for a cool movie.

He states his mission at the outset: to cure us of our freedom, which he eloquently and hilariously thereafter explains is the root of all anguish. The sharp Caravaggio darks and lights with which Ms. Krall dramatically frames Mr. Crisp's face photographically add to an overall sense here that we're receiving the distillation of a remarkable life, deliberately and richly offered up as his final gift to us.

When I call this \\"noise,\\" however, I do not mean that I strongly dislike it (although, of course, I do strongly dislike it), I mean that it truly does sound more like noise than music - random tooting of horns and banging of drums and plucking of strings.

But the problem got worse, and then I took off the cover and saw that the whole tube is covered by cracks and there are multiple big holes through the rubber.The second issue is that this tube does not provide enough stability and the kids are able to tip and get stuck with their head in the water.I would never recommend a friend to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"We got this for our 20 month old son.

Sadly, it is missing one ingredient, Chuck Negron. Cory Wells is a great soloist (Mama Told Me Not To Come)and Danny Hutton has his moments (Liar) but hearing Danny attempting to sing \\"One\\", Joy To The World, and \\"Easy To Be Hard\\" is too much to ask for those familiar with the originals (all three songs and many of their other hits were originally sung by Chuck). The production is great, Richie Podolor, the original producer still has the touch and the harmonies are impeccable.

They also discuss how Joseph may have rose to be the Prime Minister of Egypt, from some new findings in that area.In the Joshua and the Walls of Jericho story, they theorize that it was an earthquake that may have brought down the walls of Jericho, perfectly timed as Joshua's forces were on the outskirts. We have seismic data of Middle Eastern earthquakes over the past 100 years, and they line up almost exactly where certain cities of antiquity were destroyed, too, such as the city of Troy.This is a really neat video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joseph's story is Good, Joshua's is poor.","review":"While the analysis of Joseph's story is quite good and commendable, BBC did a poor job in gathering information about the reality of Joshua's conquests. It's biased and arrives at a farfetched conclusion that the story of Jericho is a myth. The archaeologists chosen are not authoritative and seem biased against the Bible record which weakens the conclusion. At the end they seem to infer that we have to accept the story of Joshua as mere hope and faith that the promised land was all people's desires towards liberation and freedom. Why can't we accept the Bible by faith rather than try to explain everything scientifically. Archaeology cannot provide all the answers, especially when the archaelogists are biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Not what I call a great game, it's a game but not well developed.

I went out for a 30 minute ride last night with no issues other than my little girl fell asleep and since there is no support for her i had to hold her head with my arm. There is no way for the baby's head to just stay on the pad infront of them. The seat is small, my baby is 16 months and I'll be surprised if she can fit in it past the age of two we'll see but for now its great. All in all its a good seat it was easy to install it took about ten minutes. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is because the box says for kids up to 4 years old and that is doubtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing I've purchased on Amazon thus far!","review":"My husband and I reviewed a few children's bike seat and we were getting negative reviews about the seats that attach behind the bike. Apparently it causes some imbalance when you use the seat that attaches behind the bike. We found this Kangaroo child seat from WeeRide and we strongly agreed that having the child in front where you can see him at all times was the safest. My 18 month old loves to ride along with his Daddy. The best part about this seat is that it is light weight, very nice design, and it allows the child to have a great view while riding. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking into buying a child bike seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoy this product!!","review":"Got this product for $49.99 and love it. It was very easy to install; took only about 15 minutes. The one thing I don't like is that there is a hand screw bolt that holds the seat to the very stable support bar. It seems safe, but I needed to use one of those rubber jar openers to tighten it since its was difficult to tighten enough without hurting your fingers. You are supposed to take the seat off when transporting the bike by vehicle so that the wind doesn't damage it, so I imagine that this will be my only complaint with the carrier.My 14 month old seems comfortable, secure and enjoys riding around with me. It surprisingly was not difficult to get used to riding with a carrier in front of you. I would highly recommend this over the cheaper, back-of-bike models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infant bike seat","review":"This bike seat was purchased at the request of my family members.

He has a canondale men's bike and I have an Eddie Bauer women's bike. Both are pretty standard. We would have had to attach the bar to the handlebar tube in order to get it to work, which we did not feel comfortable with (instructions state not to do this). Measure your head tube, the part that sticks out above the frame and right below where the handle bars attach. Make sure you have enough space to mount the bar (at least an inch I would say? maybe it is in the specs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!","review":"I bought this bike seat for my daughter when she was about 2 years old. She is on the small side, so she fit in it until she was 4. I had this on my cruiser-style bike which worked great because you sit totally upright. On a road bike it probably wouldn't work as well because you lean forward to reach the handle bars. I also had to point my knees out just slightly. Otherwise though, I just love it! I tried a regular seat that attached behind my seat, and I lost my balance almost immediately and we both fell over. This seat allows me to chat with my daughter, maintain our balance, and overall have a great ride. It was definitely one of my favorite baby purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Make","review":"I thought that this would've been perfect, I could see at all times what my child was doing. Which is true, but all the wind would have hit his face first. ( That would be if I could've fit it on ANY women's bike) It kept rubbing my inner thighs. Im not a large woman either! Only 125 lbs, 5'7. So I do not see how this could work at all. My husband is searching for a bike for him so I do not know how it fits on a man's bike. Also, I saw this same item at my neightborhood Walmart. So I would've bought it there to avoid having to send it back. I ended up buying the copilot bike seat. It reclines and is comfy. It does go on the back which I realize that I prefer over the front rider. Hope this helps everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed","review":"I was so excited to receive this for my daughters 1st birthday. I had done alot of research and this seemed the best!! When I opened the box, I thought it was a joke. This seat is SO tiny!!! My daughter, although in the 95% for height and weight, at 11 months old she BARELY fit!! Another reason I picked this seat was that it was for ages 1-4 years, but unless your kid was born 3 years prematurely, I don't see how they could comfortably fit past 1 year or so. I understand the seat probably couldn't really be TOO much bigger, but to claim this is for up to a 4 year old is crazy. I would have loved this last summer when she was 3 months old! Unless you havea very tiny child, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"No room for the rider","review":"As pointed out by other here, when installed, the weeride doesn't leave any room on the top frame bar, which is really dangerous when you need to stop in a stop light.

I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not made for larger kids","review":"Seems like a well put together and well made seat, but I bought this for my 17-month old, who is at the top of the percentiles for height and weight. She weighs about 29 pounds at 17 months, and barely fits into the straps. She is also fairly tall and the adjustable foot rests were just about too short already! Not recommended unless you have a little peanut!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, but not intended for short people!","review":"I loved the idea of this bike seat but it didn't work for me! I'm 4' 10\\" and once I put this seat on my bike I couldn't reach the ground without jumping off the bike (not possible with the seat right in front of you). I bought a new bike so that I could reach the ground from the seat but unfortunately the span between the handle bars and the seat was too short to fit the child seat. Maybe a taller person would have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great childs bike seat...","review":"This is the second one that I've bought and I highly recommend it. We have two young Grandsons who just love riding in this!

I love that I can see the kids without having to turn back, I can reach them without having to reach around backwards, and they love that they can see evrything and feel the breeze in their faces! Installation was pretty easy, but we have hybrid bikes, which must have a thicker frame, so my husband ended up getting longer bolts at the hardware store to attach the seats more firmly, but that was no big deal. I think this is one of the best kid/bike solutions I've seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wee Ride Together!","review":"Very simple and easy to install. My husband had it on and ready to go without a lot of complaining. It's sturdy and well built and we love that the child rides in the front.Our son is about 2-1/2, so he's not going to be using this that much longer--he's not that heavy, but he's getting a little too tall for it already (the space for the feet are only so big). Wish we got it months ago. He has so much fun on it and gets all excited when Daddy says \\"Let's go for a bike ride!\\" I would highly recommend getting this for a younger child to really get some use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WEE Ride review","review":"Our 19 month old has loved this. It is a great product, easy to install. Only problem is the harness gets tangled and is hard to adjust to stay tight. But overall we wouldn't trade it for anything.

I didn't feel comfortable with the seats that sit on the back of your bicycle, the weight distribution was awful! After getting the wee-ride, it took my husband about a half hour to put on, my daughter LOVES it!!! The first time out, she fell asleep on the head rest and my arms kept her straight, the foot holders are great. When people in my neighborhood saw us riding around they did a double take! I cannot rave enough about this fabulous seat! My daughter is safe, comfortable and loves going for a family bike ride now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"My son and I love to go riding.

Upon opening the box, I immediately realized there was no way any child bigger then say.... 25 lbs would fit in this thing. THEN, I went on to try and mount it onto my bycicle, and there was just no way no how. I have four very different bikes at my house, beach cruiser, womens mtn., mens mtn., and a tandum cruiser (nice bikes too, no junk) and this seat would not mount to any of them.

Come to find out it was damaged in shipment and I would have to go back online and re-order - something I chose not to do because with my first order I was getting free shipping and probably with the re-order I probably would have to pay.

So we finally bought a back child seat for my 3 year old and I just wore my 17 month old on my back in my ergo carrier. Now that's it's summer time in FL it's too hot for that so I came across this seat and fell in love with the idea. So I tried it for the first time today and I hate it. I don't like to say that but I really just do not like it. I went 2 blocks and my inner thighs were super red from the seat scratching the inside of my legs. I have to bow my legs out just to pedal. I guess if you are just cruising the town it would be ok if you are wearing pants so it doesn't rub but we bike on trails and uphill and I couldn't imagine doing that with this seat. I Love though how my child was so close to me but I don't understand how this seat can be used comfortably. I'm really disappointed and I'm now looking into an ibert seat instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble","review":"This seat, unlike others I have purchased and returned, actually fit the odd frame of my mountain bike. It was very simple to install, and feels very sturdy. My son fits comfortably, and even though he is front and center on the bike, he is out of the way when it comes to steering, breaking, and changing gears. I do have to turn my knees out slightly when I pedal because my knees would hit the seat (I'm 5'10 so maybe shorter people won't have this problem?), but it's not completely uncomfortable to do so. The seat is a light plastic so it doesn't add too much weight to the bike. Overall, it's a good and inexpensive seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product!","review":"I love this product.

After hours of research, we chose the WeeRide. The seat works well for my husband who is 6'2\\". Unfortunately, for myself riding on a 15\\" frame, I could not get it to feel safe or comfortable. I am researching another for my bike such as iBert or Bike Tutor. My husband does enjoy having my son in front of him. We find it to be very safe riding on paved trails. My son has the biggest smile on his face when he is on it and asks often to ride it. I would highly recommend it for something larger than a 15\\" frame. For all of those who question the safety, I am an advid researcher and find it to be quite safe. I know it is relatively a new concept in the US, but many other countries having been using them for decades. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves no room for the driver...","review":"We really wanted a child bike seat that would allow our son to see more than just one of his parent's backsides during our family bike rides. So, we researched and purchased what we thought was the best for the amount of money we could spend--the WeeRide Kangaroo. It was not too difficult to install, however, only upon installation does one realize there is no room for the \\"driver\\" to stand while straddling the bike. The WeeRide takes up all of the frame, from the seat to the handlebars, leaving no room to hold the bike up when coming to a stop. We ended up having to return the seat to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much freedom to ride...","review":"The WeeRide is a great idea, but it's really not comfortable to use. You have to bow your legs out to pedal otherwise your knees hit the seat, even when it's as far forward as it will go! And the part where they can put their hands or put their head down can get in the way when you're trying to make a turn. If I'd have known about the iBert I would have gotten that one because it keeps the child's legs forward and just looks more comfortable for both of you! The safety straps on the WeeRide are a joke. Buy the iBert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weeride kangaroo seat","review":"I was not impressed with this product, it was very hard to pedal my bike cause the seat puts the baby right in the way.

The only thing I liked was I could see what my baby was doing unfortunately she didn't look very comfortable!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Granddaughter FELL OFF as the ONE THUMBSCREW gave out","review":"I liked the idea and bought this and enjoyed it for two days. My wife went out and put our granddaughter in the Wee Rider and as she was standing there the seat fell. It became unattached from the bar and my granddaughter took a tough fall, if she did not have her bike helmet on she could have been hurt.We looked back at the directions as I thought I may have missed something but I did not, there is only one thumbscrew that holds the whole thing to the frame. To make it easy to remove there is no bolt underneath. I can't believe others haven't had this issue. I plan on returning it and writing the company. Four screws with bolts to hold the bar to the frame but only one thumbscrew to hold the Wee Rider to the bar is crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"First, this product did not fit on my husband's bike at all, so I had to put it on mine, which was not as planned. Second, when we finally got in on there, I had to pedal bow-legged to get my knees around the seat...and not a little. It was really unwieldy. On top of that, with the extra weight of my daughter, I felt really unsteady going around turns. Then, my one yr old started grabbing things...my bike, my arms, my face whatever she could get her hands on. I felt like a circus monkey trying to balance on a unicycle. Needless to say, I am going to start looking for the bike trailers, even though they are a lot more expensive, because this thing just does not work. BTW, I am a 5'6\\" female - maybe if you are a 6 ft. tall man it would work?? Really, I am one of those people that never gives up on an idea - I have duct-taped a lot of things together in the name of making it work, but there was just no way this was ever going to be comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Idea, Just Doesn't Fit","review":"I gave it 2 stars because it's a great idea. I couldn't give it any more than that because it wouldn't fit my bike (Gary Fisher) or my husbands (Specialized). The seat went on my bike after I removed my seat but the platform would not fit because I couldn't remove the handlebars! I had to attach it to the spacers on my bike instead of the tube and my husband's bike didn't have a tube or spacers to attach it to. I don't know how this seat fits any bike. I really wanted it to work and was so disappointed when it didn't. I got this seat for $56 at Wal-Mart and I'm glad I did so I don't have to pay the shipping fee to return it. I ordered the iBert seat from Amazon since I couldn't find it locally. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it fits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was so excited to receive this child bike seat, but was very disappointed! The seat could not attach to either of what I thought were standard bikes. Where the bar is supposed to attach on the front of the bike, the bar swivels. Therefore, it didn't work. I tried but couldn't turn the bike very easily. Not only that, but check out how small the seat is compared to a normal child's bike seat. The seat is teeny, and doesn't seem safe and protective if you where to fall. Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is a great product for parents who want to take the kids out for a bike ride. Easy to install in less than 20 minutes. My kids love it. Also better to have them in front, rather than the seats where they ride in the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product!!","review":"Cool!! This it great baby can see everything.

Great Product would buy again and again. Excellent!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Minor Design Tweek","review":"Overall happy with the design. My daughter loves it. Being in front really simulates what we all love so much about riding bikes (Unbroken wind in your face). Unfortunately, the harness needs some work. Our daughter is small for her age (1.5 yrs, 24lbs) and we already have the harness fully extended. We do tend to bundle here up quite a bit but nothing too crazy. She will probably outgrow the harness long before she gets to the 40lb weight limit. Still, for ~$45 it's well worth the money. It's great to be able to interact with her during the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"Nothing else really to say!Easy to install.My son loves it.I love it.We get stopped all the time by parents asking about it.Potential warning to 'thick around the middle kids' - my son is under 30lbs and the waist strap is tight.

Most mountain bikes have virtually no neck at all, so check before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential","review":"I was really hoping this would work.

You can talk to your child, they can see everything and are truly excited by the experience (faster daddy!). It does not change the center of gravity of the bike and is therefore more stable to ride.If your child is below 4, don't even waste your time with a rear carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weerider is alot of fun!","review":"Easy to install product and take on and off bike, also an extra bar makes switching between my husband and I fast and easy. The mounting bar is a stable base for the seat. My son enjoys being between our arms. He does reach down and play with the brake cables, gear shifter, and handle bars. He is 24 pounds so hopefully he will get over this curious stage. He also fell asleep once and ended up resting his head on my arm which got uncomfortable. We have to widen our legs slightly when peddling and my son loves to put his hands on my knees to help me peddle. We love the closeness though so we love the weerider. I thought of making a cloth sound activity center to go over the front rest to keep him stimulated when the ride gets boring. This would be a nice add on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"I did not like this seat, and so I returned it. I am not sure how it is supposed to work or why someone would try to put their kid over the top tube of their bicycle but it is a bad situation. It makes it hard to pedal and my daughter was trying to get all up in my steering. I also have a nice hatred for it because I now have a small scrape in my top tube in the shape of a circle where the long metal piece that holds the seat on cut through when I was tightening the knob."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interested, but is it logistical","review":"I was very interested in purchasing one of these for my then infant so that I could see him while riding bikes with the rest of the family, but I tried one before buying and, being short in stature (I'm 5'2\\"), my legs kept hitting the foot rests of the seat and we kept having to play head tango. It's a swell idea, but not for those of the shorter variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but check your bike frame style","review":"The bike seat is great. My daughter and I love going out for a bike rides. I am 5'11\\" and have not had difficultly pedaling around the WeeRide. The hardest part was learning to shift down to make the uphills instead of standing up and pedaling. Not being able to stand up and pedal makes some of the hills that I am used to climbing easily very challenging. Anyways be certain that your current bike has at least a one inch handle bar neck on the frame to attach the front support clamp.

Baby is on the way (you constantly hit baby's head with your chest), bar it too high and child sit is to near to the main sit, so if you jump down than your groin get stuck in between two sits. It's create dangerous delays while on intersections and increase your chance to be hit by the car.My knees should go to the sides or the rub child sit. Also it come with some kind of a \\"shield\\" that go between baby and a bike wheel. I guess for baby sleep on it or defend from rollover. It's impossible to install it if your bike front bar is too high. I'm 6'2 and have normal size bike for my height by the way. Here is video of us riding it: [...]So I'm planning to buy child sit for the back of the bicycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"My wife and I love this seat for our two year old. It is so fun to hear him chatter away while we are riding. It is much easier to communicate with him now while we ride than when we had him in the bike trailer. My only complaint is how expensive an additional cross support is. I would love to have both of our bikes set up to take him for a ride but as it stands I can't make myself shell out the extra money to outfit my wife's bike with an extra cross support. Overall though, we are loving this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"My daughter absolutely loves to be in this WeeRide. She always wants to go for a bike ride.

I took the seat off the bike and never used it again. We bought a back riding seat, problem solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for toddler","review":"I think maybe if you start them on this when they are littler it could work but for my 2 1/2 year old it was way too scary. Also pretty uncomfortable for me, 5'6\\" on a mountain bike, pretty awkward. It was worth a shot, I guess, but also not impressed with the construction. The connection to the bike was a pain and does not inspire confidence. Maybe the other brands are better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tall people","review":"This product in design is a good idea, putting the child up in front of the parent so they can interact and the child can see where they are going, but talk about poor design for the parent.I am 6'2\\" and my knees are now bruised thanks to this seat. Dont get me wrong, it is possible to ride with this on your bike, if you are willing to ride bow legged. If you hit an uphill stretch and want to really pump on the pedals, be prepared for some pain because its tough to get some torque on the pedals if your knees are splayed out to the side.I am going to return this one and buy my next option, the green front mounted seat. The reviews on that one seem to solve my problem. I will keep you posted on how that turns out.Add in the poor strapping system, and somewhat shaky mount, and this is only a 2 star product. It better be 4 stars or better, after all, this is the safety of my son I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Easy to use, my boys love it - they can see everything while we ride.

Both are fairly standard off-the-bike-store-rack models. The company's misleading advertising states it fits virtually any bike. What it should say is that you must have at least 3/4\\"-1\\" of head tube extending above the top tube so that the front mounting clamp will fit without interfering with the headset bearings (steering mechanism.) My trek mountain bike has essentially no such space. My wife's Giant city/trail bike had a little more space due to the sloping \\"ladies\\" top tube, but the clamp still did not fit. Had I known this, I would not have wasted the shipping fees, and gotten a seat that fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummed..","review":"I wanted so badly to LOVE this product.

(she's only 15mo old and also petite!). Plus, I had to bike with my legs splayed/knees pointing out. Just plain akward..I have to second the other reviewer who commented negatively on the seat belt system. It's not a very easy in/out set up and the straps slipped off my petite daughter's shoulders. The ride must've been comfortable for her though, she'd even fall asleep w/ her head on the pad!!We did get lots of comments on how unique/great idea the seat was. I truly wanted this product to work out, it just didn't cut it and we broke down and bought a pull behind bike trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but....","review":"This is a wonderful way to talk to your child and have more interaction while riding.

However there are some things you need to consider:- Turning radius of the bike is restricted- Does not handle child up to 40 pounds as stated. My son is two and is 50 percentile height and weight and is just about too big for it.- You have to ride slightly bow legged for you not to hit the seat with your knees. Its not good for long rides, can be very tiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the front loading bike seat","review":"I was not smart enough to switch the bolts from the front to the back so I replaced the rear bolts. I can't imagine this would fit any non-steel seat post.I put the seat on a long wheelbase touring bike so I'm able to use cleats just fine. The splay of the legs is disappointing but more than made up for the fact that I get to hug Anna while I'm riding.I just have to teach my kid to keep her arms out of the way.It's definitely going to cut about 2 mph off your usual speed.But the cuteness factor is overwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"We use this all the time and love it!","review":"This is a great child seat. I can hardly feel the difference from riding alone. The center of gravity is not changed at all (like the ones that attach on the back of the bike which I have had). I do not feel wobbly at all. My child loves seeing everything and we can talk while riding. I feel safer when I am on city streets with my child in front of me that when I used to have the wagon being pulled behind. This is amazing. I hesitated in buying it because my child was approaching the weight limit, but for the price and how much we've used this in the past few weeks it was worth it. I'd buy this again and would HIGHLY recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, had to modify bracket for my bike","review":"This is the best item on the web, great concept. Son loves it. I had to take him riding on it after installing to calm him down even though it was 40 degrees out. Now he makes a daily request to ride.Only negative was that I had to drill new holes on the WeeRide for the back bracket to fit on my bike. I can see this being a problem with anyone not capable or comfortable with making their own modifications. I still recommend this product to all and I can see the overall progress of this company's product and expect to see even better products in the future.*** Follow up ***Noticed the new set of holes on the back bracket on the new WeeRide Pics from their website. I believe the manufactures changes would now work perfectly with our bikes. Thanks for making the changes WeeRide."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommnt this!","review":"May not fit every bike! It didn't fit ours!

The Kangaroo centers his mass on the bicycle, which causes less disturbance when he shifts his weight, and gives us the opportunity to interact while riding so I'm aware of what he sees and I know when he is in discomfort, or when he needs to stop.Downsides:==========1. I have to make minor modifications to my riding style for my knees to clear his seat, but the inconvenience is minor.2. His feet can also reach the handlebar, which has potential to be dangerous if I'm not paying attention.3. The many people who stop us to ask where they can get one interrupt my ride"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to drill hole on one of the center bars","review":"You need 2 pairs of hands to attach this thing to the bike. We needed to drill a hole on one of the center bars so the 2 bars can be screwed together.If I knew this beforehand, I would have returned it in a heartbeat. However, we have already installed the 2 bars on the bike before we realized the lack of hole on one of the bars. Either we got a defective one or company who produces this does not have a quality inspection procedure.I would have given this product a zero star had it not been that my child absolutely loves to ride with me using this.For all of you reading this, get the i-bert-safety-seat available here on Amazon or on ebay. It's more expensive but a lot easier to install and more comfortable for the biker (this is according to a friend who bought the ibert.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had misgivings at first.","review":"when i first got it i was skeptical, because of the size i didn't expect it to fit my bike. but now i leave it attached unless i go into the store. my daughter approves by trying to steer the bike & often falling asleep. she also has been known to grab her helmet and try to take the bike out herself if i'm lagging.i deducted a star because my unit came incorrectly assembled. 5 stars otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Product","review":"Product is not as easy to install as some say. Definitely need two pairs of hands or a clamp to hold the bar in place while attaching it to the frame. We had to switch the front bolts with the rear (specialized mtn bike) as my seat post is thicker than most. I am 5-11 and my knees do not hit the seat (some people probably have their seat too low). The straps are hard to adjust especially with a fidgeting two year old. All in all we are happy with this product and we would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but cheaply made.","review":"The idea and design are great. However, it is very cheaply made of flimsy plastic. The bar is very strong and sturdybut the seat itself is not the best quality. I would neither buy again nor recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it and my son also love it.","review":"Despite of the negative review, I purchase it because I wanted the my son to come with me for the ride. This product is perfect for my bike which is a mountain bike with 26\\" wheel. It was very easy to install; thus it only took about 5 minutes to install. The only thing that is wrong with it, the part that hold the hand screw in place came off, but it is still usable. Just had to hold that part will screwing it to the bar. Other than that, I would still recommend it... If you don't remove the seat every time after riding, then there is no problem with the screw. Thus still give it 5 stars just for the product itself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for the price","review":"I just got back from dropping my 28 month old off at preschool - we rode the bike and he LOVES it. I feel much safer than if he was in the back. I am very tall, and have no problem with my knees hitting the seat, but like other reviewers I do have to splay my legs a wee bit to ride with the seat on it. I am in decent shape so hills aren't that bad - but I did get a workout! We have tons of bike trails around our house and a trailer would almost be too wide for them since they are about 1/2 the normal width. Once my older son gets his Trek 2 wheeler we're going to hit the trails. It works great though even when he's on his Trikester and we tool around the neighborhood. We are very close to a major commuter bike trail so we are all going to try it out on the next nice weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"My 13 month old enjoys this very much! We go on bike rides every opportunity we have! Highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone 5'-02\\" or shorter","review":"I thought this would be a great option since my twins were getting upset having to share the bike carrier. This was a disaster! I couldn't stabilize my bike when we stopped and almost fell over with one of my girls in the front carrier. I never read anything stating you should be a certain height, but the bar was a concern. Luckily we were only just out of the parking lot, so I walked the bike back home. I brought this right back to the store for a refund!The harness system bothered me too. It doesn't work like a car seat does. I had to stand them on their feet and wiggle them into the harness.I'm going to try one that hooks directly to the front of the bike. Great product if you're taller than me! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will not fit Schwinn Majestic!","review":"I have to give the seat 4 stars as I have yet to use it. My wife has a Schwinn Majestic but the Kangaroo will not fit - the frame on this bike curves up, which moves the support bar above the head tube (so it would attach to the handlebar stem, which the manual explicitly states NOT to do). No fault to WeeRide, I needed to get my own bike anyways so I'll make sure to get one that will work with the Kangaroo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We just got this and LOVE it! I have a 3yr old, who is actually too tall and too heavy for the seat by what is reccommended, but we were desperate. It actually works perfectly for her and me! We have a trailer as well, but the WeeRide is WAY easier! Having her in the center of the bike makes hills way easier. I had no problems balancing at all, just a little extra weight (better work-out!)Plus, I can see/hear her the whole time, so I have a better peace of mind. I do have to splay my legs a bit to pedal, but it does not interfere with my ability to ride. It fits better on my husband's bike than mine(we made it fit on mine), so be sure to check measurements before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept good but only for very young children","review":"This bike seat is sturdy and seems to be safe, but my 20 month old daughter, who is 39.5 inches tall (quite tall for her age), was already too tall for this seat, so I returned it. So this seat is for 6-18 month old children at best (or older if they are small), so if you get one, don't expect it to last for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Child seat.. my lill guy lovin it!!!","review":"no issuesinstallation simpleif you are huge (physically) then you might want to think about the knees hitting some part of the seat .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for children!","review":"Parents now have the opportunity to include their children on their bike rides. Great family time. Years back you could never see your kids without glancing behind you. Much more reassuring that your child is safe. My granddaughter gets a front row seat. She loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad we bought it","review":"This was fairly easy to install on my husband's mountain bike. Caveats are that the harness attaches in such a fashion that I was a little concerned about my 18 month old daughter's shoulders being able to slip out. There is no chest strap that narrows the harness over the chest since the buckle is down in the waist. However, that's a small detail. She seems pretty secure. The other issue is one that has already been brought up and is probably an issue with all of these styles of bike seats. When you peddle, you have to change how your legs move by splaying your knees out a little. This precludes it from being used for legitimate travel since it would be uncomfortable for longer or more demanding rides. A short ride around the block for the child's entertainment is just fine. That's why we bought it. My daughter absolutely loves it. She was VERY upset tonight when the ride was over and I took her out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat!","review":"Terrific product. Wish I had bought it 6 months earlier. Only thing I would change is a clip across the chest for the harness. THe shoulder straps have a tendency to slip off the shoulders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought this would be a perfect alternative to the caboose type carrier, but I was very disappointed. The straps are way too long for my child (and probably for most kids--my daughter is 22 lbs and 30 in. tall). The seat is almost exactly straight up so she was leaning forward making it uncomfortable. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weeeeeeee!","review":"Love this seat! It didn't take but 10 minutes to install and we have been using it ever since. My son (2 years old) can't get enough. It has been fun for me to get back into biking too after a long break. I have a women's mountain bike, installed just fine. Buy this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice idea, bad design","review":"The idea of placing the seat in front of the rider is a great one. However, once installed I realized that the bulk of the item prevented me from pedaling comfortably, as the insides of my knees kept rubbing against the outside of the seat. I tried adjusting the mounting brackets higher and lower to see if it could help, but neither made a difference. I am a male, 5'9\\", 185 lbs, and I installed the seat onto a mountain bike. I can only imagine others have experienced the same thing. I do not suggest buying this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but...","review":"I love this seat and so does my son. However, and it's a pretty important however, the harness straps really need to be longer. My son is 21months but he's pretty big for his age and the straps are already at their limit which also means they slip out of the buckle if not secured a by pin or tied. I'm going to have to replace them/extend them myself pretty soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accesories for the Wee Ride Seat","review":"Beware of the recommendations to order extra items ( like the mounting bar) upon your order - I am not sure if it is Amazon doing this or the WeeRide Company. It did come inlcuded with my bike seat AND then when I returned the mounting bar they of course credited me for a VERY small portion of the original price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was realy looking forward to using this as I'd prefer to have my son where I can see him. I was VERY disappointed. First, the seat is way too small. It says it can accomodate up to 40 lbs. My son is 25 lbs and just barely fits into it. It would never have lasted him more than 2 - 3 months. I've seen other reviews that have a similar complaint.Second, many bikes, including mine, have a handle bar shaft that rotates all the way to the base; therefore, you can't attach the seat on one end.The concept is great, the design of this seat is definitely not"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this Guy Here?","review":"This guy is too damn old to be in the rap game he should be trying to get out.

People who are conscientious about their physical health can start on a healthy diet, a healthy exercise program, and a healthy attitude toward life in their teens! Sometimes it might be too lete to correct all the mistakes one has made in one's earlier life by the time one reaches 65.

It's not too bad in the beginning, but it gets progressively harder and with no saves and no health, you're destined to play the level over and over and over and over and over and over again... Don't waste your money on it! Play a game that's better designed and fun to play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty great game","review":"Pretty fun.

You don't have to worry about saving the game because it saves by itself. it's not like Halo where all you do is kill it's more of a game where you have to find your way through life threatning obsticals. If you don't buy this game or don't even rent it you are very stupid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indy at his best","review":"All in all this is a good game. Great if you're an Indy fan likeme. I thought the locales were good and the size and detail of some of areas you explore is impressive. The fighting is verywell done and realistic. Bullets are a fairly rare commodity incetain stages so, you can't just blast your way though opponents.(Notice the sound effect of Indy's gun sounds just like the movies)I enjoyed the traps and especially the puzzles but, once you getthe hang of it, you figure things out fairly quickly.The voice acting is done very well and Indy's voice is closeto Harrison Ford. As a special note my girlfriend speaks Mandarinand she said the Chinese voice actors were right on. Accents andall. Hopefully, the Collective will do a follow up game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe-some!","review":"This is awesome! Here is a pretty vivid explanation.* It is 1935, and Indy must race against both the Nazis and the Asian crime syndicates to possess the legendary Heart Of The Dragon* Travel with Indy from the jungles of Ceylon to the underwater palaces of Istanbul to the violent streets of Hong Kong* With help from his beautiful partner Mei Ying, he'll use his whip and gun to avoid traps and survive street brawls & martial artist wars* Leap, swim, climb and punch your way through exotic locales as you survive an adventure just like the movies!Also here are some cheats.God mode:Hold L + R and press Up(2), Down, Up, A, X, A, B, Up, Down, Y, Start at the \\"Press Start\\" screen. Note: Use the D-pad. A song will confirm correct code entry. You will become invincible with unlimited ammunition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for starters...","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers about the problems with this game - not being able to save (very irritating if you die at the end of a level and have to start the whole thing again) and the game freezing at inopportune moments - although it was a relief to discover that it was the game and not my Xbox causing the problem...But despite all this, I still really enjoyed the game. The graphics are excellent - the controls easy to master and the music matched the action incredibly well. Indy really does look like and sound Harrison Ford and parts of the game are based on the actual movies which makes it fun as well. The die hard gamers seem to have found the game very frustrating with the issues that crop up, but if you're not too serious then this game can keep you happily occupied for hours - it did me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too sweet, and bad nutrition","review":"Although Glucerna seems to help avoid low blood glucose, it is sweet, sweet, sweet!

The tracks included are pop hits that the 5D had little to do with, and don't perform particularly well. The cover of \\"Respect\\" is downright embarrassing. A previous release (cassette only) of this material was issued in Holland and contained some interesting studio material from Florence and the Post-McCoo/Davis 5D....if you have that tape, note that NONE of this material appears in this release.

I've been told that these studio tracks are bootlegs, and never appeared on any \\"official\\" 5D album. Like the live tracks on both discs, sound quality is pretty poor, with bad stereo balance and more than a few sound dropouts.This disc isn't a complete waste of money, but if you're a big enough fan to be interested in these tame live performances, it would be worth your while to search out \\"Respect-Live\\" and pass on this CD.

The 90s was probably the worse era for horror and sci-fi films easily. A lot of those kind of movies from that era lack creativity and originality in a big way.

I started to watch it for the first time today and could barely take much more of it. Really bad acting, uninteresting charactors and flat \\"humor\\". This ranks as bad as the movie \\"Solar Crisis.\\" I've seen Treat Williams in others movies and he was sometimes pretty good. Someone told him how to act in this bomb, to turn on the supposedly witty, carefree, tough-guy act. It's unbareable to see. The supporting actors are all trying desperatly to raise the bar only to raise the embarassment level. It's overacting nonsense.I actually decided to watch it based on a review at the web site All movie .com. Three stars, and the word \\"gem\\" was mentioned! This is a 90s flick that cost mega-millions to make and no wonder I never really heard much about it. Have we been reduced to actually giving this sort of garbage a pass.

It has monsters in it, so therefore there's some lack of logic to some things. It's meant for entertainment, and it does its job very well. It's chock full of suspense and action, and some dark humor as well. It's not the best of all monster movies, but it still doesn't disappoint. The cast is good, too, though Kevin J O'Connor did seem to steal the show a bit too much. But other than that, this is an exceptionally entertaining monster movie. I give it a B+."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much-needed new attempt at the deep-sea terror genre!","review":"When I first went to see DEEP RISING, I have to admit that I had my doubts. I was proven wrong when it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite films!! The film is packed with great special effects and major action especially when the gigantic tentacled creature attacks and gorily munches on the cast! Absolutely astonishing, the film packs a wallop along with some clever humor. DEEP RISING is the first deep sea terror film in awhile, so it's a hip, much-needed shot at fun--and it succeeds at its goal. The carnivorous beast from the depths moves with such smoothness that you would swear it's real. Intensely terrifying, DEEP RISING is a film that no sci-fi or horror fan or collector should be without!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic Is Invaded evil worm-like aliens","review":"You must see Deep Rising. If you are a Sci-FI fan this is the hot tamale(though if you did not like Alien the movie I do not recommend this movie). The blood and gore is throughout the whole movie, so if your stomach is uneasy Deep Rising is not for you. A great action thriller about a boat driver who drives a bunch of theives to a Titanic like boat. But when the convicts arrive the find thal all the passengers had allready been robbed....of their lives. The rest is for you to find out. A must see Sci- Fi thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific fun- if you can recognize all the clichés!","review":"Deep Rising is one of the only ways a horror/thriller can really work- by being silly. All the characters are stereo-typed and self-kidding, and so is the movie. There is lots of dry humor in the face of certain death, and this makes the movie seem to surreal to be taken seriously. Which is a very good thing, because this is an extremely gory movie- but even that's not a bad thing because it's so clichéd! There are huge rooms filled with bloody skeletons, and a guy who is vomited up with half his face missing. But it doesn't really get to you (unless you're really squeamish) because it, like the movie, is so OVER-THE-TOP."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad monster movie","review":"The story is just \\"monster eats up almost everyone on the boat, and some bravely escaped from it and destroyed it with a big explosion).

Blunty, it's a rehash of of the old corny \\"monster at sea\\" movies. Nothing suprised me, except for a couple of impressive special effects. And did anyone mention plausability?

The plot was non-existent and the acting - oh my god! with a guy called 'Treat' I guess we should have guessed! it was cheesy line after cheesy line, rather than a \\"fine wine\\" he was more like a cheap bottle of Boone's Farm that made you want to hurl in the sink!If you have to watch this, we recommend you have a drink or two (hell, drink the whole bottle!) at least to numb the pain! Oh yeah, and amazingly Treat's hair quif remains perfectly intact after being underwater and everyone else is drenched - oh dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad in a bad way","review":"The studios make lots of trash that gets buried in unmarked graves, showing up on local channels with lots of commercial interruptions (but showing the same couple of commercials over and over), leading us to wonder, \\"was this movie ever in theatres?\\" This movie is just bad. It is very suspicious that this unremarkable bad movie should attract so many reviews, and that they are overwhelmingly positive. There are a few inexpensive special effects created with care (the ocean liner model that gets blown up, the computer graphic tentacle monster). The monster is an extremely slithery version of the alien in Alien, you know, it opens an orifice in what is supposed to be its head and then there's another head (or whatever). Every time the creature bursts into a room, it looks the same. The riding around on the jet ski in the boat at the end is some terrible low budget movie making. Not a classic bad movie, but bad enough to regret wasting time watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COOLEST HORROR / ACTION MOVIE EVER","review":"Beat this Deep Blue Sea! This movie was the coolest movie I've seen since ID4. I was surprised by Treat William, and how cool he was despite the fact that he hasn't been in a big time action movie. The special effects are enough to keep you watch. It's neat to watch these monster sliding down the hallway of a 'Titanic size ship. The plot isn't close to being complicated which is why this movie was called a B-grade film, but it is very entertaining and that is what a movie is surpose to be. I've considered myself as a pretty taugh guy when it comes to horror movies but I found myself asking the TV to skipe to the next scene, but in this movie the next scene wasn't any prettier. If you just sitting around with nothing to do then you should go out and rent this."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it","review":"this movie was great in my opinion. it had good special effects average acting about the right lenght, good storyline. the only problem i have with this movie is the end. they just get done with destroying the alligators and then at the end there on a island with some other monster. but still is a watchable movie. i would just rent however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lights, camera...NOOP - ACTION!","review":"HIIYAA! This movie is made for us who like non-stop action. Thers a simple but smart storyline and great visual and sound effects. Not recommended to people who cant stand blood and gore.

Replay value: High"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie really scared me","review":"When I watch a monster/horror movies I want to be scared. This movie does just that. It's not the most original story but it is great fun to watch. It builds the tension from the very first and gets scarier and more gory as the story progresses. You really have no idea what the monster really is until the classic scene where the hero confronts it. The special effects are excellent(expected) and original(rare). The movie is visually beautiful and the soundtrack is very good. I would like to have seen more development of the love interest between the two characters but that is not the reason you see a movie like this. Shakespere in Love this is not.

This really bumms me out because I love the look and feel of the watch. Another big problem is the lack of backlighting. It's impossible to see in the dark and the glow-in-the-dark paint on the hands and number markers stops glowing after about 20 min. I know that some watches have glow paint that lasts for hours. This watch needs it. I could live with the lighting problem but I can't live with the paint/plating wearing off under normal circumstances. It changes the look from classy to cheap. I've only had the watch for a week and you can see the brass on the band. I will have to return it. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"This watch looks great in the picture on my digital screen, but when I received it and tried it on it looks awsom.

The last time, the watch shop screwed it up. So, I was familiar with the way this watch works. It does not have a light (niether did th old one) so it's tough to see the digital portion at night or in a darkend area. If you are a pilot, or in the aviation industry and use UTC time, this watch comes in very handy as there is a dial on the face that tracks UTC time. It's slightly heavier than the older versions, but I figure that's due to the Eco-Drive. Overall, I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable or reliable","review":"I am about to send this watch back for the third time in about 2 years. 1st time, watch would not zerorize (digital time constantly off analog time). Second time analog hands wouldn't even match up to zerorize, came back with new chip but lower mode dial not quite centering. Then the mode dial fell off a few months later, so now it's on it's third trip back. Not sure if I would invest in the steel clasp -- pins seem to have bent a bit and the black wears off the casing.I am a professional pilot and bought this watch to wear everyday, but I don't think it's durable enough to be worn by actual pilots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good read","review":"I read the book in about three days and I gotta say I was not let down.

They try to explain everything in a scientific way. It's very clear that Bible believing Christians did not have a hand in creating these programs. For instance, they want you to think that Paul who was one of the New Testament's greatest apostles (The Apostle to the Gentiles) was mentally ill. They compare him to an epileptic who he sees things and NEVER actually speaks to GOD. For instance Paul never actually saw the resurrected Christ when he was on the way to Damascus. He just thought he saw him. He was struck by lightning. That's why he was blind for 3 days. If you believe in God please save your money and don't buy this series. All of my friends are Christians.

It's a minor detail, it wouldn't stop me from ordering it necessarily, but I'd really like them to use a regular mouthwash cap. The mouthwash itself is as advertised.

If your tower is on the floor, this cable isn't long enough to make it to a standard desktop. After putting my tower on a stack of wood to elevate it, it still had no signal.

In addition to being difficult to use, it contains numerous bugs. The program will crash repeatedly, even with the most current computer equipment and video drivers. Worst of all, it has a tendency to crash and produce an irretrievably \\"corrupt\\" file when a plan has gotten large and detailed. This then prevents that file from ever being used, and it cannot be reversed. This happened to this review's writer after having invested over two weeks of work on a landscape design.

The 'handles' used to shape terrain, ponds, etc. often do not work and you can not work within a grid when laying out the terrain so you have no idea where the hills are in relation to the house. Building the house is very confusing because of the way the program has set up 'levels' for the house. Sometimes you see the house, sometimes you only see the fence, sometimes you can modify existing structures, other times you can not. Definitely not a user friendly system. Also, the plants are mislabeled: an iris is labeled as a clematis, a verbena is labeled as a stokesia, the same photo is used to portray two aster varieties, etc. As far as I know, you can not make a plant cascade over a wall. I could go on....The technical support people do not answer emails and the help phone number is computerized; I waited for 15 minutes and then hung up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Clumsy, unstable program.

Often it is impossible to delete items that have been improperly placed. This product is NOT ready for sale. It needs a lot more work to remove all the bugs. This is an extremely fustrating and time consuming adventure, with very poor results. Further, the advertised \\"see your landscape in different seasons\\" doesn't work.

I did like the 'arial' view that allows you to zoom over and around your plot and view plants in 3-D from all angles. I also liked the plant library to lookup and research basic information on plants.

The package came with a decent users manual and a small tutorial to get me started but don't expect to import a picture of your house and yard and start throwing shrubs and flowers into it. You'll have to cut sections of walls from a photo of your house, and remove obstacles such as tree limbs hanging in the photo and resize them to fit sections of walls on the house that you made inside the program. The complete yard will have to be constructed from scratch inside the program unless you want to use one of theirs. I was also surprised not to find the standard privacy fence and chain link fence in the fence section among other things. I keep going back to it and trying to give it another chance but the lag just kills me. On the upside.

There is no way a professional software company would release a product with this many bugs in it. You have to save your work constantly to multiple backup files, since the program simply crashes and exits without so much as an error message displayed. It does things that are totally weird. I added a single fence section to the yard and it deleted the entire house. There a bugs throughout. It's hard to believe that whoever authorized release of this software at Broderbund actually used the product themselves. They were probably given a demo by a developer or a product manager who was under the gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for...","review":"The product is good for very simple ideas; however, more detailed ideas such as raised flower beds, various fencing, and plants are not located in the software or are not available.

Most of the time, the listener doesn't appreciate all of the music on the disc, and also, doesn't appreciate soundbites from the film, unless, like me, they are completely in love with the movie.

Cord is too short. Non stick surface is false advertisement as far as I'm concerned as everything stuck to the top plate with the tenacity of a good superglue. The design is good in theory because the top plate doesn't have to touch the food, but even though it's too hot for direct contact, it's not hot enough for cooking when locked into the bracket for broiling. Furthermore, because of the hinge design, when you can manage to clean stuck food off of the top surface, it falls down through an opening between the two plates onto your countertop. I've used Foreman grills for years and was willing to put up with the inadequacies of the cheaper models based on the low price, but even buying this one on sale I paid too much. Unfortunately I will soon be adding it to the local landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"G Foreman grill","review":"used this a couple of times & no more.... it does not have enough power to create the seared/broiled effect & taste. also it is too small for all the cleanup trouble.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Pain to Clean","review":"What a pain to clean this thing.

I was looking for a grill with removable plates, but decided on this one after reading several reviews. I have the smaller one and like the way it cooks. I am more concerned with how it cooks than how it is cleaned. I used the cleaning suggestion of putting a couple of wet (but not dripping) paper towels on the grill and closing it immediately after cooking is finished. Works great. No scrubbing just wiping.

Surefire says the bulbs should last about 30 hours depending on how they are used. The 225 lumen bulb on my M3 lasted through about 2 or 3 sets of batteries over the course of a year. Batteries last about 20 minutes with that bulb, so I guess I got maybe an hour of use out of it? That bulb is about $30. I was kind of annoyed about that.

It is a great fantasy journey through the modern landscape of America. The wife's journey is a secondary story, but equally compelling. Imaginative made-up contemporary gods, some cool, some a little silly, and that's where the book fell a little for me. The last battle between the gods, with the surviving old gods present, seemed a little odd or weird, (but not in a good way in my head as I read it). But that may just be me, not the story.

The characters are great and so likeable. I like Emma who is strong and stands up for herself. I like the little girl which surprised me. The romance is great.

Anyone familiar with Giacchino's music for ALIAS or his score for Pixar's The Incredibles knows he has a flair for writing music appropriate to this genre. He also does a great job of incorporating some familiar themes from the original Mission: Impossible TV series. Sure, some of it is vaguely derivative (of his own work), but it works for the movie and it's also exciting to listen to on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for drying sponges, etc","review":"To prevent cross contamination I like to have at least 3 different sponges on hand.

MISLEADING ADD!!","review":"I bought this almost three weeks ago and it took forever for them to ship it out to begin with and to get here!!I pull it out of the box and go to place it on my sink counter-top and i am shocked because after waiting for so long its not even as described! The front part slants forward a bit so from the height being 7 5/8 in the back which would have been fine your left with either not being able to use your levered faucet or every time you do try and use it everything you have on the shelf falls off or behind it!!!!So i contact them so i can return it and they never even bothered to write back! So i opened an Amazon claim and 3 days later i receive an e-mail from Amazon asking me to return it with me paying return shipping and i will only get refunded the item price not even the shipping i paid for it when ordered originally (its not free because its not sold directly from Amazon).Very disappointed with this \\"company\\" and Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"scooby doo and the phantom of the knight disappoints","review":"As a person with considerable experience at the computer, I was diasppointed in this game.

The box says \\"kids can play independently. Provides help when your child needs it.\\" This is completely untrue.

The help section just tells you what to do with characters, mazes, and games that you can't get to. It was no help whatsoever. I hope this review saves someone a purchase.

The only thing that really changes is the villan and the clues.The kids have played once, with helpful hints from me to get them going when they got stuck. They havent been back which dosent surprise me as they tend not to replay games that do not have some varability.It could have been a great game as it has the difficulty but without varibility it is not as good as it could be.Solving the villian and clues does not play a big enough part in the game to make it replayable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very skeptical of the good reviews","review":"Awful packaging.

Most people get the impression from \\"nightfall....\\" that Blind Guardian is a big, bombastic band. Very untrue for any fan who has heard earlier material (\\"follow the blind\\", \\"battalions of fear\\", \\"tales from the twilight world\\"). What we have always cared about was the uniqueness of Hansi's voice and the insane soloing (which really isn't that difficult). BG has always been a \\"fun\\" band with some really emotional stuff. Well now that is gone, the bombastic choruses on thsi album destroy any uniqueness in Hansi's voice. The solos are what we've heard on every other Blind Guardian album and the lyrics are strangely silly....Nothing memorable on this album, this album only gets two stars because of \\"precious jerusalem\\". This was the only tune worth listening to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a night at the opera","review":"Let me start this review with the following qualifier.I am not a rabid fan of this band. I have thought the threeprevious albulms to be excellent, but I don't give thisrelease the same amount of praise. There is way to much orchestration and 'noise' going on for my taste.The musicianship is as good as you could possibly ask for,but I don't think the songwriting keeps up.Yes it is a departure in some ways for them, but not a stepforward I am dissapointed to say.Not in the same category as Nightfall on Middle earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spoof on heavy metal?","review":"I purchased this CD based on some amazing reviews I have read for this record. The first thing that came to my mind upon listening to this was Spinal Tap. Is this some sort of heavy metal spoof or joke? I will admit that the musicianship on this record is quite astonishing and there is no doubt that there is talent in this band, but this just sounds like fire and brimstone power metal. I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for years, and this band is no Iron Maiden. Iron Maiden has an addictive quality to their music, which is sorely lacking in Blind Guardian. The only addictive trait to Blind Guardian is what I perceive as the band's sense of humor.I enjoyed some of the riffs on this record and if this was simply an instrumental record I would have given it 4 stars. As it stands however, the lyrics, lead vocals and choir backup leads me to believe that this band is hamming it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"catchy\\".","review":"I give this album two stars because the band members are so talented. My overall opinion of this album is not very high. I have never heard anything else by Blind Guardian; I listen mostly to heavier stuff. The musicians do have a lot of talent which draws me from giving this one star but a lot of the songs are just too \\"catchy\\" for my tastes. For example, I never owned any Iron Maiden albums but Bruce Dickinson has a great voice. I like to hear vocals done in an aggressive way. Hansi isn't that bad a singer but this is much lighter than what I normally go for. Just listen to something like \\"Precious Jerusulam\\" to see what I'm talking about. \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\" is perhaps a little more interesting but still I prefer my music heavier. Click on my username to see what I am into if you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Guardian's newest release is here...","review":"Blind Guardian is one of the most talented bands I've ever heard. Their metal expertise in the field of power metal is unrivalled. The German group's latest CD is not their best, but it certainly is one of the best CDs ever nonetheless. Blind Guardian's new CD has many great songs, but my favorites have to be 'Battlefield', 'Under the Ice' and 'And Then There was Silence'.'And Then There was Silence' is a spectacular 14 minute song that never repeats itself and leaves you breathless at the end. This CD is an absolute must if you like Power Metal, or any type of metal for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improving Perfection","review":"Power metal band Blind Guardian has done what few other bands can do. They have diversified their style without losing the aspects that made them great in the past. The new album combines true power with soaring melodies. If you're already a fan of Blind Guardian, then this album needs no introduction. If you aren't, then prepare yourself for a musical experience unlike any you will find with other bands. Expert musicianship and perfectionist-like detail has gone into every song. With every listen, you will enjoy this album more and more. Whether you enjoy speed (and the album is plenty fast) or melody (and the album has plenty of harmony) then you will greatly appreciate Blind Guardian's excellent ability to blend these two so that no one aspect outweighs the others. If you are looking for a band that lifts themselves above the status quo, then you will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Power Metal","review":"Blind Guardian's are the leader of power metal, and a night at the opera is one of their best albums. Its a bit over the top, but in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is amazing","review":"This is one of the best CD's ever. It combines powerful electric guitar solos and a full orchestra on almost every song, along with the beautiful, strong voice of Hansi Kursch, often overlapped several times to produce a choral sound. And of course the fact that it includes the most epic song of all time, And Then There was Silence, helps a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"THis singer....","review":"First of all, I think it's absurd for a band to release an album featuring a title identical to Queen's absolute masterpiece, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.Second, even liking Blind Guardian a lot, I had enough of Hansi Kursch harsh adn full of acent vocals. It's simply unbearable for me nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the pain!!","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer from Aug. 5,2002, Rand Al-Thor. I could have written that myself with only two exceptions;1) I didn't hear the bonus track that actually had real singing as I couldn't get past the fifth track without cringing in near agony over the auful and overbearing vocals (kind of like those senes from Star Trek where everyone on the bridge is covering there ears and falling to the floor - they must have had this disc on).2)I have never heard anything from Blind Guardian before this one, so I have no frame of reference to any past work. Doubtful I ever will after this mess.I do so agree with him also about the drunken, disorderly croud noise. That is the first thing I thought when I first played this CD.

The solos are okay, but the levels are way too low to realy catch it with all the rest of the song noise going on.... The guitars in no way even come close to what Jason Becker and Marty Friedmen are playing.All in all this is the worst CD i've ever purchased.Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Night at The Opera Rocks\\"","review":"This is the first c.d. I ever listened to from Blind Guardian. I am impressed with this band. They have a unique and awesome sound that sets them apart form any band you try to compare them with. This band is not your typical Metal band, with sensless lyrics and pure screaming. Thet have much more controlled vocals and the band overall has exceptional skill. If your not into the pure death metal vocals but still like the heavy music, this band is perfect for you, and this is some of Blind Guardians best work. If your interested in other bands of this type of metal style, you shoyld check out Iced Earth, Nightwish, Demons and Wizards, or Iron Maiden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lithium Ion batteries","review":"These are not Lithium Ion batteries.

In fact, Simon hasn't sounded this relaxed in years. Unlike Rhythm of the Saints, YTO isn't an overachiever album. Simon displays both his melodic gift and lyrical wit in a selection of strong tracks. It's as if Simon always the restless wanderer seems comfortable in his own skin.Like John Lennon's last album (Double Fantasy) Simon has come to terms with the public persona that eminated from Graceland. Because he has nothing to prove, Simon displays a wealth of observations about himself and those around him. This isn't Simon's best album (Graceland wasn't either for that matter), but what it lacks in earthshaking change it makes up for in warmth."},{"rating":"1","title":"It grows on you--like a fungus.","review":"No, seriously. You may like this or you may not, but I can't understand the people urging you to listen to it ten times or more. It's a guy who proved incontravertably in \\"One Trick Pony\\" (the movie) that he can't convincingly declaim a line TALKING. Trust me: even if you love it at first (or second, third, or fourth), you don't want to hear it ten times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I'm out about 15 bucks, so maybe I can save someone the same fate. As long-time fans of Paul Simon, my wife and I bought this CD with high expectations. We've listened to it several times, once in the car during a painfully long stretch of highway where we were determined to find a reason to like it, but unfortunately, it just ain't there. The melodies don't seem go with the choruses which don't go with the rhythms which don't go with the lyrics which all makes for an ugly music stew in our heads. Now, maybe we're very musically unsophisticated, but we know good stuff/bad stuff. Despite other reviewers' suggestions of listening till you like it, that's not something you should have to endure. Pleasure should be immediate and apparent. I could probably learn to like having my teeth drilled if I did it continually. No, download the free sample, decide for yourself, and ultimately, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I am afraid I have to agree with \\"Disappointing\\" (October 5) and \\"It Hurts Me To Write This\\" (October 4). This CD has GREAT instrumental work, but the song lyrics are the weakest of any Paul Simon work. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist rewarding repeated listening","review":"So is it any good? My friend asked. I had only listened to it once in the car, so I said: Yeah, I think so... Now I'm more sure: This is pure vintage Simon. There's a jewel hidden in each track and I love every song on \\"Your're the one\\". The songs are timeless and very rythmically complex - maybe the reason for being a bit difficult to get a grip on at first. Listen and learn. There's more going on in one Pauls Simon-song than on most whole albums by other singer-songwriters. The songs work very well live - I had the pleasure of seing Paus Simon with his band in Stockholm a few weeks ago. By the way: I also think that the Capeman is a wonderful album, and will absolutely try to see the musicalin London - if rumoured plans are fulfilled..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon has lost his touch...","review":"When an artist as popular as Paul Simon takes an ten year hiatus from releasing a proper studio album (disregarding the 1997 debacle \\"Songs from the Capeman\\"), you expect the new release to be near perfect. Unfortunately, Simon doesn't deliver. To deliver the lyrical punch of his latest album, it seems that Simon apparently stole a third-grader's rhyming dictionary. On \\"Old,\\" Simon's preachy three-chord ode to God himself apparently, he rhymes such classics as \\"old\\", \\"mold\\", \\"cold\\", and \\"sold.\\" Brilliant. Simon has left behind the accessible and interesting songs of yore and opted to offer the listener a disjointed collection of songs that trudge along with no clear direction or variation. The songs on \\"You're the One\\" are pleasant enough if you're using them for background music, just don't think about them too hard or they'll drive you nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the One","review":"I had a funny thought when I was listening to this severely disappointing album: this is actually the first truly mediocre release from Paul Simon in a recording career that has now spanned nearly 40 years. But there's simply no denying that YOU'RE THE ONE is riddled with weak, and occasionally shockingly bad, material. For every solid, affecting tune like \\"Hurricane Eye\\" there's a clumsy embarrassment like \\"Pigs, Sheep, and Wolves\\" to kill the momentum. And the list of horrors doesn't stop there: the title track is pedestrian; \\"Darling Lorraine\\" can't decide if it wants to be cute or epic (and so it settles for being a cute epic, which is just as bad it sounds, believe me); and \\"Old\\", with it's lyrics lifted straight from the Born Again Cheerleaders Handbook, sounds like Pat Robertson gettin' the funk out. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Paul Simon Album Ever!!","review":"Horrible. This is the word that I kept muttering to myself as I listened to the new Paul Simon album. As I was buying \\"You're The One\\" I had visions of \\"Graceland\\" dancing through my head. That is, I believe, one of the best albums I've ever heard. It sounds as great today as it did fifteen years ago. His follow up, \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\", was also very good. But whatever you do, don't go expecting his new one to be anywhere in the same ballpark as those two. That was my mistake and I couldn't have been more disappointed. There's not one song that has a memorable melody. The songwriting is weak to say the least. And that half singing/half speaking thing he does is incredibly annoying. He's done it only sparingly in the past so it's never bothered me that much, but he does it way too much on this album. If he just wants to read bad poetry than he needs to go ahead and do that. That way the rest of us who prefer music can save our money and skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"aging,growing,living and dying","review":"four days ago, I was ready to review this as a very dissapointing album...I am a staunch Paul Simon fan, and after two listenings I went to amazon. I saw I was the first review and decided that I couldn't let Paul have a bad first review. Then I listened again....and again...and again. What was I thinking? How could I be so foolish? This is a wonderful piece. I don't think it is always accessible...Paul isn't the most accessible artist....I don't think it is always brilliant...but it is art. It dares to be different...to be quiet...to be expressionistic in a world of to the point crap. This is the heartbeat of our quietest genius, the expression of aging, growing, living and dying. I agree that some of the talk singing is annoying, and some of it is a little less than inspired...but we should revere the artist that dares to write the unwriteable. So listen....again and again....it will grow in you, and age, and live but probably not die for awhile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Small Potatoes From a Musical Landmark","review":"After the intoxicating experimentation of \\"Graceland\\" and the sorrowful poetry of \\"The Capeman\\", \\"You're the One\\" gives us quiet meditative songs that are pleasant enough. Unfortunately, none of the tunes--with the exception of the charming \\"old\\"-- speak eloquently about missigivings within relationships and personal needs that are Simon's hallmark. This album will leave you with a puzzled frown on your face and dissapointed expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the One","review":"This is weak, weak stuff. Poorly recorded vocals over lushly produced rhythm tracks. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen just once","review":"Paul Simon is/was a genius. But on the first take, I was disappointed by this album. I was ready to put it aside and move on. But, giving him the benefit of a doubt, I came back to it. By the 4th play I was hooked. There is a lot here; not the immediately compelling rhythms of Graceland or the transparent grace of Rhythm of the Saints or accessible poetry of Hearts and Bones, BUT: some really fine songs and musicianship, if you give it time and a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older and Wiser and Just as good as ever!","review":"I love this CD! I think it has a warmth about it, that to me shows, a side of Paul Simon I hadn't noticed before. I think that it has an \\"undertone\\" to it that is not trying to be a major platinum-selling success, just a writer expressing himself. I think that Simon always tries to experiment and he has done so in this CD as well, with \\"Sheep, Wolves and Pigs\\". For me, I think it is about his coming to terms with himself, and maybe mortality. I really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Drawing Me Back","review":"I have listened to the CD and like it better on each listening. Great rhythmes, great guitar work, Steve Gadds percussive work is wonderful. Whenever I play this CD, it stops me from doing whatever I was doing and causes me to just sit back and listen again"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, for all that","review":"We keep encountering people who refer to \\"You're the One\\"'s \\"beautiful melodies\\". Well, if rap has influenced this record, it's probably influenced reviewers too. A generation has grown up eating cardboard and calling it bread. In fact, there is scarcely any melody at all on this record, beautiful, plain, or ugly. This is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of knowing what the word \\"melody\\" means. It doesn't mean any combination of sounds that might happen to appeal to you in any way or by any means (through force of repetition, for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not his best","review":"I am a longtime Paul Simon fan and have a hard time disliking any of his work. (However, I'm not a big fan of his last CD -- Songs for the Capeman.) I really like several of the songs on this disc, especially \\"Old\\" and the title track. This disc is well worth the money, but if you're looking for the best of Paul Simon's \\"modern\\" discs, get 1983's \\"Hearts and Bones\\" and 1990's \\"Rhythm of the Saints\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps getting better","review":"Paul has managed to do it again! After some amazing past albums, he has found yet another genre to succeed in. The great motion and power of songs like \\"Look at This\\" and \\"Peaceful as a Hurricane\\", along with his typical phenominal lyric writing has made this an instantly enjoyable work. \\"You're the One\\" is an album created for doing. You'll find yourself tapping your foot if not jumping up and dancing. It has made a strong campaign for a slot on my top favorite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow beauty","review":"Paul Simon is a master craftsman, and we find him having some fun on this odd collection of songs. The multicultural percussion is still here, as well as a very light touch in all the instrumentation sounds. There are moments of great beauty and poignancy. Be it said, however, that this album will not be viewed in retrospect as one of Simon's best achievements. (There's no shame in that, since his best achievements are incredible, but I feel the need to let you know not to expect overmuch. This is a more homespun little effort.) Here he relies on occasionally wandering melodies (a la Joni Mitchell) and more simple rhymes. A few tracks (such as \\"Pigs, Sheep, Wolves\\") are downright bizarre, but give the man credit for doing whatever he damn well feels like and not worrying about being overly commercial. It's always been one of his strengths. If you want a mellow album, there have been no better ones this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't call it a comeback...","review":"A decade on from Rhythm of the Saints, Paul Simon has returned with You're the One to reinstate himself once again as one of Americas foremost singer songwriters. The album is a welcome return to Simon's wry, witty and at times introspective songcrafting and goes some way to make up for his ill conceived Songs From the Capeman. At 59, Paul Simon's voice is as pure and delicate as it's ever been on this record. Borrowing in equal measure from his varying styles over the last four decades, the album flows along at a nice pace, with each consecutive listen revealing a few more pleasant surprises than the last. I wish Paul Simon every success with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"This is Simon's least compelling album since Graceland. And Graceland was great because of the African musicians on it more than Simon's songs. Simon's trend toward an intorpsective, conversational style has resulted in songs that seem so contrived and private that it's hard to imagine that they'd be of interest to anybody but Simon himself. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long Wait For Very Little","review":"This effort is a big dissapointment. It does does not approach any of Mr. Simon's better work. The instrumentation is sparce and uninspired. The vocals are forgettable and the songs are not ones you will be humming in a week, forget a month or two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Disappointing","review":"I've listened to it several times and if not for the voice I'd swear this guy was an imposter. Did some record exec. find Simon's throw-aways and decide to publish them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"tepid - the decline of lyrics the absence of mirth","review":"This review is difficult to write as I revere Paul Simon as a true musical genius and one of the greatest artists of this generation. Always inventive, with haunting melodies and thoughtful poetic lyrics; sadly, this gathering of songs is his worst.Mournful, the collection appears to be a resignation (not celebration) of the aging process. Tepid rythmns, a fading guitar. The only way to recognize this as a compliation of Paul Simon is his still true voice.I wanted so much for this album to be inventive and spiced with a little humor and find the rythmns we've grown to expect. Mr Simon's music has always inspired me. But this collection is close to a durge.Like a baseball player continuing past his prime, this is a sad thing to \\"watch\\", The inspiration is gone. There goes rhymin' Simon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Simon","review":"As one of Simon's biggest fans, I was disappointed in his latest work. \\"You're the One\\" is a collection of sub-Simon songs that carry neither the passion nor the poetic verse that made Simon one of the masters of songwriting. This album would be better named \\"Simple Simon\\" as there is no depth to the lyrics - no verses that awaken the inner spirit in quiet reflection; nothing that touches the soul. There are no memorable songs from this album, and none that I care to listen to. But Simon has had other forgettable works that were followed by masterpieces. After \\"Capeman\\" and \\"You're the One,\\" he's due."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't need to listen again","review":"With all due respect to those suggesting I listen to this album again and again, I'm doubtful I will come to love songs I so loathed on first listening. I am a HUGE Paul Simon fan, and thus it comes as a big disappointment that his songs on this album are so stale, and his lyrics so predictable and mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than disappointing!!!!","review":"I thought that Paul Simon would maintain a good taste in music even after leaving Garfunkel, but it turns out that he hasn't lost anything except the definition of music. All I hear in these songs is a monstrous amount of different instruments all crashing together from different angles while each plays a different note. Purely disappointing and too far away from deserving any interest. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I want to like this CD. I was looking forward to it after his disasterous Capeman, but there just isn't much here. One of the most boring CDs since some of James Taylor's latest efforts. His decline continues... Paul, do you have a good album left inside of you?? After the last few really bad albums he has delivered, I'm afraid the answer may be no... sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Salvador Agron to making us groan","review":"I'm another of those who has enjoyed Paul Simon's work for a long time, so I was anxious to hear this latest CD. After making myself listen to it several times, all I can say is \\"Huh?\\". These songs range from OK (That's where I belong, Senorita, Old) to bad (Lorraine, Pigs Sheep & Wolves) to incomprehensible (the Teacher) to unlistenable (Quiet). The only positive thing I can find here is some of the instumental work is nice. But, those lyrics! I'd much rather hear about the Girl from New York City who calls herself a human trampoline than the frog in South America whose venom is an antidote for pain. (Hey, did I just make a rhyme there?) I hope this isn't Paul Simon's last album, as it would be a poor coda to an otherwise great body of work.
