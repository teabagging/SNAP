Gael Baudino exposes the hipocracy of the Church and the damage caused by the Papal schism on one hand; and the beauty and power,of unconditioal love and positive thought on the other. I found myself recalling the words of Martin Armstrongs poem \\"The Gage\\" (Man afraid to be alive shuts his soul in senses five).

Number 1 the Church needed change to keep up with the times. Change is good and most members agree with the changes. The Masons did not do anything. The Church leaders did. The bad issues in the news such as sex abuse also had nothing to do with the Masons. If people just looked with an open mind you would see that the church needed to better screan their Preisthood. Looking to blame the Masons does nothing but take responsibilty away from church leadership. The book in question is mostly hate speach. After reading it and looking at each side and historians the work is just hate. Hate groups use works like this and often use God to justify such actions. The Masons are open to any good man regaurdless of faith.

What a disapointment! The main strength of Streetwise is the integration of Streets and Subways. But Streetwise Brooklyn actually leaves off some subway stations! Ever try to mark up a laminated map to add a stop? Doesn't work, and neither does this map. And the north/south split just doesn't work for Brooklyn. Also, the trains to Brooklyn changed when the Manhattan bridge re-opened to subway traffic, so where's a new edition?

The cover fit perfectly, with the elastic bottom almost able to cover both tires (it leaves about 1-2\\" of tire visible near the ground). The elastic around the bottom is very strong, you almost don't need to use the strap that connects the two sides under the bike. The material is much higher quality than other covers i've owned, a much thicker, stronger material with no fading so far. The bike sat outside for three weeks with this cover on it, during the wettest christmas season in the san francisco bay area in years, and the bike stayed perfectly dry, the cover not moving an inch.I would highly recommend this cover over anything sold by the motorcycle stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Material and Excellent Fit","review":"I've been using this cover for almost a month. The material is surprisingly thick (compared to my previous covers) and impermeable. It fits my Suzuki DL650 perfectly. Because of the fully elasticized bottom, the cover is a challenge to get on at first; but with a little practice it goes on easily--and stays on well. This is the best cover I've ever owned and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a smolder, but not Burning Bright in my opinion","review":"I picked this up with high hopes of a book as good as The Girl with the Pearl Earring, and I was disappointed. For a novel set in the 1790's, there were no clues that transported me to that time, and the whole book lacked any 'umph' ... I completely missed the point about William Blake as he was never made out to be a major player in the book and it seemed more of a story of childhood self discovery between Jem and Maggie. The back cover of the book promised so much that was not delivered that I kept rereading it to see if it could give me clues as to what I was waiting for. Not a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Period Piece","review":"I loved it. The historical detail makes this well worth reading.Maggie Butterfield is one of those characters who stay in your mind forever. Street-smart and brassy, she knows the underside of London. She's one of those poor kids who manages to wiggle into the front of the crowd and grab for herself a free seat from where she is able to take it all in and learn from it.Maggie and the Kellaway family are the main characters in this, another of Tracy Chevalier's grand books, highly-detailed adventure. Blake is relegated to a secondary role, one that offers few clues to how he bacame the person he was, someone ahead of his time, a thinker, a man caught up in the events on the Continent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe - not so much","review":"I did not love this book - I loved \\"Girl with Pearl Earring\\" because it was well researched - provided good detail on the historical period and life of the artist Rembrandt van Rijn. This story - while mildly amusing, lacks all of what made \\"...Pearl Earring\\" interesting. The historic period detail was lacking, there was little information actually about William Blake (In fact, he was more of a supporting character who was trying desperately to be a lead character, but wasn't really making it.), and I did not find the lives of the main characters all that engaging. If you have limited reading time,I recommend you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Watercolor/Far from a Poem","review":"Not worth the time. There is little plot or story line other than the author tries to paint a word picture of rural England and London in Blake's time, but ends up with a lot of fog and Blake a dim drab shadow in the background. The author never seems to grasp the genius and passion of Blake's poetry or the depth of his involvement and horror over in the collaterial damage that tortured so many craftsmen and those rural people who tilled the land -- all caught in the maw of the English Industrial Revolution and the bloddy undertow from the French Revolution. If you are interested in Blake and the world in which he lived, it is better to spend your time and money on Jacob Bronowski's book: A Man Withjout a Mask : William Blake 1757 - 1827 -- now in used book sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all it seems","review":"Like Chevalier's other books, this is good historical fiction, taking place in England more than 100 years ago. The book addresses taboo subjects, youth and innoncence lost, friendship, mourning and poverty. There are elements of joy and sorrow, mixed in with some cruelty and hope. I can honstly say I learned new terms and concepts after reading the book, as some of the language is not used in today's world. The main characters are easy to like and root for, as they face some harsh realities of their worlds. Like most of her books, I recommend Burning Bright fairly confidently. This is not a one night read, but rather a book that is worth savoring over many days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Tracy Chevalier's better books","review":"I've read every book by Tracy Chevalier and loved each of them. I was so happy to find out she had a new release,\\"Burning Bright\\". Sorry to say, the book is not as good as Ms. Chevalier's others. The story is dull and doesn't go anywhere. Only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is that Ms. Chevalier does an excellent job of bringing the 1792 time period to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent book...","review":"Like others have said, not as good as her previous books. In fact, I only bought it because she wrote it- had it been by another author, I'd have not even looked at it twice. I read it in a day and a half, so it moves pretty fast. Unlike what I read in other reviews, I don't feel the characters were \\"stock characters.\\" In fact, I found them to be complicated, believable, and incredibly human. It was the events of the book that seemed to be slow rather than the characters. The ending, while not disappointing, was not quite satisfying upon reading it, but made sense after a few minutes of reflection. Not the best book I've read, and I don't think it will have a second reading for years, but definately worth reading at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bookschlepper recommends","review":"In 1792 London William Blake gets new neighbors and is soon embroiled in their lives as Maggie, Maisie and Jem take on the big city, the circus and the serious business of growing up. There is more emphasis on the teens than on Blake in this novel. As she did in The Girl with the Pearl Earring, Chevalier evokes a specific time and place: from the filthy air and streets of Lambeth to the golden fields and muddy villages of Dorsetshire to the demons escaping Blake's mind as he etches his copper plates. It is a hard-scrabble existence for most, for whom life is cheap; it is a privilege for a few, for whom women are cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it more than most","review":"Burning BrightYou folks are too hard on Tracy -- I found this book to be quite enjoyable. No, not the best book I ever read, but far from the worst. For me, it was a very enjoyable story, with late 18th century London for a backdrop. Chevalier paints a very palpable picture of the times and the place, and the two young people she uses as her main focus kept my interest. I've read so many awful, cynical, violent books lately -- most of which I never finished, they were so unpleasant. This one certainly is placed in a tough, violent time and place, but focuses more on the learning process of a naive country boy and his family who wind up in London, and the other characters they meet, including Blake. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burning Bright(ly) in my mind","review":"I am a commuter. I am a book lover. How great that one of my favorite authors let her work be produced in this way! I don't have the oppertunity to read for pleasure as much as I'd like, and I am so glad that my situation didn't keep me away from such a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, what's the point?","review":"I totally do not recommend this book. She is a talented writer, I wonder if she had an idea and then couldn't develop it and just finished it up quickly to get to print. The plot never got interesting, the characters aren't very developed and the part involving William Blake is minimal. He was a backdrop, as another reviewer said. This is more about a neighborhood and some kids in 17c England. The only thing I gathered from this was how dismal life was back then. Read \\"the Lady and the Unicorn\\" or \\"the Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" instead. This was a waste and disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Tracy Chevalier I once loved","review":"It seems so unfortunate that a really dynamic writer, in an effort to get another book out quickly, will write just anything. This book was a terrific disappointment. Country kids; very little Blake and no reason to keep on reading except to \\"get it over with\\" !"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unremarkable read not about Blake","review":"I should probably preface this by saying I'm not a fan of Tracy Chevalier. She seems determined to follow a trend (over I dare to hope) of including historical figures in her narrative in order to classify it as true Historical Fiction. It's an unnecessary contrivance. I read this hoping to learn something about Blake. He's in it. It's not about him. In fact I'm not sure what it was about. There seemed to be no resolution to any of the conflicts set forth. Perhaps I'm just having trouble remembering, what was, for me, an unremarkable read. All the key figures walk onto the screen with hardly anything memorable about them, they have their say, engage in their respective struggles, then walk away again without seeming to have accomplished anything but to have gotten themselves into finer messes than they were to begin with. I'm a fairly astute reader. If there was a point, I didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story falls flat","review":"I finished this book quickly, it held my attention well enough but I kept waiting for the plot to \\"kick in\\" and it never did. The ending was a complete let down. In fact, after I read the book, I kept wondering what the point of the book was-it really wasn't about William Blake who was portrayed as more of a backdrop. It just seemed to be a a year's chronicle of a small section of neighbors in London preceding the French Revolution. Other than Maggie, the characters were flat and somewhat undeveloped...you wanted to know and care about them, but it just never happened. Extremely disappointing book from a very good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bright Enough","review":"This is one of my favorite authors. I could hardly wait to open Burning Bright and get lost in London of the 1700's. Well, lost I got! Each page was more and more boring. I read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library. After reading the other reviews I am glad I didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like Girl With a Pearl Earring","review":"After readingGirl with a Pearl EarringI picked up \\"Burning Bright\\" and was very let down. I agree with other reviewers, the characters are too emphasized where William Blake is too much of a vague reference, almost as if Tracy Chevalier was afraid to assign him dialogue in case she be proved wrong. I truly didn't care for any of the characters and was always hoping some*thing* would happen. There was no climatic ending, it fizzled out and a nice bow tied things up. It's obvious Chevalier puts effort into creating a realistic era. Needed a lot of work on plot, dialogue and action/events.I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting!","review":"I've always been fascinated by the visionary William Blake, and found this novel to be very good, very well written!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at a very obscure topic - British tanks in Greece","review":"I came to this book from \\"Brazen Chariots\\" - I had hoped to find out about Crisp's experiences in Normandy - he makes an aside to this in \\"Chariots\\" but this book is not that story - it's a sort of prequel to \\"Chariots\\" about his time commanding a tank troop in the British expedition to Greece in 1941. I read this book as a teenager and learned some things: lots of water is a cheap hangover cure; it is possible to shoot an aircraft down with a Bren gun (just not very likely); and the A9s, A10s and A13s were more suitable for an indigent family to live in than as battle tanks.I bought this book many years ago, in a paperback edition that has since split and is kept together with string and pressure; it is one of my prized books.

It is good that I found it in After Midnight, because it is her only real album. It features some great stuff like Mood Indigo, Black Coffee and Midnight Sun. One must use the word \\"contrast\\" in any description of Ms Grayco's work because most of her time before a studio mike was with her then husband, (gasp) Spike Jones.

The book condenses a phenomenal amount of research on a dozen major guerrilla movements in Latin American, and presents a compelling analysis as to why only the Cuban and Nicaraguan movements successfully seized power.

The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, the premise is original (for White Wolf at least), the length is just right and I love the way the characters interact with each other. It bears mentioning that the author is gay, and he includes a little spiel about homosexuality/ homophobia, but it does not hijack the story, which in any case is something a Hollywood screenwriter would come up with while on the john. Bassingthwaite does have the annoying tendency to refer to his characters by their tribal affiliations (the Fianna, the Glass Walker), but that's a small nitpick.

It seems to drag on a little bit... because the writer keeps mentioning the vague \\"secret\\" until it is revealed at the end of the book. You're expecting the secret to be very exciting because of all the little mentionings of the \\"secret\\", but it just doesn't add up.Another thing that I've noticed about these books is that in every book, SOMEONE has to die! I understand that they are trying to make the books realistic because back in those times many people died of hardship and disease, but they play it up so much that it's kind of depressing.If you want a good series to read, try the \\"Anne of Green gables\\" series by LM Montgomery.

Unfortunately, his excitement turned to frustration within minutes as the poor quality of the product became evident. The spring-loaded \\"pitching\\" bar is misaligned so that the pitched ball enters the playing field only about one in twenty times. Moreover, the plastic end of the knob routinely comes off in my son's hand, leading the entire pitching mechanism to come loose from the game. The wooden tabs were misfit to the slots in the board and so the left field wall doesn't go all the way in -- the back wall was attachable with some effort but it constantly pops off.My son still likes it OK -- he just sets the ball down at the top and rolls it rather than pitching -- but overall I can't recommend this poorly-made product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else instead...","review":"This thing is a piece of junk... I received it and the edge of the homerun shelf was broken- luckily I had superglue on hand so no big deal I guess... The curve at the top of the ball shoot is not flush with the wall so 50% of the time I launch the ball is rejected off of the gap. The ball return feed is not flush, so the ball gets stuck beneath the playing surface and I have to tilt the device to get the ball out, and even then it is hard to scoop the ball out of the undersized collection area. This think is made out of cruddy mdf or particleboard and the backdrop is put together with unsightly tape.The only reason that this got two stars is because it was particularly inexpensive- and if it was worth the hassle of returning it I would.Steer clear of this product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!!","review":"I bought this item and I cant be more pleased. I like how it looks and how fun it really is!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it broke","review":"It was great fun until it broke. The set screw on the plunger that holds a piece in place for the spring to push against came loose on the first day. It's essentially impossible to tighten, and even if you were able to successfully tighten it, it looks like it would come loose again right away since the indentation the set screw goes into on the plunger rod is so incredibly shallow. My son wanted to give up on the game when this happened, but I came up with a workaround of just rolling the ball down the ramp in center field (the \\"home run\\" ramp). He still plays with it some but nothing like he did those first couple of hours before it broke. The mechanism for the bat still works, though, so that's what keeps it from getting only one star for durability. If you don't mind doing the workaround, the game is still fun, but having to roll the ball down the ramp is a hassle because you have so much less time befor the ball gets to the bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept bad implementation","review":"This is a classic pinball game scaled to fit a coffee table. The durability, however, is below any thinkable standard. The tightening nut on the main lever broke after half of the game. Tightening didn't help for long, and my husband had to adjust the screw and actually weld it to the main part to make it hold. Our kids were more upset than happy with this toy: they are NOT the kind of kids who break toys and they are not used to seeing a toy break just from normal use.

I contacted University Games to inquire about replacement parts. Their super-friendly and helpful customer service department told me they don't have parts, and promised instead to replace the game. However, three months later we have never received a replacement game, repairs parts, or any other resolution.Given this experience, I cannot say I would recommend this product to anyone else, nor would I really be inclined to buy another product from University Games.Don't say I didn't warn ya .......UPDATE: In all fairness, University Games did finally replace this game with a new one, free of charge.

The stage was completely handed over to the ECW guys, so there is no involvement from TNA guys who were not in the original ECW. I may be biased since Raven nearly smashed my kneecaps and Sabu practically landed in our laps, but I'm pretty sure that this show will be loads of entertainment for *any* fan of the oldschool ECW who just wants to see the old guys go at it one more time. All of the wrestlers involved in the show look like they had a blast, which makes it all the more enjoyable for those of us watching!

Polaco match was also a solid bout mixied with high-flying action,brawling & even comdey with the Big Titty(eeww). The Brother Runt-Rhino-Al Snow 3 way Elimination match was short but still a entertaining & fun match to watch. The South Philly Street fight between Team 3D & The team of Axl Rotten & Kahoneys(F.K.A. Balls Mahoney) was a good reminder of the 1990's ECW and it also bloody,hard-hitting & hardcore and the same goes the Tommy Dreamer-Raven match. The RVD-Sabu(subbing for Jerry Lynn)match was a high-flying,back-and-forth,entertaining brawl. The \\"Where are they?\\" & \\"I Remember\\" segments were ok.

The suction didn't seem to be as strong as I was expecting, and it took a lot longer to accomplish what I could in a few seconds with a bulb. But worst of all, my son was completely terrified of it. When the music started, he would whimper and cry like he only does when he's really frightened, and it took a long time to calm him down afterwards.

When the mucus is sticky, it is hard to get and requires more cleaning during use. The sucking power seems right. A little more power would benefit. I should come with some little brush or pipe cleaner to help clean out the tip. We use tooth picks. We really hope this thing lasts, as we find it useful.

In fact, I felt it jerked around the emotions of the readers and came up with the most cruel - but improbable - possible way to end the book.

But I must take issue with his decision to use 8 minutes and 55 seconds of the 29:08 minute CD for, well, harmonica. Now, I like harmonica around the campfire or anywhere outside - live harmonica's different, and can be soulful and plaintive. I even own a harmonica (but don't tell my former choir director that). Solo harmonica on a recording is the equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard...The \\"My Country 'Tis of Thee\\" was effective - but would have been better played on the slack-key.That being said, the piano and guitar tracks are lovely, and carry a message of hope in this time...Kudos to Mr. Winston for putting this album out and reminding us that beauty exists despite horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"First: Too much money for too few tracks.Second: What on earth was he thinking with the harmonica?I'm a George Winston fan, but this CD was a disappointment.

At least my purchase price went to a good cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the piano","review":"I dont get G Winston sometimes. I love his piano work, it is at times breathtaking. December is one of my favorite CDs ever. I even loved his remake of the Doors music. But the harmonica? My COuntry Tis of Thee? C'mon I could almost do that.

I would have liked a longer visit with him.

I have always had good experience with Black & Decker appliances. My only problem with this toaster is the size of the slice holes.

Also, like the bagel feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"not large enough to fit bread or bagels","review":"Its toasting capabilities are OK, not the best, but the worst part is it is not deep enough to fit the whole piece of bread or bagels.

Not much better than my $6.00 toaster that I replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak toaster for an upgrade","review":"As other reviewers pointed out, the bread does not fit into the slots. The slots are too short so that a portion of the bread always sticks out.If the adjustment for light-dark toasting is too high for a particular bread, you can NOT simply stop the toasting. The control lever appears to be electro-magnetic. You have to go and unplug the toaster before it releases!!! How lame is that? Do you want to mess with unplugging and plugging in to control your toaster lever?Too pricey for what you get, and design flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy","review":"After reading some of the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to try this workout. I was very disappointed with the workout that I got. Didn't even break a sweat and both the boxing and ballet segments were too easy.

It's listed for a resell after one viewing. For me, boxing and ballet do NOT blend well. Some of the ballet moves are pretty fast moving, and as someone who is far from a ballerina, it was fairly tough to keep up.The boxing is... meh. There are better boxing focused DVDs out there (Ilaria, KCM).So, although the concept is very interesting, the reality for me didn't hold up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy, not challenging","review":"I had good hopes for this video based on other reviews but found it far too easy. I do regular workouts and have done barre and cardio boxing. The segments are too short. At the end, they suggest you start over and do it again.

A good service facility should check your tires when your auto is serviced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milton Tread Depth Gauge","review":"So your dad taught you to use a nickel and Lincoln's head to tell when it's time for new tires. However these days, tread patterns and tire materials are a lot different. It's handy to have tool specifically designed for the task. The Milton is a pocket clip sized gauge that in increments of 1/64\\" tells you how your tread is wearing. No more crawling under the wheel well to see Lincoln... Just insert it over a tread groove and push down. Where ever it rests it will stay. Pull it out (get out your glasses) and read it. That easy. It's nice for non-gear heads and people who aren't as limber as they used to be alike.Stopping is the most important mechanical feature of your vehicle. Tires obviously play a huge role in this, particularly when road conditions are wet and slippery. So checking your tread and planning for the next big expense of replacing them is important. Be sure to also check your tire pressure often as this plays a large role in tire wear and driving safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, but watch out, it's oily.","review":"Received this item a few days after ordering. Simple and does the job. Just beware, as others mentioned, they apparently soak these in WD-40 before packaging and shipping, so they will be oily upon opening. Other than that, I see the price has gone up $1.50 in the past week. Not sure why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little hard to read","review":"Got this to try to extend the life on my motorcycle tires by adjusting the air to keep the tread depth similar on the middle of the tire and on the sides. It appears I was running too much air and the middle tread was wearing faster than the sides. The gauge is simple and straight forward, however, the scale goes around the cylinder that goes in and out, so if you measure tread depth at one point on the tire, you have to turn the gauge around to read tread depth at another point on the tire if it is more, or less, than the first reading. Also, while you can \\"guestimate\\" the depth (good enough for personal use) by reading the lines on the gauge, I would just go for one of the digital depth gauges if I had to buy one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tread depth gauge purchased so far","review":"This gauge does not easily move around, like some of the other gauges I have.

If it is 4/32 or 1/8 of an inch or less then you should probably get them replaced soon. Essentially 1/8 of an inch is fine for summer on road driving but not winter driving. My tires have exactly an 1/8 of an inch of tread left and winter is coming so I guess I will be tire shopping soon. The package says that the product contains lead, just thought I would add that for those that care about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the grammar-phile, not the everyday lawyer.","review":"This book is intensely and heavily focused on sentence-level English; grammar and punctuation receive the most attention. No one can question that, because lawyers are professional writers, we ought to understand English at the sentence level. But this book offers so much detail that it is difficult to get through. Most lawyers can learn to write correctly and effectively without understanding grammar at the level of an English Ph.D.Plus, practical advice for preparing legal documents is sparse.

It actually has a conscience....a soul.....and a much more noble mission. Mothra is the guardian of Earth and nature. The best part of this movie is the awesome foe of Mothra, Death Ghidorah. It looks to me like a more primitive version of King Ghidorah, my favorite Toho movie monster. Death Ghidorah is an evil alien being that travels from planet to planet, absorbing all the energy and leaving the planet dead This greatly resembles the bio of the original Ghidorah from the old Toho movies. It was trapped hundreds of years ago by Mothras but now it's back and it ain't happy! I won't give away too much, but the new Mothra at the end is cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film for kids but not true to the legend of Mothra..","review":"This was not a bad film. It's geared for kids and has a pretty good plot as well as some nice special effects.However, it doesn't really stay true to Mothra, treating her more as a flashy bug than the revered Goddess she once was. The little fairies, Moll and Lora...what can I say about them? Not cute like the Shobijin or enchanting like the Cosmos, plus their costumes were pretty tacky...the traditional Mothra song, however, was sung very nicely.Mothra's opponent, DeathGhidorah (it isn't DesGhidorah, that was a result of bad dubbing) sounded like an elephant and I thought he was pretty cheesy...but that's me.I've only seen the dubbed version of this film which could account a bit for my poor opinion of it...but it's really a good movie, overall, and I recommend it for any child, or anyone else for that matter :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says it is","review":"I ordered 2 of these for my boys and this is not what it says it is.

The same thing happens in New York in the book but with more devastating effects.Wylie was very pessimist. The end of civilization started in the eighties in his story.

This is par for the course as far as printed versions of popular music go. What really sets this book apart is that the piano part are no only watered down, they are bad. Any half-decent pianist could do better faking it. Not only that, but the rhythms on the printed vocals are often nowhere close to those on the albums. To top it all off, large sections are completely cut out of many of the songs (Considering the quality of the piano parts, however, these missing instrumental sections will hardly be missed). The song selection is good but not enough to balance all its faults. Overall, I could only consider recommending this book to beginning piano students who are hard-core Tom Waits fans. Otherwise, save your money, cross your fingers, and hope a book containing decent transcriptions of these songs becomes available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crud","review":"This is a pricey product so I expected quality.

Oh well, I lost 1 hour trying to figure out the right way to mount that bracket, and got it to work. Screwed on the mounting bracket, slid the CPU onto the track and.... crooked! There's nothing to be done about it. I spent another hour messing with the various clamps, to no avail. My machine is not especially heavy but it pulls the clamp sideways.

I suspect that the Mandrake partition tool created some problems in the partition table, but I thought the whole point of a tool like Partition Magic was to fix these. I was already resigned to wiping my disk and reinstalling the OS, but all Partition Magic would do was to report an error. Tech support at Symantec told me to \\"boot DOS and run FDISK.\\" Why can't PM, whose sole purpose is to manage partitions, recreate a partition table for me?If your system is up and running, then this tool may help you manage your partitions.

There are two stories in this book that I found mundane to say the least.This Masquarade version, the Yellow Room took it's title from the fact that the room in which Miss Alice Darvell is shut in to receive her repeated and continuous punishments. Although the book says the room got its name from the curtains I think that it got its name for the golden showers that Uncle Edward seems to like so much ...The second part or the book is a series of letters from Miss Coote and her experience at a French all girl boarding school. These letters have been published so many times as filler in so many books that I think I have alll the letters memorized ...I am upset that the publisher does not include this information in the name of the book since 128 pages of a 210 page book have nothing to do with the 'Yellow Room' story .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste the Time you already don't have","review":"I was excited to read this book and thought it would have some insightful ways of how to make more time. Even at the start of the book they promise to be straight to the point and not waste your any time, however the book was filled with short stories, quotes, over explanations of common sense ideals, and the mention of the other books they have written. The only interesting part was the free quiz it tells you take on-line to find out how your \\"time style\\" your partner takes the same quiz and then it tells you about how each of you perceive time, sure that was semi-interesting, but not helpful. It also repeated refers to a workbook with activities, which you buy separate, that is supposed to help to do along with the book, which we did not have and did not purchase.

This company instructs their so-called Professionals to do the bare minimum. Everything else, like hiding wires or hard wiring the radio will cost you extra. Shop around because the service offered can be had for less, much less. The installers that customers are sent to are high end businesses that are used to selling and installing car stereo's and DVD players that go for thousands of dollars. I just wanted my Sirius radio installed to play on my factory stereo. They view people like me as losers and treated me accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is extra","review":"After ordering the install and \\"activating\\" online it took them a week and a half to get back to me.

There is a variety of men of all types (clean cut all-american, hairy hippy, tattoed and pierced) and colors, which is nice. The problem is, at least a third of these pictures are badly out of focus and/or badly (not artistically - badly) lit. Other pictures look like something you could snap off with a cell phone camera or the men simply just are not very interesting (I like a bit of personality.) In addition, many of the men don't actually get into the lotus position.

Duel of the Fates and Anakin's Theme are really incredible. I can't wait for Sony to release a complete set.

And the end credits music... what's the point of repeating the whole \\"Duel of Fates\\" and \\"Anakin's Theme\\"?... isn't one time enough? that's such a waste of CD space. The first trilogy's end credits were so great because they had ALL the important \\"leitmotifs\\" of each movie... and this one lacks of them... no theme for Shmi Skywalker, Darth Maul, or Queen Amidala... not to mention the droids and the Force theme...of course they're about two different generations and times.

No tracks on this CD are intact, are are fragments carelessly strewn around. This is due to the carelessness and arrogance of Sony Classical. After a 5 million dollar buy on Sony's part, Williams and Lucas decided to sell out their classical work. It contains no portions of Qui-Gons theme or the briefly stated (new for episode 1) Obi-Wan's theme. This album should have gotten the 2 CD RCA victor treatment like the Special editions soundtracks did. I was shocked. I DEMAND, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER FANS- A TWO CD SET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another great work of art by John Williams","review":"John Williams just amazes us again with this thrilling work of art. This great album is comparable with the other Star Wars albums, and in my opinion is the second best (next to Empire Strikes Back). The inspiring theme Duel of the Fates is considered by many experts to be not only Williams' most thrilling work, but one the best works for film score music ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit For Williams","review":"The music in StarWars has always been an experience to listen to. It was always fitting to the scene and really makes to serve up an epic. Some of the music is in a tone of dispair (such as Qui-Gon's Noble End) or joyous celebration (Augies Great Municipal Band)and even an odd sounding interlude. The music ingenious of Williams has never ceased to amaze me, especially with the last track of the CD; horns and drums beating with a child chorus in the background. It is this type of music that keeps me interested in his work and he always finds new ways in which to keep his fresh and new. But alas, there is a downfall to this soundtrack, some of the tracks are just too subtle and slow and really don't keep me interested, but that is too little to really make it bad, but I did mark down a star for it. If you like Starwars or just good music, get this Soundtrack today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Star Wars Score!","review":"I Usually listen to music without words and I'm a Big Star Wars Fan.

There's more!","review":"Let me start by saying how truely terrible THIS presentation of the score is. It lacks any sort of coherence and LOTS of additional music. While it serves as a listening experience on it own and seperate from the film, you later watche the film and realize you've been robbed. Help is on the way! It would seem Sony Classical came to their senses (and woke up to the fact that they spent too much money for the rights to the score and did not move enough copies) and announced that they will be releasing a full score in November. So you have a choice (a choice that I do not have anymore - because I bought this inferior CD the day it came out) you can buy this now,... or you can wait until a full score is released and experience the music as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises here...","review":"Williams has been away from the Star Wars universe for awhile, and it shows by (except for the main titles) avoidance of redundancy. Don't get me wrong, there's a certain style to Star Wars soundtrack music and it's here. But two decades have leached away any tendency towards recycling that composers of series film music tend to have when the flicks follow one another fairly closely. The \\"Augie's\\" march theme at the end is great--I was afraid that this example of music \\"performed\\" by onscreen characters was going to be a \\"Lapti Nek\\" or \\"Cantina Band\\" retread. There are only two examples of soundtrack music that I can enjoy as music in their own right--the other is John Barry's \\"James Bond\\" material. Owners of Williams' sountracks to the original trilogy won't be disappointed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"There is nothing memorable about this sound track. None of the characters have a theme that you will find yourself humming later, though several characters (Watto, Sebulba and especially Qui Gon) deserve a strong and recognizable theme, in my opinion. I also question the ordering and pairing of the tracks on the CD. They are not in the order they come in the movie. If you are familiar with other sound tracks by John Williams, you might hear echoes of Close Encounters, Superman, Indiana Jones, and Jaws. The strongest piece is \`\`Duel of the Fates'' and you will catch pieces of the Force Theme and the Empire March from the previous movies, which is nice. But all in all not a soundtrack I will listen to often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Forgive Me John","review":"I'm sorry, but this score is not what you are expecting from a Star Wars film. Remember how intense the music from the trailer was? Well, it's entirely absent from this soundtrack. I think that the score to the Lost World is better than than this one. If you've heard it, you can make the comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as memorable as ESB or ROTJ","review":"Well, I'm an obessesive Star Wars fangirl, so I did like the movie (I also hated it, but that's another story). I thought the music was really good, and I have been listening to the soundtrack almost nonstop since I got it. I really like \\"Duel of the Fates\\" and the end credits, but I don't find myself humming it like I did with the finale at the end of ANH or \\"Darth Vader's Theme\\" in ESB. I agree with the previous comments that it would be much better with stronger themes for the main characters. In the second movie trailer, it uses all Classic Trilogy music (Vader's Theme for Darth Maul, etc.), and while I don't think that would have fit in the movie, it did make parts of the trailer more memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is for everyone! it is the best!","review":"this cd is awesome! jed-heads and non-jed-heads alike should love it! jed-heads love it especially, i know first hand. i'm proud to be a jed-head! jed-heads all over the world, unite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams at his best !","review":"John Williams not only succeeded but outdid himself.

The new themes are superb, and the occasional reference to the previous movies is just right.The thing that drives me nuts about this compilation is that the tracks seem to be in random order. I strongly prefer soundtracks that are true to the film, because I can \\"play\\" the film in my mind along with the soundtrack.

It encompases all the emotions that should generate from a soundtrack. The most notable and famous song being \\"Duel of the Fates\\" and a lovely, romantic song called \\"Anakin's Theme\\" are my favorite. Although the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" contains all the music from the film, in order, I prefer this album's concert piece quality. I purchased this film score because I am a \\"Star Wars\\" fan.

Rousing Score!","review":"While many tend to gravitate to the most famous and inspiring theme, \\"The Duel of Fates,\\" I feel that \\"Anakin's Theme\\" is the strongest piece on the Album. Reminiscent of \\"Luke and Leia's Theme,\\" this soft, innocent melody has a dark under-current of things to come. The integration of the \\"Imperial March\\" at the end just made this an outstanding thematic piece. The Star Wars legacy is very much alive in music as well as in John Williams. The other tracks are very well done, Including \\"Duel of Fates,\\" and they deserve recognition. There is not one track that I wouldn't recommend listening to, whether as a whole or as stand alone tracks, the music has survived the hype...now if only the critics can see past their own hype to what lies at the core of the movie and the music...\\"A boy, A girl and a galaxy\\" :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpy GREAT","review":"This is one great classical score. I should know its the only kind of music that I listen to. The tracks are full of energy and magic, but only if you play them in the order they are in the movie and not the order on the soundtrack itself. Sony gets an \\"F\\" for presentation and for limiting the music to seventy-five minutes when the music doesn't stop in the movie and the movie is over two hours long. But on the music itself its fantasic, but I did wish that Mr. Williams had included a little more of the familiar themes as well. The Jedi theme itself was one of energy and action that no one only associated with Luke and could have been utilized for dramatic portions here. This would have helped to link the movies more and quench our thirst for some familiarity. The few cues from the original movies that are present help to forshadow events and add to the storytelling. \\"Duel of the Fates\\" \\"Anakin's theme\\" and \\"Captain Panaka and the queen's protectors\\" are by far the best of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still great Star Wars music","review":"If you're looking for the music from the Phantom Menace trailer, get the soundtracks for the classic trilogy; there was no new music in the trailer. But if you're looking for classic John Williams in the Star Wars style, this CD is a must listen. There aren't many themes from the original movies in this new soundtrack, but there are a LOT of subtle hints woven throughout the soundtrack. \\"Anakin's Theme\\" is particularly striking, including quiet reminders of the \\"Imperial March\\". Another great soundtrack by John Williams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER AMAZING JOHN WILLIAMS ALBUM","review":"I got the soundtrack yesterday and listened to all 73 min. of it.

And I was one of the first to go out and purchase the eagerly awaited soundtrack by John Williams.Needless to say I was in awe! Even after I saw the movie and was subsequently disappointed, I was still enamored by this music. Although \\"Duel of the Fates\\" felt a little out of place in the Star Wars universe (don't get me wrong, it's an awesome piece of music), it eventually grew on me, especially after getting incorporated into the succeeding prequel scores, ATTACK OF THE CLONES and REVENGE OF THE SITH.I still think the soundtrack would have been improved if John Williams had used more of the Tatooine themes from A NEW HOPE (perhaps excerpts from \\"Binary Sunset\\" or \\"Mos Eisley Spaceport\\").But after ten years, it's much more Star Wars-ish to me now than it once was. It's still a fun musical adventure, full of excitement and wonder.Par for the course for John Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - if you'll notice the details","review":"First, the track arrangemnt dosen't make any sense. Second, this CD contains pieces that were CUT OFF, and lacks so much of the finalized soundtrack found in the movie.

Listen to \\"The Droid Invasion\\" (my favorite piece in the movie) and compare it to the movie, it's different on the CD!. SOME OF THE GOOD MATERIAL WAS LEFT OUT, and the order of the tracks does not match the sequence in the movie.It seems they had made this CD before the movie was even edited.

I have one reason for the four star rating: it's incomplete! I have all three other SW soundtracks, and they all contain the complete score from the movies. I don't know who made the decision to do differently with TPM, but I think it was a mistake. Other than that, this CD is a must-have, unless you want to wait for the complete version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!!!","review":"One GREAT soundtrack, the names spoil some but not too much. Again William's digs has used some allusion and Mr. Tchaikovsky, Mr. Beethoven, and a couple others have remixed for some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force is with Williams the 4th time around !!!!!","review":"In the day of soundtracks for everything, when all is sounding the same, along come John Williams and George Lucas to make old new again. Not Just new, Invigorating. My heart pumped through the opening, past the Duel of fates into the Municipal band segment and right through the close. I have waited years for this and have NOT been let down. Thanks again for the privilidge of being young at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I've by now heard almost all of the tracks. Williams has done a fine job of incorperating some of the classic tunes into TPM's music. My favorite track is 18. I like the way it opens up."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Star Wars music is always a good thing...","review":"The Episode 1: The Phantom Menace soundtrack can stand alone as a great CD. It isn't just the SW hype that gets people excited about the soundtrack, it's the fascinating music that draws emotions as powerfully as the former SW movies and their soundtracks. John Williams does a great job of creating new music, different from the old SW CDs, without losing the touch that makes the Episode 1 soundtrack Star Wars. Everyone should get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good soundtrack, but not what you expect from Williams","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge star wars fan, but I think people is far too excited about episode i and most of them will say the movie is great without a critical point of view, just because it's another star wars movie. Same thing happens with the soundtrack. The music in this album lacks the intensity of the previous albums. In the previous albums, music was an entity of its own, now it is more like mickeymousing (a method of synchronizing music and action) and music doesn't have a life on its own. If this was the music for another movie and by another composer, it would be great, but I thought star wars and williams had trascended this stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great....","review":"The Star Wars episode 1 soundtrack really isn't so great. Most of the tracks are fairly boring, and the exciting ones aren't really worth your money. Get Episode 3; it's far better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I did not enjoy listening to this CD, though I really liked the film. I expected a better and more dynamic soundtrack but only the opening score is good, the others are quite boring. You can buy it to have a souvenir of The Phantom Menace, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Kidz Bop or Star Wars?","review":"This soundtrack is pathetic compared to the old trilogy and the Episode III soundtrack.While \\"Duel of the Fates\\" \\"The Droid Invasion\\" and \\"The Sith Spacecraft\\" are excellent, most others like \\"Anakin's Theme\\" Jar Jar's Introduction\\" and \\"Augie's Municipal Band\\" are terrible. The band one is so retarded! There are people singing idiotic lyrics as children laugh. The rest non-kiddie tracks are totally bland, boring junk that doesn't deserve the name \\"Star Wars.\\"DO NOT believe the 5 star reviews. If you do, you'll just get buyers remorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Jeeze this is suck a stupid soundtrack. The movie is even worse! Whats so good about star wars? It's just some stupid people flying in ships. The music is for losers and it's just plain DUMB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Bunch!","review":"While the actual movie may have been a little disappointing, the soundtrack is the best yet! John Williams has put together a masterful work which combines new and old themes together so the songs are fresh, yet still \\"Star Wars.\\" \\"Duel of the Fates\\" may be the best song since the \\"Imperial March.\\" \\"The Flag Parade\\" and \\"The Droid Battle\\" make an excellent pair, taking the same theme into different directions. On the softer side, \\"Anakin's Theme\\" is beautifully brilliant with a slight hint of darker things to come.A must buy for any Star Wars and music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best soundtrack for Star Wars ever?","review":"Being a fan of Star Wars for years, having listen to the original soundtrack for the uncountable times....This soundtrack for the new episode was well-done, even better than some of those original soundtracks I had listen to. The track \\"Duel of the Fates\\" was much better than any of the themes for the climax in the original. Check it out, you can't go wrond with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still good","review":"The music of The Phantom Menace, is quite similar to the original Star Wars soundtracks, and yet completely different all at once. I still consider it a classical style, yet it is more contemporary than the previous Star Wars soundtracks. True, this album leaves out a great portion of the music used in the film, but the music on the CD is fun to listen to, and every track oozes with emotion (like most John Williams recordings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Beautiful music.

It is full of echo when you use the speaker phone function. Although the screen is 5\\", the resolution is low and bad when you use the full screen. You have to shrink it to smaller screen (3\\") to have better veiw. I switch to use Skype video phone and it has a lot better sound and video qualities. Also, Skype is more easy to set up.

This is a thorough story of Texas, or rather, a story of a slice of Texas. It is done with precision, depth, and a dedication to its purpose.Additionally, Mr. Wilkinson does not try to be a \\"chauvinistic Texan\\" and paint only the \\"boasts\\" that this state is sometimes known for. His intriguing characters come to us, warts and all,and we are the better for it. The author does not seem to want to give us a story of a state through rose colored glasses; he seems intent upon actually telling a story, one that is believable, sensitive, viable--one that will stay with us.He has succeeded. To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement. I look forward to his continued writings, whether it's about Texas or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Lonesome Dove.","review":"This book was recommended to me after I expressed a strong liking for Lonesome Dove and a biography of Sam Houston.

He will watch this CD over and over, listening to the schmaltzy, vapid piffle called \\"Forever & Always\\" until his skull goes supernova. The world will then be a much finer (and snazzier) place all because you bought this horrific CD and did the right thing by getting it off the North American continent. Consider it your Yankee Doodle Dandy responisibility to make fun of this trash as often and as brutally as possible.

He is the best pitcher on his team but has other things to worry about. He lives with his older brother Carlos but doesn't live with any parents because they both passed away. But if anyone finds out, Michael and his brother will be separated. There are also some complaints about Michaels amazing pitching which takes him out of baseball for a while. Rival coaches don't believe that Michael is twelve years old. Michaels favorite baseball player is El Grande, a Cuban born player just like Michael. Michaels dream is to be able to pitch just as good as El Grande.

They should be reading The Count of Monte Cristo, or Ender's Game, or the original Sherlock Holmes stories.

Short, Tween books like Heat are brainwashing American children into thinking that any book over 300 pages will be boring incomprehendible drivel. Even in High School, adminostatrers encourage kids to read these books that take a 5th grader half an hour to read. If you are a parent, DON'T buy this for your kid! Buy them Ender's Game or the 3 Musketeers. Challenge them!On a side note, most sports books seem generally the same.

The reality is that Lupica has never had fresh, original takes on anything. His distinction, if he has one, is to be about the dullest, most insipid, prose writer ever to earn a living pumping out copy. The success and glowing reviews of his latest, brutal novel is just another persuasive argument that, sometimes, \\"image is everything.\\" Lupica, the heterosexual Richard Simmons, does have one indisputable talent: self-promotion.

But we are on our 3rd year of unpacking and repacking these boxes with no problems.In fact, this year, my 2 year old chose to sit on one while we unpacked the other and they were fine. I recommend these for anyone who needs quality storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Storage","review":"Personally, I really like this offering from Snapware. I had already gotten one last year, and decided to convert all of my holiday storage to these containers and purchased three more this year. They store ornaments really nicely and also my Christmas Stockings and a few plush animals. But, if you have anything that is taller than about 6\\" (and can't lay it down in the box) it simply won't fit. These are individual levels that snap one on top of the other. I like that they can be stored on top of eachother (if you buy more than one set) but it should be noted they are not air/water tight. I wouldn't store them in a garage for instance... strictly indoor in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"This storage kit is great.

Mine have stayed snapped (already put ornaments away that we didn't use) but the cardboard dividers don't even touch the sides of the boxes! I thought the little grooves on the sides held the dividers in place (another thing I liked) but they don't even reach the grooves. AND, they don't include directions on how to assemble the dividers, which if they had reached the sides of the box, would have seemed to be self-explanatory, but I couldn't figure it out at first. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn the Truth About Poland's Assistance to Jews","review":"From time to time, there are vague and unsubstantiated accusations that Poles did not do enough to assist the Jews during the German occupation of Poland and the ensuing Holocaust. Others gloss over the 3 million Polish gentiles murdered by the Germans during WWII. This book is a collection of eyewitness accounts of both the Holocaust and of Polish assistance to Jews. And, remember, that in Poland, unlike other German-occupied countries, the death penalty was imposed for the slightest assistance to Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought one of these: it failed after about one week.

Now its not reading any of the cds it was reading last night, or any other cds I put in there. This amounts to a lifespan of one day inside my house.

En Ensayo Sobre la Ceguera, Saramago desarrolla una gran historia sobre una premisa muy simple: Que pasaria si todos los habitantes de una ciudad se fueran quedando ciegos, uno por uno, sin una causa aparente? Obviamente las cosas que suceden son tristes, por momentos desgarradoras, pero realistas. Un libro muy entretenido y que nos da que pensar sobre la naturaleza humana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Universally Captivating","review":"The first adjective that comes to mind when reviewing Saramago's \\"Ensayo Sobre la Ceguera\\", is captivating.The book deals with a nameless city (which by the way could be absolutely any western hemisphere city)in which everybody becomes blind in a matter of a very few days.The plot is extremely well conceived and it becomes very difficult to put this book down. A very emotionally charged story, with strong and well defined characters, all of which remain nameless throughout the novel.You will find yourself inmersed in the devastation, horror, and chaos..... transported to this city of the blind, sharing their troubles, fears, and feelings.Saramago's narrative is superb. Very few authors can get away with mixing description, comment and dialogue in a sigle sentence, aided only by the use of mostly commas.This is really a superb book, which will be enjoyed by both Saramago advocates and also by people who have not read Saramago before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espectacular","review":"Saramago despunta y se reafirma como uno de los mejores palabristas de nuestros tiempos. Su estilo ��nico de contar una historia y su estructura novelistica rompe esquemas literarios y nos abre una ventana a un mundo nuevo de expresi��n escrita. Al principio nos asusta, o a algunos podr��an hasta rechazar su inigualable manejo del lenguaje, pero en poco tiempo nos atrapa, y nos embarca en un hermoso y exquisito viaje del que nunca desear��as terminara."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asombroso, inquietante, y reveledor","review":"A traves de este libro asombroso, Saramago pretende explicar que pasaria si a los seres humanos se les robaran la vista, una de las cosas que nosotros como seres humanos muchas veces damos por sentada. Una de las novelas mas humanas que he leido, los personajes al enfrentar la ceguera, llegan a ser meros animales, presos a las privaciones que surgen bajo la cruel perdida de la vista."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok bag","review":"Quality looked better in the picture, but for this price I really can't complain.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't reflect contemporary teaching","review":"Understand that TAN books has two primary markets: Those who are interested in texts of historical significance and those who believe that the church should not change its approach to the world as the world changes. This book is aimed at the second group. The central premise of this book is that the primary purpose of marriage is procreation and the raising of children, a view that the church developed in the 1920s when it first attempted to formulate a theology of marriage and had shed by the 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible.","review":"I lost my cord during a household move, and the replacement did not work with my cooker.

Kimmel draws from a variety of sources to illustrate how ideas, images, and events shaped and were shaped by a continuing construction of a unique American understanding of masculinity. I understand that it is currently out of print, but I've heard rumors of a new printing fairly soon. If this is the case, then I heartily recommend this book to those interested in gender studies or cultural history. Even if you're simply interested in historical ideas of manhood or how current ideas of gender roles are in fact historically- based, this is a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring and thought-provoking!","review":"Michael Kimmel, undoubtedly, is at the forefront of sociology in America, yet at the same time developed an unusual gift for creative writing that miraculously transforms any tedious study of manhood in America into a gripping narrative that makes you envisage our schools are vanguarded by a horde of extraterrestrial organisms who arrived in our locker rooms to impress, overwhelm and subjugate womankind (and undo their competitors). What Kimmel does is piercing all the impressive data and disassociated knowledge from social studies together in order to reveal (as in revelation) those disturbing bounding rites and the chronic survival of (mostly white middle-class) male basic instincts going astray in the modern world of eternal competition, moral decline, and ferocious feminism. Very daring and thought-provoking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor drivers + weak hardware = worst USB device I have used","review":"We have tons of these drives, as they were the only ones originally available. Unfortunately we have nothing but troubles with them. They constantly stop working and the drivers do not make these drives as easy to use as a normal floppy.Thankfully the poor product's problems are (usually) easily solved. Every time you use the floppy you have to uplug it from the USB connection, wait, then re-plug it in. This seems to reset it and allows it to work for another 5 minutes. I would not reccomend this drive at all.On top of all of this, this is the ugliest contraption I have seen! It is HUGE and heavy for just a simple floppy drive.We now use VST's USB drive and have had much better luck with it.

The phone started up normally then It froze at the Sony Ericcon logo. I went to the cingular store to replace it and the couldnt. Then i tried to get a new one but it was discontinued, so it was out of stock.Do not get this phone! If you want to risk it, go ahead. But try to avoid this phone.

First of all, it is a quality phone. It has a nice camera, it is fully customizable, the mp3 player is sweet- though some complain about its limited song capacity. I can't complain about song capacity because when you think about it, this is a device that you already carry with you everywhere you go, and you can use it as your walkman too! I mean if you want a device thats sole purpose is to play mp3s, buy an ipod with a 20 gig hard drive. But having a walkman with 256 mb of song capacity in a device that is already in your pocket at all times is pretty convenient to me. It also serves as a flash drive; you can store word documents, etc. on it (you have to bring the USB cable with you though). The FM radio is cool, although you need the headphones plugged in to use it (they serve as antenna). Oveall, the W600i is a great phone that's easy to use and fun to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Drains out quickly","review":"Well with all the hype and looks, I'm sorry to say this phone lacks the most important feature - *** THE BATTERY ***.

My last phone was going out after 2 years so when I was trying to find one reasonably priced this one fit the bill.The camera is top notch, the fact that you can download music to it is worth the money you pay for it, and on top of that it has a built in radio. This really helps when I am waiting in the doctor's office or for my car at the shop & forgot my book.Lastly but MOST important is the reception. For some reason in our house we get the worst reception, but with this phone that is not a problem.The only other comment I have is the color, if you don't like the orange it's removable. There's a dark blue cover that comes with the phone if you'd like to change it out.All in all, I would definitely suggest this phone to anyone who wants a good quality, no hassle phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed up","review":"It is a rather nice phone, but after 6 months, the screws holding the faceplate to the swivel arm have come out.

Battery life is superb, lasts about 3 days on average use compared to 1.5 day for Razr. (I own both the Razr and w600i) Instant messaging support is very cool with support for ICQ, AIM, and Yahoo Msgr. Overall a great phone but the camera's picture quality is very poor for a 1.3 megapixels it has too much noise... The screen can also get scratched easily akin to the problem iPod Nano has so I suggest investing in a screen protector (such as the ones for PDA) and covering the screen for additional protection.

It has 225MB memory to store audio and video files. I am very impressed with the MP3 player, awesone sound effects. The digital camera works great. Swivel design makes it much more attractive and compact. The speaker phone in the unit has excellent clarity, which avoids keeping your phone closer to your ears all the time. This phone can also be used to store files similar to a hard disk. This phone also has its own small flashlight for the camera which is good enough for low quality pictures in the dark.Overall this phone meets all your basic requirements as a cell phone with excellent reception. The built in MP3 player, FM radio & 1.3 Megapixel camera works great without any flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"This phone is great!","review":"The walkman is good better than expected, i have already downloaded song to the phone.

More precisely, I love the look of the phone, but no more. Why?I decide to write this review after returning the phone to Amazon for the second time. The first time I returned it is because there were intermittent noise during the phone conversation, which was extremely annoying. The second time I returned it is because of the White Screen of Death (WSOD). Just google \\"WSOD and w600i\\", and you'll see how many people suffer from this.

In the Quest series, each volume concerns a search for one of the gems that fits in the magic belt of Deltora. In this series, our heroes must find and destroy the Four Sisters, one per volume.Now, all of this sounds like the same book, over and over again. But, Rodda keeps each book fresh. She keeps an eye on the arc of each series, but gives each individual book its own appeal. That is quite a feat.Rodda's Rowan of Rin is for younger readers and is a great introduction to quest fantasy. These books are the next step.

The real Son of Sam claimed a dog made him do it, but in reality he was probably just some nut who got his sick thrills out of killing. Since there was no proof, why add the dog? The film portrayed Americans with Italian heritage with Hollywood stereotype. A film idea about New York City in the midst of a heat wave, a blackout and riots, and everyone gripped in the paranoia and fear of a stalking serial killer sounded very intriguing. Too bad Lee couldn't do better with that idea. I don't speak for all of Lee's films. I thought Boyz n the Hood was a good movie, though its prejudices are still very one sided.

Meanwhile we, the audience, know that the mobs are assaulting the wrong people - we all know Berkowitz is the killer, and we also see that the so-called \\"good guys\\" in the mob are not \\"good\\" guys at all.

Pure trash. Which is sad coming from someone accomplished like Spike Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR FOR THE SOUNDTRACK","review":"Disgusting. That's all I can say. This movie had absolutelynothing to do with the summer of Sam. It was all about sex, andthat's it. The famous night of the black-out was only two minutes long.

Otherwise, I felt it was a disgrace to all the victims of that summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop right there ....","review":"Whoa, hold a minute. This is a great movie, no doubt. But this is not a great region 1 disc - the region 2 version has a documentary, a director's commentary, cast & crew interviews (including Spike Lee) and whole lot more. Boycott poorly packaged DVD's because, like the Cliffhanger DVD re-release, the studios are trying to make you buy it twice.Fight the power."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great example of how bad movies can get","review":"Spike Lee has done little to impress me since his debut with \\"Do The Right Thing\\" which I found to be a wonderful film. Lee has a great topic to work with in this film but it is executed in a way that made me sick to my stomach. For one thing only a small portion of this film seemed original. Elements from \\"GoodFellas\\", \\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Shampoo\\", \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and even \\"Do The Right Thing\\" are all woven together with a serial killer chasing everyone. The language is extemely foul, the sex scenes are borderline porno, the violence is extreme and, the acting is horrible. It all turns out to be a major dissapointment. Some scenes are shot fairly well and the period music was also chosen wisely. Sadly there is not any other credit I can give this film. Watch the movies that were ripped off by this one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy any other Spike Lee movie but this one!","review":"I did not enjoy this film. While the acting was fairly good (except for Spike Lee's cameo as a TV reporter-awful), the plot was weak and included too many extraneous tangents. A lot of unnecessary and exploitive sex and moments that were intended to be bizarre and imaginative but just ended up being laughable. Did I mention no rising action and murders set to cheesy 70's music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A remarkable piece of garbage","review":"Summer of Sam proudly takes its place amoung the ten worst films I've ever seen. This plotless, shapeless mess of poorly directed and edited drivel fully deserved sinking out of sight at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spike's stab at a Scorcese movie.","review":"Hard to watch film about Italian losers during the summer of 77... you know you're in trouble when the only remotely likeable character is a punk porno dancer/actor. Leguizamo seems lost as the lead, a scumbag who sleeps around on his wife, Mira Sorvino, who wrestles with her role in front of your eyes. I'll give him an extra star for getting the feel of the 70's right, but this effort is nowhere near as good as his earlier great Clockers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Time","review":"I have to say I don't often give a film such a bad review; especially the ones that come out at actual theaters as opposed to the made for tv horror movies or dramas. However, I must say this movie was freaking horrible. Considering the title of the movie and the commercials they ran for it, the movie had very little to do with the Son of Sam murder \\"spree\\". The characters in the film were pathetic and there really wasn't a single character that I could like except maybe the punk rocker Richie, I think his name was in the film. Granted he wasn't that great either but at least he was a bit more substantial than the others and I actually felt a bit of sympathy when what happens to him happens; for those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it. I think the movie jumped around way too much and sometimes you didn't even know what was going on or why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Prove","review":"Spike Lee has nothing to prove to me. So many of his films--Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever, Malcolm X, Get On the Bus, and 4 Little Girls--have touched my heart and soul and changed my way of thinking that I can excuse him for one muddled, uneven mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure on all levels","review":"This film tries to work on several several levels and fails at each one. As a historical reflection of the times, it was weak, there are many other films that better capture the 70's. We found out nothing about Sam Berkowitz. It totally failed as a crime film. The \\"message\\" is frivolous (for a Spike Lee film that does this part right, see \\"Do the Right Thing\\"). The central characters are totally uninteresting. Last but not least, it is loooong and booooring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been called \\"Summer of Sleep\\"","review":"This movie is alright. It is way too long. A two and a half hour movie could have been made in under and hour and a half. The only good thing about this movie is the acting by both John Leguizamo and Adrien Brody, thankfully the stars of the film. Spike Lee makes a somewhat hilarious cameo as a news reporter. But other than a rockin' soundtrack and and a half naked, super hot Adrien Brody, this isn't worth a second viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap political agenda saves film when ideas run out...","review":"The last scene in Summer of Sam is clearly an attempt at audience hypnotism to convince the viewing public to the music of the Who that Italians are dumb animals who cannot see further than their noses. He pulled this stunt back in \\"do the right thing\\" and he demonstrates a cheap attempt at this agenda again. Why does the poor guy hate Italian-Americans so badly? Maybe he has no talent and has to play the hate card when he runs out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakey facade for pornography","review":"This movie has all the marks of a bad porno movie; one animalistic and unrealistic sex scene after another loosely strewn together with a thin and uninspiring plot. One has a difficult time remembering the basic plot premise when every other scene is one more perversion splashed on the screen as if in attempts to shock us more than the previous scene. If you watch it at all, be sure you have the remote handy to fast-forward. Doing so will help you focus on what little plot their is and lesson the time you waste which you could have spent watching something worthwhile. If the Son of Sam murders of the late 1970's are your interest, you will find precious little about it here so do not bother. It is a very sad that Spike Lee, with hints of true talent, could release something that would not even pass for mediocre pornography - much less serious drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotry is alive and well in Tinsletown","review":"Lets be honest.Spike Lee is a bigot who hates white people.When i had to endure this Italian exploitation mess,I felt insulted and as an Italian,quite angry.Hey Spike get a grip.Perhaps your own people are beginning to see through your ways!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow in a bad way...","review":"When I went to the movies, I thought Summer Of Sam would be completly different then from what I saw.. I was completly shocked, in a bad way. I went with a few girl friends of mine and a few guy friends of mine.. And definately the guys enjoyed more then the girls did.. I couldn't believe some of the scenes.. all of us girls were like \\"we paid to see this? \\" and the guys just LOVED it lol I really expected a better storyline.. I know it was a true story, but Spike Lee could of really choose a better point of view of showing the summer of sam murders.. But, some scenes were amazing to watch, because the direction was good.. like when Mira Sorvino and John Lequizamo were in the club dancing.. the lights and choreography was good.. but definately a lot of scenes were not entertaining AT ALL.. lol But there has been mixed reviews about this movie- so rent it if you like. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. I definately did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing wonderful","review":"If Adrien Brody hadn't been in his underwear. I wouldn't had watched it. The movie really was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY GOOD THING WAS THE SOUNDTRACK","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who gave 1 star, the sex scenes were uncalled for, and way to excessive! And boy did this movie DRAG! I usually enjoy Spike Lee films(Girl 6 is one of my TOP 10 fave's), but this was not a winner. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was the soundtrack was REALLY REALLY good! and Mira Sorvino is one of my faves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal!!!","review":"What an awful film. I saw this in a theatre and will never forget when, in what supposed to be a moment of terror and psychosis, David Berkowitz begins to hear a dog speak to him. The audience howled with laughter! I wanted to walk out, but my friend didn't and he had the car keys. Avoid this unless you crave a really violent episode of \\"Welcome Back, Kotter!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"lotsa good, but more bad than good","review":"Summer of Sam is another frustrating film from Spike Lee. Lots of great scenes, ideas, performances, but so many bad, dumb decisions too. The plot itself is Saturday Night Fever meets Shampoo meets the Ox-Bow Incident -- but it's really about Spike making a movie about white Italian scallions who live deep deep deep inside their NY state of mind and can't get out of it. From scene to scene I found myself alternating between \\"wow! Spike's got talent to burn\\" and \\"this feels like it was written by a 10-year-old.\\" The previous basketball one was the same way. My favorite bit is where the dog talks to the guy and my favorite Spike Lee joint by far remains Get On the Bus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Spike Lee Flop","review":"After about twenty minutes I had to remind myself that this was supposedly about the Son of Sam. Sounded like a good premise but instead we follow John Leguizamo through a boring plot where he thinks he'll go to hell for cheating on his wife. The there was all this time devoted to an Italian guy who thought he was a punk rocker. This movie was all over the place. The subplots were fuzzy and were a distraction since the audience belives the Son of Sam is the main idea here. Egomaniac Spike Lee puts himself in the movie as a reporter. Do the right thing, Spike, and make a good movie next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eating its own swelled head","review":"I don't know much about the real \\"Summer of Sam\\"--I was only a year old. I DO, however, know that this film displays poor excuses for tension and meaning all by itself. The sections of the movie that focus on David Berkowitz are actually the good ones. It's the surrounding drama of the couples and their neighborhoods that really bombs. Director Spike Lee seems to be trying to shock the viewers into some sort of social awakening, but only manages to shock us into realizing what a bigoted movie this is. We are made to dislike EVERYone in the movie (even the characters we're probably supposed to sympathize with), and even that brilliant 'Who' song gets extremely annoying when it's played ten times in one movie. The only thing that kept me from giving \\"Summer Of Sam\\" one star was the fact that it did provide a bit of historical knowledge into that summer--something I found at least interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I dont think that Spike Lee is a racist.However,I think that he is a hypocrite.He tends to portray people of different races stereotypically,which is the exact same thing that he complains about.The Italians in this are so unbelievable dumb,they are like caricatures of caricatures!I dont think that Spike is trying to say that all Italians behave like this because he is too smart a man to think like that.However,he complains about white directors who do the same thing with black characters!Im not sure if he intended this film to be a comedy,but thats what it was to me.And who is the genius who chose John Leguizamo to play an Italian?Please!Avoid this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST,most worthless films ever made","review":"A hateful, unwatchable abortion of a movie--Who green-lighted this piece of trash and WHY? Awful story, script, direction, characters--I think this was the only time I was actually made ILL by how awful a film was--I would have walked out, but I was in the company of other \\"victims\\" at the theatre and didn't feel like HITCHIKING, or I would have! Spike Lee owes the patrons of this miserable waste of filmstock a refund (and punitive damages) A disgrace to Hollywood and even the decade of the 70's--one thing worse than sitting through this film would have been getting shot by David Berkowitz--S-U-C-K-S! Spikey went on to make other horrible films like BAMBOOZLED. Someone take his movie camera away!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee goes back to his 'Do The Right Thing' roots !","review":"Lock up the kids, & crank up your amp, Spike Lee scores a 5 star hit with this superb masterpiece. I was glued from start to finish. The script, music, direction & acting are superb. Laced with violence, sex, bad language, racial tension & even an orgy scene ! this is one not to miss !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected.","review":"This wasn't one of the best films that I've seen lately. The thing about it that I didn't particularly care for was that it was too long (it should have wrapped up a lot sooner than it did). The acting was okay, but none of the cast stood out. Summer of Sam wasn't as good as I thought it would have been. It's a real gritty and coarse movie in all aspects, but didn't capture my attention completely. I actually give this film 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"this actually made it to the theaters?","review":"Having been a teenager in the 70's, I was excited about the prospects for this movie. The film disappoints on all fronts, however. Instead of a period piece, or cultural revelation of that time period, we are served a poorly acted, \\"in your face\\", directionless movie in search of itself. While the son of sam seems artfully and accurately portrayed as the sub plot, it gets completely out of hand. If you don't find yourself asking 'why am I watching this?' when you get to the scene with the talking dog, then you and I will disagree and part ways here, but for the rest of you, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":".44 Caliber Disappointment","review":"This movie failed to live up to its promise. It had a strong cast including John Leguizamo, Mira Sorvino, Adrian Brody, Jennifer Esposito, Bebe Neuwirth, and Patti LuPone; it had fascinating subject material to work with in the Son of Sam killings. But the story fell flat. the lead characters (portrayed convincingly by Leguizamo and Sorvino) were unsympathetic and annoying. There was a point I was hoping they were next to be gunned down. Really. The only characters I found interesting were the Punk Rocker and his new girlfriend, Ruby (Brody and Esposito). They were sympathetic, developed, and were the sanest characters in the movie despite their societally unacceptable appearance. Other characters were flat characatures and social stereotypes, with too occasional appearances by \\"son of Sam\\". The movie dragged on, twisting a potentially interesting concept into a seemingly endless nightmare of boredom. 1 star was too high a rating for this awful waste of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Piece of Junk","review":"It seems that the other reviewers are afraid to \\"dis\\" the great Spike Lee. This was the most boring movie I've seen in a long, long time. The gratuitous sex scenes bordered on porno. And how about that great acting by Spike? What a piece of garbage. It gets one star only because zero was not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"This jewelry organizer does the trick and it is a good price.

Like many of the other reviewers I was suckered into thinking it would be very funny because of the advertising, but virtually every humorous scene is included in the previews. Vince Offer in particular is an absolutely terrible actor and has no comic timing whatsoever. His movie tries to be funny through the use of sex and violence, but sex and violence aren't inherently funny, you need WRITING too. Overall, the project is a terribly flawed attempt to recreate the Zucker brother's \\"Kentucky Fried Movie\\" which still manages to be funny and offensive nearly thirty years after it was released. I recommend you go buy it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credit me back","review":"Do you like offensive and hilarious films? Well than this movie is definatly not for you.

This is such a waste of everything it's not even funny. The jokes fall miles from everyone and the \\"crude offensive humor\\" must have passed me by because I didn't even chuckle.

I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is, while I can't speak for the other calibers, the 9mm I bought are actually slightly shorter than my real 9x19 cartridges. Whether that will cause a problem when I try mixing with real ammo (to detect my shot flinch) remains to be seen. Also, when stacked against one another in the magazine, they are rather high in friction, not smooth like between 2 brass casings. I'm not sure if that contributed to a jam I had between shots. Lastly, why are these things like $12 for 5??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions DO NOT meet 9mm standards","review":"These dummy rounds do not match the same dimensions as a typical 9x19mm round. The angle above the base of the shell is at a much shallower angle. This causes two problems in my Glock 26. First, the loaded indicator does not project far enough out to show that it is loaded. Obviously, not critical for dummy rounds, but for training purposes, that's a problem. Second, and a bigger problem, is the action does not slide all the way forward smoothly when loading. You either have to release the action further back and let the spring close it harder, or you have to smack the back of the gun to close it.

Or at least that's what people of today believed. People like Stefan Amaris and the rock he turned over when he assassinated the First Lord told otherwise. Yet technology-wise, it was a time of great heights. With the development of 'Mechs with technology unrivaled by what could be produced 250 years later by the Inner Sphere and the creation of massive warships capable of unleashing unheard of firepower, this Technical Readout hints at the power the Clans had at their inception and built upon, and the technology that nations fought over for two and a half centuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying if you can find it","review":"A good book which showed off the advanced 'mechs available to the SLDF and the lostech they mounted. A bit overshadowed now days by the fact that most of the new and rare weapons are standard and that most of the 2750 'mechs which didn't appear in TR 3050 are in the revised 3025, but getting this book and the original TR 3025 is a better deal for the amount of 'mechs. Also features Star League vehicles, Dropships and Warships, though most are vastly different when they appear in TR 3057"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Island Playing","review":"I transferred this from the original LP so can't vouch for the commercial CD, but this is superb playing beautifully recorded.

Santa Claus it turns out is actually a very good looking death fey who isn't at all fat and jolly looking. He's also been given up for dead, murdered by the goblins but now after a hundred + years he's back stronger than ever. The story is a good and very interesting end to the series(maybe?). But it does place a lot more emphasis on the actual storyline instead of a romance and because of that may not appeal to everyone. But if you would at least like to see things all wrapped up then I would recommend that you give The Saint another look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh....very slow treatise on sociology","review":"First things first...this really was not a romance. I would more call this a psychological, sociological and religious ficticious exploration. There was not much romance stuff going on...and trust me I know romance. There was no real villan and the ending kinda just crept up on you.....very slowww. Half way through the book I was at the point of yelling \\"get to it already\\". It was all pretty much a big blur to me so if you want romance read Sherrilyn Kenyon or Gena Showalter since there was nothing much going on here. Interesting fantasy concept...pretty darn nothing romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saint","review":"I was very dissappointed in this book. All of the other Wildside books have been very intresting and edge of your seat, dont want to put them down. This book is simply a soapbox for the writers ideals on life and the state of our planet. Thats fine and her absolute right to write this kind of book, however, I found myself skipping whole passages because she went on and on and on constantly and I got very tired of this. This book is less a Wildside romance and more a political statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a romance at all...","review":"This book appears in the romance aisle and has the typical romance cover, but it really doesn't qualify as a romance, since very little actual plot or story time overall is used to deal with the attraction between the leads. It is, in reality, a melange of things: a social treatise, a psychological profile of the main characters (both of whom have Serious Issues), a retelling of historical beliefs and myths. Without the interesting writing style of the author, this book would be a complete mess; as it is, it ends up being odd, but interesting. If you are looking for romance, look elsewhere. If you want to spend a few hours contemplating the nature and purpose of religion, the difficulties of transcending differences in culture (and the resulting cruelty, advertent and inadvertent), and the commercialization of Christmas while occasionally delighting in an interesting turn of phrase, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not romantic...just boring","review":"This was the first book I've read by Melanie Jackson. It was painful and more than a little depressing. The book showed promise, I'm all for reinventing the otherworld, and the lead characters had some initial spark. Unfortunately, the book devolved into a lot of preaching. The author had some good things to say, but it went on...and on. I had to put it down read something else and come back to it a couple of times. This book should not be classified as a romance. I felt little to no chemistry between Kris and Adora. And the goblins just didn't do it for me. I may try one more of Ms. Jackson's books, because I have read such good reviews, but this was a total letdown for me.If you like paranormal romance I'd highly recommend Kresley Cole's \\"A Hunger Like No Other.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"When I read that this was to be the last book in the goblin series, I was sad, as so far each of the books was a fantastic rollercoaster ride of an adventure. If, however, future books would have gone in the direction of The Saint, then I'm afraid it is a good thing Ms Jackson is looking in a different direction for her next books. The Saint is 70 % a textbook on religion, social inequalities etc. Rather than love, action and adventure, we get the female protagonist, Adora, interview the male hero, Kris about his long life, religion, philosophy. This was the first book by Ms Jackson that I had to force myself to finish. All of her other books - not just the Wildside series - I was tempted to read in one go, but this book was laid aside frequently and the only inspiration to continue reading was that there MUST come some better, fun parts. Sadly, those were few and far in between. Please, Ms Jackson, go back to your wonderful writing style of the other Wildside books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever!","review":"Ok, I'm quite mellow about romance novels but I have to say this book was horrible and painfully disapointing. It was like every Mary Sue cliche possible as used all at once. The characters were flat and one dimensional, the plot..was there a plot I couldn't tell? And the characters were unlikeable. The character of Kris was the most farfetched overly gary stu male lead I have EVER read and I had to force myself to finish this bit of mindless drivel.I'm glad I got this on mega sale and the only use it's had so far is going to be something to prop my good books up with.

Still, Sinatra's sophisticated talent only serves to highlight how blunt and overpowering the French-Canadian chanteuse's alto sometimes sounds.

Her ability to conform to the changing musical times, yet never abandon her faithful fan base, is a true talent in itself. This is best ex-emplified by the single \\"That's The Way It Is\\". It is an uptempo Euro-pop beat, capitalizing on the Backstreet Boys sound. Not surprisingly, this song was written by Max Martin, Swedish super-writer for BSB, Britney Spears, 'N Sync, among other pop groups. The rest of the new tracks on this album are much more low-key, but equally as spectacular.

THIS CD IS HER BEST WORK YET. CELINE HAS SOME GREAT SONGS. SOME LIKE \\"MY HEART WILL GO ON\\"/\\"BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME.\\" AND OTHER GREAT SONGS WE HAVE MISSED ON THE RADIO. HER NEW SONG WHICH IS \\"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\\" IS WONDERFUL. IT HAS A POSITIVE MEANING TO IT. GREAT SONG TO GET UP AND DANCE TO. ALSO SING ALONG WITH. THIS GREATEST HITS ALBUM IS BETTER THEN HER LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE CD. CELINE WENT OUT ON TOP. AND THE 5 NEW SONGS ARE GOOD.MY FAVE TRACK IS \\"ALL THE WAY\\" W/FRANK SINATRA. I COULD PLAY IT EVERYDAY.A.FITZPATRICK"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got to be Kidding","review":"I think the CIA should use \\"All by myself\\" as a means to extract information from enemy agents. They would break after about 5 seconds. But that is not the only suicide-inducing ditty on this CD, that would be too easy. Someone should tell Celine that her 15 minutes of fame are up, stop milking it already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE ELEVATER MUSIC FOR THE COMFORTABLY NUMB","review":"This is not art, but pure elevater/soap opera type of music. I have heard these songs(unfortunatelY) when I was over an colleagues house and it almost put me to sleep. How can anyone listen to such banel trite stuff? Music should have some asthetic value, which this rates as a zero in. It is one of the reasons I don't bother turning on Mtv, VH1, or the radio, because I don't want to end up completely numb like most of our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows just what a voice she has.","review":"First, i want to say that Celine is my favorite female artist, EVER. These songs are beautiful. Of the old songs, my favorites are \\"Power Of Love\\" \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" and \\"To Love You More\\". Of the new songs, my favorites are \\"That's The Way It Is\\", \\"First Time\\" and \\"Live\\". Much better than Mariah Carey's \\"#1's\\". If you like a powerful with well-written ballads, buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't even spend the money for this...","review":"Usually I would not come up on this tramp's album board and post a review about her sorry album, because I'm not stupid enough to buy an album from an artist I can't stand. Unlike some of you dumb Celine Dion lovers who go buy Mariah Carey CD's knowing you hate her, then want to come and put negative reviews on Mariah's board. Get a life! One thing I have learned... Celine lovers can't possibly like someone as classy as Mariah, and Mariah lovers can't possibly like someone as trampy and wish-washy as Celine Dion. At least Mariah is true to herself. So let's stop this garbage. Stay off the Mariah album board and keep your sorry reviews to yourself. You're not going to like ANYTHING of hers, so why bother trying? Y'all are dumb enough to spend the money for a Mariah CD when you know you hate her! At least I know how to spend my money, and it certainly will not go for a Celine Dion CD. Oh. And Celine is not better than Mariah."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"celine can do better than come out with a compilation. i can't stand her anymore, she is not as good as before. and THAT'S WAY IT IS su(ks, she can't sing up-tempo songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst compilation","review":"hate her singing style! the cover dun appeal to me at all, got this album hoping to see some changes, but to my greatest disspointment, i see non!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Nauseating.

I mean what kind of a greatest hits is this anyways? She probably put the other seven songs because she thinks that she doesn't have enough hits, which by the way is true. And people, especially meeh got tired of listening to her rather good songs but a sorry voice. I actually liked her other cd titled Falling Into You. Which I know better than her Greatest Hits...although being criticized for her slutiness MARIAH CAREY's #1's album is sure way better,although it's not her greatest hits, this album is all the way better than Celine Dion's HITS. And Mariah Carey is the only active rrecording artist to have the ost hits and Mariah is the bes selling female artist...Compare her to Celine Dion? No, I would not compare her to Celine cause you'll know what I'll say for the TRYING-HARD Celine. Go MARIAH! just GO AWAY CELINE...U don't need a greatest hits album to get people's sympathies...MARIAH!

On songs like \\"All by myself\\" she screams so much she could drive anyone nuts. And her new songs are so uncool... they sound like we're in the 1940's. Please Celine do some modern music and use your voice to sing not to scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine's voice is wonderful!","review":"What a wonderful album! What a wonderful voice!

But, yeah... could be better... I know Celine could be better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine's best yet","review":"Celine has created a mesmerizing album that brought me to tears the minute I heard \\"Then You Look At Me\\". It expresses so beautifully the indescribable feeling when your true love looks at you. I bought the CD this afternoon and have listened to it 6 or 7 times already. \\"That's the Way It Is\\" even surpasses \\"To Love You More\\" which had been my favorite before today. It's her best album yet and the new songs are outstanding. Anyone who can appreciate the sheer greatness of her voice should buy this immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"I love this CD except for the fact that I don't like a couple songs.

She doesn't need to be glamorized and madeup in order for her CD's to sell. They sell because she she has a great voice and sings with a lot of soul. This is Celine's best album yet. It includes some of her biggest hits (all *excellent* songs) and a batch of new songs (there was one big hit out of them, 'That's The Way It Is', which is a beautiful song!). This was a great finale for Celine. She stepped out of the music business on a (very) high note."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Stop Shopping","review":"I'll admit I never bought an entire Celine Dion CD before, though I've enjoyed her hits here and there and bought the singles. But this compilation made it easy to change my old habit because it has simply EVERYTHING GREAT she's ever recorded. I can take her voice in small doses, so maybe I won't play it from beginning to end all the time, but I did enjoy all her new stuff plus the best of the soundtrack hits from the past 5 years. Buy this CD if you're a die-hard Celine fan, or even a minimal one. It's enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Way...to where?","review":"I've been a Celine fan for a while, but this album wasn't as great as I expected it to be. I really like all the \\"hits\\" that she put on the album, but I couldn't find myself enjoying the new 7 songs that she put on it. It just wasn't my cup of tea, although it was Celine style. If you like Celine's hits, but not all of her songs, I wouls say that this is a good pick, because I got it only because I wanted all her hits on one album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic","review":"This CD is of my favorite singer, Celine Dion. But there are only about 5 of my favorite songs on this CD though, but how hard is it tho find them all at once?

A wonderful track, full of timeless ballads. She sings with such vibrancy, such emotion, that it could bring you to tears.

If you like Celine, this is the CD to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"After having wasted three whole years of my life listening to this seriously sugar-coated mess, I've had enough. A nice voice seriously goes ugly by screaming, and I'm afraid she could be hurting herself, pounding her navel like Tarzan's wife. And I'm not surprised that that song, \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" had been seriously overplayed three or four years ago. HELLO? I USED TO LIKE THAT SONG? Why didn't James Horner choose another singer to sing MHWGO? Celine has been famous for singing other people's songs, not just her Barbra Streisand/Liza Minelli-esque style of singing. I don't get it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please","review":"please people, can't u just wake up one day! celine's days r over, i hate to say this but i must agree with this!

It's appalling. Seems the Schlock Factory has been working overtime. \\"Because You Loved Me\\" is a particular low point. The songs are maudlin and treacly, the singing is way overblown, and it's all in all a sludge-fest of gooey sentimentality, bad songwriting and over-singing. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get much worse","review":"Celine Dion's \\"All The Way\\" is a complete showcase of maudlin sentimentality. On the surface you may be impressed by how many hits she has had, but if you think about it for a second, all her songs are the same. A slow, sleep-inducing melody, insipid lyrics about love, and Celine Dion singing WAY too loud - she doesn't know how to be subtle. Anyway, if you need to hear \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" again (as if it hasn't already been played enough), that is on here, as well as all her other dull and predictable hits. I would suggest you listen to some music with a pulse, you will forget Celine Dion ever existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick! why would anyone buy this?","review":"celine dion has no talent whatsoever. everyone praises the ground she walks on because she sang the theme to titanic.

What would the season be without a reprise of her nasal bray on \\"Because You Loved Me\\", her bombastic bellowing of \\"It's All Coming Back To Me\\" or her really terrifying rendition of \\"To Love You More\\".

She needs to go away, I cant take the pressure anymore.

She's ugly, lacks any real talent, and worst of all, sings nothing but love songs! I hate love songs. There are millions & millions of songs out there that are about love, and when I constantly hear songs that are about the same subject every time, it gets annoying. There are better things to sing about besides love. I like Marilyn Manson and David Bowie. They sing about all kinds of cool stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"I definately do not agree with the last review.

It's the first (official) english compilation CD from the Canadian DIVA. As a bonus, you'll receive a few new songs like \\"That's the way it is\\" - \\"Live\\"- \\"The first time I ever saw your face\\" - \\"All the way\\" (= virtual duet with Frank Sinatra),... All her big successes are also present: \\"My heart will go on\\" - \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" - \\"It's all coming back to me now\\".

There are seven new songs that are also included."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice way to bow out of the spotlight","review":"This CD was excellent, her mix of old songs along with her new ones such as the hit \\"That's the Way It Is\\" was great. The song \\"The First Time\\", was a beautiful ballad that showed Celine's talents. Her duet with Frank Sinatra, \\" All the Way\\" was put together nicely as well, a sweet tribute to the great singer. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a Celine Dion fan or is in the mood for a great CD that you will play for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Schlock","review":"The song, \\"All the Way\\" sounds like Celine just recorded herself singing along to a Frank Sinatra song. What a travesty! I know Frank recorded some awful duets on his \\"Duets\\" album while he was still alive, but does his memory have to be trampled on by stunts like this now that he's gone too? Celine, please take that time off you've been promising to do...and don't rush back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is THE Princess of Music","review":"I suppose the person who wrote ht e\\"poop\\" review hd nothing better to do with his time. Nor did hte person who wrote the \\"cheeseburger review\\". Notice that neither gave a reason for their statements. I will for mine. Celine Dion is a wonderful, beautiful person with passionate, grammy winning music. She deserves nothing less then five million stars. 3 notes from one of her songs deliver more feeling and quality than Britney or Korn's whole album. I recommend this album to a true CEline fan and to anyone who actually has TASTE in music. This is full of old classics (Power of Love, If YOu Asked me To) and new hits (That's the Way it Is, If Walls Could Talk). You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine Strikes Again!","review":"This is the first Celine CD I have ever bought. And I am glad I waited, because it has all her hits in one CD!

It's a quality album.","review":"Never mind all the hostile comments towards Celine's album. Some have an agenda to put down others when they are successful. Celine album rocks. It's one of those albums that stands out and stand the test of time. Why else would it be in Billboard's Top Ten still after 3 months after it's release, and consistently in Top 10 at Amazon. This album is a good thing. I appreciate it; It has both quality and quantity.

Blatantly ripping off a song is bad enough, but to copy off the Backstreet Boys, of all acts, is an absolute shame. Of course, I'm referring to \\"That's the Way It Is,\\" which is merely a rewrite of \\"I Want It That Way.\\"Save the exquisite \\"To Love You More,\\" this album only showcases Dion's penchant for wasting her chops on lame material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine...What were you thinking?","review":"It comes as no surprise that Celine is making a desperate attempt to try to outsell Mariah Carey. Why else would she tell the world she is taking two -five years off. Who cares, plenty of artists take breaks between albums, but they don't publisize it and bring their ailing husband on national television to gain popularity. As for the album itself...It's very lackluster with no diversity. Same old ballads, different words.By the way...one reviewer wrote that Celine is the world's biggest selling artist...I beg to differ once again. That title belongs to MARIAH CAREY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest hits that is missing her \\"greatest hits\\"","review":"What a shame it is to see Celine's people forgot the first two or three years of her career when they put together this little collection. MIA are \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\", \\"If There Was Any Other Way\\", \\"Misled\\", \\"When I Fall In Love\\", and the more recent \\"Tell Him\\". To me, this is the Celine that makes music. Not Celine the robot who churns out mellowdrama like its going out of style as eximplified by recent hits such as \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", and \\"Its All Coming Back To Me Now\\". For this, I place this collection back on the shelves of my local record store and search for another cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screeching is not singing","review":"When I first heard the song, \\"Power of Love,\\" it sounded like she was being stabbed. And after listening to a few more Celine Dion songs, I wish I was the one being stabbed. Just because you can screech a song through the hills doesn't mean it's pleasant to the ear. I am certain that if Celine Dion were on the Titanic performing, passengers would be jumping off the ship far earlier than when the ship hit the iceberg.

Celine Dion had shown some musical talent in 'Falling Into You' but now... it's feels that she is just a women with loud voice. I think Britney Spears can sing like her if she had some vocal lessons. The new Diane Warren song ( I forgot the title) is just OK... but that's all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does she have a hit song?","review":"After listening to this strange album, I began to wonder whether Celine actually has a hit song of hers. Most of the famous Celine songs are from movie soundtrack, not from her album. (Of course, they are in the album, but they don't belong there actually!) Other tracks... Were they a hit song? I don't think so. Anyway this album is a very boring, dumb \\"David Foster\\" album. NOT Celine Dion album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One song okay... but enough is enough!","review":"Celine is a beautiful woman with a lovely natural, if untrained voice, but the style she adopted does not allow for the beauty of lyric or melody to come through at all. Celine has made a name for herself as yet another \\"vocal gymnast\\" who does not believe any song is good enough on it's own. She has to make it somehow \\"spectactular\\" by performing it along with a myriad of screams, yells, and supersonic vocalizations scattered through the melody. This stuff gets old very quickly, especially since Celine is crammed down our throats in every dentist office, Denny's, grocery store and \\"call waiting\\" phone feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Who really wants to hear a gazillion yucky songs? That's fine with me if you like that kind of music, but believe me, if you don't like songs like THAT, don't buy THIS CD. I have it in my house, and I'm sick of it. Especially since my mom LOVES it. She lives to torment me with romantic songs. So if you ever asked ME what CD to get, I'd say, \\"NOT THIS ONE!\\" Remember, this is just my opinion.I DO NOT LIKE Celine Dion. Used to.

The song 'All The Way' that was written on 1955 and renewed is not really bad. I will give the 'All The Way' song 2 stars indeed. You're not gonna regret to purchase or hear this album.

There are not much to say about the Greatest Hits, we all know them, we all love them...that't why they are the \\"HITS\\". If you were looking for the \\"perfect gift\\", you found it here. Only one thing missing...\\"Where does my heart beat now\\"... but there is nothing perfect.

On top of that, the effort 'That's The Way It Is' is a welcome pace change, but seems to be a bit too childish in its subject matter for a 30-year-old woman to be singing. As for the remainder of the tracks (I do own the album, by the way), too many ballads that all sound alike without any truly memorable melodies. As always, her voice is in fantastic form, but for me, I don't know, I'm not a fan. I see that the sales of this album have been astronomical, and that a lot of people enjoy the music, and I'm not a pop-music basher in any way, but I feel there's a better use of her voice and talent if she and Sony would be daring enough to try moving her music in a different, less cookie-cutter direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album","review":"2000 is celine dion's doomsday in her career! she will fall and scumble! this album doesn't worth a cent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BARBRA STREISAND SHE IS NOT","review":"THIS WAS A TERRIBLE ALBUM, GET WITH BABS AND GET SOME ADVICE BEFORE YOU CUT ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE THIS ONE.

She's turned into a singer interested only in selling records, rather than stretching and growing. Faux pas abound. What's with the pronunciation problems on \\"That's The Way It Is\\"? She \\"swallows\\" her vowels and it is very distracting. She should take lessons from her self-proclaimed idol, Streisand, and learn to keep her voice forward and clear. She, at one time, had the promise of being this generation's Streisand - the consumate voice of the last generation - but she has let down her guard and insisted on including insipid, silly songs in her repetoire. Maybe the next couple of years off will give her some prospective and she'll return interested in more important work.

My first book was a \\"How to\\" book wrapped up in a fictional story. Before this project I had no fiction writing or even reading experience. I'm was a non-fiction reader and writer. However, using this book, I wrote my first novel and it has been a tremendous success and has even hit number 1 in the introduction to investing category in Amazon.The value in this book is that it and breaks down the principles of writing fiction into simple concepts that apply to most styles of fiction writing. I just read the book a second time as I prepare to write my next book. Now having read How to Write a Damn Good Novel twice, I got much more out of it and realized how helpful it was.

Once you get past that, you realize that this book offers nothing useful for writing a salable novel. Although it seems like the author knows what he is talking about, if you try to write from what you learn in this book, indeed in any such book, you will never publishin anything.

He advises aspiring novelists to join a \\"destructive group\\" that will tear your novel apart. That way you'll get ideas how to rewrite it and make it better. He even gives advice to those who don't have a \\"destructive group\\" and must make do with their friends --- or even just themselves --- as critics. And that advice is valuable. You might not think of it yourself.But still I don't know how anyone will ever learn to write by reading books on how to write. The other chapters about characterization, conflict, viewpoint, etc. are just amusing because of the author's no-nonsense style as illustrated by the author's first paragraph in chapter 1 where he compares creating characters to a bricklayer and a carpenter building a house. The style is just plain entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I found this book to be full of useful information, examples, etc. However I dont believe any one book is going to have everything you need to be a writer.

This one offers some limited value for people who already have a solid grasp on the basics, but if you are a beginner, I would advise you to skip this book, at least until you've read quite a few others. And get it from your library rather than spending money on it. Starting with the fact that the author incorrectly explains first/second/third person to the premise that your novel must start with a premise (to insist on starting with one may cripple and oversimplify your book, if you are lucky enough to not have it turn into an unpublishable sermon)...Approach with caution.

That generalization pretty much describes his approach in a nutshell and I found it helpful only for some of the other sources on novel and fiction writing he does cite."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous","review":"the author insists, so far as I can tell, that the only way to write a decent novel is based on some Aristotelean idea of the 'premise' which cannot be violated. 'Love leads to death' is an example for a character who dies as a result of being in love. This is nothing but an obscene simplification of the plot. It's absurdly reductionist.maximum capacity? A character's dialogue should always be the best thing he could say. What nonsense. How about the mistake, a common factor of life?Some good points on dialogue, though, but not worth the book.I think you could write a good novel with this book, but I think it would hobble a certain type of writer severely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and formulaic","review":"Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as \\"Cheaters never win\\") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply stated","review":"Writing a novel can be daunting, but this book provides the answers to plot, character, structure, voice and scene in clear, distinct ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer be warned!!","review":"The Marketing masterminds behind this campaign are quite devious.This disk does not contain all realms as the product description leads you to believe.

Then Hot Wheels will release those two episodes on a disk, and then release yet another disk that MAY contain it all.My Kids were excited about this release expecting to get additional programming, only to be disappointed that there is no new footage on this release.

If this review prevents even one parent from making the mistake I did in buying this sequel. The characters have bad attitudes, there is meanness for the sake of meanness and violence for the sake of violence it seems to me. Another reviewer noted the street gang aspect of this movie...and I ask, why why why bring that into the impressionable world of someone as young as this movie is targeted to. The first one seemed to make the cars the stars....in this one, I tried as hard as I could to find redeeming character traits as my 3 year old witnessed a fiery death, a brutal beating, and instance after instance of aggressive, violent behavior, and in general, horrible attitudes. OF COURSE, he wants to see more...I've informed him the disc is broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattel Flounders","review":"After Barbie lost market share to BRATZ, Mattel appears to now want some of those urban sales. In my opinion, Acceleracers is an attempt to make Hot Wheels appeal to that market. There is an emphasis on the street racer/tuner scenes with a simple plot.My 5 year old son loved the World Race movie; the animation, story, characters, and cars were of high quality. The first thing you will notice in Acceleracers is the animation style and technique has been changed to an exaggerated look which is horrible. The more realistic feel of the World Race movie has been lost in favor of a Sci Fi\\\\Fantasy emphasis (the first movie even demonstrated heel/toe shifting, power braking, clutch use and other driving techniques!).Boys will find it enjoyable, but others that have seen World Race you will wonder what Mattel was thinking when they made this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Navigation","review":"This DVD does not allow you to skip scenes or to choose which scene you would like to see from the menu.

I bought this DVD but have not watched it. The back of the box specifically and clearly says it has all four episodes or \\"Realms\\". This is supposed to be the \\"full length movie.\\" If this is not the case, than Hotwheels is VERY guilty of false and/or deceptive advertisement and this should be brougt to their attention. It sounds very sneaky and dishonest of them. Let me know what you think of this. Perhaps others who have bought this DVD agree and we can all voice our displeasement to Hotwheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids","review":"I was really shocked at the violence of this movie. I have 3 and 5 yr old boys and we loved the World Race. This one takes those characters and splits them into street gangs who spend nights illegally racing. Complete with the younger brother as a gang leader bent on revenge because his older brother was killed in a car wreck.These themes really take away from what could have been a good movie to keep boys excited about car racing.If there are more movies coming, I would hope they clean this up and focus on what kids look for in Hot Wheels. Fun, fast cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit mixed but overall a great option for the boys in your life","review":"I am thrilled that Hotwheels has expanded a line to coordinate with movies and toys. WTG hotwheels KEEP IT UP! It is very refreshing to have another option for the boys. One that isnt superheros fighting. I really enjoy many of the characters in this movie. The plots and different Relms.I do have to agree with some complaints. the angst they created between the teams is a bit too much in this movie on the verge of ruining it for me. And it is a bit too dark. My son is 5 1\\\\2 and I do let him watch this one but probably wouldnt if he was younger.BUT the first movie wasnt bad, I have seen reviews that they lightened up the second part of this accceleracers series so I still reccomend this \\"series\\".

But I am rating it in part as part of a great series and line for the boys in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequel","review":"My sons loved Hot Wheels World Race so we were naturally excited when the sequel came out. Unfortunately this sequel was terrible. The characters don't even look the same and they certainly don't act the same. The first movie had a positive message and the characters personalities were highly developed. In Acceleracers the characters have no personality and some of them look like they have taken major steroids and yes they are shallow, violent and mean. Did the same guy write this one? The animation in World Race was excellent where as in this one the characters faces look bizarre and elongated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"My 4-year old son loves the whole Hot Wheels video series.

The entire movie was based on violence. The first scene had a fight between brothers, one apparently on steriods. Monsters, robots, yelling and fighting for 90 minutes... Worse yet is that the ending of the movie suggests another movie, or series of movies to complete the plot.This was so bad that I will be attempting to return it, and I have already filed a complaint with Mattel (who noted they sold the movie rights to another company for Hot Wheels)..Please note \\"world race\\" is a great movie, my son idolizes the characters and knows their names and the names of the cars.

In order to make it snap into place, I have to fiddle around with the latching part on it to make it push the button down on the machine like it's supposed to. It's too flimsy to latch into place without major assistance. This involves turning the whole part while pushing on the latch with my finger or a spoon handle which isn't easy to do.

The only reason it made it to print is it confirmed some Manhattan editor's insecure and snide prejudice about New Jersey. To paint the Barnegat Bay in this sick and toxic light is a crime. The author makes several flagrant errors in her geography and chronology, and in other places describes things, like her father walking on Reich Farm, that could not possibly have occurred. It is a shame that she has spent her life so sick, but that surely has a lot to do with her mental anguish and alcohol and drug abuse, and little to do with these paranoid fantasies of Toms River and Barnegat Bay being poisonous.

When Sandra enters into marriage at sixteen, her romantic visions of love and marriage are immediately crushed under the cruel hand of her sadistic husband as he emotionally and physically torments her. She gives the reader a rare opportunity to look into an intriguing world that so few are privileged to ever see. Any reader will find her story shocking and informative in regards to what really goes on in some Moslem marriages in the States and in Iran. Her heartfelt words and courage are inspirational to any woman, but most especially to those who might be thinking about entering into a multicultural marriage between a Moslem and a Christian. Although Sandra began her innocent journey as a naive young woman, she emerged from the sorrowful ordeal with a dynamic determination to make a better life for her and her twin sons.

I don't want to see the same old photos published in dozens of other sources. The writing is clear, crisp, and affectionate, and refreshingly free of the trite sensationalism so common in other writings on Marilyn. It's true that the production quality of the book is only average, but with any luck the author will be able to contract with another publisher when his current contract expires next year.

By that time I had smoke coming out of my ears and my blood pressure had gone way up. This woman managed to trash working women, ethnic groups, women who choose not to have children, and women who, because of economics, have to work. But when she said that children of working mothers always turn out bad I had to quit reading. She managed to quote that old standby that working women were \\"taking jobs away from men\\". And she brought up the person that she sees as a purveyor of evil, Hillary Clinton. She should read Proverbs 31:10-31."},{"rating":"1","title":"another person clueless about feminist","review":"seems like another woman thinks that all feminists are anti-homemaker... which is a concept that came from negative media images of feminism, not feminists! feminism questions why it is women who are always the primary caregiver... and feels that the role of homemaker (if the couple can afford to have someone stay home all the time) can be either gender."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Riveting Expose' Against Feminism","review":"For years I grew up believing that the feminist movement was simply a backlash against male society's degradation of women. Yet, in a most profound and poignant fashion, the author reveals that much of the feminist group's beliefs, rhetoric, and actions are equally to blame for such debasement of their own gender, particularly women of traditional values. Many times, while reading a particular paragraph, I found myself saying audibly and emphatically, 'that is so true.' There is one criticism. While I certainly can appreciate her position on abortion and how well it ties in with feminist beliefs, it is quite conspicuous that she does not address the perplexities, extenuating circumstances, and even tragedies that a few abortions truly mitigate. A parenthetical statement would have sufficed. Overall, an affirmation and confirmation of my mother's choice to stay home and raise us. This book is a must-read for any man, woman, or couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the long wait?","review":"I order from this sender being a bit skeptical since there were no reviews and no former sales from what I could tell.

Well, they are so well hidden that I couldn't find them, keeping in mind that I was looking for the same type as in my current worn out wallet and then in desperation anything that looked remotely key-holder-like. While looking for them however I found that the material seperating two of the six card slots was not attached to the leather and would sag and allow the cards to rub if inserted.As no pricing/shipping details are allowed in a review, let's just say generically that the shipping was almost as much as the item price, so it's not even worth the shipping to return it.I'll be shopping locally for this from now on.Other than that, it looks like a fine thick wallet made in India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy","review":"This is a huge waste of money I had it for about a month when the part that holds the symbol to the necklace broke.

This is a Caduceus...commonly mistaken for the symbol of the medical field. The correct symbol for the medical field is the Staff of Asclepius (found with different spellings) which is a worm around a stick. The symbol comes from the way a Guinea worm is removed from an infected person's body. It's rolled around a stick and removed slowly over weeks or months. One worm...not a snake...on a stick without wings.The Caduceus is a totally different story with a different origin and was mistakenly used as the medical field's symbol somewhere in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"This small paperback book is taken from material used in the late 19th century.I had hoped for detailed instructions about how hairstyles (specifically for long hair) were created.The illustrations are artistic views of each hairstyle -- but only one view is presented - usually a profile or 3/4 view. There are no detailed illustrations and the written commentary is sparse. Also, there are references to hair items that are not known in this era - and no glossary to explain exactly what the word means - so you are left in the dark.This paperback - in my estimation - is purely a \\"curiosity piece\\" and falls way short of being any kind of help in re-creating the beautiful coiffures of the 19th century.One last thing - many of the styles call for switches or fake hair pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ames Weed Hook Is a Great Old School Tool","review":"I have weeds that pop up in my paddock I need to eliminate.

And that is all I found...ONE! You bet I bought it, and I do not regret it. I can see that someone not being careful might drive it into their own foot, I should say, being very wreckless, could dirve it into their foot or calf. It can be sharpened, like I had mine sharpened. It is quick, efficient, and free from chemicals that could harm my herd. I just jab and yank. No digging at a weed forever.

Also the part that connects the handle to the blade was loose, it slides down when is in vertical possition.

I turned a blind eye in the past to the fact that with regular use, they only last about 1 1/2 to 2 years before one, and shortly thereafter, both of the channels fail, because of the sound quality and comfortable design. This newest set, however, delivers neither. I have a job where I'm at a computer all day, and am somewhat particular about music clarity and sound, not a nut by any means, but I like good highs, deep bass and good clarity. The previous models provided exactly that. They also fit much more snuggly, and the speakers themselves were double the size. I realize that they are only a $ 10 set of headphones, but compared to their previous excellence, these \\"updated\\" headphones fall far short. On a side note, I would not have purchased them had I been able to get a hold of ANYONE, be it via phone or e-mail, to redeem the \\"Lifetime Warranty\\" that they promise from my previous set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not work with Intel D945GCLF Atom-based motherboard","review":"I don't want to give it a bad review because I think it was mostly the motherboard's fault, but the connector arms that came with this heatsink would not attach it to the north bridge on the Intel D945GCLF motherboard that I bought it for.It looks like the motherboard is missing two of the mounting brackets that this heatsink assumes will be present, so it cannot be attached.

Unlike it's brother, it does not rely on a AC adapter for power, which is a real plus when bringing work home. The data transfer is great for a few files, but don't expect speedy transfers when trying to copy huge directories (ie number of files) but in single (or smaller #) large files, the copy speed is great. The hard plastic shell has proven time and again that this is a durrable drive, designed to take more than just desktop abuse.

In addition, it covers some tips on using various ingredients like bonito stock, mirin, miso paste, wasabi, and ginger, etc. Very practical. Yet, if you're more interested in cooking methods, secrets, and techniques, you should go for one of the author's book by Shizuo Tsuji, \\"Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art\\", which is also the well-known bible in Japanese cooking.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 19-Jan-2006)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent cookery book","review":"This book is one of the gens in my collection.

I wouldn't say that the actual recipes are particularly better than one can find in other books but I love flipping through this book looking for inspiration and there are plenty of dishes I still look forward to experimenting with in my own kitchen. I should add that this book is probably not for novice cooks looking to learn the basics of Japanese cooking. Many dishes in the book require a fair amount of skill to execute. Beginners may have a frustrating time trying to make their attempts end up looking anywhere like the beautiful photographs that accompany each recipe. I have what I hope are intermediate skills in the kitchen but I have yet to attempt the 'Karei Kara-age' featured on pages 30-31 and I will be very surprised if I manage to pull it off successfully the first time I try."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 year later and still a great toy.","review":"I bought this for my son last year at Christmas.

Great characters, fast pacing, fascinating world. But I have a major problem with books or movies that depict the torture/murder of children. I can cope with it happening to adults, but not children or infants. If I had had any idea what happened in the hospital scene, I would never have checked this book out from the library. At least I didn't buy it. And I won't be buying it, hardcover or paperback. I really enjoyed the earlier books in this series. But a depiction of the slaughter of newborns is NOT entertaining to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need better editing","review":"LKH needs a graveyard full of editors...in earlier books Anita has her car totalled then after being dropped of at home by a co-worker, she receives a call from Dolph, and she drives to the crime scene, excuse me... what did she drive? Also, in Obsidian Butterfly, ever notice how Dolph became Dolf? These books are good, but I think the series could be much better if things were to flow smoothly, which would mean...without errors or time frame mishaps. Overall, wonderful books, must read in order, Anita has not only aged with the series but her gifts have grown as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsidian Butterfly","review":"Anita Blake has her hands full when she is requested by her friend Ted (not really his name), to help solve some unusual mutilations of skinned but still living humans. The nightclub scenes are surreal in there description of vampires and werepeople. This was my first Anita Blake adventure that I've read. I just ordered the first in the series and can hardly wait to read the rest. If you are a fan of Vampire lore or just a Buffy fan looking for a more lush toothsome treat. Anita Blake Vampire Hunter is the woman to follow. Thank-you Laurell K. Hamilton for your ornate treatment of this horror genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just gets better and better.","review":"By far my favorite of Hamilton's Anita Blake series. Edward is fascinating in his own way and this opens up a whole new world to him that I love reading. I love the gore and pure evil that the characters spread and also that blunt humor and loyalty Anita processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love Edward","review":"If you've been following along in this series, you know the man with one name. Or two I suppose, but his second is a alias, Death.One of the more maddening aspects of the story was the very little back story we got on Edward. As the books progressed, we learn more and more of Anita; her life, her past, her hopes, her ambitions, her training, everything. Jean Claude, Richard, everyone gets their lives laid out for you, except Edward.Until now.And with that, a very unique Vampire in Obsidian Butterfly, some very lavish story, and a new venue which is always a refreshing change of pace (not that I don't enjoy STL, but does anyone die anywhere but a club or their home?)Really, this would be a five star book except for one of the same complaints everyone has, editing. It just needs to improve. Otherwise though, a great read and one of the strongest books of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Series gets a much welcomed wakeup call.","review":"While I have been loving each of the Anita Blake books, I have started to notice that they have been pretty formulatic. While in that of itself isn't a bad thing, I just wasn't feeling as compelled to get to the next one as I was in the beginning of the series.However, this book breaks out of the usual format, and makes Edward, one of my favorite minor characters one of the main characters while Richard and Jean-Claude take a backseat as merely guest stars. While this might sound like a huge mistake, excellent character development on both Edward and Anita's part and action sequences that make you nervous and thrilled as if you were right there with Anita fighting the monsters.I highly recommend this book, and I am looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord have mercy.","review":"This was my first Hamilton book. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages. It is really poor. Some of the similarly rated reviews will give you a better idea - I don't want to waste any more time with this book.I'm not a diehard vampire fan, but I've read some Rice books and others, this has to be one of the worst I've seen. The plethora of mystical/fantasy stuff is so omnipresent that it takes away from the fun and mystery of it all. There is a lot of filler too - this author seems to have trouble quickly moving the plot along. I got tired of repetitive descriptions of Edward's \\"dead eyes\\" and boy, watch out for that killer description of sopapillas and sage honey. Lord have mercy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Anita to take up knitting and marry a minister.","review":"Laurell Hamilton has a good thing with her Vampire Hunter books. I really enjoy the series. Although the action is fantastic, the gore factor is climbing - we're hopping from one blood bath to another. It gets old. Despite the silly story line, Ms Hamilton once again creates some wonderful, if not sociopathic, characters.She also seems to be painting Anita into a corner as to her character development. Where at one point we might root for Jean Claude or Richard as her would be permanent partner. Anita is now getting so brittle and less sympathetc (as we endlessly hear through the character's internal dialogue) that both guys deserve better!The characters and world of the Vampire Hunter series can certainly continue, but Ms. Hamilton may consider writing one last Anita Blake book and tieing up loose ends (but not without your basic silver bullet/crucific wielding rock'em sock'em ation ending)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money and wait until this book is released in paperback. Obsidian Butterfly is poorly written, poorly edited and a major disappointment. Anita is getting more and more violent yet moans that she is a monster, get real, sweetie, change some of your ways or quit complaining.. I am hoping that Book 10 of this series is better than Book 9...Anita doesn't need a vacation, she needs help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept me from reading her next book for over a year","review":"I'd have to say that this isn't on of Hamilton's best works. With the last book, I've begun to notice that the series is taking a turn for the worse. Even though I've always gobbled the next book in the series as soon as it comes out, this book kept me away from NiC for over a year! NiC is even worse than this (you can read my review for it). But back to OB: the plot is still ok, but the scenes of violence are getting to the point where they don't really belong in the book. Hamilton tries to shock her readers, adding more and more violence. Also, I find Anita's character is beginning to get on my nerves. Before I could relate to her; she was a woman, petite, and had to be tough in order to survive in this type of world. However, now she's just annoying, but a I'm tougher than you attitude. You can't turn a page without her comparing egos with the guys. It is annoying as hell. It is a like a testosterone driven teenager in Anita's body."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Last Anita Blake Book","review":"I started at the first book in the series and was interested enough to continue reading. The stories started deteriorating into repetitive \\"I'm badder than you are contests\\" and the sex ramped up to the point I was skipping most of the pages trying to find the plot. The final straw was I lost any respect, sympathy, or admiration of Anita and realized I actually don't like her. What a pain in the posterior she is and why would anyone like her? Blue Moon is tiresome, but I forged ahead with this book. I couldn't finish it. It's to bad because some of the early books were actually interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite in the Anita Blake series","review":"This is my favorite Anita Blake book. I have read the entire series and found myself of late rereading some of the earlier books. Obsidian Butterfly is by far one of my favorite. For anyone that has read the entire series, you know that some of the newer books are full of mystical stuff, sex, and lots of men. However, this book is loaded with adventure and she is actually \\"working\\" and doing a job. There's lots of blood and gore, suspense, and a whole lot of Edward. (which I love) It is nice to see a whole new side of Edward in his own element. It is refreshing to reread this one again. If you are a fan of the series you need to read this one. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peeved","review":"I am a big fan of Edward, and was delighted when I learned the book was going to be about him. Much to my irritation the \\"mine's bigger than your's\\" confrontations start off in the first chapter. I know the main characters of books are supposed to have conflicts, but this is ridiculous. It's so highschool.Ms. Hamilton can do better. This is one of her worst books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips books","review":"I love reading these types of books as it takes you into a different world and will continue doing so"},{"rating":"2","title":"obsisian butterfly","review":"This book was a wonderful addition to the series. You get to learn more about Edward and his world which is scary. Also a couple of new characters which I believe one ( Olaf ) we will be seeing again in a future book ( run screaming ).Anita is an incredible character and gives the reader what they have been missing in other series about the supernatural. She is human ( sort of ) and is tough as nails which I love more than I can say. Read the whole series from the begining and you won't be sorry. I can not put these books down. I start one and finish within a day they are so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Obsidian Butterfly\\"--Was Awsome","review":"This is the first book I picked up by Laurell K. Hamilton, and It will not be the last. I completely fell into the story line of this book. When I firsted picked it up and noticed how many pages it was, I thought it was hopeless. Needless to say the first night of reading it I read through 150 pages! The second night of reading was into the scary part, but I still managed to read more than the first night. Reading the book at night was a little creepy in itself. I finished \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" by the third night of reading it. And my only regret was that I finished it too soon. I rarely find a book that will suck me into the characters, places, plot and settings, but this one was great. I cannot wait to get my hands on Ms. Hamilton's earlier novels. I hope her other books have the same sense of energy as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"These books are wonderful! I'm on the 10th one right now and they just keep getting better!

It's nothing highbrow by any means, but usually an enjoyable adventure. This episode is just too filled with our heroine worrying about whether she's more of a monster than Edward. She's also way too full of bluster and bravado.And by the way to the author -- no one in their right mind would carry the Browning High Power these days. Anita should carry something with more capacity and less bulk."},{"rating":"2","title":"love LOVE this series","review":"This has to be one of my favorite series. And every time you think Hamilton couldn't out do herself, she does it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - back to basics","review":"If you need a break from Jean-Claude and Richard stories this is worht it. A little long but worth the effort to find out more about Edward. Nice story line. It is nice not to have all the sex that distracts from the story but I see in the excerpt of the next novel she is back to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about Edward","review":"This was another excellent installment in the Anita Blake series. It would be very helpful to have read the other books in the series before trying this one, however.This story centers around Anita's involvement with Edward and some very gruesome murders. Not for the squeamish, but very creative for those who are used to fantasy violence.Defintitely a worth while read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward does it all!","review":"I am flying thru the Anita series and Laurell Hamilton has one active imagination. This time Edward calls in a favor and Anita answers. It's great ride. Over the top and the last is so exciting you cannot put the book down. Edwards business associates are so scary Anita has to really stay on her toes as well as fighting the bad guys. I never thought this genre would interest me but Laurell Hamilton is worth the try. Anita definitely needs a vacation after this one. Nail biting time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written but not enough Jean-Claude or Richard!","review":"This book feels separate from the rest of the Anita Blake series in that Jean-Claude is missing. He has been one of the \\"red threads\\" in the series, and although Edward is fascinating, it was a bit too much Edward at times. This book also had the most blood and guts to it. I started the series with the 11th book \\"Cerulean Sins\\" because it was available to me, and then read in mixed order through the rest of them. My favorites are \\"The Killing Dance\\", \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" and \\"Cerulean Sins\\"; primarily due to the involvement of Jean-Claude and Richard. Although it's best to start from the beginning, each story stands well enough alone that you can read them in any order and still follow along."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love LKH's books","review":"I have always been interested in the paranormal, such and vampiers and werewolves and have to say LKH has brought them to life for me.

It's a very good book because you get to know more about Edward and his life.

But I was still left wanting. I know that the next book will have all of the boys we can handle and I look forward to it anxiously. I have mixed feelings over Itzpapolotl(?)

Spoiler:Olaf loves Anita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I was vastly disappointed in this book. Yes I know it was to be a book for Edward fans and it is that but I came away with it feeling like Hamilton was trying to dodge resolving some of the situations she's made for Anita back home. Instead of seeing Anita grow, I felt like Hamilton gave us a whole new group of characters to be awed by the Anita we already know. It made the plot seem repetative and contrived. As for Edward, I did not like the way he was painted here. I enjoy the Edward we met in the other books. The cold blooded, calculating hunter. I felt that his character was made into a stereotype in this book. Hard boiled man, made soft and fuzzy by innocent love and children. Just didn't read as anything but tripe and predictable. I hate to say it but if Hamilton has gotten this hackneyed with the Anita Blake world I'd rather she just move on to another character and another series then produce anything else that looks like Obsidean Butterfly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Romance Novel With Vampires","review":"I have no idea how anyone could read this all the way through. It's nothing more than a cheap romance novel with a vampire hunter as the main character. The supernatural setting, which is supposed to set this series apart, isn't even highlighted or detailed well! It's just background noise to the silly soap-opera-esque romance plot! This is worse than Anne Rice's Interview With A Vampire! Run away! Run away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattered hopes.","review":"Tho I liked Edward's story, I was deeply disappointed by the book alltogether. Kept reading in the hope that eventually somewhere Jean Claude will appear. Going through the whole thing, without him was painful.If this is the last book in the series. I feel let down. I feel like a kid on Xmas day finding an empty box under the tree. As much pleasure I got from all the books before this, I expected the same. It is Jean Claude that keeps me enchanted, I'm not as fond of Richard. But evenRichard's presence would have made this book worth reading. I know that readers have no right to demand that the author provide us with what we want to read. But still.I'm sure we all want Jean Claude in the story not just for half a page. The unforgettable scenes from the previous books when he was so beautifully present, so detailed that I could almost touch him. And now a whole entire book without him, waaaaah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped the ball","review":"I have read all of the other books in this series and I think this is the one that no one spent anytime looking for errors since they can be found all through the book. I have enjoyed the series and look forward to reading it over again but I think I will skip this book in the future. Read it once, checked out from your local library of course, to keep the flow going but don't go back a second time it just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"I hate it when an author insists on telling me what I should think of the characters and events in the book, and describes everything in a way that leaves no room for my imagination. If you are like me, DON'T read this book. The style is boring and lacks any kind of subtlety.Apart from the style, I also found the narrator and heroine rather unlikeable. Her moral dilemmas might be interesting if she wasn't such a judgemental bigot.On the whole, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"This is the first book by Laurell K. Hamilton that I have ever read. It is also the last I will ever read. Has this woman ever taken a writing class? A grammar lesson? Does she not have an editor? Those are the only reasons I can think of to explain the travesty that is this novel. With a strong editing hand, the book could have been cut by at least half and the story would have been just as strong. The long, rambling, nonsensical paragraphs that clog up the story bogged the momentum of the book down so badly that I had to grit my teeth to get through the entire thing. I do admit that I was intrigued by the premise of the book, and feel that the story was entertaining. However, the characters were poorly fleshed out or unbelievable, the descriptions were ridiculously detailed and irrelevant, and the general writing style was amatuerish. I'm absolutely shocked that this woman has sold enough books to have the words \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" on the front of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more like 10+ stars!","review":"I just picked up this book, and I'm only halfway through it, but I just ordered all the other Anita Blake books! I'm thrilled to find a new author (for me at least) who combines such good storytelling with such wonderful characters, a fascinating plot line, great dialogue and humor! And the scene with the werejaguar has to be one of the most sensous scenes - without explicit sex - that I have ever read.

The ending to this book is too pat and seemed to be a let down after all the build up. Ms. Hamilton's stereotypes of law enforcement have gotten old and tired and she never seems to change. It's time for her to break out of the tried and true pattern she's been using for these books and step out in a new direction. Hopefully future installments of the Anita Blake series will break new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsidian Butterfly","review":"Don't get me wrong. I've positively adored Anita Blake since the first book, but I simply couldn't get through this one. I think Hamilton is an excellent writer, but this book is simply too much. First, Edward only really works as a character if we don't know much about him. Once we know about his personal life, his mystique as the hard-edged killer don't stand up anymore. This was not an \\"Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter\\" book, it was a \\"Lets Demask Edward\\" book. And Anita did not grow as a person, or so I saw, all she did was have a different cast of men to fall at her feet -- either in death or worship of her beauty/strength/power. The other Blake books are, in my opinion, as close to perfection as any writer can get, but Hamilton seems to keep simply wanting to go more and more grandiose with villians and gross with victims, and this was simply going too far. The book did not further the series at all. It kept it at exactly the same spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did you have to do that","review":"Unfortunately, as much as I love the AB series, I think the series has ran its course. This book killed it for me. For a while now, I have watched as my Puritan fell from grace becoming the sex craved monster who gives only side pseudo-consideration to the high ideals that were the cornerstones of her existance. The development of the characters to become more than one dimensional took away from the power that there archtype presented. I watched, in horror, as both Richard and Jean Clauda lost there beauty. But I draw a line when the iron man get a heart.

How many times should an author repeat the same description of a character's eyes, lack of human feeling, clothing? Ms. Hamilton obviously believes that there is no limit. Tedious at best, predictable dialog, boring, familiar plot. Anne Rice she is not. The only thing we get to learn about our characters is that there are only one or two traits worth revealing.

She's a \\"Mary Sue\\": every man wants her, every woman envys her, she's strong, she's pretty, she saves the day. Edward--I just didn't like him in this book. The whole plot with Donna was ridiculous.And can we say sloppy editing? On one page, Anita's Uncle Otto is from Hapsburg, while on the next, he's from Hamburg.

The fake-sex-on-stage scenes are tooooooo long. And then there are the missing parts of the story, e.g., did the rookie cop sacrifice himself by heroically starting the fire in the zombie-infected hospital room or was it accidental? Also, Anita promised to take care of the tragic monster created by Baco, but then she apparently forgets about it.

This is an excellent book, like all of the Anita Hunter novels, a lot going on in her head that takes a bit away from the story, but other than that, its really good.It introduces two majorly scary monsters, Obsidian Butterfly, an Aztec Goddess vampire, and Olaf. Olaf is proof that the human monsters give the preternatural monsters a run for their money in this series.

The storyline is complex and engaging, the combat system has depth that has to be seen to be believed and the amount of time the game will suck up is incredible.Even more than Parasite Eve, VS is a completely cinematic experience, from the opening shots to the last crash.If you haven't found yourself enjoying the heavy combat-based games Squaresoft has released over the last year (FFT and Front Mission 3) then you may want to gloss over VS, or at least rent it first.Any true RPG fan, though, this is one game you need to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vargrant Story -- Almost Excellent","review":"The \\"cinematic\\" story line is a great feature, although had the producers inserted some REAL cinema cut-sceens the popularity of this game would have been through the roof.

I've been playing it for about 5 hours and I have only finished 15% of the map. It can be kind of frustrating for people who have no patience, or people who's I.Q. only has two syllables in it. Once you figure out the battle system, it comes along pretty well, and the fights are not really all that easy. If you have your doubts about it, try renting it.

While Squaresoft does make a lot of great games, they also manage to churn out some pretty boring ones, too, like both Saga Frontier games and this one. The graphics are ok, nothing special. The colors suck, pretty much the whole game consists of different shades of gray, black, and brown. The battle system is also not much fun. I don't know, it just didn't interest me. It's a good thing I only rented it. I suggest you do the same before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've rented this twice now and both times its been (bad)","review":"okay the graphics are stunning and about as good as the humble ps1 is going to get but I've got quite a few criticisms of this game so here goes:1) Its hard to know what you're supposed to be doing half of the time so a lot of the gameplay is spent running around doing nothing.2) The combat is ok, but it can be VERY annoying a lot of the time due to the 'affinities' of weapons and the 'risk' system.3) Weapons and affinities are a good idea, but the way they are implemented is dreadful. I found it infuriating.4) The weapon creation system is appaling and it is almost impossible to find a combination that does anything. And when it does there is no way of checking so it ends up just as a (bad) time wasting issue.5) The story is okay but its hard to get a feel for the characters and get involved with the story as in mgs and ff games.Overall, I wouldn't buy this game(...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"True RPG Fans, prepare to be disappointed","review":"The Characters in Vagrant Story are amazingly developed - Sydney(the villan) is probably one of the coolest bad guys since Sephiroth. But be Warned - You will spend the entire game following him around through the same dark and danky dungeon fighting extremly annoying little monsters. There is only one town, Lea Monde, and you only see it (and the light of day) a handful of times throughout the game. I was very thankful for Electronic Boutique's 10 day return policy - because after about 6 days I was ready to throw the CD's out the window. I respect it for it's interesting spiritual/political storyline ... but Vagrant Story hardly stands up to it's SQUARE predecessors, in summary - A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Darn Fun!","review":"This game was better than a barrel of monkeys!

I have grown a bit freary of modern games and couldn't deny the mid-90's for their RPG prowess. So, i decided to go with the crown jewel; Squares PSX swan song of Vagrant Story. All i will say is, buy this game. Deepest battle system of its time (by about a decade). Basically it is Fallout 3's VATS. Leveling up is a chore to be enjoyed and customizing youre weapons is a big deal too. The graphics, story, gameplay and audio are all top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"With Vagrant story you can expect to have one of the most dedicated and complete games of these last years, you wont be dissapointed even tough the game is not a traditional RPG (interaction with people, town travelling etc. ) but one with a great mix of strategy and action.

The battle commands are unwieldy and time-consuming, and the dialog balloons are rather childish and distracting. Granted, some of the effects and characters are neat, but I have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence. After that, it's a disappointment for experienced gamers.

The graphics are probably some of the best graphics on the psx today. The battleling system is very good, although it takes some time to learn how to use magic and chaining abilities, if your more of the sports game fan like i am. The dungeon that you spend the whole game in is not that bad. The thing is though, that all the rooms look basically the same, and it is sometimes hard to remember where you have and have not been. The game is challenging, and you will find yourself in some lengthy battles with certain bosses. I would recommend not using a gameshark at about the 8-12% complete point, because when you get to a certain room, numbers will just start appearing on the screen taking away from your 999 mp at rapid speed. all in all Vagrant Story isn't your normal RPG, and can even be liked by sports game fans like me, who think all other RPG's stink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vagrant Story is not one to buy","review":"I give my props for coming up with an excellent villian.(Best one since Sephiroth) The battle is decent since you dont have to wait for a time bar to fill. The worst thing is unlike FF7, is that you stay in one city for the entire game. The graphics are not all that great either. If your one that likes games that you have to go to other cities this isnt for you. I am also very disapointed in the story line. The bosses were way to easy. And anyway the puzzles are kinda lame to.If you like games that have very easy enemies and like staying in one place this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"Just a terrible game. If you enjoy pushing boxes around for hours, by all means buy it. The gameplay consists of alternatly pushing boxes, jumping on boxes, and killing 35,000 bats and other generic monsters. Interspersed are story sequences that move the story very, very slowly. I played for about 6 hours and just couldn't take it anymore. I would literally rather be at my job, where I can at least earn money, than play this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this???","review":"awful. Absolutely awful. I am 13 and spent 2 months allowace on this .... the game looks great and the characters move smoothly, until you find out there are about 40 different character animations. This means that ashley does the same thing while attacking. He attempts to stab a 40 foot tall golem with a sledgehammer. Pathetic excuse of a story: play for two hours having no Idea what you're doing, and some nameless character comes up and tells you what happened. ultra repetitive gameplay: run in a dungeon and kill stuff. wwwwweeee.

I have more fun in math class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of gaming Trash","review":"There are some items that you buy that you feel that you wasted your money on. I've been playing the Final Fantasy games since I was 7 and I pretty much know what a good RPG game should be. In this game you assume the position of Asley, a bum with no plot of a convincible life. The story makes you feel that you're playing this to see the CG movies or fight. The enemies in this aren't even that cool and the animation is choppy. You just see the same attack move every time. Even in FF8 you got used to the characters in about 12 hours but, man, the characters are ... you just love to hate!! I would recommend Final Fantasy 7 and 8, Dragon Warrior, Teletubbies over this game. I feel like I wasted my money off of a Final Fantasy RPG stereotypical clone.

I found it to be well-written, clear, and honest. It demonstrates maturity, and is a good treatment of many facets of life with a disability. In a previous review on this page, however, it was mistakenly assumed that Cerebral Palsy is a disease. Although this is more than understandable, I would like to point out that it is, rather, a condition caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before, during, or after birth. Diseases are generally progressive, and many can be fatal. Although the mobility level of a child with CP often decreases with maturity (due to growth) CP is neither progressive nor fatal, and a full understanding of both the book and the disability is greatly helped by the knowledge of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad portrayal of life with cp, lacking positive outlook","review":"Based on the positive reviews I read here, I bought two copies, hoping to give one to a young girl with cp, struggling to cope. I was looking for a positive role model for her, someone with a hopeful outlook, who had developed as a person despite their disability. This book is not that. I will not give it to this girl, or give to other students to read. I found this book a very sad autobiography of a girl's life. It was mostly a chronological listing of her life's events. She only touched on the subject of her emotional struggle with cp, but she gives no advice to others in her shoes, leaving the reader to wonder if she herself has emotionally come to grips with her disability. Not a book of success despite adversity that would serve as a model for others in similar circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I am a beginner and I was looking for some supplementary instruction to my classwork.

It has little to offer us beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Lacking","review":"I bought this book hoping it would give me basic information on color mixing, brush technique and composition. It did not. The book has some beautiful examples of the author's art but gives very little information as to how he got there. It is not a step-by-step instruction book. Mr. Greer does not tell how to handle the acrylic medium as far as how to mix and apply the paint to get various results.

The author is a good landscape painter but not the greatest teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very brand-oriented","review":"This particular book is one of the least helpful books around. The reason for this is simple. The book seems more about how \\"Golden Fluid Acrylics\\" are better than anything else, and makes several other references about how brand-a is better than -b. While it is true that artist acrylics are better than \\"student\\" brands, I've achieved similar results with Liquitex, Grumbacher, and Holbein products. I think it was unneccesary to promote Golden as much as the auther did. I also think he had a lot of nice paintings in the book, but as far as how to achive those results I think you might be better off using one of several other acrylic books listed on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book. own.","review":"I originally found this book in the library and loved it so much, I wanted a copy of my own.

On the plus side, they did try very hard to help.I ended up returning the card and the router, and buying a the Linksys WRT54GX router and WPC54GX. If you don't care about 108 vs 54, or you have the patience to wait for a firmware upgrade to fix the Super G problem, then you can't go wrong.If you want to take advantage of teh 108mbps, take a look at the Linksys or the Belkin competing products.."},{"rating":"1","title":"For casual use, most advanced functions do NOT work.","review":"Basic connectivity and wireless work.

The show is less about a woman with cancer than it is about the \\"cancers\\" that affect each of us in our daily lives and how we choose to deal with the obstacles both literally and figuratively.Season two of this great show brings in some new dynamics and characters that add more depth to the story lines. With a all star cast we get introduced to Alan Alda and Cynthia Nixon as two great characters. But one of my favorite characters in Season 2 is \\"Lee\\" played by Hugh Dancy (a British Actor). He is a perfect complement to Cathy Jamison (Laura Linney). This season, much like the last is captivating but I find has even a bit more depth to it.This show is great and it is just on the road to getting better and better.

The writing, the acting, and the story lines were so funny and moving. This season, the show started to lose some of its direction, but the acting from Laura Linney alone makes it worth watching.

Of course, being Hollywood, what she does about those feelings and thoughts is sometimes more outrageous than what most people would do, but that's part of the fun, isn't it? Really enjoyed all three seasons of this show. You might sometimes show some episodes to children, but probably not all of them.

The read-out on my Canon S10 indicates that I'll be able to store over 500 photos in high resolution setting on the microdrive. That's great, except for two major problems. One, the drive eats power like there's no tomorrow. I run out of battery power (with the display turned off!) about twice as quickly as a regular compact flash card. I'm not sure I can recharge the battery fast enough to ever get anywhere near 500 pictures taken. Most of the power drain would seem to be related to the second drawback. The drive runs extremely hot, which makes my camera very uncomfortable to hold. Not just warm, but hand-me-a-napkin-to-hold-the-camera-while-I-take-this-picture hot.

Cave-In may have signed to RCA, which isnt that cool, but in my opinion, they still make good music. they put on an awesome live show, and theyre talented and nice guys. i definitely reccomend this album to anyone who likes good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the average","review":"I write this at a disadvantage, having not had much exposure to this band's previous material. Apparently, \\"Antenna\\" is quite the departure from Cave In's traditional sound, and from the looks of it, not well received by some. If I had a history with this band, I probably would have been turned off as well by this venture into the land of Foo-Fighters-mass-produced-sell-out-pop, if not for the fact that these guys are really quite good at it.For people who like this kind of thing, \\"Antenna\\" is a sure fit. Cool changes and great guitar work set the tone for this record, with crisp, melodic vocals reminiscent of TPOH's Moe Berg. The intelligent, pop-rock sensibility of songs like \\"Anchor\\" and \\"Youth Overrided\\" ground this album as well-placed high points.

Some of my favorites: \\"Stained Silver\\", \\"Inspire\\", \\"Anchor\\", \\"Youth Overrided\\", and \\"Lost in the Air\\". If you like this, also get Jupiter and Tides of Tomorrow.

Although lightweight story and an easy read, this book compares favorably with the best of the genre. The plot is just twisted enough and contains a handful of surprises. The dialogue is smooth and witty. The characters are likeable, but clearly Mr. Wright plans to develop them in books to come, because he doesn't grow them much in these 200 pages.

Cotton Candy has fun on the stairs, while Friday is in the kitchen. All six girls in the DVD are good looking and have their own scene guarnteed to please. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not instructional, not sexy- not worth buying","review":"I ordered several CDs featuring female masturbation in an effort to school my long-time boyfriend. I thought this video would help because it featured female masturbation but was also a \\"porn\\" video of sorts...unfortunately I'm not even going to show it to him, because in the 15 minutes I scanned through I found it to be neither sexy nor helpful. These women- all of whom have seen better days- basically overact, rub their DD fake boobs, and ram various objects into themselves. Between the barb wire tattoos, oversized breasts and worn out privates, I can't understand how anyone else found this appealing- also, there's actually very little masturbation without the use of a sex toy, so it won't help my BF learn anything new. It normally turns me on to see other women touch themselves- after a short viewing of this I turned off the TV and started cleaning my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad. Good production value.","review":"Of the six women on this DVD I really liked three of them. My least favorite was Tara, the body builder. To me she seemed a little out of place on this and I did not find her that attractive. Most of the women (four out of the six I think.) have fake breasts which is a turn off for me but the two that are natural almost make up for the rest of them.

Rememberable Movie","review":"The reason I watched this movie when it first aired on TV was because I was getting over a phase where I was interested in everything related to the Titanic tragedy. This movie of the equally tragic demise of Titanic's sister ship ranks in my to TV movies of the last few years. The cast were all perfect in their parts. Amanda Ryan is quite believable as Vera Campbell, John Rhys-Davies (one of my favorite actors ever!!) adds a special brand of comedy as the Brittanic's captain and the two kids are adorable!! There are a few moments that are some what unacceptable for younger children, including a couple of bullets and some blood-shed. However, the drama and angst is well balanced out by some comedy and adventure moments. The suspense is gripping, and all the good points overshadow the less-than-perfect special effects. If you liked \\"Titanic\\", this is a must-see movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough facts.","review":"The special effects on the HMHS Britannic sinking is the whole of this movie. The plot on the made for Hollywood about spies, and govenment plot is made up. The movie should have stuck with real events not a made up plot. It is a movie that makes one think whay did they bother. The HMHS Britannic, (Titanic's younger sister) deserved better. She struck an underwater mine in the Greek Kea Channel. Luckily loss of life was a minimal 33, or 35. Ship great --- movie lame"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Drama than Documentary","review":"As an historian of Titanic and her sisters, I was disappointed that the film did not take a scientific approach, answering some old questions and raising new ones. I always like to learn something I don't already know, and this film had nothing new to offer unless you consider the fictionalized story, which gives the film a nice tv-movie feel. This one would never have made it at the box office. If you know nothing about the Britannic, or just like an interesting tale of adventure/disaster at sea, then this is worth a look. If, however, you prefer solid documentraies with top-notch research and original thinking, this film will be a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic's sistership","review":"Britannic was served as a hospital ship during World War I.The British secret service agent Vera Campbell boards the Britannic to learn more about German spies.Then,she falls in love with Reynolds who was a German spy.The Britannic sank on November 21,1916 in the Aegean sea at 9:07 am with the loss of only 30 crew members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britannic Review","review":"When I WATCHED THIS VIDEO IT WAS A VERY GOOD EPIC THRILLER/DRAMA MOVIE THOUGH THIS SHIP THE bRITANNIC DID COPPY OFF OF ITS SISTER SHIP'S MOVIE tITANIC IN SOME WAYS.

If you have always dreamt of building a boat but baulked at the complexity or the price then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"making things straightforward","review":"Jim has been in the business for a long time, but has the particular knack of using plain language, logical reasoning, and clear warnings to explain the methods and pitfalls of an esoteric art - boat building. He has that in common with Philip Bolger, Harold Payson, Thomas Jones, Parker Ruel, and Karl Stambaugh.(and others, including \\"Mister\\" Chapelle.) A generation bent on making things not simple, but straight forward and practical. You can really build a good serviceable boat straight from the book without either agonizing for months nor busting the bank. You will not end up with a statuesque ocean racer, but you will obtain a useable, user-friendly, nautically sound, so cheap to use that you will use it often, that you \\"made it me-self !\\" and even looks good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUILT IT","review":"I'm not much of a wood worker...never built a boat...but I built the 16' jonboat with my 9 year old son helping out. Sturdy. The plans take a little deciphering and could definitely be clearer or laid out in a grid so doing/converting measurements to the plywood would be a lot easier. This is a good entry point. You don't need experience and only minimal tools. Instead of building in the wood seats I used igloo boat coolers that serve as seats and coolers all in one. Added fishing rod holders out of pvc pipe. One consideration when building a 16' boat - I only lived a couple of blocks from a launch but otherwise have a trailer or BIG truck bed. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful book","review":"This book covers all aspects of simple boat building. I can see that I will be referring to this book over and over again. I only plan to build a simple rowing skiff, but the book covers sail and motorboats as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Remarkably Clearly Written","review":"This author certainly must know a great deal of what he's talking about - you can easily gain from his obvious experience, and be sure it's sound - when you read the quite wise tips on working around problems, evaluating what kind of boat is best for you, and his consistently practical approach to the subjects.That he includes a number of plans is just another benefit.I found his writing to be refreshingly clear, open and drawing me to want to read more. A great writer, in my opinion, feels like a wise friend, who's begun a conversation with you, and made you feel secure in the subject. He or she also makes you feel not only like you're there with him or her, but also makes you feel that you'd be glad to know them.Jim Michalak, in my opinion, does all of that - while educating and thus raising the standard in books on this subject.Praises ....and hope he writes more.Nathan Abraham"},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"This series of 6 books was wonderful.

These things should be taught at an early age as it is done so wonderfully on this CD. Through different themes, rhythms, exciting performances, and activities for these songs, Bobby Susser successfully brings all young children together.

Burgett gives excellent eyewitness testimony to the horror and slaughter that was the Battle of the Buldge. The reader sees the battle through the eyes that faught it. Burgett brilliantly takes the reader into the heat of the battle and makes the reader understand what it was like to be in the 101st Airborne during World Wae II. I could not put this book down until it was finished and it made me want to read as much as i could about the Battle of the Buldge.Donald Burgett is truly an American Hero. I highly recommend this book to everyone young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing amount of detail about the battle for Bastogne","review":"This is one of the BEST 1st person accounts of the European theater of WW2 i've ever read. Don provides such detail that the reader is easily drawn in and absorbed in the moment. (How did he remember it all?). Most interesting are his thoughts about personal encounters with the enemy after his various skirmishes. I can almost feel the cold as i read about the GIs' lack of warm clothing, sleep, and food. It's a wonder anyone came out of that alive. Can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoir of a Paratrooper","review":"This book follows Burgett's career in the paratroops as a sequel to his first two books where he relates the stories of the D-Day and Operation Market Garden landings. In \\"Seven Roads\\" Burgett relates his personal experiences as his unit is called up from a rest area to be thrown into Bastonge ahead of the on-coming German Army in what would be called the Battle of the Bulge. The author is an above-average writer who manages to balance first person experiences with overviews of the battle. Recommended for the military reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal account of the Battle of the Bulge.","review":"If you want a definitive account of the Battle of the Bulge, this is not the book for you. Burgett's account is a personal view of what his unit went through. In this account, one views the destruction and killing of war. Friends of Don's are killed in these battles and a soldier's reaction is to continue and survive. One wonders how soldiers continued in this environment.

Mr. Burgett's earlier book, \\"Currahee\\", brought the reader to England prior to the NOrmandy invasion, and then to Normandy with all the confusion, savage combat and gallows humor found in line outfits. This volume continues in that line, and complements greatly works like \\"A Time For Trumpets\\" and Toland's \\"Battle\\". The book offers no political insights, second guessing of commanders. It offers the insight and observations of a young American GI fighting far away from home, watching friends die, and wondering who was next.

Less is more. He's one of the few (relatively) new piano players that has a sound all there own. Thru the simple passages comes Shipp's signature sound. This is one of Shipp's better albums too. William Parker is always a pleasure and one hopes that Shipp starts playing more with Drummer Guillermo E. Brown again, as well.

If this is a \\"swinging, bluesy affair...(Shipp's) most straight ahead (recording)\\", as Newsweek called it, then I am surely not gonna like much else from this artist either.

HORRIBLE. You end up having text at the top of the first sheet that should be on the second etc. Who has the time to babysit their fax/printer/coper???It finally died its final death and I'm glad. Sadly, I will probably buy HP again because of price of a new one ($80) and convenience. There's no way anyone would fix the G85 for $80, at least not in the Bay Area.

The installation instructions that come with the G85 specifically state not to install the CDROM software shipped with the G85, but to use the drivers already contained in Windows XP.

The record album never indicated the musical conductor or arranger. However, if I were to hazard a guess, in my opinion the orchestra and chorus is much more reminiscent of Frank DeVol's backing in Ella's Verve Christmas album.I will skip the platitudes in praising Ella's performance since that has been covered so well in other reviews.My choice for the star of the collection is \\"Somebody Somewhere.\\" It's one of those quirky tunes that is not likely to linger in one's memory for very long. However, when heard as the final number on this CD, it keeps going round and round in my head for quite a while.There appears to be two alternate takes offered on the CD - most notably in the coda of \\"Steam Heat\\" and around and including the bridge of \\"Guy and Dolls.\\" No big issue, just an observation."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not perez prado's mambo mania","review":"Be sure to listen to the samples.

The quality of the product is superb. Excellent build and fitment. But, here is the tricky part. This system has to be pieced together just right for the hangers to fit on the factory installed rubber hang points. This is a job for a minimum of two people. I did this myself and it took almost 6 hours of tweaking and muscle power to get it just right. Also, use high temp. lubricant to fit the pieces together. This was an important point missed in the intructions. Do not tighten any of the clamps until you have it hung and in the right location. The directions lacked a bit, but overall a good product. Nice exhaust sound as well!P.S. Be sure to use Break Free or Liquid Wrench to remove the factory nuts at the flange.

Soon, strange things start happening, and April O'Neil, friend of the turtles, tries to get them back together to fight this new menace.Using the live action movies from the 90's as a vague history, this CGI film jumps right into the story and doesn't let up until the end. This is my first turtles movie, but I have to think that CGI treats them better than the live action movies did. There are no limits to the fight scenes and camera angles as they bound across the city. \\"TMNT\\" was surprisingly good and entertaining. Kids and action fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with the purchase.","review":"Product arrived on time at USPS, but USPS didn't give us a notification about its arrival.

The table of contents lists each map by the title of the short essay that accompanies each map. So, if you have not read and recalled the essay you can't know what map you will find. In fact the entire book is a long series of articles and essays about the oceans. Lots of pretty pictures, and titillating, short introductions to interesting subjects.

How about presenting just the facts? And comprehensive maps? And scales? And references that tell me from where and when they got the info?OK so maybe asking for equal coverage, geological information, actual data instead of hand waving might be too much. But how about just balanced information?This book is eye candy. It doesn't cover any of its many topics well. Furthermore, it's got a European bias.

It's very upbeat and encouraging for those who have more than just weight to contend with.The only jarring part is the rather inane popup screens of perfectly healthy HollyWood stars chanting \\"You can do it!\\" in a rather patronizing manner.

It covers all the various areas of perl, from simple language syntax to actually using the built in modules of perl. There is also a chapter devoted to using the built in perl debugger (which was a very nice addition).The main theme with the 'black books' is that they are mainly about showing code examples, and this book is no exception. Some of the code examples are weak, but most explain the intended concept very clearly.I found it rather odd that the author included information on programming TK and XML, but didn't include any information on DB programming. Since most people will have to do some sort of database work, this is a very glaring omission.Overall, if you need a reference, this is a very good book to use. If you are trying to learn perl, then I would suggest 'learning perl' by O'Reilly. If the author included a section on DB programming in the next edition, then I would give this 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"[A review of the SECOND EDITION 2004]A favourite scripting language of many programmers. Holzner offers an update to his successful first edition on Perl. Here, he talks about Perl 5.8. As a bonus, he offers informal glimpses of the upcoming Perl 6.If you're not interested in Perl 6 for now, and already know the language, then this book is unnecessary. But if you are new to Perl, the book will be a concise guide. The examples are simple and short. Towards the end are subroutines of moderate complexity. All typically less than 100 lines.One thing to note is that the book doesn't expound on higher levels of structured programming. If you have a problem that might require a Perl solution of say 1000 lines or more, then how to tackle this, and decompose the problem into more amenable parts is not discussed here. This book caters to teaching the syntax and simple applications that rest directly atop this syntax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference","review":"This book is a great reference if you just want to quickly look up a syntax. The index is very good and makes it easy to find answers to problems quickly, and it almost always beats trolling through google search results!

My 5-year old was fascinated with this book. She remains so, even though she has memorized all of the solutions and locations of the hidden objects. Since she can't read yet, Puzzle World was more than she could tackle alone, and that made for hours of participatory parenting, explaining the puzzles and watching her solve them.

This marvelous and well-written volume is a distillation of the ideas behind Integral Yoga into a very concise and well-organized form. It's structure is carefully thought out and it captures the spirit of integral yoga as well as the essential philosophical foundation for it. These interpretations and summaries were approved by this school of yoga and in my opinion this book is the best source of information on the topic.While Sri Aurobindo was certainly brilliant and his original writings valueable, they are not necessarily an easy read.

One can see why Ms. Parker was interested in the role(s). Like The Robber Bride, MiM provided Ms. Parker to play her characters from different perspectives. And I should add, she delivers as does Jimmy Smits. The first hour of the film works successfully in keeping the viewer off balanced and reevaluating. It's a wonderful ride until the last 20 minutes, where for this writer, the film turned into a sinister take on Shaw's Pygmalion. Interesting idea, but the story took such an over the top and preposterous road that it leaves one feeling disappointed, confused and a bit cheated. It was simply too much to swallow.Ms. Parker does a fine job and resists overplaying it, as unfortunately her costar Nigel Hawthorne, failed to do in the end (I expected better from him).Interesting yet with an over the top and wacky ending.Grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I purchased a DVD of this film in PAL format. The presence of Nigel Hawthorne, one of Britain's greatest actors, attracted me. Alas, the film is one of the worst turkeys I've endured in the last two decades. The writing is completely baffling; when the film ends the viewer has no idea who the main characters really are, or whether or not they are even alive! The acting, Hawthorne aside, is extremely weak. The heroine, in fact, is just barely an actress at all, spending most of her time in the film making teenage facial expressions and strutting about in tight-fitting clothes. The director....well, that's perhaps the saddest part of the film: seemingly endless shots of gore and cruelty are interrupted by clips of past and future events in the story that flow by at breakneck speed, leaving this viewer dizzy and angry.Murder in Mind was filmed in Los Angeles, and it must have been shopped around to all the networks.

It was the late 60's and most Americans were too wrapped up in Vietnam era worries to really notice this event. But in England (where it started and ended), it was huge! In spite of the fact that the entrants weren't really in it for the competition, the British press offered prize money, a trophy, & pretty much guaranteed \\"fame\\". The stories of these men and their journey is amazing. They will surprise and even haunt you (esp. if you don't know the twists). This is an outstanding \\"man-against-nature\\" story with an even more compelling story about \\"man-against-himself.\\" The author used lots of \\"nautical/yachting\\" terms with which I was unfamiliar, but that certainly didn't detract.

Nothing about this whole story seems credible. Including women admitting on an exit interview how they originally took the job to marry their boss. What?? And the hero talks like a female. \\"What do you mean the women have designs on me?\\"What man says DESIGNS?I hated that everything was told to me as oppose to me seeing things. Like how the hero and heroine met. I was told in past tense what took place when they both saw each other as oppose being there when one or the other walked in and witnessing the response.

Actually, I guess if those synths are really good, maybe the whole thing was synthesized!The performers listed in the credits are Stephan Marston and Sheridan Wolf Eldridge, not Thomas Chase and Steve Rucker, who are actually the album's producers.You can learn a lot from reading liner notes - for example, did you know that \\"The Beatles experienced one of the most riveting careers in the annals of show business?\\" How about that albums like Abbey Road \\"forever changed the course of rock 'n' roll\\"?

The pity is that the author nearly always has assumed that the person has had instructions in the subject before approaching the topic. In the interest of being pithy, the logic behind the phase diagrams and equations is severly lacking in several chapters.

The characters were down-to-earth and believable. It wasn't your rough-em-up, shoot-em-up novel that is so typical of some of today's authors. Sam Wright is an average, everyday working man, minus the tough-talking self congratulatory conceitedness that you find in many fictional protagonists. The author carried this story from beginning to end, finely weaving all the details of the story and bringing them together wonderfully. Nothing about this book was overstated or overdone.

I don't mind romance, but quick frankly, I haven't read them since I was in high school. And to romanticize this relationship and call it loving is (in my opinion) a joke.

Buckners voice hasnt aged a day in 30 years and if you gave the two versions of Pac Man Fever to a newbie who had never either version before, they would NOT tell the difference. These songs use all the same instruments and sound effects (as much as they can) as they did in 1982, and all the right marks are hit. Those of us who would say \\"Well he inflected that word different in 1982\\" well sure but that only differs so much. The musical notes are spot on. Bottomline, you come away singing \\"Hyperspace\\" in the back of your head for the rest of the day, and thats all any of us wanted.BTW, check out his new song for Wreck It Ralph.

I'm scared to listen to the rest of the album now for fear of having my favorite song memories scarred by a less-than-stellar remake.You can tell by the voices and singing that this was a new CD, but trying to sing the way they used to.

I just couldn't pass up an album titled \\"Pac-Man Fever\\". I seriously think I would have gotten more enjoyment out of setting the dollar on fire.I can't adequately describe how bad this album is.To start with, almost every sound on this album is created with a synthesizer. That'd be okay if the music wasn't bland and uninspired. Buckner doesn't even bother with music that plays to the synth's strengths, he creates music that makes the synths shortcomings glaringly obvious. The vocals match the music, and are among the worst I've ever heard. Buckner can't sing, and he's not even singing interesting lyrics.If you're really nostalgic about 80's music and 80's video games, then you might like this; but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so chessy you'll want to scream.","review":"Listening to this CD today makes me ashamed that I bought the LP in the 80's.

I loved every inflection, I loved the exact way the instruments were played, and I loved the classic video game sounds. Each song on the album was a masterpiece.Since Buckner and Garcia couldn't get their hands on the original, it's nice that they tried to recreate it, but it's an offense to the ears for people who loved exactly how the original album sounded.

And I have to agree with the other reviewer of this CD, it's a nice gesture by the artists, but it doesn't compare with the original album (and single) from 1982.

The best songs are \\"Mousetrap,\\" with great music, \\"Goin Berzerk,\\" which actually sounds melancholy, and \\"Centipede,\\" for inspired lyrics.

It was one of the few LP records I had to replace with CD. When I got it, plugged it into the CD player, I was very disappointed. They had went back to the studio and re-recorded it. It is very obvious as well. If you love this album, you do not have any other choice for a CD version. It is very sad, because I really loved this album. It always takes me back to my high school days when I was playing all these great games at the arcade or at home on my Atari. I will give this credit to them though, most of the songs they worked hard at trying to make like the original. My favorite, \\"Do the Donkey Kong\\" was a complete disaster.

To be honest, the h/h were happily together for maybe 20 pages of the book? The rest was frustrating and down right depressing at times. The author even had to kill off an innocent woman! Ugh!

It is an old game that has been rehashed but cannot polish a turd, Stick with IL2 Forgotten Battles as the graphics and gameplay are far superior.Too many crashes, Too many Bugs and GMX media have the worst customer service i have ever encountered, DO NOT purchase this title or any GMX games as when you highlight the faults to them you will not be heard and you will also be banned from their forums.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRUDUCT , as even high end machines find it unplayable!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light years ahead of first release","review":"I have been playing all the combat flight sims that have been released in the last 3 years.

It is not a casual arcade game. It is realistic and difficult as were the real planes it represents. It should be viewed as a hobby rather than a game. The sim has had many years of updates and they are continuing constantly. Try reading the forum of this sim and see if you want to undertake the necessary learning that it will take. You could not learn to fly a WWII fighter easily. Many were killed trying learn to fly them on both sides. This sim is the same way, but you can rise to try again. If you devote the time and effort to mastering it, you will be richly rewarded by an experience that you cannot relive any other way. Just my opinion and based on my experience. I have flown actual F-51, Me109 and other WWII era planes and this is as close as it gets. IF you are looking for a hobby this is it. If you are looking to pass a few casual hours look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a \\"ZERO STARS\\" option!","review":"The only reason I gave this 1 star is because no stars isn't available. Ok, in spite of the reviews that said this game had some programming issues called \\"CTD's\\" (crashes to desktop) I bought it anyway since one reviewer said it ran fine after downloading the updates. All I can say is that he must be blessed. After downloading all 3 updates (patches) this program will not run more than 1 minute into the game without crashing. There are too many other flight sims available to waste your time, much less your money, on Battle of Britain 2.

That hurdle being overcome, and having received my copy from America, I found it a very difficult book to put down. The plot was not insignificant, but kept happening right on to the end, and kept me wondering if Wycliffe really had a handle on the crime.

It would only dog-in-the-manger to wish that her \\"affective\\" range were a little wider, somewhere closer to cellist Anner Bylsma, for instance, than to Yo-yo Ma. But then perhaps I'd have to worry about over-interpretation.I've been tacitly rebuked recently for not calling listeners' attention to Rachel Podger.

Harink is at his best when he focuses on Hauerwas and Yoder; he proves quite effectively that he understands each better than most critics (and critical readers). Unfortunately, when Harink turns to Wright, his examination falls apart and even turns into a vicous ad hominem attack at several points. Harink does not display a thorough understanding of Wright's work and, as one the previous reviewers on this page has noted, his summary is really a parody of Wright. Sadly, the weaknesses in the chapter on Wright betray further weaknesses in his scholastic aptitude, and his inability to comprehend the most important international \\"postliberal\\" Pauline scholar forces the reader to question whether he really has a grip on postliberalism (or Paul) at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design, why it must be a classic!","review":"I was using a \\"P\\" sized Cokin before, but with a 65mm lens on a 4X5 camera I was getting vigenetting.

I liked everything about it, including Cooper and Josie having to get books on childcare so they could learn enough to do it. One reviewer thought Josie was too inflexible, but I have been where Josie is and I felt her character was right on target. Yes, she took terrible advantage of Cooper's love for her, to the point where she almost lost him but poverty makes you do that and it is very hard to let go of the fear. If your parents were children during the Depression, you know the feeling because they don't let you forget the fear either. This is a couple, both professionals dedicated to their careers, who are suddenly faced with responsibility for little people and I loved Cooper for not letting these children go to strangers. Do not, do not, pass this one up. I read it and immediately began to read it again. Definitely a keeper and one of Brockmann's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird priorities","review":"Too much bickering, and strange priorities - got halfway through before I couldn't take it any more.

By the end of the book I was wondering about Cooper's mental health. No sane person would have put up with her antics. I love Ms Brockman's writing but this book was difficult to finish. There was no one to root for except the kids and you had to wonder what would become of them living in that dysfunctional household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brockmann is not at her best here","review":"I'm a big Brockmann fan. I've read all of the Tall, Dark and Dangerous and Troubleshooters titles, but this one was so trite and predictable. I couldn't finish it.

I was rewarded beyond my wildest dreams by the 3 complete quintets on the disc. Boccherini is an unjustly neglected composer and now I am absolutely \\"hooked\\" on his music, having bought an additional album of quintets and an album of cello sonatas with more purchases on the way. The music has an elegant vitality that makes it an absolute delight to listen to. If you love Haydn and Mozart but haven't yet made the acquaintance of Boccherini, lose no time in buying this CD. It's a fantastic introduction to this genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable throughout","review":"Boccherini's music is elegant and charming and has an unmistakable spanish flavour to it, I cannot recommend this CD more, even the cover virgin has chosen depicting a fragment of a picture by Tiepolo cannot be more apposite.

It WILL open your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb in every way","review":"This is simply one of the greatest works of non-fiction, and I only stop there because it's so difficult to categorize. History, biography, science and sociology seamlessly mingle in some of the most ecstatic -- yet not over-the-top -- prose one is likely to encounter. This is one of those books that you are truly sad to see end, so rich is Stevens' portrayal of a time and its remarkable characters, Leary and Kesey foremost among them. For once a book that deserves the epithet 'remarkable'."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to keep a baseball card enthusiast happy!","review":"I purchased this set of 500 cards for my grandson's 9th birthday.

Doubles would be no big deal, but in some cases there were up to 21 of the same card! There was not a single card older than 1992.

Since this gift is going to a 9 y/o as part of his first collection, it doesn't set a very good example. What really 'set me off' was opening the US Postal box and finding the cards there....no separate container, just the cards laying there, a couple of them bent at the corners.

My wife and I picked this book up because it was the cheapest guide on the shelf. You get what you pay for. This edition, at least, is out of date - many of the places of interest noted in the book have closed down or changed significantly. The maps in the book are limited to a very small area of downtown St. Paul and Minneapolis - yet the book recommends plenty of places that are off the maps provided. Finally, having gotten used to Lonely Planet guides, it's hard to fathom how this author could make his topic as dull as he does.

Then one of the extremely thin keys starts to stick... then another. You unstick them but now they aren't on the same level as the other keys. Then the mouse starts to go non-responsive -- first the motion is erratic, then the pointer starts to periodically jump around on its own.

However, that was about a year ago. Now all three keyboards have several sticky keys, and often it is difficult to get them unstuck. I am now at the point where I am wasting too much time fiddling with the keyboard and am just going to trash all three. Not worth the continual headaches. For this reason, I cannot recommend this combo (especially the keyboard), unless you are willing to replace it after a year or so of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Keyboard","review":"My computer is hooked up to my wide screen TV, so I sit on the sofa about 8 ft back and use the computer.

A great keyboard/mouse combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The mouse stopped working after a few days, the laser went out. I contacted the seller (Beach Audio) and they said my recourse was with the manufacturer. How worthless are they?

I have read it dozens of times. There is a lot of truth in it, although it describes a world which has vanished, so who knows exactly what happened? It's witty, gay, jaunty, humorous, and yet it leaves you scratching your head. There's a degree of cruelty and sadness that grounds it in reality. Hmm, could this have really happened? Indeed, if you are a consumer of Mitfordiana. you will know that it did,in a way, and you can embark on a long journey through the dozens of memoirs, collected letters and assorted works of fiction trying to live in Nancy Mitford's weird world.

After being a fan of the incredible Twilight Zone of course I had to start working on getting Night Gallery. I have only watched a couple of episodes so far because I just received my Season 3 copy. But I am very pleased with what I have seen. The episodes seem to take the Twilight Zone to increased heights. Dwelling with supernatural issues like ghosts, witches, Demonic issues as well. It's also great to see the old actors and actress' of that time period of Night Gallery which makes the set worthwhile. Bill Bixby and Vincent Price to name a few. Now that I have season 3 , the other Seasons won't be far off to purchase. Why did I wait so long to buy this? I'll never know but it won't be long until I have the whole set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final chapter of a classic tv series","review":"As a child, I was always drawn to The Night Gallery because of its dark humor, macabre story lines and guest stars.

But I do realize it's mostly my fault for not checking before I bought it. I was just too excited. So with that being said, I'm divided on which way I should rate this item, because the movie uncut is a masterpiece. It's so funny and super gory, but the R-rated version is a damn shame. Since it's the item I'm rating I'm going to give it one star because it's the R-rated version. The movie deserves a solid six....Now I have to cough up more money for the real version.

There was no way that it could measure up to Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. But if they were good, this one is too, right?Wrong. The first day I had it, I was already bored. What makes the game even more aggravating is that you have to get all 242 stars to beat it. You also have to beat all the bosses twice (or more). I still wonder why I bought the game.The music and levels are beautiful, but sadly it doesn't contribute to the fun of the game. If it weren't for them, I would give it one star. This would be a wonderful game to rent, but don't buy it.

But I then found out within the first 10 minutes that alot of it is video watching and playing boring missions (i.e. Playing Hide and Seek with a rabbit).

This is definitely a must get game for the Wii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly flawless gem of a game","review":"This game is tons of fun! It's got many different worlds and 121 'stars' which are like levels.The controls are tight and responsive. It's a deffinite step in the right direction.Unfortunately, it's also a tad easy, especially if you play with the second player to 'freeze' all of the badguys. I played without the second player and still only died a handful of times, usually on the timed courses or by accident as opposed to it being too difficult.Many of the levels are also small and short, which was dissapointing.Don't let that throw you, though, it's still the best game I've played for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Mario games ever!!!","review":"One of my favorite things about the game is being able to fly through the galaxies and explore all the cool themes.

When you start the game Bowser comes to take Peach. You get on the castle but you get blasted into space. When you arrive on the Comet Observatory (The main place in the game) Rosalina tells you what she is doing and How to get Peach Back from Bowser to get to Bowser you have to get enough Power Stars by going to multiple Galaxys and finding Power Stars. Once you get enough power stars and have moved to the last Galaxy then you get to the boss galaxy, Boss galaxys only have one level but instead of getting a power star you get a Grand star. You get one Grand star in each dome. once you get a grand star the power opens in a new dome."},{"rating":"2","title":"play all the way through!","review":"With this game the fun never stops!

I cannot believe how much content is in this game. There are so many different things to do that fully utilizes the functionality of the Wii remote...from general movement to balancing on a ball to riding a sting ray in the water. Mario can even be shot like a slingshot from stickey spider webs. A lot of thought went in to this game, it is truly amazing. I just got it for Christmas, but I feel it is not too difficult for an older child/adult (except the Sweet Sweet Galaxy) but is a bit advanced for a younger child."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"My husband and I (ages 32 and 28) love this game!!! My 6.5 year old loves helping her dad play by using the second controller and helping him collect stars (which is great as she can do that and feel involoved without messing up the game). The games is very entertaining and has the same charm as previous Mario games. Walking upside down in some of the worlds is a little different and you have to get use to it.

I was a little nervous buying it, as I'm not 15 anymore :-) (38, actually) and I didn't know if I'd get the hang of it.

This takes similar gameplay mechanics and level design and brings the game into the \\"next-generation\\".THIS GAME SHINES WITH GREAT LEVEL DESIGN AND INGENUITY.The play difficulty has a good range, so that I think someone without much experience can get into it... though I suggest they start at the beginning to learn the moves. My first time playing was in a game store and I had a hard time, because I didn't know the new moves Mario had. Keep that in mind if you play it in a store. Otherwise, I think that this can appeal to both younger audience (as it is playable for them) and hard-core gamers as there is sufficient difficulty.An inclusion of multi-player cooperative is fun, but I don't think it's meant for two hard-core gamers. The second player can be played quite well by small kids, which has been great with my nephews and niece. They simply point and collect the star bits, and have great fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love this game","review":"It would not be fair for me to write a review based on my opinion.

Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I've been a fan of Mario since I saved up $99 to buy my first NES in 1990 just so I could play Super Mario Bros. I must say, things have certainly changed since that title first came out. It was interesting how pictures/music/etc. of that first game still popped up in this gameI didn't know if I'd like Super Mario Galaxy, the whole idea of a \\"Galaxy\\" turned me off, I like jumping/swimming on large land masses, and not planet hopping. I was relieved though to find this game was very well done, and there are plenty of galaxies with normal land masses, swim areas, you name it, and of course there are places where you're planet hopping.My only complaint about the game is the camera angles. They seem to rarely be enabled. There were certain times in the game I would have liked to see a different angle on mario, to make a complicated jump, or view something afar, and the camera wouldn't let me. Other than that, this game was great fun, very addicting though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very novel gameplay makes Mario a winner on Wii","review":"This game is quite different than anything you've ever played before. As you move through the cosmos, you will be surprised again and again at the creativity behind the level designs. It's simply a game that will make you smile, whether you're a casual or hardcore gamer who has a weak spot for the plumber.The controls are fairly conventional - you use the analog directional stick on the nunchuk to move and press the big \\"A\\" button to jump. Most of the time, the motion-sensitive Wii-mote is only used to spin, which requires only a quick jerk. You'll also use the Wii-mote to point at star bits and collect them, which is relatively entertaining.Overall, this is a great game - probably the best so far for a great system with a small library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM SOLD ON NINTENDO","review":"I was a fan of the playstaion every since the first one came out in the 90's.

After playing a while with this game I'm really surprised how this game is. The graphics are totally amazing. This game proves Wii doesn't need HD.

I am around a 1/4 of the way through the game and severely addicted! It brings in aspects of a lot of the older games into this new inventive world.

The whole family got involved including my one year old son, but he was not a big help though he did eat all his dinner watching us play:) The game can make you absolutely crazy in parts. But, some of the levels are so creatively ingenious you have to wonder if the programers channelled Lumas floating in the milky way. The characters of these games became imaginary friends for the whole family. They are always here, and I'm sure many years in the future we will remember playing this game together.

First, you sit through a lame opening with Bowser kidnapping Princess Peach for the thousandth time. Then you, go through a'bunch of tutorials.. what's with Nintendo's \\"hold-your-hand\\" bullsh---? I understand how to play videogames. I don't need help with the 1000th Mario game. There's far too much tutorial and beginner stages. It gets tedious. There's really nothing much here. You jump around, and save some princess. I don't want to sit through 2 hours of easy stages to learn that, nor does Nintendo's target audience (children).Same concept for nearly 2 decades, and Nintendo can't seem to do it right.Let's hope Galaxy 2 has a skip-able tutorial or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mario has lost his way since the days of the 8 bit nintendo. While Super Mario Galaxy is an improvement from Sunshine, I think that Mario 64 is better than Galaxy. The best of the Super Mario series of course being 1 and 2.I found the orientation of Galaxy to be disorienting and uncomfortable. As Mario, you move from planet to planet as levels. The object typically being to find and collect the Super Star. Each planet is like a ball that you run around on, but the camera does not change perspective. [..]Graphically, this game looks good for a Wii game, though only somewhat better than what you would expect from a Gamecube. The music scores are orchestrated, but uninspired. The music from the old 2D Mario games were much more spirited."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!!!","review":"I hate Super Mario Galaxy!

Who thinks of transforming into a bee, leaping across planets, and spinning into ice-skates? Besides all these, Super Mario Galaxy has the most interesting gravity--it is a main point of the game to use the flipping gravity to cross the levels. The levels are difficult even for returning Mario fans, but the challenges aren't impossible.Visually, this is the most awesome game I have ever seen.

It goes right back to the Dark Ages (the early 90's) with its terrible save option which means you have to do a ton of stuff over and over again before getting to the point where you last were. This completely ruins it. Maybe the 'retro' aspect of this game also had a 'retro' appalling save element in it, but it makes the game unplayably tedious"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive in any way.","review":"I really don't understand the appeal of this game. There is nothing impressive or original in this game. The control is terrible. You'll waste a lot of time falling off of the edges of the planets into outer space and starting all the way over. The graphics are fine for the Wii but the Wii is really just a gamecube. You spend most of your time running around and jumping on beetles or shooting stars into marshmellow aliens mouths. I'm pretty much the only person I know that doesn't like this game so you'll probably love it but I just had to say something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"#1.

I guess they're trying to set up a storyline, but the kids just want to play, not sit through several 2-3 minute videos. And if you don't reach the 1st spot where the game will save, you have to sit through all of them again. I don't know why all of the recent Mario games insist on making you wade through \\"extras\\" (you have to hit the \\"A\\" button 100 times to get through different intro screens for each event on Winter Olympics...painfully tedious), but we've really soured on \\"Mario\\" games because of it and won't be buying any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative new take on classic Mario","review":"I really enjoyed playing this game it was very creative and involving.

It's a bit distracting so I just play solo. You can play as Luigi if you collect about 120 stars but I feel you should have the option to play him or Mario whenever you want.The game seems easy at first but the more stars you collect, the more harder it gets.I highly recommend Super Mario Galaxy if you're old school Nintendo player like me.

Of course, without the unsightly cables, there'd be no audio or video, either.

Then he combines drawing and painting to launch into ways of being creative with color and light. The book ends dealing with backgrounds, depth, and finding new ideas.Appropriate to an art instruction book, there is an abundance of illustrated examples, step-by-step pictorial demonstrations, and very stunning completed paintings.

Some of Dawson's rules are in the category of \\"duh!\\" and others make no sense. His points are usually illustrated by his own work, including landscapes (quite interesting), cityscapes (often dramatically lit but oddly unmoving), and portraits (sappy, sentimentalized, and including a few real bodice-rippers).

Supposedly, there are certain ways to play around the bug, but I've tried this level four times (wasting about an hour each time) only to have my Xbox 360 crash whenever I get to the creek in the Battle of Endor level. I'll continue trying because I'm a completist, but failure to properly playtest a game is inexcuseable.Unfortunately, LucasArts has shown no interest in fixing this flaw, which is absurd.

Well, it's more like blocking with your lightsaber until their attacks are done, and then hitting them 3, or 4 times to stop them. This gets old realy, really fast. Especially since they keep constantly popping out and attacking. It's the equal of cutting a steak with a butter knife. It's just plain awkward. Overall this game just felt rushed, and I was shocked that so many game reviewers gave it good marks.

There are a few clips maybe worth having, depending on your tastes. The first is some kind of inquisition victim girl who has a protuding part of her upper charms burned and then removed, but it's quite fakey (you can see the rubber). Then there's some very brief glimpes of things like a girl tied up on a wall, some fallen nuns or something with spears in them, stuff like that, but nothing really long enough to concentrate on. Finally at the end (with a tired thumb on the fast forward button) we have the heroine tied to a tree to be skinned, some partial nudity there, but I didn't find it to be erotic, kind of grim, really.So, I don't know, maybe a half star for the nip scene. That's generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hibiscus-y and Rasberry-esque","review":"****Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!Recommended.****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music When It Was...","review":"I have to admit, I haven't yet seen the video... but I saw it live on TNN, and it was outstanding!

Not everyone needs or wants tarot decks sagging with bloated elves and overly cute fairies, or crowded with pseudo-medieval tarts and knaves. I don't think this deck would ever have been one for beginners, but it might have had its place in the tarot scheme of things. But the cardstock is flimsy beyond belief, the folder-holder is crap, and the book is questionable. On top of that, the card numbering in the Major Arcana is in error (not \\"different\\"; WRONG), and no one caught it before the set went to print.

They witness a jewel robbery and testify in court. Therefore, put in the Witness Protection Program. They are put in literally hundreds of new places before they find themselves in Austrailia. (Don't worry, they don't show all of their new homes.) They want to become apart of the popular crowd, but they have two surfer boyfriends. I don't want to give the whole story away, but you get the idea. (Hopefully!)ConclusionThis would be a good movie for girls between 5 and 12 years old. It has a good plot that is very original.

They change their identities about 4 million times before being sent on the last place of earth: Australia! The fact that they filmed on location gave you a nice scenery of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Of course, they meet two surfer rebel guys and a snobby girl, Victoria. There is slight, yet tasteful, bathroom humor and they actually have TWO parents.Two goons working for the head of an Eastern European Mobster find them in Sydney and attempt to find the diamond, the twins prove that they're smarter and catch the REAL bad guy (goon from an imaginary country called Urugli) and save the day!

In this particular movie, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen start out in high school. After witnessing a theft, they become the prey of the thief's uncle. They then become part of the FBI's Witness Protection Program, which means they get a new home and a completely new identity. They move to beautiful Sydney, Australia and struggle to fit in (as if they wouldn't!) at high school. They meet some REALLY HOT guys and, as usual, fall in love with them. This movie would be for girls (ages 6-16), I would say. Boys might stay awake through this movie, but they wouldn't enjoy it.

Although that may sound depressing, it is not the core of the movie and doesn't detract from the other stories. Some of the acting is good, some actors we'll probably never see in another movie. The characters Alex and Gracie are enjoyable to watch, they are able to portray a true attraction for each other. Their \\"love scene\\" is too brief for those die hard romantics...but it was nice to watch. If you like kisses with passion, you'll enjoy those two.

That one of the community's most notable families unexpectedly comes face to face with one of its members who falls in love with another womyn, a former community member who is a nurse at the Hospice. In both heart-warming and heart-breaking ways this movie shows the indomitable human right of love and dignity.I personally enjoyed this movie a great deal even though some of the acting seemed a bit stilted.

Bad acting, bad storyline. enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"two hours and $10 i'll never get back...","review":"i'm normally a fan of the indy gay film. i'm normally able to overlook bad acting and a mildly predictable storyline in the name of supporting queer visibility. i just couldn't do it with this film. the acting was so stiff it was painful. the storyline tried really hard to be funny and origional, but it failed miserably. the charicters were two dimentional and inauthentic, the plot was shallow and the jokes weren't funny. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this \\"movie\\" even made?","review":"Who did they think would spend money to see this? It's kind of like a low-budget \\"after-school special\\" with amateur actors, something which might be shown in a progressive-minded high school to teach kids in backwater towns that homophobia is unpleasant. There is really no reason why any relatively intelligent being would want to suffer through this. Let's count the redeeming qualities: uh, that would be Zero. Go see \\"Brokeback Mountain!\\" Definitely watch \\"The Opposite of Sex,\\" watch \\"Longtime Companion\\" or \\"It's My Party.\\" Even watch \\"Philadelphia\\" - but avoid this waste-of-time-in-a-box like the plague. (And no, it's not even bad enough to be funny.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exaggerated and lacking...","review":"Here's one that will NOT be joining the ranks in my personal library of lesbian/gay films, which includes Desert Hearts, High Art, When Night is Falling, Bound, The Incredibly True Adventure..., Forbidden Love, The Crying Game to name a few. \\"It's in the Water\\" is rife with stereotypes, mostly with a tongue-in-cheek approach. Yet I found myself falling victim to my own stereotypes, because I never for one moment honestly believed the female leads in earnest. The men portrayed in the movie, even in their exaggerated-ness, were much truer to their identities. I'm sorry, but the one female lead (don't know her name) looks like Kathie Lee Gifford's twin. I know! lesbians can be glamorous, too, but I just couldn't buy into this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever is in the Water...it aint good!","review":"I'm harsh with lesbian movies...and this dvd is a good example as to why.Plot:Really pretty strait chick leaves husband for unattractive lesbian: Horrible make-out scene's follow.I considered tearing my eyes from my skull as I watched the lame acting of the brunette in this flick. I don't know who she is, or who told her she could act, but someone screwed up big-time!The 'love scene' was a complete rip off. Ugly, stumpy legged brunnete lesbian crawls into bed with sweet looking blonde woman...and the screen fades to black.Wow.(...)Skip this (...) movie...for your own sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes!","review":"I've read only fair to great reviews on this movie. Don't be deceived! This movie doesn't even qualify as being fair. Apparently in our desire to be represented in any way other than stereotypes on the screen, gay people are willing to accept horrible writing, story cliches and bad acting as the norm. Don't! There are more positive portrayls out there.This movie was just plain awful. It was predictable, plodding and was so cheesy it smelled like old Velveeta. It may have gotten better in the last 30 minutes -- doubtful though -- because it was so bad I shut it off.If you are looking for a gay positive movie, there are SO many more out there. Don't waste your time on this.I normally don't write reviews, but after seeing everyone praise a movie that is so CLEARLY mediocre, I had to do something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until it's on clearance","review":"...the gay men in this movie aren't portrayed well at all. They tried to appeal to both gay men and lesbians and didn't pull it off. They did little or no character development on any of the male actors. The acting ranges from fair (Alex) to very bad (Grace). The directing is poor at best. I found myself wanting to skip forward at times because I was bored to tears. And what's with Alex's mother? She was funny for about the first five minutes and then it got REAL stale. As a lesbian, I will add this to my library of DVDs, but I wish I had bought it off the clearance rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing attempt at gay comedy","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this film. The main characters lacked chemistry and the plot wasn't believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROAN","review":"Watch this with a gin and tonic you then need to get up and get another gin. Very disapointing rather dull movie. Bought this from previous reviews and what a waste of money, it neither well acted or funny and the story line is as weak as water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for Insomnia Found","review":"Feeble comedy features an implausible story about \\"Gay panic\\" in a small Southern town. With poor production values, flat acting, crummy camerawork and plenty of PC bludgeoning, _It's in the Water_ fails on nearly every level. Still, film-festival audiences lapped up this dreck, possibly because it portrays Straight people as complete morons and Gays as saints-in-training. I believe I may have chuckled once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, cute...","review":"This movie will never win any awards, but it's a low budget look at bigotry and intolerance with some decent jokes and one-liners. Acting is OK, actors are nice to look at. Go in knowing it's a \\"poke fun, anything's possible, low budget look into gay life\\" and I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the silliest movie i've ever seen!","review":"Although far better than Bar Girls, this movie ranks high in the \\"stupid lesbian movie\\" category. It's funny though, and I somehow recommend seeing it... but don't buy it. I won't ruin the ending for you, but it will undoubtedly inspire laughter. e.g: ha ha ha! Happy Viewing! Watch it after a breakup to remind you not to date those dreaded: \\"bi-curious\\" girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"Quite honestly....this is the worst gay & lesbian themed-movied I have ever seen. The acting was awful, the characters were ridiculous, and the script was lacking anything desirable. I found nothing humorous about this movie. It only sparked my interest because I'm in Texas and the thought of a gay movie filmed in Texas shocked me. I wouldn't waste any money or time watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing In This Water...","review":"If you're looking for actors who can act...don't buy this dvd! The storyline is cute, but the two main characters have no chemistry whatsoever. The sex scene was pathetic...the actresses looked so uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable! Don't waste your money on this one, save it for \\"Better Than Chocolate\\" or \\"When Night Is Falling\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice down to earth lesbian movie","review":"This movie is by no means top notch Hollywood stuff, as is the case with most lesbian movies. The plot is pretty predictable and the acting in some cases is a little forced, but there is most definitely something about this movie.If you are looking for a cute, heartwarming story, then you will enjoy this. Of course there is certainly nothing wrong with having to watch Keri Jo Chapman who plays the main character.So I am not giving this movie 4 stars for its production value, but for the fact that it is a really nice feelgood movie without your typical stereotypical lesbian characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring one","review":"I decided to watch this one because of all the positive reactions I saw here. But the movie fails.The concept seemed to be quite interesting, but the product doesn't deliver anything. There no chemistry between characters in this film, some of the actors play as if it was their very first time in front of camera, the others played on my nerves.There is not so many films with gay AND les plot, but this one is really dreadful.Don't lose money on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat Condescending","review":"The premise is cute - a rumor that the water was making people gay. However, setting the scene with ultra stereo-typed 'straight' homophobes pitted against an AIDS hospice was just in bad taste. All the gays in this film are the extended maximum stereotypes as well, making the entire cast look insensitive, stupid and annoying. To add to the distate, it takes place in Texas (well, maybe that part did make sense). The characters are all stupid, annoying and two-dimensional. I feel like I wasted my time just writing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate... since there isn't much else.","review":"By my way of thinking, there are three ways to look at it.The first - it's great for a genre that rarely gets the funding to produce anything at all, much less something this inventive.The second - compared to movies outside its genre, it's poorly written, poorly acted and poorly filmed. Hate to say it, but it's true.The third (and probably the most reaslistic) - it's an endearing enough idea that could have been better had the budget been there to hire someone to write a better script to be performed by better actors (perhaps some who are actually gay instead of beautiful straight women who seem more like they're experimenting than actually coming to terms with their sexual orientation). As it is, there was no budget, so some of the better actors overcome the dialogue that isn't so great, making this a fine and somewhat enjoyable way to kill a few hours just before bed. At least they tried, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with indies","review":"Although I, too, appreciated the story and the message which this film sent, I couldn't help but think about one of the sad facts of \\"indie\\" GLTB film making, i.e., indie = not very well made. \\"In the Water\\" basically could have used a way, WAY more competent screenwriter, a way, WAY more incisive director, and with a few exceptions, way, way, WAY more talented actors, as opposed to those who are graduates of the Indie Filmmaking School of Hysterical Overacting. As it happened, I watched \\"Water\\" on the same evening as I watched \\"Hairspray\\". I fully understand, of course, that \\"Water\\" probably had a total budget equal to John Travolta's wardrobe costs in \\"Hairspray\\", but the contrast was there nonetheless. And not in \\"Water's\\" favor. In short, watchable for the message. Pretty gruesome in the execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's In the Water","review":"Paula's opening reveiw of the film was harsh and laced with a snobish attitude toward Queer culture and this film. God forbid if a film entertains while playing with stereotypes that are so inherent in Southern culture. \\"It's in the Water\\" is wildly funny and a pleasure to watch! It's a noble piece of work, that belongs in any top collection of independent cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute co-stars!","review":"Before I purchased this movie, I read some other reviews and one of them said this movie had the best line before the first kiss ever and I must agree. In my opinion (straight girl for 38 years and lately I have asking what if?), this is one of the best movies I have seen with a lesbian theme. This movie had several parts that hit very closed to home. For example, one of the girls in the movie goes and rents 7 or 8 movies with lesbian themes because of feelings she is having; I purchased almost the same ones she rented. My reaction to watching the movies were about the same as hers. One more point. There were no sex scenes in this movie but some beauitful kissing. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth you time","review":"Okay, the acting isn't that great and the characters are a little stereotypical, but this film is still fun and worth watching. It addresses real social issues--coming out, AIDS, prejudice--in a faily light-hearted style that will keep your attention and not leave you feeling cheated by the film's shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! so cute! but $10 more than Target Store","review":"Bought this for our newborn son. It is $20 @ Target.com but totally out of stock. found this for $30 on Amazon and bought it. I like the clear mid section which allows light to shine through. Monkey pattern are nicely stitched on fabrics on the clear plastic part, not printed on. Love the good quality. Also, its height is 70 inches which is hard to find. I have an older home from the 1940s and the curtain rod wall holders are set low ( guess it must be popular back then ). Standard 72 inches curtain will be dragging on floor. I am very happy to find something fit well and super cute! P.S. I found one later in Target store for $20 one week later. I didnt bother to return this because of shipping cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Albert King 2","review":"This guy is somthing else, just listen to his licks, and it's like King Albert's back with us again.His singing and song writing are great also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product, poor support","review":"I'm happy with the speed and reliablity of the drive, however I wanted to make it bootable. I exchanged several email's with them and they eventually told me to \\"go find a free one on the Internet\\". I can't believe that they don't know how to make there own drive bootable, or even point me to a specific place to download a tool that would.When I bought an HP USB key drive they had a small tool I could run to make the drive bootable, supplied by HP. If I can't make it bootable using format, sys.exe or any other normal means, I expect the company to provide a tool for me. I don't think that's asking too much. Poor customer service and support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad deal, Good Hand Warmer","review":"I have a client running 8 of these drives by La Cie and they have replaced 6 of them within 1 year of purchase. They are not designed to be left running 24/7 because they overheat. My client has lost years worth of data due to the failure rate. What's with using Firewire still anyway? Get a FN clue La Cie and put a fan inside and lose the firewire, fricken MAC lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable","review":"After about an hour of use, this hard drive just stops communicating with the computer. Information can't be stored or retrieved. Turning it off and then on again sometimes helps, but not for long. Turning it off for longer (> 1 hour) does allow it to be used again, but only temporarily.After trying everything I could think of to get it to work consistently, I returned it for a replacement. The replacement behaved exactly the same, which indicates this is probably a design flaw, rather than a defective unit.(I'm using a Compaq PC with XP, and have had no trouble with other USB2.0 externals.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty performance, useless for iTunes","review":"I purchased this hard drive to use as my music library with my Mac and iTunes. It doesn't work. As the drive heats up, iTunes will only play portions of a song, then move on to the next song. This does not happen with other hard drives, just the La Cie Porsche design hard drives and many others have had the same problem (check the iTunes forum over at Apple.com and you'll see).Also, when hot, the drive will frequently do odd things, showing full folders as empty. Yes, these drives are cheap compared to the prices of others on the market, but in the end, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!","review":"I've never taken the time to write a review, but since I've given this thing so much of a chance to prove itself that now I can't return it, the least I can do is try to save someone else some grief.Like all the other reviews...it work wells for a day or so. Then it starts unmounting during file transfers. It skips when playing songs off it with iTunes. Some files even vanished and then reappeared days later! All this happens during the rare times I am able to get the thing to actually mount. Hopefully I'll get one more mount out of it so i can transfer my data when I buy my next non-LaCie external hard drive!DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I have been using this drive for 4 months and I am very pleased with it.I am using it with 2 pc (laptop and desktop) and I perform full backups quite often.The drive is fast and reliable.

Infact, four of the picks slipped through the unsealed box. Not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gloves","review":"These gloves are great for kickboxing. They are really comfortable and give you a lot of support - good for your wrists.

Those were very well used and so roomier than if bought new in that size. I researched and measured my knuckles at 7 inches. These gloves were medium and fit EXACTLY. The label I read online said 7 inches or slightly bigger I would say no bigger than 7. They are good gloves they fit well with no irritating seems on the inside to rub you raw even after using them several times a week for going on three months. They have good wrist support and padding. And they were about 20 dollars cheaper than the Century brand which I liked a lot too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harbinger bag gloves for women","review":"I teach a kickboxing class with a heavy bag and I have used 3 different brands of gloves, my class and I agree these gloves are by far the best, comfortable when you first use them and wear really well.

Unfortunately (and this may be my fault) I ended up with bloody knuckles after 1 kickboxing class. Granted, I hit hard, and I didn't listen to my body when my hands started hurting.. but I feel like gloves should protect your knuckles, and for some reason the way they rubbed my hands, ended up tearing the skin off. I still like them, and I still intend to use them now that my cuts have healed. I guess I will just try not to hit so hard, plus my kickboxing instructor said it was pretty normal for this to happen the first few times you use this style of glove. I'm just so happy to have a pair that fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm","review":"Diet Coke is delicious, and I drink it pretty much all day.

This was one of the first books written by and NFL official about officiating so I loved it!John McDonough was a referee in the AFL from 1960 until the merger with the NFL 10 years later. He officiated in the merged NFL until his retirement after the 1973 season. He was the referee of Super Bowl IV and he was the referee of the longest game ever played between the Dolphins and Chiefs on December 25, 1971.After he retired from the NFL, he was supervisor of officials of the WFL and he writes about those two crazy years.In 2009, while the AFL is getting some retro-love, you'll find this a great unofficial history of the AFL. McDonough talks about officiating, and tells some hilarious stories. His story about running the Miami Dolphins kickoff team through a military color guard with President Richard Nixon watching is worth the price of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK as a time piece but misleading title","review":"A nice enough flashback to life in the 50's, but I felt mislead by the title. The \\"vampire\\" action is only a couple of chapters at the end. This is barely a \\"horror\\" story, it's more of a coming-of-age of 3 friends, a la \\"The Wonder Years\\", but with 16-17yr olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laymon does it again!","review":"Just finished reading this strange book...of course most of Richard Laymons books are strange but good! I cannot get enough of his writing...so different. I would highly recommend this book in the long list of his books, never a dull moment and the ending is great.However, I would not really call this a horror novel (scarey in a few places), it is more of a relationship novel about some kids and their fears. Kind of creepy in a few places.Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been much better","review":"Luckily this isn't the first book I've read by this author, because it probably would've been my last. This book has very little to do with The Traveling Vampire Show, except for a tiny bit in the beginning, and then at the end. The rest of the time, the book meanders all over the place, following the characters around their town. It was quite a letdown and not at all what I'd thought the story would be like. I'd spend your money on another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"What a waste of money!! Out of the 40 vampire books that I have purchased in the last 2 years, this was the most disappointing one I have come across. The story line drags out and spends too much time on the relationship of the characters, and very little time on the vampire. This book waited until the last 100 pages or so to introduce the vampire and even then it was a letdown. This is definitely a book that I would recommend passing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Sophomoric Crap","review":"Having loved Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked...\\" I was eager for a story in a similar vein (no pun intended). What I got instead was 400 pages of flat characters wandering about an anonymous town doing stupid things. Laymon even chickened out on the ending. If you're an adolescent with an overactive libido that needs release, go for it, but if you want plot, suspense, or characters to care about, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Money","review":"After all the good reviews, I decided to give this one a chance. Phew. What can I say? Laymon's characterizations are shallow as wallpaper, and the pace of the book is plodding in the extreme. The author piles on detail after mundane detail, often taking several sentences just to move one of his characters across a room--which would be fine, if something actually happened along the way. I also found his character's adolescent obsession with catching glimpses of women's bras and breasts embarrassing (for him, not for me). I agree with others here who have said that these kids seem more like 12 than 16. I persevered to the end, though, just to see where it was all going. Wish I could say it was worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP! Save Your Money! You've Got To Believe Me!","review":"Stupid! Ridiculous! Moronic! Childish!, Don't believe the good reviews on this book they're lying to you! all of them liars!, either that or they have an IQ of 70 on a warm day (and that's being generous and polite). Richard Laymon's the most overrated (hack)horror writer out there(I've read 4 of his books and they all stunk), Read him only as a last resort or if you are easily entertained. Mr Laymon's writing style is immature, opportunistic, uncreative, sloppy, and plain old fashioned stupid.

Horror novels are not exactly on the level of Shakespeare, but I do expect them to have a cohesive plot, realistic character development, and some actual enjoyment factor. This book felt like it was written by an over-sexed adolescent who failed his creative writing course in middle school. I am flummoxed as to how this piece of trash won a any award-even the not-so distinguished Bram Stoker's award. If your idea of a great story is a mix of clich��s and hormones, then by all means read \\" The Traveling Vampire Show\\".

No, it didn't. The characters were bizarre and completely unrealistic. You keep waiting for the climax, you are lead on to this incredible conclusion, but then all the action happens in about 5 pages and the story ends with. . . \\"Well, that's my story.\\" And I say who cares!

Now i only got this book cuz i wanted to read a vampire story but this book turned out to be more about a relationship(teen) then about a vampire... now i had no problem with this book except...THE ENDING!!!!!!! i swear it left more questions then ANSWERS!!! Well in closing if you are looking for a VAMPIRE story don't pick this book. But if you are looking for a pretty good read then give it a try :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I agree entirely with the other negative reviews on this novel. Stephen King is the master of combining coming of age with a good horror story and Richard Laymon has not challenged him at all. I found the story irritating and the plot twists were invariably a disappointment.If you want a good horror read do not buy this book, if you want coming of age read Catcher in the Rye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictingly Good","review":"Wow! I REALLY enjoyed this book. So much so, that I stayed up WAY too late to finish it because it was just so suspenseful. I seriously could not put it down for even one second! I really liked the writing style, not to mention the very-charming characters. And while not everything was explained, it somehow didn't bother me as much as it normally would... everything just worked. And the author is from Illinois!! I will DEFINITELY be keeping an eye out for other books by him! What an exciting thing to find a new author with such an extensive backlog of books to discover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"The catchy title had me wanting to read this book for quite some time now. I hate to be hard on Laymon, but if there is a word I could use to describe this book it would be...weak. It could have been a lot better! The story kind of drags along with not too much happening. The ending had a little twist that made the book a little better, but in general was a little unrealistic. Not the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror(ible) at Best","review":"I would have rather spent my time reading the dictionary. As a coming of age story it was kind of sweet. However as a 38 yr old man I started to get a little uncomfortable reading page after page about the thoughts goopings of horny teens. The book is boring, repetitive, and overall pretty lame. I need to purge my memory of this book. Maybe I'll read Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good ended as a bungled mess","review":"This one will get your hopes up at first but leaving you wondering why you even bothered at the end. IT seems like the author got lazy at the end or could not figure out what he wanted to do with it so he just copped out and left a lot of loose threads untied. I have seen some people comparing this to Robert R McCammons Boy's Life. Do be fooled Boy's Life is vastly better. This is not even in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The back cover of the book faviorably compares this book to Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. That comparison is meaningless hype. Read the reviews listed here. Those who mention Bradbury's book do not like this book. Those who like this book do not mention Something Wicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"children book","review":"I could never understand how people say this is his best book. If you are 13 and you like stories of little kids and teenage love and constant running around because of this worrying here and there then i understand. This book is not horror, nor exciting, nor gruesome like other laymon works and is simply a story of a few kids about a vampire show coming to town with a little bit of action and mild horror (literally two paragraphs) in the last 40 pages. It was ok to read, but it felt like a book i would read in 9-10th grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Painful to read. I bought this on the suggestion of other readers here at Amazon.

I will not be reading another book by this writer, but hey, now i know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SHOW-STOPPER","review":"Richard Laymon's THE TRAVELING VAMPIRE SHOW is a departure from his in-your-face suspense and gore. This time, atmosphere dominates this effective coming-of-age tale of forgiveness. Narrative Dwight takes you back to the early 60's to reminisce about a time where innocence ruled and curiosity had big consequences. Indeed, along with his friends, Dwight faces what is to be believed a vampire. His union is a roller coaster ride of the fittest, faith, trust, and of lost love. Laymon fanatics will be in for a treat as the suspense slowly escalates to a final slam-bang showdown. Valeria may be a cool villainess, but it's her Laymon creator that deserves all the attention. The guy had great talent.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Character Development...","review":"This book isn't as much a horror book as it is a story of a teenager growing up and having to deal with many different issues. What I like about this book is that Laymon found a way to keep the book scary but also leave room for character development. I read a lot of the reviews of this book and completely disagree with anyone who says there was too much character development. In my case I really got to know the characters of the book. By the end I felt like I could relate to them. Laymon does an excellent job and by far this is the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author had a few \\"issues\\"","review":"First of all, I think Laymon had some talent. He did seem to have good characterizations. I am going to try more Laymon books. Now that I said that, Laymon probably never got any action in his lifetime and had to fantacize repeatedly about the complete absence of bras in his fantasy world. Like other reviews: characters were not 16, more like 12. Ending was a complete cop out. After all of the trauma these characters went through, everything seems to be all peachy keen for them in the end. More realisticly, none of the characters that made it to the end could have ever looked at each other again and they would all be in therapy for the rest of their lives. If Laymon had spent a little more time on the ending and a little less time fantacizing about nude or nearly nude women, this review would have been much higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This was the second Laymon novel I have read, and it is certainly much better than Resurrection Dreams. The story takes place in 1963 and involves 3 young friends Dwight, Rusty and Slim(who happens to be a girl) The story is mainly about their quest to go see the Traveling Vampire Show and the series of strange events that lead up to it. Typical Laymon sprinklings of sex are found throughout with the ever horny Dwight lusting after Slim and his sister in law Lee. Having a lusty vampire Valeria doesn't help either. Most of the story is a coming of age tale, with the horror being racheted up in the final 50 pages or so. The story was interesting and kept me wanting to read just one more chapter before going to bed. Based on this book, I will be picking up more Laymon novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Laymon - Scary Theme, First Loves, and great characters","review":"Three 16 year old friends (Dwight, Rusty and their female friend Slim) hear about the Traveling Vampire Show coming to their small town, and make up their minds that they will attend despite being too young, being too scared, overlooking town curfues, and parental objections.The Traveling Vampire Show is a one night event at midnight, and highlights the gorgeous Valeria - the only living vampire in captivity. When strange events happen during the day prior to the show, the three friends begin to be concerned over their safety if they attend - as if that is enough reason to stop them from going!The show offers money to anyone able to survive 5 minutes in a cage with the gorgeous Vampire Valeria, and Rusty finds out that $500 may not be worth it! Dwights beautiful sister in law offers to fight Valeria to save Rusty, and the caged fight between the two women begins....Classic Laymon - great ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been shorter","review":"After reading the \\"The Traveling Vampire Show\\" by Richard Laymon I felt robbed. Three hundred and fifty pages of character development, with little story gusto. There's nothing wrong with character development if it was a novel but it's a horror book, which should mean more suspense and killings. If you read \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" by Ray Bradbury that's all you need to read. This story is about a couple of kids who wreck the plans of an evil vampire who comes to their small town in a traveling vampire show. That's it. The story doesn't come alive until the last fifty pages of a four hundred page book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading \\"The Traveling Vampire Show\\" is like . . .","review":"watching Jerry Springer. You know it's oversensationalized, can't happen in real life and can't get much lower, but somehow you just can't stop watching (or turning the pages in this case). The story has a comic book plot, a rehashed \\"vampire\\" character that could easily have been Vampirella by the way Laymon described her, and way too many references to a certain part of her anatomy, yet the oversexed, dysfunctional, and prone-to-violence teenagers in this story lend it a certain charm. I would have given this book one more star if it weren't for the fact that Frances and Dwight survived; had they died grisly deaths this mediocre exercise in pulp fiction would have been so much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRAVELING VAMPIRE SHOW","review":"I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT.

Not mature enough for adults and not appropriate for children. Also until the very end the plot was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU'RE 12","review":"I bought this book on the advice of several of your reviews, but it is certainly not for the discriminating horror reader. It is juvenile and silly and the middle 100 pages could be eliminated by saying, \\"Dwight's horney\\". I could have cared less about Dwight and his hard-ons, or Lee and her ripped-off blouse.The most interesting character, Bitsy, was not even given a hearing, much less a plot line. I can understand why Richard Laymon is more popular in Europe, where readers are less educated and far less well-read.This writer would not stand up two seconds next to King or even Saul or Koontz.If you're 12 and need some assistance with fanticization, buy this book. Everyone else forget Laymon. I'm sorry he died, but it may be for the best for the horror genre.Fort Wayne, Ind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stake Well Done!","review":"Laymon takes the \\"Bite\\" out of the vampire novel with this one. However, I found the book a lot of fun to read (can't believe I'm saying this about a \\"Horror\\" novel). The ending will keep you turning the pages so fast that your fingertips will sizzle! Nobody writes like Laymon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good coming of age horror story","review":"I think some people didn't get that this story is supposed to be a fun, coming of age horror novel. Laymon novels are always fun! I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It's too bad he passed away this year. He was a nice man, too. But I've heard there are a few more books he wrote that are tucked away somewhere, and they'll be published someday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I just finished reading this book. My overall feeling for this novel is SLOPPY. There were some enjoyable scenes (the fight scenes with Valeria, Slim's character, a few others) but they did not redeem the overall story. The ending was very abrupt as if the author was headed to a long vacation and didn't want to be bothered with an unfinished novel. And what is the fixation on clothes and lack there of? I feel it should of been titled \\"CLOTHES\\"! The vampire aspect of this book was a small ingredient. I cannot recommend this book. This is my first and last of Richard Laymon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought the premise was great but overall I was a disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much, but the book seemed cartoonish, reminding of an R-rated Scooby episode, the ending notwithstanding. The story is original and Laymon does a good job depicting the rural 60's setting. The characters are interesting, but their actions are sometimes puzzling and not believable. At times the teenagers acted like 10-year-old kids. If you are a big fan of vampire novels I think you should read this, but otherwise I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking great","review":"I love when a book genuinely scares and thrills and this one does. If you're a Layman fan, you'll love it. If you're new to him, it's a great place to start. Some of the most vivid and memorable characterizations ever. Extremely high recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"and you thought your childhood was screwed up...","review":"This book was all but perfect. It is a great story with a distinct feel of americana. During you truly find yourself rooting for the main character, who is quite likeable. This book delivers in the sense that by the end you are truly concerned about his welfare. The main lacking point in the ending. Laymon fails to tie up some of the loose ends which leaves the readers wondering well what happened next? All in all though a truly great book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Laymon","review":"I'm writing this review because I was pretty disapointed with the star rating you'd given it - I feel it deserves more. In TVS Laymon's character development is, as always, excellent (as it is in Bite, Body Rides and Blood Games). This, I feel, is one of the most important aspects of Laymon's books: his ability to INVOLVE you in the story and to create empathy for the characters. Keeping it short, I recommend this book to any Laymon fan who hasn't already read it - it's great. I am slightly biased though, I love anything Laymon writes (some more than others)."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been a short story","review":"The story had too much filler in it. The author could have cut this down considerably and made a decent short story. The best part of the book is the last 20 or 30 pages. This was my first Laymon book and it will probably be my last. Try Brian Lumley for a series of truly terrifying vampire books."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"The more I read Laymon, the more I dislike him. This is the 5th offering of his I've bought, and I am beginning to worry about the man's mental health. If you've read \\"Come Out Tonight\\" you'll undoubtedly notice the similarities between that book's villain, Toby Bones, and Rusty in \\"Travelling...\\". Fat, immature, delusional and degenerate. If I knew anyone remotely like either of these characters, I would quite happily punch him in the face. Laymon's characters tend to be inneffectual and irritating, and I implore anyone who is looking for an introduction to Laymon not to read this book. Go and read \\"The Midnight Tour\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy story and very sloppy proof reading","review":"I felt that the story had alot of potential, but zero follow through. I have read three other Laymon stories and liked them. It seemed to build the characters up pretty well, getting you to care what happens to them. But like alot of the reviews (2 or 1 star ones), the story just fizzled out. The ending seemed like some crazy twist was about to happen and Slim was going to be the hero/tough girl. And I was looking forward to the new story branch and then fizz.... story over.I dont know if this was just my Kindle version, but there were sooooo many grammatical errors and strange \\"pastings\\" of \\"- Richard Laymon\\" through out the book. I have not read any other reviews with this mentioned. Seriously, was it just my copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"This book is about friendship,having fun together and getting into trouble together. This is about the 4th book of Richard Laymon's that I've read and I have to say so far it is my favorite. This book has some violence and sexual overtures but I thought much less than some of his others. It's a great vampire story. I found the characters all very interesting and couldn't book the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh surprise","review":"I liked it. Maybe it's not the best I've read this season but it's a fast reading book quite entertaining and both innocent and wicked.

I unscrewed the whole valve brass part out, and drilled with a really fine drill to make the hole little bigger to let me NG pass through.However, to use with NG, I should add a metal plate to block some of the air intake from side of the brass valve, since NG is different from propane that could expand more in volume. Without block the air intake from the side, the fire could come back to the valve when you have the valve set very low.In general, this is good buner. I am sure it will work great for propane."},{"rating":"2","title":"WA DUDE","review":"Overall I am pleased with the purchase of this product. I do like the fact the frame is steel \\"angle iron\\" for easy repair, replacement or modification purposes vs. the cast iron framed burners. Being steel it's easy to add/weld a 1/4\\" or 3/8\\" rod to bridge the center opening above the burner so I can use smaller pots and pans on the stove. The burner did have some left over casting material in the holes that needed to cleaned out, no biggy, was to be expected too some degree. Good heat output, does not like drafty or high wind areas, might need to add a wind block if you do use it windy areas. I used a Harbour Frieght 4' tank adapter ($12), fit perfectly... I think its 3/8\\" threading. Worth the money... good for SHTF or camping or whatever ????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burner","review":"For the price, great buy. It is nothing more than angle iron and square stock welded for a frame and a burner tacked across it. One of the legs wasn't welded straight and in order to sit flat I snapped its weld to straighten out. As another review said, reaming the hole out for more flow is a great fix to get a little more juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red River - red in more ways than one","review":"The musical score of this 1949 John Wayne American classic has a great twist. Dmitri Toimkin is the composer, and it was played by the Moscow Symphony. (The lyrics to the original score were sung by the Moscow chorus, which is probably why it is hard to understand). Red river captured the classic cowboy cattle drive the way Dances with Wolves takes the viewer into an Indian buffalo hunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"i greatly enjoyed this book. it was amusing and terribly funny. i could barely put it down. the characters were life-like and i found myself wrapped up in their twisted plot. i would recommend this book for anyone that wants a liesurely read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curse in Reverse is a clever twist in a folksy package","review":"This book, by author Tom Coppinger, is a pure delight! I'm an old softy for stories that hint of old Celtic folk tales, and especially ones like this that build to an unexpected but delightful ending! Derek Zimmer's illustrations give the perfect flavoring to the tale. His touch is evident from the cover, where the tower rising in front of a wood-cutty block of the title shows attention to detail. I like the understated small illustration of the witch on the cover -- it invites you, rather than having the character get in your face -- showing the confidence that the illustrator has in the material he is working with.But it's the story that is the star here, and the story is what earns it a permanent spot on my own bookshelf. Agnezza the witch is a character I would like to see again, and I hope the author continues to develop a stable of characters like this to populate the worlds he creates!

I also want to say that I don't miss the Eurythmics contributions to the score at all. This comes from a fan of the group and a proud owner of their original soundtrack recording. My recommendation: buy this DVD and the Eurythmics soundtrack and enjoy them seperately. The new score is a better fit, although I would have gladly paid a little more money to have both versions of the film. As far as special features are concerned, forget it -- this is a bare-bones release.

As far as movies go, I thought this was one of the worst I have ever seen. While it is faithful to the novel, I thought some scenes were very poorly done, cheesy, and not entertaining at all. It was painful to watch and the soundtrack was terrible too. If you want to be depressed and see a lot of a hairy naked chick, buy this movie.

It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more depth than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is deplorable, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie. The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior.

This is probably the worst rendition of a book made for the screen. 1984 is too complex, too moving, and too important to make a movie out of. The concepts in the book are not here, first of all. And THAT is a crime. Next, the actors (with the exeption of Burton) plain suck. I don't understand why Hurt, such a talented actor, could be so awful in this motion picture. An insult, finally. This movie is an insult to one of the greatest works of literature of all times. Lord have mercy on the souls of those involved in the making of this film.

For one, the compositions are too tightly letterboxed wacking some nice visual info off the top of some shots. The biggie is that they chose to dump all of the Eurythmics contributions to the music score in favor of Dominic Muldowney's compositions. Both scores are nice, but the film has lost a great deal of the distinction that the Eurythmics tracks lent to it. Muldowney's score is servicable, and was well utilized in the patriotic anthems of Oceania, but the Eurythmics portions lent a haunting beauty to many scenes, and are woefuly missed.

I really can dissect it enough but suffice it to say that I think it would be a bit hard to follow if you hadn't read the novel already. It is also a bit abstract at times. I am glad I saw it to satisfy my curiosity but I think I will put it up for sale. I thought THX-1138 was a better movie as well as the TV redition of Brave New World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I DEFINITELY won't buy this DVD....","review":"I was reading some of the reviews, how disappointing to hear that EURYTHMICS Soundtrack is not on this disc.

What kind of idiots at the DVD Company would drop out their \\"sound\\"?.. Wow!.. Surprising, yea, if I was Dave or Annie, I would be pissed...

I just want to say that this is a five-star movie IF you've read the book already. Otherwise, there are lots of parts that are not explained and will leave you in the dark. Althgether, it fit the image that I was picturing in my mind while I was reading the book. MUCH better than earlier versions on the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 - are we there yet?","review":"This movie was really well done. I am almost always a fan of books over movies, but this was very well done. The cinematography is dark, but that is the mood throughout the movie. The actors were splendidly placed in the roles. Richard Burton's performance was darkly impressive as was John Hurt. Even if you like the books better than the film version, you should buy this movie. It is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orwell's \\"1984\\" nuff said!!","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\"!!!!! nuff said!!

Boring! As I mentioned in other reviews all English movies are boring and this one is not exception.

The movie is a wonderful movie and timely as ever. The video transfer to the DVD medium looks very good. However, and this infuriates me, the soundtrack of the Eurythmics which complemented the orchestral soundtrack and the visuals of the movie is completely missing!!If you are going to put out a DVD, do it right and don't butcher it!! The DVD is ruined in my opinion. For those of you who have this on VHS and plan on getting the DVD version, you should hang onto your VHS copy if you enjoy the TRUE soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, then don't bother with the movie","review":"George Orwell's powerful book on a bleak future just does not translate well to the screen. At least not in this adaptation. In fact, if you haven't read the book I doubt you'll have any idea what it's all about other than a really unpleasant society. Of course, 1984 is no longer a future date, but time seems to have passed this by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Region 2 in South America, we live in N.

In addition it introduces some vocabulary that would be useful in reading the Q'uran. The good things about it are 1) its clarity in description, as well as the typeface and layout 2) it concision - it is not too much to absorb by oneself, so if you don't have access to a class and/or a teacher and have learned the script ,you can easily learn the grammar concepts that this book presents."},{"rating":"2","title":"See this film!","review":"An interesting, informative and entertaining film that commanded my attention throughout its viewing. It also serves as a warning that we must move quickly toward, and support the development of, alternative forms of energy.

There is no way to enbale super G mode (you need it to connect at 108mbps). Without the most I could connect at was 54mbps. The quick install guide and the manual said it's available, but it wasn't. Tech support was able to reproduce my problem, and tried many, many things. Even though they were very helpful, they coudln't fix it.My guess is that it's going to take a firmware upgrade to enable Super G. If you can wait for that, then you will be happy.

What a waste of time, talent, and energy! But if you crave a good horror movie, see \\"The Ugly.\\" Then see \\"In Dreams.\\" Then compare them. Put simply, there's no comparison. \\"The Ugly\\" will make you shiver,while \\"In Dreams\\" is simply a pretentious mess. Hold on. Maybe I'm being too harsh. After all, there must be something good about the film. Well, there's a nice performance from Toby, Annette Bening's dog, who's more convincing than Robert Downey's villain. Another plus is when the film is over and Roy Orbison sings \\"In Dreams\\" over the credits. It's hard to believe this film was directed by Neil Jordan, the same bloke who did the undervalued Bob Hoskins' starrer, \\"Mona Lisa.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"terrifying","review":"now, this movie is a big mess. First mistake, the murder of little girls is no subject of entertainment and i don't think anyone can oppose a reply to this. But it's more than that; Annette bening is her usual self and therefore nothing great. Then you get downey jr who either is an excellent actor and should get the oscar or either needs a good therapy. Then you got an ending kind of \\"scream\\" thing, with a little bit of \\"seven\\" and a touch of \\"kiss the girls\\".

It gets a 5.3 out of 10 there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence of the lambs meets Alley McBeal...!","review":"'Good on you', Annette. She really puts her all into this movie. Sadly it's not enough. The rest of the cast seem to sleep walk through the entire length of the film. Hello! Stephen Rea - I swear to God his performance was so wooden, I doubt he even bent at the knees as he crossed the screen. The Cinematography is lovely, especially the underwater town (I'm a diver) but the story really goes awry, the characters show little concern for the plot, and Robert Downey. Jr plays Psycho like Bob Dylan, sans Guitar. The finale is straight out of a soap opera (did they run out of film, couldn't afford a less hammy performance?) Honestly, if you appreciate good mysteries and a good tale, if you want to be scared and convinced that something terrible is happening, then watch Alley McBeal, it's right up there with 'In Dreams'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This movie is fantastic! If you want a good chill, I suggest you rent this one. The only things I didn't like was that it's not something you want to see again and again, and the beginning is a bit TITANICy. (underwater, the drawing, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"After reading the customer reviews on this movie I went out and purchased a copy on DVD, although the photography is excellent and the underwater scenes are ever so disturbing, I found the movie to be just another predictable slasher movie. The acting was just terrible and the storyline ever so weak. If I had know this ahead of time I would have rented it first. Take my advise and save your money for something else more worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful.","review":"This movie is trite and overwrought - another attempt by Hollywood to make a film on high-minded horror psychology which, like nearly all its predecessors, ends up a perspectiveless mess of unbelievable characters and improbable situations. Robert Downey Jr. acts more like a dishevelled teddy bear than a maniacal killer - or, wait - was that, like, *irony*? Roll on right past this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A psychological suspense without the suspense","review":"How can you recommend a movie that's fear is apples? It's silly and Robert Downey Jr. is supposed to be a disturbed child killer but he comes off a psycho rock and roll singer, I could imagine drumsticks in his hands. The writer keep rehashing scenes of the boring drowning town scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS AIN'T NO BAD APPLE","review":"Neil Jordans chilling psychodrama thriller In Dreams is a movie that will always come up on my list for the most impacting,disturbing films I have ever seen. It's wild, wacky, dark and absurd... and oh how it works. This is a film like no other- and Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant in this obscur performance. Annette Benning is her wonderful paranoid self in this thrill ride thriller. It will haunt you for days. I'm still haunted, two years later..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downey rose above some pretty bad material.","review":"As much as I LOVE Robert Downey Jr., even he couldn't salvage this piece of garbage.

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring and predictable","review":"Unbelievably this is directed by the same person who made the Crying Game.

And this one tops all of them mad in the last 2 or 3 years because it doesnt have an ending made to have a sequel. It has an ending that lets YOU decide what happens. The movie also shows that dreams can come true, and some things sound fake but you have to believe in them. I think this movie is a great low-costing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"Annette Benning did a good job. We weren't bored, but not an acadamy award winner, but pretty solid entertainment. Good special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I, quite frankly, adore Annette Bening as an actress. Bob Downey is quality too. This film, however, was/is a mess. It could have been so much better given the talent that was available, but it failed, in my opinion, simply because it was so erratic. Artistic license aside, the film was a jumble which detracted from the potential of the story-line.A shame, because the acting was excellent. If only the composition had matched the effort of the actors"},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Company of Wolves' it is not!!!!!","review":"First of all, 'Wolves' is very much a surreal fantasy, romantic and fairy tale like. 'In Dreams' is sickly disturbing, and the acting wasn't very convincing either. If it must be compared to something, try 'Candyman', though more violent and graphic in nature, it leaves the viewer wondering about the definition of insanity. 'In Dreams' asks no deep questions, and isn't scary. I would not call kissing the (known) killer of your child romantic or sexy either, but very disturbing. Sharing and manipulating dreams, are not new concepts to film, and this one exploited them poorly. If you like horror, fantasy, or romance look elsewhere - there are plenty of good movies to choose from. If you like to conclude a movie with the words; \\"it left a bad taste in my mouth\\", then try 'Dead Ringers', 'Damage', or 'Barton Fink', at least the acting is light years ahead of this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In Dreams\\" gets two thumbs up from me!","review":"\\"In Dreams\\" is a great suspense movie! Unlike other films from its genre, \\"In Dreams\\" employs a unique storyline, setting it apart from the numerous cookie-cutter plots so common in movies in recent years. With a very talented ensemble, \\"In Dreams\\" captivates the audience from beginning to end, particularly through the outstanding performance of the lead role played by Annette Bening. Though the mood of this film is rather dark, it is not violent, gory, or gruesome (another aspect of filmmaking that is overdone). \\"In Dreams\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN DREAMS-WORST MOVIE EVER MADE","review":"Single worst movie ever made! It's a series of disturbing puzzle pieces that the watcher hopes will all come together only to have it end making no sense at all!!!! A complete waste of two hours of my life.

This was the best of all the restaurants in Chinatown. Carl Seetoo was a master chef and took great pride in the freshness of his ingredients and the personal presentation of his unique culinary delights. His clientelle was wealthy and extremely sophisticated. No Pu Pu Platters at this place. No menus either. I always would bring Carl a wine opener or captain's knife as a little gift when I dined there with my wife (in the 1980's). One evening I brought in my well-used copy of Wallace Yee Hong's \\"Chinese Cook Book\\". Carl and his wife spent 2 hours copying recipes like mad from this little book.

What is written has been arranged, so much in fact that \`Cabaret' itself is spread over 2-3 pages (as a chorus number) which looses all the emotion and essence of the song. All of the songs loose the feel for the show in the way it has been arranged and by how much of the songs are cut!On a more positive note, it is for piano and voice so, essentially, it is \`easy to play' with (guitar) chords. It includes songs which aren't widely available, i.e. Mein Herr, Maybe This Time, Money-Money, (not available in the vocal Score). They are almost suitable for concert performances, if re-arranged.I would not recommend buying this book at all, only if you can't, for example, play anything more difficult!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gloves","review":"Gloves were bought to replace 20 year old Harbingers and these are exactly like the old ones when new.

They are so fun to wear and don't get hot at all and did I mention the leather. I leave the wrap straps hang sometimes while hitting the bag for added cool effect. All in all.

You'll be glad you read my review when you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before buying online for a woman's fit.","review":"I bought these gloves for kickboxing because I wanted an open finger area. The gloves are not sized for women. I bought a men's medium since I had tried on a men's small in a store. The medium initially felt okay when using, but has since expanded. Not sure why--leather? sweat? At any rate, I have to wrap them really tight around my wrist in order to get them to stay on properly. Otherwise, no issues. If you are an intense woman kickboxer, I would strongly suggest buying them from a place where you can try them on. I kick about 2 to 3 times per week and switch on and off between these and full-coverage type of gloves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gloves","review":"These gloves really hold the wrists tight and take a pounding.

Anyway, this movie was a real drag! First of all, the dude playing the romantic lead was big old tubby guy, totally unbelievable that Mimi would fall for him. Couldn't they have got Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp to play the romantic lead? Also, I don't know when David Hasselhoff got into foreign movies, but his italian accent was terrible! Also, the thing was subtitled like an old japanese godzilla movie, the actors would be going on and on really excited about something, and the subtitled would say like: \\"pass the salt.\\" I think maybe they were saying something dirty, but the translator tried to cover it up because she was embarrassed.

I saw a rerun recently (for nostalgia only, my grandfather liked this show and I watched it often with him) and it reminded me of the moronic and flat characters that got retread for nine years. The characters are all consistently borderline mentally incapacitated (how is Dauber funny?), but I think the fact they are so stupid than most people makes us feel good. The writing stinks with canned and predictable \\"alpha male\\" vs. \\"educated female\\" situations predominating every storyline. I expect most people will disagree since you're only looking as a fan (hey, that's cool, I'm not critiquing YOU, just a show), but if there is some lone person looking to buy a dvd, please, everyone I have ever met begs you- BUY 'JOEY' first, even that garbage is more amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coach - The First Season (Limited Edition)","review":"Although I haven't seen this DVD I have watched the show many...many...many times.

Coach is insensitive and she is just trying to find her way. All of this garbage dates this series, big time. As for fashion: Is Christine somewhere under all that hair? If her toothpick, construction nail legs (in full view from the skirts that ran out of material and wound up around her neck) didn't pin Coach to the mattress, her nails will claw him to death.

The sex scenes are really hot and there is alot of emotional upheaval. It is your basic kidnapping romance, the heroine Summer Ashton is forced to wed by her father. She is headed to meet her new husband when her ship is attacked by another ship. The captain of the other ship is Brent Douglas and he has a grudge against Summer's husband. He decides to get back at him through her. When he realizes she is innocent and she was forced to marry he no longer uses her as a form of revenge and they have a steamy affair, but Summer cannot forget what he did, so even though she desires him she is forever fighting him and at odds with him. This book has plenty of passion, the story is fast paced and interesting. The female character is not a complete doormat for the male, like they tend to be with these older historical romances. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This book should come with a warning. What was suppose to be the first love scene happened more like a rape.

The hero if you could ever call him that is a first class a##@hole.He is verbally abusive throughout most of the book. And some how she fell in love with him. Talk about Stockholm syndrome.

Two songs noticeably missing are \\"Runnin' Wild\\" from \\"Some Like It Hot\\" and a charming version of \\"That Old Black Magic\\" from \\"Bus Stop\\", which Monroe recorded in character(with a hick-town twang). Otherwise, a first-rate package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ham Hocks and Cornbread","review":"Four discs. Each aproximately 77-78 min. in length. Remastered.JSP has done it again! Given us several hours of good rocking jump blues. The artists range from known(Johnny Otis) to the less well-known(Goree Carter) a singer-guitarist from Texas. This is the music that bridged the gap between blues r&b and rock and roll. These recordings were all made with small to medium sized groups usually consisting of a rhythm section and at least one or two horns. The type of group where the singer and the honking sax try to outdo each other. This is exciting music! Meant to be played loud,preferably with something cold to drink. There is very little let-up from one song to the next-which is a good thing! In the end the artist is almost immaterial because the music is so unrelentenly good,loud and fast.

The introduction, with the use of the prophet, made it somewhat interesting, but then the book dragged on and on. The main character never seemed developed enough. This book bogs one down with pointless descriptions of EACH different type of nuclear weapon. The average reader will find this quite time consuming decifering what Morrow is trying to add here. I've read a few books about the world ending, but this one does little to excite me in terms of content. The actual destruction was brief, and 80% of the book seemed quite pointless.

Well it's not, it's just a worthless excuse of a game. They someone took the controls that they've been using for years and made them bad. Also the game keeps trying to be humorous but it's just not, all the jokes are just terrible. The only good part of this game is the system where you get to use the left and right control sticks to move you're feet to do a trick. But you can just play the next Tony hawk game Proving Ground. It's actually a good game and includes the trick thing. So if you don't want to get pissed at the world then don't play this game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Hawk going down?","review":"This game is great, really fun and full of your average skate stupidities with new ones such as seeing how much you can hurt yourself LOL. Really good game and really good tricks and gameplay. Theres only one thing wrong with it, it doesn't really have a storyline like all the other tony hawk games. The point of the game is to rank up all the way to the top eight and you start out at like 180 so yeah. Just complete objectives and get to the rank. Besides the storyline, thats the only con."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"Very disappointed with this game. As a skater i was impressed with the overall styles captured from the various tricks, but this is no \\"next gen\\" game...the amount of options available to customize your skater is puzzling....how is that THPS II had more options??? The graphics are horrible, the start screen even looks low budget, the highlight of this game is the new nail the trick mode which actually makes the gameplay more challenging/ realistic but alas this does not make the game. I think what the future of pro skater needs is to venture more into the direction of being a sim...i.e, having your skater progressingly learn tricks, how about real physics...when you grind on something your skater slows down instead of rocketing off...spend some time designing an actual living city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son Happy with game, Imressed with graphics","review":"As a parent I was happy with my sons reaction.

Sure, the gameplay itself is the same, and I had no problem running up big combos, etc. But the game has, like the last 3 or 4 games before it, gone down the \\"let's put in lame jokes and stupid tasks\\" route. Give me a tough line, not some joke task that 8 year olds think is hilarious. I don't want a Jackass game, I want a Tony Hawk game. The skater customisation is non-existant, which is astounding considering that this is the 8th game, and supposedly the next-gen flagship. If you're new skating game player, then by all means, play this game. But if you're a fan of the Tony Hawk series, just get Tony Hawk 4 out again; it'll be a far better use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it first...","review":"This game is fun at first, the graphics are really nice.After a while along with loads of frustrations and ridiculous missions and objectives this game loses its luster. Its really unrealistic for example, doing skateboard tricks while jumping out of an airplane. Also the slow-mo thing is really annoying especially for people who don't like to use the D-pad and prefer to use the Analog. The only skate game I'll possibly buy is EA's S.K.A.T.E because it focuses on the real side of skating."},{"rating":"1","title":"With age somes boredom","review":"I have played and completed every Tony Hawk game, and I think I finally put away my skateboard and have moved on. There is nothing new in this game that you've never seen. The graphics are great, sure, but the gameplay gets boring quick and there isn't much incentive to play through this one unless you have some sick syndrome like me where you need every achievement point possible.Rental at best, it can be beat in 5 days if you burn through it. If your little brat has never played a TH game before he will be blown away. For veterans, stay away. Pick a new hobby like curling or women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tony Hawk game yet.","review":"It's been awhile since i've played a tony hawk game and i've got to tell you this is the best one yet.

To top all of this off, Chang's use of voice, and the change of point of view in this novel (third person here, first in the previous two), make for an interesting literary read as well as for a page-turning crime yarn.The sad part?

Of course, he falls for one of the employees (the gorgeous Jocelyn Lane), and somehow the plot shifts over to that of a buried treasure.It's embarrassing to watch Elvis break into song in the most redundant situations. The dialogue is SO bad, and the acting leaves a lot to be desired.The music is actually GOOD in this picture. But, that's because the studio couldn't afford new songs to record. The result: songs from Elvis' albums from 1960 to 1963.

The primary virtue of this fluffy musical-comedy lies in its excellent soundtrack - comprised of songs from the \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" (1960) and \\"Pot Luck\\" (1962) albums.

By far the best incarnatioin of the Dark Knight to ever be concieved, Batman The Animated series has been a pioneering force in the world of animation. This book explains and illustrates why. The artists get it. Dini's uniques vision made it to the small screen relatively undilluted from the interference of too many people.

After reading many reviews on it and the N8000, I thought the N9000 sounded and looked better. I have experience with film cameras, using a Diana Mini which is equally low-tech... Well, I just can't get the film to advance. Also, the rewind lever was broken as soon as I took it out of the box. I had to have the camera shop rewind the film in a darkroom.The first roll was a disaster. Though the camera was winding and the counter advanced, the film itself apparently did not advance, so I ended up taking 12 shots on the same frame. Completely overexposed, useless. Second roll... I thought I took some great shots! Great 3D setups and I put in a lot of effort!

WEll, after viewing it in the present day, I found it to be quite dull.Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are both good actors. I just thought the story -- her being a rich uptight brat who falls \\"overboard\\" and his poor, single dad character uses her to get back at her for not paying him for the job he did.It's just so darn predictable.

The premise is good but the way the director and the cast carry out with it is horrible. Kurt Russel is trying to play a different role in this movie and I think he should just stick with his usual.

This film is SICK. A man takes advantage of a woman suffering memory loss and makes her into his personal slave? Add to that he forces his children to go along with him and the brats treat her horribly. It doesn't say much that his wife has passed away, because he's NOT looking in for a wife or mother (as SICK as that would be to FIND a wife/mother that way), but he is taking HORRIBLE advantage over.This is NOT a family comedy.

There is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and STAY clutter-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought I was organized....","review":"This book was given to me by a friend and I brought it with me to the Bahamas this winter along with lots of other reading material. Family had been visiting for a week (left) and I was ready to curl up with something really good...and this was it. I read it cover to cover without stopping. The great ideas, the snappy writing, the option that I didn't have to spend big bucks to make major improvements...there is something in it for everyone. I just got through going through a relative's house where she was a hoarder and had lived in the same house for 30 years. I think this book could have even made a difference there. So, I would think that anyone interested in less clutter, and how to go about making it happen would enjoy what Koll & Ellis have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"The book has pretty pictures, so why not hire author Randall Koll, who is not a certified interior designer? It may turn out to be a very costly mistake. We hired Randall in the fall of 2006 to organize and furnish our home. In January 2007, Randall was given a check for thousands of dollars to buy furniture. It is now August 2007 and our home is still not organized and we still do not have new furniture. Randall has not returned any calls or e-mails since May. So save your money and learn from our expensive mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newlywed Review","review":"Loved the book. Wished I could make all my spaces look half as lovely. The catch?

Or how to sort through what to keep and reuse in the new space and what to toss out!I'll use this book as inspiration!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish and practical","review":"I have two young children, a packrat mate, a home-based business, and a newly purchased, super tiny apartment. Need I say how easy it would be to drown in a sea of clutter?Koll and Ellis' book is full of beautiful photographs and simple suggestions for taming the stuff in your life while leaving room to celebrate it. I've read too many magazine articles and websites that make the reader feel guilty or inept, this is a book that understands that organization isn't tyranny but emancipation. I also love how many of their concepts are budget-friendly.Although many of the photos in the book feature spaces far more expansive than my own, the ideas the authors present for everything from storage solutions to good housekeeping habits are easy to implement. If I had room for a coffee table, this would be a lovely addition to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this book.","review":"Randall is a designer in San Francisco.

I just received The History of Trunks today and was BLOWN completely away. If you have yet to see this 'movie' you are missing out. This movie has it all.

Usually it is Goku who saves the day. Well Goku doesn't save the day, in fact the day isn't saved at all. The music was real different from the series. I liked the music in this alot better. The androids 17 and 18 were a little different in personality. In the series they weren't all that bad, but in this they were cruel killers. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it was so short. If your a Trunks fan you will want this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for dbz fans","review":"It's simple it's all about what happened in (future) trunks's past. It starts out when he is a baby and goku dies from the terrible heart disease, even vageta is shocked! Several months later the androids 17 and 18 arrive and kill one by one all of earth's special forces except for gohan. With no one left but him and trunks, he goes out and fights the androids alone. 10 years later trunks is dying to be trained and gohan begin's the harshest training trunks has ever been in. It is a must have, very dramatic. It shows you what kind of bond trunks and gohan had and why trunks hates the androids to the extent that he will not give them a second chance to think they're a bit differen't than the androids he fought even though they said they didn't want to kill anyone but goku (in the android saga). I have both english and japanese versions and the english has the best music for the very dramatic scenes it portrays."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may know the story already","review":"If you've seen the DBZ series then you probably have a pretty good understanding of what this movie is about. We already know from the TV show that Trunks came from a future where the androids have killed all the Z fighters. Gohan trained Trunks to fight and was later killed in battle. After this happened Trunks came to the past to make things right.This movie is more or less a more detailed account of the story we already know the gist of. Despite being old news, this story is great. We get a new look at the relationship between Gohan, Trunks and Bulma. As you can imagine, this movie is pretty darn sad. There is, however, a bright light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. The movie ends with.............???????Ha Ha! I almost spoiled the ending that we already know about. Wow that was corny. Anyway this movie is great. You should give it a look see."},{"rating":"2","title":"those androids","review":"the uncuts of the DBZ series shows blood and spit and this one shows blood and spit. great sequences are when Trunks and Adult Gohan fight Android 17 and 18 and we get to see how Trunks turns super saiyan and how it goes into the series. exciting and exhilarating"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next level of cool","review":"hi again it's me from gt porfileration. anyway i think this movie rules because a lot of people die in a cool way and the fights,music, and animation is excellent,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature, unrealistic, violent, bloody, eeeeew.","review":"Why do you suppose I don't have any business watching TV? Because there's too much in the way of violence promotion. This overrated garbage is no exception. I really tried to enjoy it, but the violent scenes in which Goku is getting savagely beat up by Vegeta are wicked and at times bloody. No wonder it's become so popular in America! Pok��mon isn't that violent, but who wants to spend even a half-hour of her time watching stuff that only feeds the eyes and not the brain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trunks life","review":"In Trunks time Goku died when he was just a baby right before the androids started to take over the city. During the war the other Z warriors gang did thir best to stop the androids but they all died every one except Gohan who growed up and help Trunks when he was a kid to become a super saiyan. When Gohan was fighting the androids he lost one arm but that didn't stop him from fighting and training his little partner. Sooner or later Gohan eventually died by the androids so Trunks only has his self now. While all this was going on Bulma (Trunks mother) was tring to design a time machine for Trunks to go in, it's so he can warn his friends in the past that the future will be dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, Great, Awesome, and its good too!","review":"The best dbz special ever.

For any fan of trunks, I strongly recommend getting this. The DVD has both the English and Japanese voices, as well as subtitles in both languages.

The Gericare has less elemental magnesium than the Rising brand. It isn't much of a difference, but every bit helps when you are dealing with a magnesium deficiency. It is also my concern when the company doesn't deliver the product they advertise and don't indicate that the image and manufacturer may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on a specific part of the body","review":"I bought this set several years ago to add variety to my Taebo workouts. I am a long-time Taebo fan; I have an active family and it keeps me in shape for the other sports that we do together. The routines on this dvd are challenging at Taebo's typical advanced level and excellent for focusing on a specific portion of your body. For example, if I want to get my legs in shape for biking or skiing, I'll do the lower-body workout. On the other hand, if I have already been biking, my legs have had a good workout, so I'll do the upper-body routine (I use very light weights for resistance). You could also alternate between them to focus on your whole body. However, if you're only going to purchase one set, I'd recommend the Get Ripped Advanced series instead of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweating a lot!","review":"I actually like to do the upper body more. Both workouts are equally intense and you work up a sweat within the first 10 mins or so. Even if you don't have any taebo experience previously (I didn't), you can still keep up, just give it a few days and you'll get used to it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent editing affects workout quality","review":"This tape was a bit of a disappointment to me. I've been doing Tae-Bo since the beginning (remember the motivating info-mercials?) As my wedding was approaching I wanted to kick it up a notch from the original Basic and 8-minutes workouts that I've been doing for so long. After reading all the reviews from this website, I chose this DVD. Having now tried to use it several times, I am most disappointed by the editing- there are several exericises that are performed on one side of the body but then not repeated for the other. The editing is also choppy enough that it interrupts the energy and flow you can build during a workout. It is disappointing enough that I am now trying to find an alternative DVD, or even a copy of the original \\"Advanced\\" workout. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Euro Sounding Synth","review":"The synth power machine called Cosmicity (AKA Mark Nicholas)creates some of the best underground synth music available. Smooth and polished, catchy lyrics, and great mixing are all put into every album. You can't ask for much more than this.This album contains two of his classics Too Far Gone and Orange. Both songs that will beg to be replayed. This is one of his more emotional moments in his vast discology. Perfect for driving or just listening while alone but not one of his \\"upbeat dance\\" albums. If you like the Pet Shop Boys album 'Nightlife' this will rightfully take a respected place in your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"catchy,sweet, melodic synthpop music","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite c.d.'s in my synthpop collection. I never get tired of it, it's got a permanent place in my c.d. player. The music is very sweet, melodic, catchy and mood altering. The songs on this album take you to another place and time. The lyrics are also very good and true to life. I would say that Cosmicity is similar to: Anything Box or Soviet but Cosmicity definately has their own unique sound.

Little Brother Montgomery is in his late 70's here, but still delivers the goods. His segment is only 30 minutes, but this DVD is worth it. There's a good interview as well. This man was a huge figure in the history of the blues, but still doesn't get much of the credit he deserves. If you play jazz, blues, pop, or rock piano, you were influenced by him whether you know it or not.Wingy Manone is also on here. He's 81 or 82 here, and still gets the job done. He is the one-armed trumpet player who is remembered not only for his horn playing, but his New Orleans jive talkin as well. He played with Bing Crosby for 5 years, and was a truely original, great performer.

Along with British army captain Kenneth More and others, they board an old train to escape to safety, because rivals want the young prince dead. Of course, the train trip is anything but smooth and uneventful. The film works really well, with enough quiet moments mixed with action scenes to keep the viewer entertained. There is also a very credible attraction that develops between the Bacall and More characters. Bacall's character is quite outspoken (the kind of character she did a lot when she got older), while More is amused by her and attracted to her. There's a lot of action and suspense built up, and since this film is not well known these days, it's a nice surprise to view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Kenneth Moore--hated the movie","review":"Sorry to be the contrary voice/reviewer here but this movie was terrible in my opinion. I love Kenneth Moore, \\"Sink the Bismark\\" is one of my favorite films he did and it still holds up well many years later unlike \\"Flame Over India\\". The story of Moore protecting a 6 yr old Prince from killers stalking them as they ride a rickety train is a fine 'adventure' type movie they just don't make anymore and I fully apprecaite. But the cast of Lauren Bacall and Herbert Lom are just not believeable in their roles here and the movie just moves way to SLOW by modern standards. A similar film, that is terrific and a gem every time I watch it is \\"The Wind and The Lion\\" with Sean Connery and Candace Bergan--that is a great movie but this isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for Dandy Kenny, but subject matter is passe'","review":"Reading some of the reviews makes me wonder, why bunch of poor, abused, conquered by force and tyranny, fighting a ruthless modern army for their homes and families are called rebels, savages and other Raj era slang, and they probably still judge human beings by the content of Melanin in their system and/or how rich their family is, and whom or what they worship.

They have a young prince with them, who is the key to keeping one of the kingdoms aligned to the British Empire.The movie is fun and reminds me of the British films I used to watch in Alaska when I was a kid (for some reason we always got English movies set in the jungle or the desert). The players in North West Frontier did an excellent job (led by Bacall), and this was as true for the leads as it was for the supporting cast. As far as the writing was concerned, there was quite a bit of plot twists and other devices (including a potential traitor!) and it made for great entertainment. Historically it seemed like a realistic portrayal of life in India at the beginning of the 20th C., although this is not an area of emphasis for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I loved this extrordinary book.

The downside is that after 30 minutes it hurts your ears with pressure put on them. Since I use these headphones for way longer than 30 minutes, I usually have to extend the length of the headphones so that the ear piece doesn't sit right on top of my ears, that eases the pressure and allows me to wear them longer.

As someone who is reentering the arena of model building, it was quite a disappointment.The overall cover is nice, and there are a few color pictures. However, most of the pictures are in black and white. This obscures any detail that may be gained from them. Even the color pictures are of less quality than can be found on the internet sites.The text is fairly simplistic and lacks any real detail. It does not provide any real pivotal insight in how to construct, paint and accurize a Star Trek model. Worse yet, it stays away from the most common, main stream models, sticking to mostly obscure and less common models.Overall this book was really a disappointment. I would only recommend it, if the model you are building is contained within it, and only then to a true beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for a complete novice","review":"The book details building of a few Star Trek models. Most of the advice is pretty basic, and feels more like author's modeling journal than manual designed to learn from. Choice of Star Trek models also seems a bit coincidental - I think this book would have been just as good or bad if other Sci-Fi models were shown.Several topics are beyond what I'd consider beginner's subjects: one model is build from a vacuum-formed kit, another with lighting. At the end Borg cube is made from scratch, with pieces being replicated in resin. Despite this, it really doesn't feel like there is a lot of useful advice given.Overall I think it's a good book for a beginner, but not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"I have searched for this book for about 15 years it is the best book I have outside of the bible. thank you thank you , if I find another I will purchase it also"},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly by Sandra ROCKS!","review":"Mala is right on the money with her great review.

There is plenty of room on the middle strip for two labels, one for each compartment (1/2\\" labels). The magnets are outstanding, sticks to the metal tool shelf and I have not had a single socket drop out (even after some vigorous shaking).

The only reason I didn't give this game a big fat 1 is the bonus stages can sometimes be sort of fun and after you get off the first world thing, the second place has an interesting background. Hasbro Interactive should be ashamed of this poor attempt to take a classic video game and turn it into a fun game. This is not worth the money.

Kenshin is much more of a soulless killer than you were led to believe in the TV show. The animation and voice acting are also different.

Instead it ejected the engine and came down Mach 2 nose first like an arrow and stuck into the dirt. Now that is okay if is like a block from you but even this shrimpy rocket is a little scary when it is coming back to you like an arrow at Mach 2. Amazingly it did survive the landing in that the fins didnt break off on impact. I was chicken to launch it again though with my kids around until I could figure out a way to make it tumble. Rechecked the instructions, I built it correctly, dunno why it wont tumble."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOSECONE!!!!!!!","review":"id say dont glue nosecone on.

While I agree completely that class matters I think Bell Hooks does an extremely poor job of explaining why. Throughout the novel I felt like I was reading a paper written by a ten year old. Things just don't make sense. Also, the way it's written is very subjective, taking away any credibility it might have had. She does make some good points but nothing that other books about the same subject don't make. It's not worth trudging through the repetative nonsense of the rest of the book. Don't waste your money, there are many GOOD books out there (try \\"Ain't no Makin it\\" By Jay MacLeod for a good book on same topic)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Than You Would Expect","review":"You have only so much time upon this earth.

She is also compassionate enough to devote time to addressing the most important issues of our time. The class crisis in this country is coming to a head as the middle class dwindles even more rapidly in this economy. Perhaps with many millions more joining the ranks of the poor, we as a nation will finally confront and resolve our class related conflicts.

His team is dispatched to different planets to purge them of life and leave them ripe for selling on the intergalactic market. Unfortunately, his boss the all-powerful Frieza decides that the saiyans are getting to strong, and it's time to get rid of them.For those familiar with the series, Bardock is, as the title suggests, the father of Goku. Here, we see his valiant and vain struggle against the tyrant Frieza, years before his son would fight him. It's packed with great action as only Dragon Ball Z can deliver, and you get to see the roots of the series. An excellent starting point for anyone who hasn't watched the series yet.Towards the end of the feature, the saiyan baby Kakarot is shipped off into space. He lands on the planet Earth and is recovered by an old martial arts master named Gohan. Gohan dubbs the child Goku, and takes him in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr.Gero is back and wants to take \\"its\\" revenge against Goku","review":"The DBZ Cell saga is finally going to be released on DVD in its original and uncut form.

Unfortunately the Japanese audio track is going to be Mono only (unless Funimation gets better master tapes from TOEI before release) and the English audio track although being stereo doesn't come with the original audio Fx (well, I don't know about you but I hate when a studio replaces the original Fx with cheaper ones... At least you still have the chance to hear the original audio track on these discs). The video quality should only improve disc after disc and it was already quite good on the Ginyu discs.

But still, it's not a bad action film at all. And there are so many local stories around here regarding the filming (especially from those who watched the chopper fly street level down Capitol Avenue).

Brian Bosworth plays a cop on suspension that is coerced by the FBI to go undercover and join a biker gang to take them down. Lance Henriksen and William Forsyth do a good job of playing the bad guys. Having rode with the Salty Dawgs many many years ago and knowing other clubs I have to say this is fairly realistic biker movie. The meet in the movie reminded me of one of the barbeques I went to when I rode. The statement \\"Colors never run\\", is a code with all bikers and a fellow biker saved my life once so it isn't something you forget. Good quality DVD but no extras. Decent replayability.

The plot overview has already been iterated in previous reviews, so I won't add another one to the pile, but you get the idea.It is all too easy to compare Douglas Clegg to Stephen King, but that is because there are some similarities in their narrative styles, though Clegg's descriptions are possibly more vivid.I liked this book and think that it is worth tracking down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have really enjoyed some of Clegg's books, particularly Hour Before Dark and The Infinite.

Even though Clegg is basically a pulp horror writer, his characterizations, even here, are very good, realistic. This just didn't have enough of a plot to justify 400 pages. After awhile it became tedious and boring. Everyone is possessed by malignant evil and dies in appropriately grisly fashion. Yawn. The last half of the book needed to be trimmed by half again. Granted, it is his first published novel, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone other than diehard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Clegg got started....","review":"Dougals Clegg is one of the most amazing horror writers turning out fiction these days. His stories are not traditional zombies, vampires, werewolves. etc. He is the new voice in horror with some awesome ideas and plots; simply put he is the new King.He doesn't string together a plot to unleash gore and violence on you. His plot's are well-thought out, well researched, and thought-provoking. Some say he is too intellectual in his recent work, but he has simply evolved. This is a fine example of his early stuff and clearly shows he is no flash in the pan.This novel is excellent; he knows how to scare and he knows how to flesh out his main characters. Clegg knows how to get under our skin and pulls no punches in doing so. He is a modern master of horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read; harder to like","review":"I broke one of my cardinal rules with this one - I couldn't finish it. I slogged through about a third of it and then just had to put it down. It should have been interesting; I should have cared about the characters -- but I just couldn't get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Had Started With Some Later Works","review":"This novel left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems padded out for length- a contract obligation. Our protagonist muses about his reaction to an event, but the reader has to wait a few chapters before finding out WHAT event caused this reaction. More often than not, the event itself is anti-climactic and makes one wonder at the dramatic reaction our protagonist experienced. The constant use of this tactic gets tiresome well before the halfway point. Finishing this novel was a task, and not a well rewarded one at that.In spite of this novel, I explored Clegg's later works and now consider myself a fan.If you're interested in Clegg, put this book at the BOTTOM of your reading list- you may miss out on some great entertainment otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"As far as horror goes, this is not Steven King","review":"This book is one of the most confusing horror novels I've ever read. I completely disliked the writers style of writing and the way he jumped back and forth from one person's perspective to another's. I had to repeated go back and read something because I thought it was focused on another character and eventually realized that it wasn't. There are better ways to change viewpoints in a book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was one of the few books I really didn't want to finish, but I'm not one to give up. I read it all the way through and regretted the waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent quick reference guide to Japanese A/C of WWII","review":"As my summary states, this is an excellent quick reference guide to Japanese a/c of WWII. Written by one of the leading authorities on Japanese a/c, it contains all the basic information on almost all the a/c to see service with the Japanese military, and its \\"charm\\" is the information on how the allied intelligence services came up with the code words, such as \\"Zeke\\" and \\"Sally\\", for each aircraft.

The Kid has a fight scene, and Jet has one at the end..., and aside from the opening that's all there is. I know overall it's a good movie, but I usually just watch Jet Li for fighting... which this movie lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"review of enforcer","review":"This movie was previously entitled \\"my father is a hero\\" and it is terrible. The plot is stupid and the cineatography is terrible even on DVD. The martial arts fight do not display Jet Li true talent. Avoid this movie. If you really want to see a great Jet Li movie that displays his awesome martial arts talent, get \\"Fist of Legend\\" that is his best movie and believe me, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Enforcer","review":"I love the movie but was very dissapointed with this purchuse because the dvd was all scratched and unplayable and i could not return it for i had to open it up to find out the condition and the policy was that cant return open items. well that is very messed up and it makes me wonder about the films that i buy in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you doing Dragon Dynasty?","review":"The reason I buy Dragon Dynasty movies is because it always includes the original audio and soundtrack of the movies. I feel the same way as all the other 1 star ratings posted so far.Dragon Dynasty, you should re-release this movie giving it the proper treatment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubbed. Edited. Crap.","review":"Dragon Dynasty finally went and did what the whining, cynical fanboys said they would. They simply repackaged the same disrespectful dubbed, edited version of a film they crapped out in the early days. This film features ONLY dubbed English audio, and is not the full uncut version of the film. How sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible overdub, excellent movie","review":"This movie has a great story, and some awesome fight scenes. The problem with this is the terrible overdub audio. The mouth movement is obviously not in synch with the audio, but this is not too bad. The terrible part is that they picked horrible voices for this. The audio sounds like a cartoon with a super hero and a villan. They could have done way better. The audio sounds really corny and fake. The movie itself is awesome. I would much rather hear the audio in a different language and see the subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks!","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. The kid in this movie is great. He's the reason I watch it, because although Jet Li is amazing, the kid is incredible too. If you like this combination of Jet and the Kid, check out \\"New Legend of Shaolin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The killing of a stuffed animal and the murder of a movie","review":"My brain is still trying to fathom what my eyes have just seen. I usually enjoy this kind of action movie and I can appreciate it's style, but this is ridiculous. What the heck was going on with the fake dog/sheep thing? I know you can't hurt real animals in movies, but it turned out so cheesy they should have left it out. Movies shown on MST3K had better visual effects. Using the kid as a human yo-yo was just plain silly. And when was the mother going to die? We all knew it was going to happen. Hell, I was looking forward to it. Don't even waste your time. Look out, it's Jet Li's Enforcer! Boot to the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet crashes in ball of flames!","review":"If you're an avid fan of Jet Li like myself, then you will spare yourself the agony of viewing this disappointing film. The fight scenes are almost completely void, and the plot is simply terrible. It truly breaks my heart to say it, but you should skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"American version ok, da original chinese version much better","review":"This movie was ok, but da dubbing ..., and thanx alot to \\"Dimension Home Video\\" they re did da sound effects of da movie and it was capital B \\"BAD\\". Trust me, if u wanna get dis movie on VHS or DVD, get da orginal one \\"My Father Is A Hero\\", itz in itz original language (since I never saw da original, I think da original language is Cantonese, either dat or Mandarin) and da sound effects have gotta be better.

I guess they do now.I will wait for a re-release of \\"My Father Is A Hero\\"with the original language and music and withoutwhatever other changes were madeor will seek one elsewhere.I suggest fans of Jet Li, martial arts and police dramasdo the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but BAD RELEASE","review":"Read this carefully. This movie is fun and exciting. It's a well done Jet Li film. I like the chemistry between Jet Li and his son. But this release by Dragon Dynasty is horrible. They did not release the film in it's original language nor with its original soundtrack.If you are a purist then avoid this release and find a Hong Kong import that does the film the just that it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li is awesome in this flick!","review":"Jet Li puts on a great performance in My Father Is A Hero. The fight scenes are great and there is good drama which showcases Li's acting talent.

The action will make your mouth water and the story will make you cry (I'm serious). This movie will make your girlfriend drag you into a Jet Li martial art movie next time around... !"},{"rating":"1","title":"One fabulous feature...five that are a drag","review":"There is one really wonderful feature here, The Story of The Cat And The Moon. It is the story of an aging cat who is quite mad and utterly in love with the moon. Wonderful black and white imaging and exquisite story monologue. It is probably worth owning this DVD just for this one feature alone. The other five are not so much noir as just deadly boring and depressing. You should try to see this before you buy it, as it is really not for all tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a flop","review":"Anyone expecting either good animation or good noir is going to be very disappointed with this collection. By and large, the films are monumentally dull. The brief \\"Cat and the Moon\\" provides almost the only glimmer of interest; the rest of the disc feels like a bunch of student exercises.This disc will probably bore you silly, despite the trio of five-star reviews below -- all by \\"A viewer from Chicago.\\" (Wow, what a coincidence that three Windy City residents all loved this tedious DVD and used the same words to describe it.) If you're looking for great animation with a dark twist, try Jan Svankmajer or the Brothers Quay instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool and dark animation","review":"This compilation will not please the conservatives who adore Walt Disney, nor will it win any Oscars (too outrageous). But if you like underground comics, alternative music, and are interested in what the best of the experimental animators are doing - then you will love this tape. Paul Vester, Suzan Pitt, and Jiri Barta whose dark and beautifully realized work are a part of Cartoon Noir are some of the best underground animators working today. The films in this compilation are original and striking examples of where animation can take the imagination. These works ran theatrically at the Cinema Village in New York and received rave reviews throughout the United States. Don't listen to Mr. Establishment, Charles Solomon."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"A very down-to-earth and very practical handbook for any strategical formulation endeavours.

The plot is very good and the charaters are well develeped. It is very interesting too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporate Greed in the 21st Century","review":"With the Enrob Annual Report 2001 Platt and Narita have humorously captured the essence of corporate greed in the 21st century, from that money hungry guy on the cover, through the myriad of outrageously immoral financial schemes presented in this clever parody. I have read many of Mr. Platt's science and technical articles in Wired magazine and his expertise in this area has resulted here in a great collection of techno-babble schemes replete with \\"we're in the money\\" charts and graphs. Off planet accounting, government bribery, retirement fund theft, investor fraud, environmental destruction, and commodity manipulation; all areas are completely covered in Enrob's misguided quest for profits.This is the lighter side of the Enron mess. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's have some fun for a change","review":"It's so nice that someone finally gave us something to laugh about with this whole Enron mess. Platt and Narita's spoof is hilarious. The book is just long enough to get a good jab at every aspect of greedy corporate America at it's best (worst). I would love to watch an Enron executive read this material. Everyone in Congress should get a copy.

I tried to extend the range of a wireless mouse transmitter, and after a few minutes of inactivity the device is disconnected and the extension cable must be manually reconnected to resume operation. Sort of negates the advantage of a wireless mouse...Also tried it with a normal wired mouse, and of course, same thing happens. So, it's the cable.

I agree with another review which lamented the cuts, removing the commercials for the telephone company. I seem to remember it ending with a telephone operator (w/ a vintage headset) encircled by a big Christmas wreath, wishing us all a Merry Christmas. The transfer doesn't seem quite as sharp and vivid as it did in that creaky old auditorium fifty years ago, but this was quite a find nevertheless.

Lurking and lurching beneath the sands of an American Southwest desert secret facility there are creatures that are as unnatural as they are unwholsome. Dacs, Scorps, Spitters and Hunters ... Oh my! Dorothy and Toto most likely would have found their journey through Oz much more harrowing had such denizens crept across the Yellow Brick Road. More exciting than this, though, is an enticing glimpse into the ever present and always mysterious Mr. Trent ... just enough for the faithful 'RE' followers to glimpse what is the driving forces behind the man, and Umbrella as well.

Torture Garden appears to be included on the Grand Guignol CD (between the 2 versions, which is strange), but there are only 33 songs included, when the original LP/CD had 42 songs...where are the rest? I don't understand why they included an 18' bonus track when it doesn't even appear that the whole Torture Garden album is here...am I crazy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read Very Informative","review":"Despite the obvious christian affiliation of the author, the material presented is unbiased, factual, and accurately summarized. A wonderful debunking of many of the most pervasive pseudo histories in modern western culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"You cannot trust a word in it","review":"Folks, any publishing company which, in its dust jacket description of the author's investigation of a phenomenon, describes that phenomenon as \\"this potent and disturbing malignancy\\" is NOT a scholarly press. Consequently, no matter how many degrees the author has, you cannot trust this book to have been properly peer reviwed and therefore you cannot trust the scholarly accuracy of the book. Add to this the fact that the back of the dust jacket advertises two books where the first is subtitled \\"A brief against feminism\\" and the second is titled \\"The Church Impotent: The Feminization of Christianity\\", and I think you can see this is a publishing house with a very conservative Christian agenda. The authors themselves may be genuine scholars, but if the publishing house itself is biased, how can you trust anything they put out? Bottom line: don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potent & disturbing maglignancy Prof?","review":"Sorry, but this book was about as even handed as a Pat Robertson talk about Clinton. You know you are not geting a fair hearing when such words as \\"this potent & disturbing maglignancy.\\" Please! Trust me, as a Pagan myself I know quite well that it is for the most part (95%) from this century, And so what? It's the truth & kindness that is found in the movement that matters. All religions have falsehoods at their base. Look at Christianity. With it founder who say that he would be back before the people hearing him had died...2000 years the man who never was is still not back, but a history of blood, death & horror is there, with followers like Mr. Davis who is ready, willing & able to come up with reasons why there has not quite yet been enough. This book is a maglignancy itself that I am sure will be used by the thugs of falsehood with glee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias Unmasked","review":"I read this book a few years ago, as I was interested in the pagan movement and wanted critical material on it - not for an agenda, but just for my own curiosity.Other reviewers have noted that the bias is evident from the cover itself. Quite frankly, I came away from this book respecting very thing he was trying to debunk, and it spurred me on to read more indepth on some his targets like Shelley and Goethe.The bottom line on a book like this is that is fueled by a bias that makes everything within it suspect. While this book does provide a somewhat deeper analysis of the issue, readers are recommended _Triumph of the Moon_ by Ronald Hutton instead. Hutton is both unbiased and a more eminent scholar - he also makes the \\"goddess as product of romanticism\\" case in far fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there","review":"This book is very biased. The author makes no attempt to understand WHY existant religions have failed these women and why a new religion is called for. For a much better and more scholarly look at the subject read _Living in the Lap of the Goddess_. It's a much clearer look at the movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemic posing as scholarship","review":"A look at the publisher's web page is enough to give you an idea of what to expect from this book. It claims to represent the true conservative view and accuses other conservative publishers of giving in to sensationalism and \\"scandal-mongering.\\" Its booklist is heavily geared to works of extreme anti-feminism. So the author's claims to a balanced and scholarly view are hardly believable. This is not a book for any thoughtful reader to take seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a minute","review":"most scholarly investigations of paleolithic society accept that they can't be sure what artifacts that depict women mean, but accept that it indicates the importance of women and/or a goddess in that society. Also, they don't believe that the societies were matriarchal, but rather had equality of the sexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this book because it was recommended by a friend as a \\"funny' book.

It may not be her finest work, but it's extremely funny and easy to read; you'll find yourself lol-ing and loving it. I've looked at the sample pages of the english translation, and they seem pretty good, but if you feel like improving your french, this copy is what you are looking for. It took me 2 long hot baths to finish it. Pure pleasure for the brain, wrinkles for my skin.

She has a strange sense of humour, an accurate aproach to FAR EAST culture (her father has been a dipomat in Japan and China,) and an extraordinary hability to build up plots on human miseries that arises disgust and empathy all together. I read all her books published in french, and I recommend them all. The ones I liked best are \\"La M��taphysique des tubes\\", \\"La sabotage amoreux\\", \\"Stupeur et Tremblements\\" and \\"P��plum\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing despite good intentions","review":"I stumbled on Scot Cole by accident--in my quest to find a way to exercise and to de-stress. I love \\"Scott Cole: Discover Tai Chi AM/PM Workouts.\\" As he begins each step, Cole describes the movements very clearly and slowly. I also appreciate the mental imagery that he suggests each step looks like or represents.I decided to try 'Discover Tai Chi for Weight Loss.' To my disappointment, he rushes through the movements, without much explanation. I understand that the DVD is to make the viewer/participant move & sweat to lose weight--but I felt like I was in a race, no matter how much I slowed down the DVD to try to figure out each movement. This DVD is meant for beginners or at the very most, intermediates, so it shouldn't have felt that way. Right now I'm sticking to the \\"Discover AM/PM\\" DVD, but I'll eventually go back to the \\"Weight Loss\\" DVD and try to give it another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Wasn't For Me","review":"I have really enjoyed Scott Cole's \\"Tai Chi for Beginners\\" and thought I might like this DVD as well. The movements are all almost the same as on the beginners' DVD with a few extras. Unless you are already familiar with these movements, it might be a bit challenging knowing how to do them. His instruction on this DVD is a bit rushed.Even though I am somewhat familiar with the movements, I still felt rushed. The idea is to do the movements slowly at first and then at an increased tempo. It got my heart rate up slightly, but mostly, I felt some strain on my knees doing these movements in a hurry.I choose to do Tai Chi for the enjoyment of the movements, tranquility and flow. This DVD will not provide that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and not very good for weight loss","review":"This video was very boring and didn't really do much to get my heart rate up for weight loss. He takes you through a series of exercises, which in my opinion are too complicated to get the first time and he teaches them. Then the video changes to him doing them very fast, not giving any more instructions and not even telling you which exercise is next so it's up to you to remember the exact way to do the exercise, and remember when to change to the next one. Complete waste of money in my opinion. The Tai Chi for Beginners was much better, but still pretty boring. Unless you already know Tai Chi or have an incredible memory, don't get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I love doing this tape. I just started, so really don't know if I'll lose any weight, but feel better after doing the tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"If you are going to title a DVD \\"discover...\\" anything - then it should teach you the basics of the thing first. 10 minutes would have been enough. Not a training program you want to start if you haven't studied Tai Chi before. It was going too fast with minimal movement break-downs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this. You will be glad you did.","review":"Instructions are easy to follow and everything is demonstrated clearly. Just mirror what he does onscreen. The music is also very beautiful and soothing. Tai Chi is remarkably good for overall health and for balance. I highly recommend this for aging baby boomers like myself. Old age is coming on, and the danger of falling and getting hurt due to fading coordination and balance is a real threat to health and safety. Tai Chi is an enjoyable way to prevent a lot of needless hassle and pain. Our parents did not see this train wreck coming and that is why so many of us are saddled with caring for an aging parent(s).

Charlie Hall album's always have a somewhat alternative style. This album was sorta different.I would recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Charlie Hall CD and probably won't be my last!","review":"I purchased this CD because I love David Crowder and Chris Tomlin, and since Charlie Hall is always on the Passion Tour with them, I figured he must be pretty good. And he is! Although not as good as either Crowder or Tomlin, Charlie Hall does a great job. My favorite song is easily My Drink (I Remember You). Great chorus includes the lyrics: \\"You are my drink, you are my feast, you are my love, my soul's own King.\\" It also has an excellent bridge that says: \\"Your body and your blood, and I remember you. Upon the cross you hung, and I remember you.\\" Excellent! Overall, this is a solid album that is not breaking any new musical ground, but is adding great lyrics to praise God with. You will find yourself singing along. Charlie Hall shows why he is on tour with the greatest in the industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic","review":"This was a gift for my mother, whose first language was Polish.

The problem is that websites come and go, so some of the information in the second edition is already out of date.The interviews with the owners of the sites vary - some are very enthusiastic while others are virtually monosyllabic.If you are interested in playing Chess over the web, then this is pretty much the only guide available, so it's well worth the price.Hurst is currently working on a book about Kirsan Ilyumzhinov and Kalmykia which promises to be very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song to drive to","review":"Wreckoning has an energy provoking groove that gets your blood cruising. You can't help but drum on the steering wheel, bob your head and sing to this one. The sound is fresh, the vocals extremely unique and addicting, and the beat is contagious. This song has all the elements of a great dance hit and takes plenty of twists and turns to keep it from sounding like every other over-played pop song.

Lewis's Diary of Day to Day Events from 1922 - 1927","review":"As someone who has read nearly every Lewis title in print, my conclusion about the diary is that it is entertaining in places, is good for giving a feel for what day to day life was like for the author as he was made the transition from student to teacher, and gives fuller information about some of the characters anonymously or only briefly described in SURPRISED BY JOY and LETTERS OF C.S. LEWIS. I doubt, though, that anyone other than a Lewis enthusiast would enjoy the book. It is rather banal, certainly not on par with his later writing, and indeed rather provincial. I recommend it for Lewis scholars as reference material, but not for general reading.

The Paris book was very useful, however, the London book was not organized very well. The areas of London were not marked the same in the book as they were in the city. In some of the paragraphs describing things, it says that this really is not a good place to go, etc., etc.. The places to eat section did not describe where the restaurants were according to area and did not describe the food; good, fair, excellent. This book also gave little details and always referred to other books to buy. My husband and I walked London and took the underground and this book did not give us in detail where the sights were. If we had a car, the book would have been better, but we wanted to use public transporation and enjoy our vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed!","review":"Not very successful: of all the guides this one seems to have a hidden agenda that sometimes borders on the absurd. Badly written and badly researched. The writers can scarcely conceal a latent dislike of the place. I hated this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!Makes a great gift!!!","review":"I ordered two copies of this book recently as birthday gifts to my four year old nephew and the five year old son of a friend. The kids love this book! They can't actually read yet, but as much as they enjoy for the stories to be read to them now, I now that they will love them even more once they learn to read. I ordered a copy for my own children today. If your kids are like mine, they have TOO MANY TOYS and a gift like this book makes much more sense to buy for a child. All of the Disney Treasury series/Easy to Read Series are great books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose","review":"Not a very good story line. Just a series of events happening in a airport with little tying the events to a central storyline. Mostly seems like production tried to capatilize in the popularity of actress Choi Ji Woo. Many close up shots of her in the series so if you are a Choi Ji Woo fan you will probably like her performance but will be disappointed in the quality of the storyline. Add to that the English translation in my box set was so terrible during the second half of the series that it was hard to understand much of the plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"My only complaint:","review":"Is price. For the money, I could have bought real ammo. Real ammo is way too expensive. I wonder why that is? Oh yes, it's clear to me now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! This is not the 60's garage/psych comp of the same name!","review":"Apparently there are 3 very different albums with this same title out there. Because there is no tracklist on the page for this and because I wasn't yet aware of the multiple albums, I bought it, and was quite surprised when I put it on my stereo and out blasted techno! Of course, then I couldn't return it because it was open. So be very careful you are getting the disc you intend to."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Math tips for the SAT","review":"This is a great little book of handy tips to skip through. Charles Gulotta, does a good job in making this book easy, fun, and humorous to go through. I found my self chuckling while going through one of the tips. Even if one knows a lot of the tips there are sure to be a few that one doesn't know. In this book Charles uncovers and points out traps that can ensnare an innocent test taker. All in all this is a fine little book, and it would't hurt to read it, whether you know your math or not. There is, however, one set back to this book. It is too expensive for it's size. One can buy a complete preparation book for around the same price. If price isn't a concern to you, then i would suggest getting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks what you REALLY need","review":"Don't bother with this book if you're even close to being a math enthusiast. If you are you would know all this material implicitly. There are only 130 problems total and even a low-grade virtuoso of the mathematical philosophies could finish the problems in a couple hours. The people who should be getting this book are those who have waited until the last minute to prepare for the SAT. Don't even bother with this for the PSAT. If you wait until the last minute to prepare for the PSAT and need this book, you aren't going to make the cutoff (for the National Merit Scholarship program). Believe me"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to get your feet wet","review":"I liked this book a lot because it wasn't intimidating. A lot of SAT books are HUGE, and you may feel as if you're drowning in material. This book quickly introduces you to the types of problems you'll see on the SAT, and does it in a way that's fun and makes you want to read on. You'll be feeling better about the whole SAT experience before you know it. The math in this book is not terribly difficult, so it's not for people who want to learn advanced mathetmatics. It's more about how to APPROACH SAT math problems, and the pitfalls most students fall prey to (far more invaluable than a math book on the SAT, believe me). However, the problems in the book are explained very comprehensively, so if you're phobic about math at all, this is perfect for you. I still recommend other books in addition to this one, because it contains no actual practice tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly helpful and not just for the SAT!","review":"I used this book to as a study tool for the Praxis I exam. \\"100 Math Tips for the SAT\\" provides a variety of problems and supplemental explanations for these problems. As I went through the problems in the book, I was initially stumped by some. However, as I read through Gulotta's explanations and instructions, I found myself immediately understanding what I was doing wrong. Gulotta not only predicted the mistakes I was making, but took me through step by step instructions on how to avoid such mistakes. Gulotta doesn't take for granted the fact that not everyone is a math genius. Problems are broken down so clearly that even someone as \\"un-math savvy\\" as myself can learn. I definitely recommend this book to anyone studying for the math section of the Praxis exam. Thanks to this book, I went into the exam feeling confident and left the exam feeling confident!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rails Across America did not work.","review":"I can't get the game to install.

The top down view is terrible it looks like the game was released before the artist were done. I found myself playing in the furthest out zoom and all you really do is look at lines that represent tracks being built. You do manage the railroad but this in itself is not much fun. I have played Railroad Tycoon Gold edition for numerous hours and enjoyed it immencly. I played this game off and on for about a week and have no interest in playing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMARTY JONES FAN","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book, I thought I was ordering a book that told the story of \\"SMARTY\\" from birth to the present, instead I got a \\"GREAT\\" photo book of the \\"PEOPLE'S HORSE\\". If you are a horse lover of any way, shape or form you will like this book, and like a previous reviewer said, there are a lot repetions, but each picture will take you back to the races in 2004, even if you did not record it on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book was written in 1986 and, by my estimation, was outdated when it was written. No updating has been done in 14 years. This means that numerous tools and materials we use every day were not covered. This is the worst book I have purchased from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background for the novice","review":"The other reviewer found this book outdated, and perhaps it is not for an intermediate or advanced woodworker. But I found it very helpful in explaining the basics for a novice. The introductory chapters on grades of wood, reading plans, etc. give a lot more background information than most other beginning woodworking books I've looked at. The book also discusses the differences between working with wood, plywood, and particle board. I like the fact that it tells how to do things using hand tools (for those of us who can't afford to spend thousands of dollars for a shop full of power tools in order to begin our first project). The book also explains how to make joints using several different kinds of tools. The book is easy to read, but could have more figures/pictures for some techniques. I would recommend it for anyone who is just starting out in woodworking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verry good value for the price","review":"I purchased these radios a month ago. The range of these radios is outstanding. The clarity is superb. The call feature is useful and so is the scan button. There are two buttons on the side this can be confusing. The top button is used to talk and the bottom is used to turn the squelch off. (So you can monitor very weak signals) At first it was hard to get used to, but after a while it becomes second nature. Extremely great value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Scary and exciting!","review":"This book was definitely one tht you want to read with the lights on !

Please fix the title though I am curious as to how much money has been garnered from this \\"error.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiggles want to grow up","review":"This DVD does not touch my 3 year old at all. Are you growing up, Wiggles? We do not keep up. They gave up the skivvies, traded them in for more fancy looks, there seems to be more budget for DVD, which should've been good... \\"wobblie camel\\" and \\"barking dog\\" from years ago sounds better. And offered better dancing. I do not rate the second half of the video, we never made it there. I also think, music recording/mixing seems screwed to me: vocals fade while instruments too loud on many songs. And too busy. Guys overplayed in the studio. Children need more distinct vocals to learn the songs. And, yes, too fast on that one mexican rythm. Wows to Sam, though. He is a great actor and singer. We love Sam and Captain. I mean, we like all the guys, just not this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This did NOT make the kids want to dance","review":"I run a daycare in my home that's currently hosting children ages 9 mos. - 4 years old. We LOVE the Greg & Steve Big Fun video - the kids are ardently involved in singing and dancing along for the whole video. Needing more variety, I read the reviews on this Wiggles video and thought it sounded equally as engaging. I was so surprised when watching it with the kids: a series of performed and digitally altered dances that made no attempt to get the kids up and moving. As a smattering of different styles of dance and a variety of music, it was okay, but honestly boring to watch for all of us. I'm returning it. I think live performance videos are the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son didn't seem interested","review":"My son who usually stops everything for The Wiggles was not the least bit interested in this Wiggles DVD. Parents will probably like the music more than the kids. This one just seems targeted at an older audience.

It was the only thing he would watch. Now that Greg is gone, none of the new ones keep his attention. They all seem to have a different vibb coming from them. Sam is a good singer but I'm guessing with a new singer and WB taking over the videos they just aren't the same. I own ever older wiggle but I will no longer buy the new ones. I read reviews and thought this one might be better and maybe they just needed to find a grove with all the new changes but it isn't working. I personally think it has become to digital enchanced for a child. The wiggles are not as much of it as they were or should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring song remakes from the 60's- more for adults not the kids","review":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT... Not only does it not have the typical bouncy kids songs, they are mostly song remakes from the 60's. NOT kids songs! And they are slower songs.AND what kid wants to dance a waltz or a slow polka? Totally geared to amuse the parents in my opinion. First dvd I've gotten with 'Sam Wiggle' and now I'll not buy anymore with him whether rated good or not! My son loves the Wiggles, and this dvd does NOT hold his attention, in fact he brought me his shoes which means he wants to go outside and play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not songs kids would enjoy","review":"I had not watched the Wiggles before but my 2 year old talked about them from daycare.

My boys ages 6,5 and 22 months have watched it too many times to count. It was a surprise to see all The Wiggles sing in this video since they all rarely sing. The songs are catchy even for an adult.

Less than that might be possible if you remove some spacers that came with the bike. There is 1 inch more to go up if needed. The product seems in high quality strong material. The bolt is actually pretty long and strong than the picture shows. I have been riding my bike up and down a small hill many times along dirt and light gravel tracks, many times in a bike park with 3-4 feet dirt bumps, once along a 16 miles gravel and dry mud track.

Because of the relevance of the authors, the protocols are completely explained from the necessity of such at the time when they came to their existence at present.

Readers whose expectations begin and end with a fairly credible \\"puzzle story\\" might find this book appealing, but I would not recommend it to anyone who seeks engaging characters and well-crafted prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudged through this one","review":"I can only hope James Tucker is a better doctor than writer. One reviewer said that the characters were disjointed. I agree 100%. Tucker spends SO much time trying to develop characters that he ends up creating a confusing atmosphere. Over halfway through the book I looked at the back cover again, and was SURPRISED to find out that Jack Merlin is considered the leading character. Could have fooled me. I thought of him as a side story, allowing the Assistant DA access into the medical world.One Pittsburgher said that the book hits on the hot spots, and local quirks of PGH. I'm not so sure. I recently moved to PGH and feel like I know no more about the city than I did before I read the book.

My last Quartet marker was getting old, so with their new \\"patented three chamber technology\\" and \\"ink level gauge,\\" I thought these would show a marked (sorry) improvement over the old ones. Not so! Even my old Quartet markers are darker than these brand new ones. Quartet must have changed something, and not for the better. Very disappointing.Expo markers are much darker and the colors much bolder. They erase well too - just don't get Expo \\"washable\\" markers.

Unfortunately, with about a week of use, the ink started leaking from the tip leaving puddles on my dry erase board and left stains on my fingers every time I attempt to write with it. And I'm not even a heavy user. The chamber which was full a week ago is nearly empty now. Also, I agree with another reviewer who said that it is difficult to erase the ink after it's dried. You need to put a good amount of elbow grease with the dry eraser. Perhaps I got a defective one, but I'm going to stick to the tried and true Expo markers from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapor caused me breathing distress","review":"They are certified \\"non-Toxic\\" but the MSDS does not say what is in them.

Meanwhile these hard plastic casings for the ink are being dispensed of in the garbage and ending up, non biodegradable, in landfills. I have written the company to ask that they evaluate other ways of encasing these so as to lessen their environmental impact. Perhaps they might find away to create a refillable encasing - like a fountain pen. Offices or schools could have a dispenser where employees could refill their pens.I used a SMARTBoard where I previously taught and did not have to rely upon these dry erase markers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Autumn Heart review","review":"This is an excellent movie!

I was pretty disappointed here. For starters, it looks like it was filmed on someone's home video camera. A personal pet peeve. The acting was terrible. It does look like a student film, but not a good one. The general plot failed when the action started to happen and the kids didn't leave when they had ample opportunity and wrote in pathetic reasons for why they wouldn't. It wasn't just like your typical bad decision making from a teen scream movie, it was really bad writing. Bad sets, bad directing, awful special effects...I'll give it this, it did have one or two scenes with some mild creepiness. Overall, I wouldn't waste my time, and its only a 1hr 15m movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I'm all for suspense-building and some good creepy things happening but there's just not enough of this here. I found the first half pretty boring - mostly two characters sitting around being scared after a couple of things happen. On the plus-side, the female lead's fear is mostly believable but her hysteria just goes on way too long. Things finally get going and the story becomes a little more interesting but the overall effect is only so-so. I'll watch it once more, in case it improves the second time around (as many movies do), but something tells me this DVD will end up in my next box of donations to the Salvation Army.

I know that however I wish to save you some time and money.I started watching this movie and simply couldn't stay focused due to the boring slow moving story. I stopped watching around 15 minutes in. I then started back up the next day as I paid for it and I was desperate to watch something. I made it to 45 minutes out of the 113 total and stopped again. It's slow moving, I don't care about the characters or have a need to find out what's going on. I suspect I'll try and finish it tomorrow, as I paid for it, but I suggest you skip this one unless you are really desperate to watch something. It's very very slow moving and the things that do happen are so far between with the filling being the characters just verbally stressing out over what happened.

He would spend a short time with each child in the group asking them questions and just carrying on a simple conversation. Largely unscripted, the responses he would get to his questions were often hilarious.Those responses were unintentional wordplay, where the young ears and minds heard something but transliterated it into something else.

However, a major character is missing throughout both seasons and a cornerstone character ends up dead. Yes, I can live w/o Friar Tuck, but how could they KILL MARION!!! Are you joking? There is no Robin w/o Marion. Writers are so lazy and un-original that all they can think think up is killing major characters. For once can the good guys win completely?

So much better than the '80s Robin Hood BBC series...This is a Robin Hood for fans of Indiana Jones and The Lord of the Rings. A gorgeous score, wonderful costumes, outstanding performances, riveting plots, cunning twists...Aside from the biased, uninformed view against Christianity that is evident in the writing, I endorse this Robin Hood wholeheartedly. Worth the full price! I can't wait for Season Two!\\"And then I bought Season Two the day it came out...Um...what the heck happened? Did the writers just get in a big hurry? Did everybody lose their sense of humor? All of a sudden, this great Robin Hood story turns into a lackluster, boring crawl through Sherwood Forest. These characters I grew to love (and love to hate) in Season One are now making me want to walk away for a sandwich mid-sentence. I'm very disappointed in the way Season Two decided to turn. I won't be returning for Season Three."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitive theme, a strong message","review":"Having worked in HIV/AIDS prevention education, I find this book to be a great tool in helping parents talk to their children about the sensitive issue of AIDS. It addresses the issue from a child's perspective, in a warm and loving manner, while at the same time being able to be informative and direct. The illustrations are also colourful and amazing and add to the overall theme and friendliness of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This book is deceptively named. Only about half of it has to have to do with hors d'oeuvres and the rest of the book is devoted to recipes for dishes that could be in any cook book. Why would a specialty book on hors d'oeuvres include recipes for fettuccine, fried catfish, soups, chicken legs, roast quail etc? Perhaps the idea is that this is buffet food, but the title doesn't say that. And there are exactly fourteen color pictures. Also, the book is very strangely designed; it feels cheap. No question that Paul Larousse is a serious professional---five stars for the author. His work is the best, but I think he's been victimized by his editors. For comparison, buy The Professional Caterer by Denis Ruffel."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was amazing","review":"As an avid Anne Rice reader, I thought this book was amazing. I picked this book up for the hell of it, not expecting one of Rice's \\"erotic\\" novels to have much quality in it at all. But I was blown away from the first page. For those of you who might say that Jeremy was just a \\"horn dog\\" eager to get in Belinda's pants whenever he could, you obviously missed something. The point was that Belinda was not 16, just as Mona Mayfair was not 13. The beauty of this book is in the depth of love and art and mystery. It was so beautiful at times that it made my heart ache. And so I recommend this book to anyone, it's fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. You will love it. The story flows smoothly and keeps your attention. Rice doesn't jump all over the place. It is a sweet story that you can't put down, because you want to know what will happen next. You won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed!","review":"The beggining of the book was un-put-downable for a bit until the issue 'mystery' of this Belinda cropped up and all the hype/trite/clicheness about her being a child superstar flooded the book. I also didn't like all the 80s version of being a film star and all that. It reminded me vaguely of 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' and everything 80s. A fairly good read if you skip more than half the book (which unfolds who Belinda is). The wait was EXHAUSTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Anne's best work","review":"I love Anne's vampire novels (well, three of them anyway), and I've found her other books to vary in quality. Belinda ranks toward the bottom of the spectrum -- it's easy to tell it's one of her early works. I didn't find the Belinda character realistic at all; I suppose when writing fiction authors often try to convey a \\"fantasy self\\", someone worldly yet naive and beautiful. Perhaps Belinda is what Anne wanted to be once. She seems just too perfect to exist.The romance between her and Jeremy I also found implausible, not to mention a bit unnerving given the age difference.Read The Mummy, Feast of all Saints, and the first three Vampire books for Anne's best work. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I made it through about 45 pages of this book before I had to put it down and just walk away. It is boring, slightly disturbing, and just all around not my thing.

This book however was soooo boring I read to page 97, couldn't take anymore and skimmed the rest reading the end. I don't know what Jeremy did to Belinda in New Orleans, or Marty, Blair, G.G., Alex, Bonnie, Susan etc roles in the outcome. I just didn't care. I am so glad I only paid $1.50 at a used book store for this waste of time, I have never been so disappointed and bored numb. The age difference between Belinda and Jeremy didn't bother me which I was surprised, the only thing I guess is that the \\"eroticism\\" was so bland and vanilla I missed it somewhere. Please save your money, I have no idea what these other reviewers are going on and on about unless they have never read Rice at her erotic best in the Beauty Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"i couldnt *force* myself to finish this one","review":"ive never read anne rice before and i will never read her again. how belinda (a child) is able to hold the attention of jeremy (an adult?) is just beyond me. i forced myself to pick this book up, never being one to start something and not finish it, but i finally decided this one wasnt worth my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"My review of this book consists of the following adjectives: boring, mundane, tedious, stupid, pathetic.

I had already devoured most of her published books (at that time) and this one fell drastically short of what I had come to expect and love from this brilliant woman! I failed to see the same eloquent and sometimes subtle eroticism that I had come to love about her works. This book seemed borderline \\"smuttish\\" to me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has never read any of her works before. However, I feel that most avid fans of her works are capable of deciding whether or not this really is up to the same high standards she set for herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was a peice of junk","review":"Thought it was a peice of junk, Thought it was a peice of junk, Thought it was a peice of junk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Belinda","review":"The book Belinda was sent to me in a very timely manner.

Why would a world renouned author turn into a pedophile?if you're a woman, I'm sure you'll like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful romantic adventure . . .","review":"This was a great, if unconventional, love story with a beautiful setting. How often do you read of forty-year-olds and sixteen-year-olds falling in love and living happily ever after? The only problem I had with this book was that Belinda was a bit (well, a lot, actually) on the promiscuous side. Although it was a rather slow read (not because it wasn't exciting, but because the print is so small and the book is thick), it was always captivating. I liked this realistic book much more than Rice's vampire books. Personally I think she should stay away from vampires and so-called erotica and concentrate on things like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-Modern Lolita","review":"This book has been harshly reviewed but I did not find it that awful. Yes, it is a bit of a \\"Lolita\\" rip-off but Rice adds enough of her own personal touches to this novel to further itself from \\"Lolita\\". Some of the differences include the portrayl of the characters. For example, Belinda is a street smart girl who really does love Jeremy unlike Lolita who seemed to be more infatuated with Humbert rather than really love him. Jeremy, on the other hand, is very similar to Humbert simply because he is totally in love with Belinda. While I did not fully appreciate Holy Communion made into erotica, I thought it was an engrossing book. If you are looking for something quick to read, this is a good choice. Not every work of literature/fiction can be deeply meaningful or serious; some fluff every once in awhile is refreshing. Also, if you are looking for erotica, this is a good bet. Especially the scene involving red wine towards the beginning of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally boring and not even mildly erotic","review":"I thought this book would be stimulating, instead I found myself putting it down and trying to figure out 'where are the good parts'. This is the first book I have ever started that I can't seem to finish. I think the relationship between Jeremy and Belinda is hardly realistic. It seems the only thing thay have is common is sex and this aspect was not explored in sufficient detail to make the book 'erotic reading material'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does This Novel Not Remind You Of Another?","review":"The one name title Belinda is quite a la Lolita. In fact the entire novel is. I realize that most story plots are recylced like aluminum cans. This novel is just a little too obvious. The beginning works like a half-way decent mystery. When the mystery is gone half-way through, so is the interest. All that is left is the pretentious prose. In fact, the prose drowns this entire book. I recommend a read of the original Lolita. Lolita is fresh and the prose is thankfully sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"Based on the majority of the glowing reviews on this book I decided to buy it. The visual imagery produced in my mind's eye by the writing was incredible, but I don't feel that this book was all that. Somehow I felt everyone is just raving about it because the author is Anne Rice. Jeremy and Belinda's relationship is just plain weird, I can't understand how a love like Jeremy's and Belinda's can develop given their differences, first starting on age, background as well as the things Jeremy did to/for Belinda. What is the attraction for both of them here?? Why someone as independent and strong in character as Belinda would go back to Jeremy after what he did to her in New Orleans is beyond me. The ending was a total letdown from the way it started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belinda-a wonderful novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This was the very first Anne Rice novel that I have read. I found her to be a wonderful writer. Once I picked this book up, I literally could not put it down. I loved all of the characters. The storyline about Jeremy and Belinda is what first drew me in. As I kept on reading, I got more and more addicted to the story and the lives of these characters. I also loved how part one is from Jeremy's point of view and then part two is from Belinda's. I was truly entranced with Anne Rice's novel. After reading this book, I'm even more interested in reading her other novels. I would recommend this book to anyone that believes in the power of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belinda review","review":"I thought the book was good, like any Anne Rice book the characters are interesting and complex, like the plot in this one. A good read, worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful in a twisted way","review":"I read this when I was 15. This is somewhat a fantasy for some girls, but yet sick to others. Belinda is like Lolita's distant cousin, (a classic by Vldimire Nabokov). If you liked that one, I recommend this book. Belinda gives you a break from the somewhat complex vocabulary of Lolita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive and emotional Page Turner!","review":"After reading Anne's Rice's erotic stories of Sleeping Beauty, I was much disappointed in her ability to write fiction outside of the \\"vampire\\" realm. Am I glad I didn't give up! Not only is the book erotic (all though not as explicit as the Beauty Trilogy), it wraps you in within the first couple of chapters and brings you into the mind of Jeremy Walker so deeply that I found myself thinking of him and the woman he loves as real people! Not only is the book a fine display of seduction and obesession,... it is a story of love and trust. I was dang near in tears in many sections, and keenly turned on during others. The plot is rich, and doesn't bore you with needless details. It's definitely a book that makes you wish it would never finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"At times I thought I'd stop reading it, but I finished it...","review":"This book is excellent. It isn't overly-analytical as is Rice's Vampire Chronicles. It delves into the human psyche, and how we weak humans deal with forbidden love. The book isn't too steamy, which I liked, and it combines some mystery as well. For example, 'Where did Belinda Come from?,\\" \\"Is that her real name?,\\" \\"What's her connection to all those film magazines?\\"However, the problem I had with this book was that, at times, I found the plot a little slow. There is some unnecessary jibberish in a fight over film and scandals between Jeremy Walker, and his once gay lover, the 62-year old, Alex.But the plot is involving enough to where one doesn't fall into boredom too quickly. It's another great work by a great author of supernatural thriller and contemporary erotic and historic fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rice's take on Lolita?","review":"Perhaps... but she does a good job of weaving her story as only she knows how to do. The illicitness of the relationship between Belinda and Jeremy keeps things hot and interesting, that and the overwhelming desire to find out who this girl is! Rice does a good job of playing up her age, making you feel guilty for desiring her. I can't think of many authors who could pull this kind of book off. It touches that part in all of us that desires to thumb it's nose at taboo"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice looking but didn't work right","review":"My son got this for christmas.

Every watch broke within 6-12 months of purchase. My daughter's watch broke in the first 6 hours of wearing it and we were at the museum that day so she wasn't doing anything that might cause it to break. When I went to the jewelry store to have it repaired, I was told that they had seen a bunch of watches of this style all mysteriously breaking.

I wholeheartedly recommend his work. While he's not entirely convincing on the \\"War\\" issue(I think his abstracting of a \\"theocratic fascist\\" enemy is a bit problematic), otherwise he's always tight and if nothing else, fun to read. He's a bit tedious in the last Orwell book, but his essays have no remotely blunt areas--i.e., very sharp-like, all the time.As to the Dalai Llama issue raised at length below...let's see, \\"he has no right to denigrate our religion.\\" No. No, that's objectively wrong. He has every right to denigrate your religion. Of course there's so many moral cowards running around right now, I can see why you'd think that. Nobody's ever bothered to denigrate your religion before. One would think there were a law against it, or something. Of course if you substitute the \\"religious\\" in \\"anti-religious bias\\" with \\"nonsense,\\" as in \\"anti-nonsense bias,\\" Hitchens' position may be more comprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitch not up to par in this one.","review":"Hitchens can be a very sharp, insightful writer.

Try reading his \\"Why Orwell Matters\\" for a glimpse of the real Hitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have writers the right to be wrong?","review":"Hitchens is getting boring. His contrarianism feels more and more like schtick and his rabid support of the Iraq catastrophe is the stuff of sour grapes and DT's.

The emphasis is on anecdotes rather than motives, psychology, ideas, or works created. The book is lightly documented, and if you already know anything about the individual writers or the movements they were part of, you'll look in vain for new insights. It's certainly readable, but because it treats the subjects with so little context, the reader wonders after a bit why one should care about these folk, who sound more like a bunch of dysfunctional celebrities of the nineties than the defining minds of a complex and fascinating historical era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use finer ground coffee","review":"The first time I used the MyPod, I used a scoop and a half of regular ground coffee. The result: coffee water! So I tried again. I used the same amount of very finely (espresso) ground coffee (which, by the way, the directions say NOT to do). The coffee came out VERY strong (which I like). So I would imagine that if you experiement with a grind that's somewhere in between those two, you'll be successful with it. Also, it helps to fill and load the pod over the sink. Until you get the hang of it, it can be messy. But it's totally worth it for the money you save."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!!!!","review":"I like this gadget I got for my Senseo. I find it easy to use, not messy at all. It's just dump and rinse to clean. I find I can make a cup of coffee almost as fast as sticking a premade pod in the pot so I don't see a time problem at all using MyPod.I find a scoop and a half of my favorite roast from my favorite coffeehouse makes a very good cup of coffee. It's much cheaper to use the MyPod than to constantly buy pods at $5 to $6 a package in the grocery store.Set your grind for medium on your grinder and experiment with how much coffee to put in (1 to 1-1/2 scoops) and you should be good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was keen on using the MyPod with our new Senseo but was disappointed from the start.

I tried again, using a filter on the bottom of the holder as well as on top of the coffee...essentially a single large pod, but still weak coffee. I wish I knew how the person who gave this item 5 stars managed to get a good cup of coffee. I'm sure if the number of holes in the bottom of the pod holder was greatly reduced, allowing the water to be forced through the coffee grounds, then it might work. The current design just doesn't work.

Now i have to back track...lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional debut novel!","review":"The negative reviews about this book must come from frustrated writers who have been unable to get anything published and are jealous of new talent. This is an engrossing novel with a highly developed characterization of the villain. Unlike the more pedestrian mystery novel, this one focuses less on the technical aspects of police work, but delivers a truly terrifying and heart wrenching story that grabs the reader from beginning to end. This is the first of McFayden's books that I've read and am anxiously looking forward to the rest of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read and Super Gross","review":"This book was almost too gross for me but it was worth it -- a great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Man's Silence of the Lambs","review":"Good battle between some very bad (brutal) criminals, and a weakened profiler. Keeps you turning pages quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Harris he ain't","review":"I gave up after reading the first fifty pages and absolutely nothing happened. I'm sorry I wasted $7.00 and ninety minutes of my life on this. The characters are cardboard, the narrative is endless and for a thriller, well...it's not very thrilling. Save your money on this one. Read this instead:Caught Stealing: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to return it.","review":"I have not returned anything for over 10 years.The text dicussses the FBI agent's feelings.On and on and on...Her feelings...From one mood and feeling, to another feeling...I understand that many will like this, so that is OK.But I could not listen to it...I was thinking: please don't tell me your feelings,on and on, just get on with it and catch the bad guy...Perhaps, this is just me, and, again: I am aware that many many people like this type of writing, and, it sells well.If so, for you, buy it.Be well."},{"rating":"1","title":"shadowman","review":"I was sent the wrong item and I am waiting for my refund. I hope you can send it soon.Susie Terrell"},{"rating":"2","title":"an elegantly dark masterpiece","review":"This book stands above the typical serial killer fare because of Cody's incisive descriptions, cutting-edge research on the psychology of crime, and his beautifully terrifying use of language.This is fresh, gripping writing that I couldn't put down.The only reason I don't give it a 5 out of 5 was the lack of plot twists. The story moves steadily forward and most readers will guess the identity of the killer long before the revelation at the book's climax. Despite that, check this book out. I'm sure a writer as skilled as Cody will learn from this and make his next villain a little less evident. Keep up the good, chilling work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Gruesome, violent, ridiculous plot, waste of time and money. I tossed it in the garbage. I would be ashamed to pass it along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighteningly awesome book!","review":"What a great writer...very scary and gripping! If you love books that scare the pants off you, you'll want to read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I didn't find this book boring, but I did find it incredibly unrealistic and absurd in its plot points.Every character in the story is doted over to the extreme. I found myself wondering how it is possible that every person can be so awesome. Also, the authors fixation on revealing emotions through people's eyes gets very tiresome. I cannot imagine what it must look like for a persons face/eyes to register sadness, fear, a deep longing, gratitude all in the span of 10 seconds. It seems like it is easier to just say that a characters eyes show fury than to actually show his fury through the writing.I can imagine high school kids sitting around coming up with the list of 'things that are sweet and extreme' that a serial killer can do which was shown in this book.Not to mention, the killer was obvious within 10 minutes of reading.Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't do it","review":"You know you're in trouble with a book when, after the first few chapters, you can barely muster up enough interest to pick it up and continue reading. I couldn't get past the sixth chapter of this thing. It's possibly unfair to write a review of something not even half read, but based on the first few chapters, this (for me) was horrible. The author bogs the reader down with how the main character FEELS about EVERYTHING, instead of driving the story forward. When a character in a story does something as simple as reach for a doorknob, is it really necessary to write a page and a half on the whirwind of emotions going on within the character at that precise moment? Maybe in some cases, the answer is yes. However, it's tedious to employ this mechanism CONSTANTLY throughout the story. I wanted to slap the lead character in 'Shadow Man'; not root for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start","review":"A cut above the average 1st thriller novel. A real page turner. Let's see what comes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor characterizations","review":"This book was purchased by my son and given to me along with several others. I started to read it, but quit after a few chapters. I thought the characters were fawning, unimpressive beings and the description of the murders much more grotesque than necessary. For someone who revels in shock value, it might seem like a good book, but I thought it was poorly written and in a word, sickening. I hate to say anything detrimental about anyone, but this book brought out the desire to comment on it. I agree with another reviewer that the characters are cardboard, and I fail to understand how such prestigious publications as The Washington Post and Publishers Weekly could give kudos to it. Nina Riggs Jones, Make Little Weeping"},{"rating":"1","title":"$7 down the drain, just like that...","review":"I rarely buy a book based on Amazon reviews, but I was hard up for something really good to read, so I gave \\"Shadow Man\\" a shot. Jeez, people, what book did you read? I threw this across the room after 60 pages. Paper cut-out characters, stilted dialogue, you name it. Its only saving grace: it'll make a perfect Lifetime movie. Oy. Any REAL thrillers out there??"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I loved this book. Page 4 and 5 where he desribes missing someone is incredible. Page 269 where he (she) talks about what love is is almost poetic. I think the characters are realistic, flawed to a human degree. I cannot wait for his next book. This was was thrilling, scary and real. No hocus pocus or wrapping the story up in one page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!!","review":"This book was really entertaining, it is my first serial killer novel book, but it was great read. If you are ready for graphic depictions of a sick mind; this is the book you are looking for. It had my attention, and took me only a day and a half to finish it. It really grabs your attention, wanting to see what happens in the end. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was gravely disappointed in this book.","review":"Why and how it became a \\"best\\" of recommendation is more of a mystery than the one in the book. The book has flashes of good writing, but the majority of it is a cliche ridden exposition on how to write by formula. I found the characters unbelievable, the plot was almost nonexistent since it was obvious by the third chapter who the murderer was, and the dialogue sometimes painfully silly. The torture/rape/murder scenes were detailed to a disturbing degree. All in all a book to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I saw this book while I was on the computer and gave it a try. The characters have the same persionallity half of the time, cold but caring. It got old. It just wasnt a book I could get into. I dont sugest reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time - one of the worst of the genre","review":"I only gave a 1 star because there's no \\"zero\\" star option. The story lack of credibility. Bores you to death with the \\"feelings\\" and \\"memories\\" of Smoky Barret (What a name) and irritates you with \\"Honey Love\\". How could this team be the best in dealing with serial killers when they do not look at the obvious connection to all of them. Ridiculous, bad investment, after the first couple of chapters started to jump over most of the pages just to see where it was heading. Should have thrown it away unread. I do not understand how so many people liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Harris Move Over??? Whatever!!","review":"This wasn't the worst book I've read...I actually have mixed feelings...the killer was scary, twisted, etc. and some of the cops were very well developed as characters...but there was too much \\"touchy/feely\\" stuff in it for a serial killer book. That might sound lame but it's the only way I know how to put it...again, not the worst book...but the reviewers on the cover that said things to the effect of \\"Thomas Harris move over...there's a new game in town..\\" Whatever! There's no comparison between McFadyen and Harris...Harris is the master and McFadyen is...well...not the master!"},{"rating":"1","title":"made me ill","review":"I enjoy scary serial killer novels as much as the next guy, but this one made me ill. Violence is ok when it serves a purpose in the story, but this one has way too much gratutious torture. I figured out who the killer was right away because he was practically wearing an \\"I'm the killer\\" sign on his chest. And these supposedly brilliant FBI agents never even focused on why the killer knew so much detail about each of the agents. Shouldn't this have made this suspicious that it could be someone \\"in-house\\"? Just a sad, terrible story with no redeeming value. All the characters are either saints or devils. Just way too predictable to bother with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"As an avid reader of this genre, I can honestly say this is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The imagery is almost difficult to stomach at times, but I am already wishing I had McFadyen's next book. If you are tired of some of the more watered down \\"suspense\\" novels out there, I highly recommend giving this book a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"I'd been lusting after a Leatherman Micra for a while (I have a collection of pocket knives and I am perpetually on a quest for the Perfect Folding Utility Knife.) Is this The ONE?The patented design includes a fold-out pliers--you bend down the two sides and out pops a very useful set. And there are two wire cutters--one for hardened wire and one for soft.

I love the thin needle nose plier head.BUT, when the pliers are used, you can get a *VERY* severe pinch of your skin in the palm of your hand that can draw blood. The design is such that the handles meet/touch without a gap to prevent a blood drawing pinch. I own three other Leatherman multitools NONE of the handles meet/touch they all leave a gap to prevent this problem. That is why I call it a design flaw.THis tool is good, but the pliers cannot be used safely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than AM radio","review":"I took a chance buying this DVD, and it paid-off. I was never a big fan of Tommy James, but the songs are ingrained from years gone-bye (mostly AM Radio listening). What makes this DVD a special treat is hearing all these songs, for the first time, in premium sound quality. While I wouldn't rate the sound quality as superior -- it non-the-less delivers quality enough to make this DVD's 5.1 surround a keeper for the ages. The picture is also very good, and the setting, filmed at \\"The Bitter End\\" a small nightclub/bar makes the moment very personal. Much like some of my other favorites: Roy Orbison (Black & White), Bee Gees (One Night), Moody Blues (Royal Albert Hall), the overall quality and features (interview etc.)make this DVD one of those unique finds that favorably captures the music of its time in a just fashion. Chances are that if you show an interest in the DVD you will most likely enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy James: One of the best!!","review":"This is a great video concert for fans of Tommy James.
