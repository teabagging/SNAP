Very romantic. You couldn't beat is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FANTASY OR SCIENCE FICTION?","review":"There is a point where science fiction becomes fantasy, and Greg Egan passes that point with a vengeance. The mostly speculative physics is just that, speculation, fantasy run amok! The plot was poor, and character development was atrocious. I could feel no sympathy for, or identify with, any of the characters. The only good parts of the story were where mind transfers took place, this idea was well done here, but for an even better treatment of that read THE FIRST IMMORTAL by James Halperin, a very good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to comprehend, even for a physicist","review":"I regret that I have to give this book a brief and poor review. I found it extremely hard to get into, struggled to keep interested in it and, finally, felt rather let down by a lackluster and unimpressive ending.Were it not for the glossary, buried near the end of the book, I would have found it totally incomprehensible and never pursued it to it's disappointing lack of finale.Unlike many of the hard SF books that I have greatly enjoyed, I was unimpressed with the attempts to link the plot to scientific theory. The characters were minimally developed and popped in and out of the story in a way that made following them most difficult.Oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Science, Atrocious Fiction","review":"Anything that makes a novel worth reading is entirely absent here. If you think Physical Review Letters is good light reading, than you might enjoy this book. The science is very well thought out indeed, but Egan should explore collaboration with an author that can write convincingly about how the science affects the individuals or the societies."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like die-of-boredom-a","review":"I guess there's a story in these pages, but it's hidden in the technical gobbledygook lectures which occur every chapter or so. This book will annoy 2 camps: those of you looking for a meaningful plot or characters, and those of you who have actually studied the math & physics which Mr Egan babbles about. It's sure to please everyone else, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst science fiction novels I've ever read","review":"Poor character development, excessive technical details, and a slow meandering plot made this novel torture to read. I only read on to the end because I kept hoping it would get better. Once I got to the abrupt ending, I realized it wasn't going to get any better. Don't read this unless you want to be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best science fiction novel this year","review":"This is probably Egan's best novel so far. I have little doubt that it will be the best science fiction novel published this year. Some reviewers complain \\"the plot got bogged down at that point where he explained fiber bundles.\\" But the point is that Egan researches his novels so that they are actually about real science and where it might go. If you can't tell good science from bad, you can just watch Star Trek, but if you want to read science fiction that isn't just entertaining nonsense, Greg Egan is what you need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"strong AI fantasyland","review":"Like to ponder the nature of the human mind? Don't find strong AI ridiculous? You'll then find this a complete rip--Earlier reviewers give a good scene-plot synopsis. I only add that the dance around logical impossibility is at the core of much good sci-fi. Egan provoked plenty of healthy examination of the nature of self and reason. He's not well grounded in general relativity which weakens the end, but this is still very high-quality sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vision dwarfs plot","review":"Egan's vision of humanity's 30th-century reality and it's discoveries is extremely creative, illuminating, and highly probable all at once. That alone was enough to keep me enthralled, but the book would have gotten my fifth star if its plot had been as captivating as its scientific vision. Unfortunately the story -- having built up exciting steam and anticipation -- falls flat at the anticlimactic end, and seemingly important characters come and go as ultimately inconsequential cameos (Inoshiro?). Still, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid work by Egan, but not his most original","review":"I like Greg Egan, and \\"Diaspora\\" makes me wonder why I don't read more of his work.The story is about how the three different \\"types\\" of human (flesh human, cyborg, and AI) in the far future approach adversity. The story was well written and entertaining.But, it wasn't perfect. Egan wrote about machine resident human personalities in \\"Permutation City\\". \\"Diaspora\\" to a large extent is a re-spin of this idea. It is well done, but he's been there before. The story also has long didactical passages on quantum physics. Fans of Robert Forward may salivate over these, I was bored to tears. Finally, \\"Diaspora\\" addresses 5000 or so years due to time dilation. Anything longer than a week is just \\"a long time\\" in fiction's fourth dimension.Bottom line is I like it. \\"Diaspora\\" is good and well worth reading, despite its small faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"My brain is falling out","review":"Definitely one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. The ideas and viewpoints in this book are truly unique. I found myself wondering if I would choose to become immortal as a being of pure thought. Does mortality define our existence or is it simply an obstacle to be overcome by evolution? Obviously, we are all afraid of death or at least the state of non-existence. But would that fear really drive most people to live as sentient software? I think an extended lifespan as a regular human would be sufficient for me. Immortality would seem to be infinitely boring in my opinion.I'm definitely a fan of hard sci-fi and 'Diaspora' is without a doubt one of its best examples. A book that challenges you to think about difficult questions using plausible scenarios is the whole point of science fiction anyway.Looking forward to reading more from Mr. Egan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Enjoyed the pacing and ideas in this book. Not a huge amount of character development and some challenging places in which a physics textbook helps a tad. Great read. The first of Egan's novels I have read and was good enough to make me want to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas, but disjointed plot","review":"Greg Egan definitely has some of the most original ideas that your likely to find in science fiction, and Diaspora is replete with them. Unfortunately, the actual plot feels a bit disjointed, mostly serving as a guided tour through some truely nifty concepts. I recommend reading it, but not particularly for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Lincoln ever","review":"I first read this Lincoln when I was [...]- in its Spanish version-and since then I have read it more than a dozen times- and each time I keep finding it more refreshing.Emil Ludwig wrote several other biographies, but Lincoln's was his best.

I am wondering how substantive the changes are, especially since it costs $41 for the second edition, while the first edition is available for as low as $5. Obviously if a major re-write has resulted in significant changes throughout the text, then purchasing the newer edition is an important consideration. (According to the information he's added/altered material to reflect new natural disasters and in the wake of 9/11). But if the changes are minor, I'd like to know before I pay eight times as much for a version of this book.

But let's face it, there are a lot of slicers out there for a fraction of the cost. So the only selling points for this is 1. The grating function and 2. It works with the mixer. While grating the blade feels very \\"loosey-goosey\\" due to the way it rides on the PLASTIC carriage. Then came the day when, yep, I dared to press a little too hard and BANG the spindle and carriage breaks rendering it totally busted. YOU CAN NOT PRESS AT ALL WITH THIS FOOD PROCESSOR!!!

And in some way they were, for his details on the process are precise and relevant. Pollan takes it easy, too, and he meanders, but his aim is true, and few words are wasted.

Pollan has written a thoughtful and thought-provoking narrative that not only has me looking at the built world more carefully but has also inspired me (as I had hoped when I first saw the book) to eventually tackle a construction project for myself. The descriptions in the book are wonderfully detailed and it subsumes an impressive amount of material for its length, giving the reader a sense of how much thought goes into even the most seemingly straightforward projects.

It's an impossible album to describe and doesn't really fall into any genre. Jazz rock is the best I can do to describe it. The reason it didn't sell well is that the record-buying public can't see a model as a singer. But that's the record-buying public's stupidity. There is just some amazing work here, and the proof is that it's going for over $100 more than ten years since it was released. sf consulting, if you're still out there, I'd love to get a copy of this on CD.

Death is tragic. Life is funny.","review":"Sparkle Hayter watches CNN and the Cartoon Channel, (according to her Amazon.com interview). 'Nice Girls Finish Last' is influenced by both: a thoroughly enjoyable mystery novel which is simultaneously loopy and gritty. Robin Hudson has principles, needs to pay bills, and wants to be a TV reporter - so she's balancing on the edge of yellow journalism, working out of a converted bathroom with a painfully annoying boss, and coping with life's mundane details, like avoiding a least-favorite relative and making a GYN appointment. Murder can complicate an already busy schedule. Robin rushes around New York, often noticing the quirky, ironic, and just plain inexplicable: are we aware of security cameras as we pick our noses, and what is guerilla art anyway? The mystery is clever and the background is serious and silly, commonplace and outrageous, kind of like real life. It's great entertainment for nice girls, and for the rest of us, too"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Liked It!

Ms. Hayter also employs every last offensive stereotype of Republicans (in her world, they're all homophobic, racist, women hating, bible thumping, book banning, self-important morons), so unless you're to the left of the political divide, be prepared to be insulted on every other page. I'm so glad I took this book out of the library, rather than shelling out good money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I love Robin Hudson. She's beautiful, quirky and red-headed to boot. She's got an exciting life and has such original ideas...like planting poison ivy in all of her window boxes to make anyone who breaks in easy to identify or using a spray glue gun as a weapon of choice (not to mention the epilady!) Her family members are not unlike my own, particularly Aunt Mo.I adored the fast-paced, unusual, hilarious S&M; plot. Ms. Hayter's talent with wisecracks and word play is priceless. The description of Robin's evil neighbor's robe as 'looking like it was made from teddy bear pelts' had me rolling! What a fabulous description! It's worth buying this book just to get to know the unique characters. Thanks for a super read, Ms. Hayter. Keep 'em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayter Nails It","review":"A surprisingly complex book that uses farce to explore the conflicting desires to be a 'good girl' and make nice, and to fight back.

Laugh out loud funny, leaving a lot to think about later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!!!","review":"This 3rd CD in the John Blair Party is in my opinion the best.

Of course, my favorite's are \\"I'm in Love\\" by Veronica, and \\"Share My Joy\\" by GTS featuring Loleatta Holloway. If you can't be at your favorite club this weekend, this is the next best thing.

There are no maps of Marion or Indiana included in the book, the characters come in and out of the book in a confusing manner, and after trudging my way through 3/4 of the book I'm still not sure as to what the author's point is.

In addition, the beginner hoops sold by the same company are not big enough or sticky enough for learners.

This is a DVD on how to do tricks with your hoop. Nothing more.

She explains things much more clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I love Christabel and have great respect for her, and love the fact that she's from the SF Bay Area like myself, but honestly, this DVD isn't that great for beginners. She's so great at what she does that she flows straight through it and it goes by quickly, not really leaving any time for a beginner to truly breakdown the movements that she's doing in order to do a trick. The DVD could really use some ultra slow motion to break things down step by step. Also, the names that she uses for the moves are WEIRD. I don't understand why they aren't called what they are, you know, something that describes the trick itself. Spunk? Zest? Slinky? Swish? Booty Blitz? Whisper?! NONE of these tell you what the heck they are, and I bet you the majority of the hoopers in the hooping community would not be able to tell you what they are. I have the DVD and I still can't tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such huge potential","review":"I love everything about Hulaerobics which is why I went ahead with purchasing this one. I was quickly disappointed. This dvd is not made with beginners in mind. It is very frustrating. Christabel, the pro that she is, flows through each move so seamlessly that it is impossible to make it out enough for you to copy. It does not help matters that she combines her fluidity with speed and rushes through the dvd. My dvd is now here collecting dust. Every time I try to use it, I am quickly reminded why I have not used it in so long. I think I am going to sell it.

Let me say that these watches are ABSOLUTE JUNK and that Wenger's customer service is abysmal. One of the watches stopped working within two weeks of me taking it out of the box. Wenger did replace the movement but I still had to pay $10 plus the cost of shipping the watch to them, which made me quite upset given the short time that the watch was functional. The other watch quit working within a year and when I sent it back Wenger wanted $60 to replace the movement. They also charged me the initial $10 just to look at the watch to tell me that.I would never purchase another Wenger product of any kind and I do not recommend their products at all after this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket Watch","review":"My husband was very pleased with the watch.

It doesn't help that he speaks out a lot of them as well. \\"I've got a recipe for hate... taste it!!!\\" Cringeworthy.Not a return to form, that came after with 'The system has failed.'Relative favorites: 1000X Goodbye (which suffered from additional editing after the original album entitled 'Capitol punishment' was leaked), 'Dread and the fugitive mind,' and 'Burning bridges.'Lyrically, the best is probably 'When' (only after the pathetic spoken word)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"The only reason I can't give this one star is because there is obviously good musicianship on display. However, there is a thing called songwriting that is more important and it done poorly on this recording. There is also something called passion, which might be most important of all and, again, nowhere to be found. The songs on display here are complete and utter garbage. Dave's voice has lost its edge, the lyrics have deteriorated into senseless drivel spurred on by a touching thanks to God in the credits. Any attempt at anger and agression comes off as pandering to an audience which Megadeth seem to no longer have anything in common with.

Tunes like \\"The World needs a hero\\" and \\"Motocycle\\" brought on the heavy bass and loud guitar riffs we all like to hear, while the rythmic tunes of \\"Promises\\" brings back the cruising sounds of \\"A tout le monde\\" from the Youthanasia album.Megadeth put a lot of work into the lyrics of the songs produced which shouldn't be overlooked. The music often reflects the mood as in \\"Losing my senses\\" which brings some unique melodies.I feel the crew worked hard on the album and as a result will reek the rewards. I look forard to catching up with the long awaited tour in Sydney later this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"If tis album was released twenty years ago...","review":"I would have liked it a lot better. But as it stands, this album just sounds too lost in a time warp for my liking. This style of thrash metal just seems more like something out of the early eighties than the year 2001. At least in the early eighties it would have had some *true* nostalgia. As it is, it seems Mustaine just wanted to live in the past with this album rather than getting a little more \\"with the program.\\" If you want a TRUELY nostalgic Megadeth album, listen to Peace Sells, or Killing Is My Business (preferably Peace). Or if you feel like traveling to the early nineties, listen to Rust in Peace, Countdown To Extinction, or Youthanasia (all three are excellent).

I was waitng for 2 months for it. I fanially got it, at a Wal-Mart. It was weird when I got it, becuase they always take out the swear words. The weird thing was, it had the swear words, but they covered up the cover where Vick Rattlehead was comong out of Dave's belly button. The first song is good opener. 3 is great, about going out of your mind on the road. When is a great song, I think of it as older Megadeth. Alot of the songs could use a good old' Megadeth riff to it, and just high speed guitars.

After Marty Friedman left, Dave Mustaine apparently felt the need to return to metal, and he succeded in that. Unfortunately, the music suffered as a result. Instead of making a good rock album, he made a very medicore metal album. \\"Return To Hanger\\" is not even nearly as interesting as the classic \\"Hanger 18\\", \\"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\\" sounds basically like \\"Sweating Bullets\\" and \\"1000 Times Goodbye\\" sounds very forced and insincere. For the most part, I think this album sounds very half-baked; it just sounds to me like Dave was far more interested in making a metal album than a good album. I think it's really a shame that a great band like Megadeth had to end their career with a stinker like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World Needs Megadeth","review":"Megadeth has been one of the greatest bands for years. They started off with great thrash, then toned down for a while, and with this album they go back to great metal (may not be thrash but it's definately metal). If you don't have it get it.

It works if you are a new or old fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega'deth' is right!","review":"Now, I'm not the type of jaded fan who wants them to go back to playing a million miles a second, in fact I don't like the REAL old material. I came aboard on \\"Countdown (*****)\\" and was hooked on the passionate/descriptive lyrics. I don't find that here on the new cd, instead what I found is a lot of riffs I've heard elsewhere/before. I found the last cd RISK (***) to be more uneven than this one but overall it had better tracks. The production here is actually very good but because Mustaine was the \\"producer\\" I think he let a lot of songs slip in here that may sound nice but really offer little in substance.

IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE WISE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm shocked that so many think this is a great return to old form. i challenge people to play Rust In Peace and then play this and honestly say it is as good. It doesn't have the vision, the creativity and the talent evident in Rust in Peace or any other Megadeth album I have. The press all said this was fantastic - they must be getting paid and they are probably writing online reviews under different names. I know alot of people who have been into Metal for 15 years or more and none of them like this album either. Save your cash because this is just more rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was Megac*ap","review":"I remember when Devil's Island was a Megadeth ballad. This one had some song with violins. I sobbed openly. What the hell happened to them. The sellout is complete. People who like this album also bought N'Sync, Backstreet Boys and Paul Anka. For the love of God to support this travesty by buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megadeth is dead, face it!","review":"Obviously, Risk was horrible, and this album means nothing but a desperate desire to recover the glory of Rust in Peace.It's a very good album considering Risk, of course. By itself, this title only deserves like a couple of listening sessions, and in mp3 format. Don't waste your money... unless you want to complete your Megadeth collection before moving to another band.The songs on this one are so boring... so, so boring. The only peak is Return To Hangar."},{"rating":"1","title":"COpy","review":"Unforgiveable copy of \\"AM I EVIL\\" in the track WHEN ruins the whole CD!! How can Mustaine do that??

Some great riffs. And i love the drum syncopation of the title track. the title track is worth buying the album for. All the other songs I'm afraid are typical of megadeth: Cool riff - but they do nothing with it. they should take a lesson from the Deep Purple/Black sabbath school, and learn how to use a rif properly. Just playing it over and over to begin with, then wandering off into the same dribbly bits and nasal vocals don't get you anywhere. This is a great album if you only listen to the first 10 seconds of ever song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed at first but it grew on me.","review":"Megadeth is one of my favourite bands and I have followed their development religiously for more than 10 years.The mature original MegadetH for me started 15 years ago with Countdown To Extinction. Their first 3 albums were so so, but worth the time and money. Then came Countdown and the rest is history. This album is excellent Megadeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"magadeth-a spent force.","review":"a very average album with average tracks. mustaine and co have grown old and so has their music (just like metallica). only stand out track is 'dread and fugitive mind'.rest of the stuff is boring and sounds [bad]. in case you are looking for good thrash, try newer bands like haunted, the crown etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fav. of mine, don't know why so many fans dislike it....","review":"After the heavily underrated Risk, Dave & Co. left Capitol Records for good, joined Sanctuary, and released their semi-comeback, The World Needs A Hero. Would this recieve better press than the ill-fated Risk? Read on....Well, I still don't see why so many bash this one. I love every song on here except 1000 Times Goodbye. To me that song is just painful for me to listen to and I just can't stand it's \\"It just keeps dragging on...\\" feel. But every other track is just AWESOME. Overall it's a great purchase. Oh, and DON'T get the import!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth back doing what they do best!!","review":"This album is superb, simple as that. The songs on it are absolutely class, showing that the band still shreds. This album reminds me of Countdown to Extinction more than any other megadeth album which is a good thing if u ask me coz countdown is a great album. The best songs on this album are Moto Psycho, Return to Hanger and 1000 times goodbye. If you want an album which is proper heavy metal, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD But Loose Three Tracks","review":"scratch Promises, Losing My Senses and When, you're then left with classic Megadeth tracks. these are oddball tracks to say the least, not befitting of past or present Megadeth releases.

I love every song and would recommend it to anyone. The best way to start a collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have You Gone MegadetH?!","review":"Alright, I'm a MegadetH fan and I will say that this record is par for Dave, but still there is some really bad things about this album. First: The solos are all at the end of the songs and are always far to long. You end up getting 2 minutes of actual song and 3 to 4 minutes of solos. The solos are great as they should be for the guitar genius Dave Mustain, but they are far to long to hold your interest! The title track is okay and so is the first one, but the best of the album is right at the center. The last few songs are par with the exception of one. Second: Megadeth tries to shoot for a few ballad like songs on this album. They are unfortunately, just not that good. The string arrangements are sloppy and don't go well with the guitars. Sorry guys, but this one is just kinda poor.:("},{"rating":"2","title":"great comback","review":"not a classic like rust in peace or peace sells, but a strong metal album from one of the top metal bands of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant!","review":"There's not a single bad track on here. THIS is the Megadeth cd I was hoping they'd make. For those looking for the fast and furious, there's \\"Moto Psycho\\", \\"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\\", \\"Recipe for Hate...Warhorse\\", and the incredible sequel of sorts \\"Return To Hangar\\". For those looking for more melodic metal with chugging crunching riffs, it's all here. Each song is a masterpiece in and of itself. From Dave's almost screaming lyrics on \\"Burning Bridges\\" to the almost insanity inspired \\"When\\". It's all here and it all ROCKS! Once again Megadeth proves they are the most talented metal band around. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth does it again...","review":"Though some may believe the Megaboys sold-out with their previous \\"Risk\\", they have come back in a very metal way. Return to Hangar rips like mad with some very powerful riffs. Promises is on the softer side, with a beautiful string backing. The album is just amazing. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This album was hailed as a return to form after the disaster that was Risk, and it partially succeeds. There are some heavy cuts here, and nothing blatantly commercial or made for radio. But the songs don't hold up to those on any of the albums up through Cryptic Writings. My favorites are When, Dread and Fugitive Mind, and Burning Bridges, but I wouldn't include any of these songs in a list of Megadeth's top 20 tracks. There are no classics, no unforgettable hooks or riffs. This album is for Megadeth completists only (that's the only reason I own it). Anybody else should start with Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, or Countdown to Extinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we were told to expect...","review":"I've listened through the album a few times and I'll have to admit I'm not very impressed. I have been a Megadeth fan since their inception and up until \\"Risk\\", loved every album. All of the hype about this album was how they were going back to their roots and that the album would be a lot heavier than their last few. Where's the beef??? It has a very commercial feel similar to the last 2 albums and I really feel it falls short. 'Return to Hangar' gets heavy and has some great guitar parts but it doesn't compare to 'Hangar 18'. 'When' is a pitiful song reminiscent of the crap on \\"Risk\\". I am ever so sorry to report that the world needs a hero ... I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempt to go back to roots just goes backward","review":"Megadeth's previous album gave listeners a more mello, radio-friendly Megadeth. However, Risk was largely rejected by Megadeth loyalists and almost completely rejected by mass media.So, in \\"The World Needs a Hero\\"(TWNaH herein) they look like they want to say, \\"Forget the radio! We're just going to rock.\\" The problem is that they don't rock.There is a general blandness to this album. TWNaH is composed of mostly uninteresting riffs. They seem rushed. The riffs are mid-tempo and are thin. This album sounds like a slow version of their \\"Rust in Peace\\" album.In summary, Megadeth appears to try to \\"go back to their roots\\", but they didn't want to abandon pop culture. The end result is a mock-\\"heavy metal\\" album. Once they were leaders in the metal community, now they are just one of a thousand bands releasing dull sing-along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best from Megadeth.","review":"I've become a huge fan of Megadeth over the past few years, but this isn't one of the better products."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid, Underrated Album","review":"Okay, first thing's first...Don't go into this album with outrageous expectations. This is not Megadeth at their mightiest, but it is still a good collection of songs from a solid lineup.Even with the black cloud of two past members (Friedman and Menza) hanging over their heads, Pitrelli and DeGrasso are still able to step up and deliver. Pitrelli in particular compliments Mustaine quite nicely, even though he doesn't have that exotic sound Friedman employed so often.There are a few slightly boring tracks (Losing My Senses, When, Moto Psycho) but there are also some really good tracks that more than make up for it (1000 Times Goodbye, Burning Bridges, Recipe For Hate, Dread and the Fugitive Mind).So, is The World Needs A Hero as good as Rust In Peace or Peace Sells? No, but its far from bad. Check it out after you get the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Back To Form","review":"This album is far better than the turd Risk. It features a return to thrash for the most part. The playing is alot more technical like in past Deth albums. Return to Hanger goes back to the glory days of R.I.P., and brings us this fine sequel to Hanger 18. This album is the most of all Megadeth albums to be influenced by Diamond Head. If don't know about Diamond Head, they were a British invasion band of new wave heavy metal from the late 70's-early 80's that helped pave the way for thrash metal. The tracks Dissconnect takes parts from Diamond Heads Sucking My Love, When takes riffs from Am I Evil. This is a good solid release from Megadeth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAST BREATH","review":"The trouble with this CD is not that the songs are not good; it's not the ovrewhelming sense of deja-vu. No. The songs are good and the \\"deja-vu\\" is nothing more than a great band playing his own defined style.The trouble here is that the production made the band sound tired, uninspired and without energy here, mainly the weak drumming by Jimmy DeGrasso. Never before, in a Megadeth record, the drums sounded so weak and without imagination. MUsaine's vocals are also in a down slope, and Pitrelli's playing is unmemorable, altough of course the guy is a guitar-genius.It seems to me that Dave already knew this was the last MEgadeth album for a long while, and that he did not put his heart on it.Anyway, this album is miles, miles, and more miles ahead of the abominable RISK. So, if you're a Megadeth fan like myself, ThE World... will not dissapoint you. It will only leave you asking: where's the punch here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OF course it is good, but...","review":"Of course this is good, but don't come expecting too much from it, thinking it is the good old Megadeth from PEACE SELLS or COUNTDOWN. No way, pal. MEGADETH reached that natural point where a band just can't release any more masterpieces, but can still delivers great music, which is also natural, having great musicians in its line-up, like Pitrelli and Mustaine. THe album has a good general effect. The main reason I don't give three stars is the copy of AM I EVIL included in the song WHEN. I don't care if it was to be a \\"tribute\\". If that was the case, make a cover, not a \\"new\\" song !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S NOT METAL ANYMORE!!","review":"Look, Megadeth used to be my favorite band, but This album is not heavy metal! Please, don't rate it with your heart, rate it with your mind and ears!

I bought this album and at first regretted it. Once i had listened to it a couple of times, i began liking each song one by one. once i got one of them stuck in my head, i was hooked. This album rocks! for any music lover with a fond taste for kick ass heavy metal. metal is all about not giving a F*** and thats how it should be. so all inhibitions should be forgotten, and just enjoy it! who cares about meaning and all that S***. if you do, your taking music TOO seriously, and metal is not about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEE Most Underrated Megadeth","review":"This is by far underrated Megadeth. This sounds just like Countdown, Youthanasia, & Cryptic if not a little heavier. Very talented guitar player Al Pitrelli (Savatage, Trans Siberian Orchestra) solid drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (Suicidal Tendencies, Alice Cooper)make this a solid Megadeth release. A lot of the criticism comes because it was off the heals of Risk and Dave Mustaine almost wrote every single note on the record (\\" from MUSTAINE Book)therefore he says they didn't really feel like a lineup that would last. I wish he would've at least made one more record with this lineup but he got injured and that was the end of that. Definitley put Megadeth back on track to release other solid releases System Has Failed & United Abominations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megadeth's fire has burned out","review":"After hearing from Dave Mustaine that this disc was going to be really heavy and a complete depature from Risk I was very excited. But after listening to it I am disappointed. The riffs are boring and the songs are not the type that make you want to listen to them over and over again. The solo's all sound the same after a while. Megadeth said they were going back to their metal roots, but they should have said we are going towards a commercial metal approach. If you haven't already go out and buy Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, Countdown, Youthanasia and CW. Megadeth has lost their way and may never find it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Up With That Cover?","review":"Ick. Juvenile too. But how's the music? Some of it's pretty dang good (DISCONNECT, BURNING BRIDGES tear it up) and some of it's lame (title track). Hey, Dave can still play but it doesn't sound like he's enjoying at this point. A definite step ahead of RISK musically if not conceptually but, still, nowhere near the heyday of RIP and CTE."},{"rating":"1","title":"myandywarhol.com","review":"The project is co-sponsored by two of the largest dealers in Warhol's work.

GODawful - even if you're a fan of the series","review":"Much as I loved the show, this is pure dreck ... dreck that gets even worse as it goes, falling apart totally in the last half. The lame plot is about how the gang tries to get back on the air after realizing they're canceled, but from there stupid gets moronic and even the most offensive of jokes just aren't funny. Bad animation, lazy writing, and a stupid did-they-just-get-tired-of-writing-this-drivel ending all add up to staying away from this turkey - no matter HOW much you like the show.

At all. I loved every moment of the TV series, it was brilliant. Just like other 30 minute shows, this does not work in a 1.5 hour format. It felt like 3 hours. This movie should work because the concept is great, but it just was not funny or funny-nasty. The opening scene, stepping on kittens and puppies, not amuzing. To me."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie","review":"As a huge fan of the series I was really looking forward to the movie. It was ok but not as good as it could be. I was very disapointed. If your a fan get it, if your new, your better of getting either season 1 or 2. I hope they make another movie and do better, or I'd prefer the series comes back. Also what's the deal having 3D parts and not including the glasses, very stupid however I used my glasses from my bloody valentine 3D (red and blue lenses) and I must say I was very disapointed in the 3D effect, still saw the double linning and it looked like parts stood out at times and other parts that should stand out don't.

I will say that, while the voice performances and level of filthy are still up to par, the writers seems a little out of practice.

It's a huge, disgusting, festering dump that the producers chose to take on the network, and on the fans, too.I've seen episodes of the show that are funnier than this movie, which really should have been something considering what they are able to get away with here.It's pretty much just gross to be gross, and as a result, it's boring and pretty stupid (especially the end, where it REALLY starts to drag).I give it two stars--one for the uncensored swearing, and the other... well, you'll know what I mean when you see how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"Were the writing staff taking a nap or just out of practice by the time the movie was made?

I own all three dvd seasons as well. So when I heard there was a movie coming out I was stoked. I'm very sad to say though that the movie is just completely terrible. My wife and I both hated it. To make matters worse they had to change their animation for budget reasons so the movie looks like a glorified internet flash cartoon. That might not bother some,and I know that was the best they could do, but it bugged me the whole way through.Lastly...I figured that if the story wasn't that great there would at least be great jokes throughout that saved the film. Well there wasn't. I actually didn't laugh much at anything. Somehow it even managed to not be funny. After it was over we were both literally depressed at how bad it was.That's just our opinion though. Hopefully there's more people that like it. Once more I loved the series.

Now, we have The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie, which is by and far a more fitting send-off for the rip-off reality TV characters, and those behind it take full advantage of being a straight-to-DVD release with no need of a censor. Captain Hero, Foxxy, Clara, Toot, Xandir, Spanky Ham, Ling Ling, and Wooldor are all here and are up to disgusting and vile hijinks and hilarity as they go on the run after being cancelled, with the murderous robot I.S.R.A.E.L. (voiced by Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane) in hot pursuit. There's jaw-dropping gross-outs, 3-D sex scenes, and some hilarious sing-along lyrics to boot. Like the show before it, The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you were a fan of the show, you already know that you need to pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I'm a fan of the series and appreciate the crude, witty, often ridiculous humor. This movie deviates from those traits and provides nothing but vulgarity. They basically loaded it with unnecessary profanity, cheap sexual humor, a few borish running gags, and sickening scenes without any of the usual charm and wit. It is also very story-driven, instead of character-driven, which was an odd twist. The style doesn't quite work, because fans of the show don't expect narrative drama, and were never emotionally invested in the well being of any of the characters to begin with. The writing and dialog seem pretty sloppy overall, and the characters feel very condensed and simplified; like they're just recycling the same gags we've seen again and again. Clara in particular felt very off, like the comedic points of her character were driven to the extreme without any subtlety.Meh nothing but complaints from me. Very disappointing. Stick with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the series...","review":"This was majorly disappointing. We absolutely loved the show, and were really excited to see the movie. It definitely fell short of expectations. The animation was done by a different company, so the characters didn't look right; this would have been excusable if the story had been good. But it wasn't. They spent more time trying to get every dirty joke in that they couldn't put in the series (which wasn't much) than actually making the story worth watching. I wish we wouldn't have watched the movie, and let Drawn Together end with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If you've ever seen the show (and I assume you have), then whatever offensive words I could use to describe the movie just won't do it justice. It's a shame this show was ever cancelled...and the movie doesn't hold back on those responsible for that. I won't say it would be bad parenting to let your kids watch this... but if you are the type to go to church... don't watch this movie. It's only for people with a sense of humor! Again, if that last comment offended you, definitely do not watch this brilliantly funny movie...and kill yourself! HA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Show, Hate the Movie","review":"I was introduced to Drawn Together by my roommate and we rewatch all three seasons quite often. I love the show's offensive humor and the points it makes using the stereotypes and humor.The movie falls flat. The animation is irritating and the only things I found funny were the ISRAEL and Sabbath jokes. The brief Smurf bit made me laugh a little bit. Jew Producer's bigger role was a fun add-on. Everything else was just dragged out and lacked the charm or originality of the series. It was actually reminiscent of the Entertainment Weekly episode in season 2, but at least their point didn't become preachy then.Well, it was worth a shot, but I'll stick to my DVDs of the show rather than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this was the best they could do, be glad the show was canceled when it was great.","review":"So I love Drawn Together, and like many people, I was disappointed when the show was canceled. But it was only recently I heard there was a movie out so I came here and immediately bought it. And I have to say, I am now glad the show left on a high note because this movie is crap. There was only 1 time where I actually laughed out loud(and I'm being generous when I say \\"laughed\\"). If this was the best they could do for the movie, imagine what the next season would've been like. The show didn't have a long run, but it certainly had a good run.

The only two worthwhile parts of this collection are the section about Albert Speer (but it's only four pages), and a re-print from McCall's earlier, much funnier book, 'Zany Afternoons.' Starting with his 'Last Dream-O-Rama,' McCall really just hasn't been as funny. Saying that the author is often good is not the same as saying that this particular work is good. It isn't.McCall also adopts a partisan, political tone that was never present in his previous works.

The bird arrives, lands on one of the perches next to each hopper opening, and goes at the seeds. But there's nothing stopping the seeds that the bird didn't get hold of from falling through the gap between perch and opening. I set a tray on the ground to catch most of the seed, then wondered why I bothered to make up for a stupid design.There's a reason why the old, home-made wooden bird feeders were platforms with roofs.

The fabric feels cheap, and the shorts seem cheaply constructed. The fit is odd around the waste band, and the draw strings are useless. The buttons on the pockets are kind of a pain if you're used to being able to quickly get things in and out of your cargo pockets without leaving the flaps unbuttoned. I don't know why I thought these were made in the U.S.A., but they're not. The nicest thing I can say about these shorts is the inseam is a good length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright shorts.... bad zipper.","review":"The shorts are made of nice soft material however it is sewn kind of long waisted and the zipper is a joke I have seen tin foil that is stronger.

I work out a lot and most of them are too small that I find in stores. I like cargo's for the pocket space and that helps a lot at work when I have to carry multiple items. This has a tie in in the front and it buttons up. My only problem is that I tied up the front and it's now stuck in a permanent knot. I don't recommend tying the front straps to tighten the pants up. Just use a belt and button it up like normally.

I had previously used a good old fashioned scissors type trimmer. It worked reasonably well, although we did have some trouble with the spool head. After I unwound the cord and then rewound it, it worked fairly well. This year, after charging 24 hours, it runs about half speed for about 10 minutes. A replacement battery is only $45.00. That leaves about $15.00 for the rest of the machine. I guess that's about right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spool design is blatantly flawed. :-(","review":"The twine for this unit is flimsily wrapped around the inner spool. What this means is that while in use, the twine either spits out way too much at a time (wrapping it around the base, requiring down time to fix), spitting out none at all (resulting in a dramatic 1-inch cutting path), or sucking the twine back into the spool. Very poor design. Twenty minutes of weed eating cost me an hour. Forget the ease of lightweight battery power...this one is inherently flawed. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"The price is great, but it takes its toll in using. In order to keep device running, you must keep the handle sqeezed. This requires more than light pressure, so after five minutes or so, expect your hand to tire and start cramping. With breaks, the process can take quite a while and I only have a small lawn. On the other hand, only the lightest tap extends more line so you may end up doing this more often than you want. The low price may be worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to assemble !","review":"This trimmer is definitely NOT \\"easy to assemble\\". I'm a merchandiser and assemble large displays for my job. In addition to that I always assemble all items at home.The trimmer's handle clicked perfectly in place with the middle part. But when I tried to click the middle part into the bottom part, the bottom part split open (along the seam) and the middle part simply would NOT fit.After reading some of the other reviews, I'm guessing Toro changed the design of this trimmer. There were NO bolts to screw into ANY part. The instructions were simple, snap the bottom and top part onto the middle part (after stuffing the cord into the the middle part).Yes, the parts were angled, so it was impossible to attach them incorrectly. Even so, the parts did NOT fit together as they should.I've sent it back to Amazon and am waiting for a refund.(Received my refund from Amazon, thank you, I won't buy any more Toro products in the future.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I purchased this trimmer in 2005 and loved it for the first seven or eight uses.

Not the power of a gas trimmer but then I didn't expect that. Very comparable to the power of an electric trimmer but without the cord. I will give up the slight loss in power to never again have to drag that cord around. Simple to put together and plugs in anywhere to charge. This is a definate buy if you are in the market for a good reliable trimmer. Toro states that the charge will last for 45 minutes. I trimmed for about an hour and still saw no power being lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far","review":"This product has been great so far. I have had this trimmer for about two weeks. The first time I used it the battery ran low after about 30 min. The second time I used it (after charging all week) the battery must have been more completely charged since it didn't become low after over 30 min. of use. Its a whole lot more convenient to use than my old gas trimmer and it doesn't sound like an airplane flying over. The trimmer line that was on it when new did break quite often and I replaced it with line from a bulk reel of 0.065 line. This line is more durable and I have not had to add more line yet. The unit is somewhat heavy and can get tiring if you have a lot of trimming to do. It would be nice if there were places on the trimmer to add a support strap. The bump feed mechanism works flawlessly. I have never had the line to become tangled or fail to dispense as it should. For the price and convenience, I don't think you can find a better trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little trimmer","review":"As said previously, whoever had trouble putting this little beauty together must be very challenged. It went together in minutes. After a good charge, it did a great job on the little patch of lawn I needed it for. I must say, after awhile it did start to get heavy, but its easy enough to switch hands. The weight more than makes up for not having to drag an electrical cord around. All around, I like it - worth the few extra bucks to get the Toro name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I eventually smashed this trimmer in frustration, after the 10th time in one session that I had to mess around with the string cassette.The string cassette in this trimmer seems to have been intentionally designed to be as useless as possible. Impossible to load, no positive holding mechanism for the string, so it invariably spits out the last foot or so of string, and if you let it get a little too short, the string retreats into the housing.Based on my experience with this item, I will NEVER buy another Toro trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro 7 inch Trimmer","review":"The product arrived as promised. It was not difficult to asemble although the advertising did not tell me I would have to do that. The trimmer works well.It has two limitations. One is that it is heavier than I thought it would be.

It contains his most accessible film (the wonderful CARAVAGGIO) and perhaps his most experimental (the aesthetic tone-poem THE ANGELIC CONVERSATION). Amazon.com's product review illustrates the generous amount of extras that Zeitgest has provided with these films and the booklet of essays is also a must for fans.Unfortunately I must deduct a star from my rating due to the boxset's design. Zeitgest has decided to package the discs in tight cardboard pockets. While it saves space on your shelf and looks very nice, the DVDs themselves are susceptible to scratches every time you slide them out of their respective slots.

I'm not a huge fan of the first single \\"Two People Fell In Love\\" and I would probably have to rank it as my least favorite song on the album. Paisley has figured out, like Alan Jackson, the secret to country music is having fun with it. Paisley wrote songs based on punchlines on several occasions here- \\"I'm gonna miss her\\" is stolen straight from a bit of T-shirt wisdom. \\"Come on over tonight\\" is a hilarious mix of twisted cliches and slice of life humor. My favorite song on the album is \\"You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive\\" which brought to mind strains of Diamond Rio's unreleased treasure \\"Kentucky Mine\\", and made me revisit Steve Earle's \\"Harlan Man\\", and \\"The Mountain\\" This sophomore effort is certainly worth the price of the CD, and it'll leave you wondering what part three will have in store."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never leave harlan alive.","review":"I bought this album after watching the fx series justified because of the song \\"You'll never leave harlan alive\\" and after setting my music player to random I started hearing the other songs on the album and loved them I thinks its probably one of his better albums I would for sure recommend it to any country fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever","review":"this is the best cd i have listened to since brooks & dunns greatest hits album came out.

Two Feet of Topsoil is a great way to begin this albulm, and it's just the start of lots of hardcore hillbilly and honky tonk songs that will keep you interested.

While this album doesn't quite capture all the same raw energy and imagination, it is the closest that I have heard on record. This is album is NOT heady, out-there bepop, but just straight-ahead, cooking, soulful guitar, with a smoking rhythm section. Kind of the anti-Jim Hall.

Reading this sweet poem, coupled with the lovely complementary and simply styled watercolor illustrations (image on left with two lines of verse on right), rekindled that passion.One thing to note is that this book speaks to the truly young fairy lover inside as it doesn't in any way touch on the fair folk's darker proclivities.

The level of detail is amazing, and is presented so that you can delve deeper if you are inclined, or skip ahead to the many summaries, useful lists and recipes. She is quick to differentiate between what has been demonstrated by scientific methods, what is common people with IC, and what is more anecdotal. The needs of people with related conditions are addressed, especially concerns about balancing low-oxalate and IC diets. Throughout, her tone is positive and encouraging without ever sounding condescending. The book much more than I had hoped for - I can't praise it enough.

I've taken Chinese for two years, and I still found it impossible to learn anything from it.

The customer rep said I had to pay the shipping to them, (insured,) and write a check to them for the shipping back to me.

It's a great dryer - nice design, etc, but I'm returning it. Why? Because if you're using a normal plug at the bottom of the wall, and you're 5'5\\", or God forbid, taller, then the cord is simply too short. For some reason Conair always makes their hairdryer cords too short. I literally have to crouch to dry the top of my head. Why on earth do they go to the trouble of making a good dryer and then chintz on the cord - an extra foot would be the difference between me keeping it and loving it and me returning it, which is what I'm doing!Conair should go into the table making business - they could make dining room tables with 2 foot legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I ordered this product for my Mother for Christmas.

I also don't care for how poorly the labels for the heat and air settings wears- its only a few months old and already there's alot of wear due to how my hand usually grips the handle.

I took it out of the box to test it, plugged it in, turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it. I liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer, so I kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting. The hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting. Something is seriously wrong with that.Also, the cord was very difficult to retract.

I had a Remington for about 8 years and finally decided it was time for a new one. I had never used a diffuser before as I have short hair and didn't think it would do too much for me. Boy was I wrong. My hair doesn't have this much volume unless I use a product in it!! The cord wind is phenomenal!!!! I always hated how my hair dryer took up half of my counter unless I unplugged it and stored it under the sink. For something I use everyday, it never happened. I thought I was going to have to be content with my dryer's cord all over the place until now! When I am done using it, I simply hit the button and the cord goes away but the dryer is still plugged in:) The only down fall is that the cord is not very long. Luckily my outlet is right next to my bathroom counter! I am very pleased with this dryer and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord Keeper Breaks!","review":"I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price. Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it. The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I'm drying.A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I purchased this dryer on sale at CVS. I love the cord keeper. I just hold onto the cord while it's retracting. The removable filter is much better than other dryers I've used, because there is a plastic piece that keeps lint from actually getting into the dryer. This dryer is much more powerful and lighter then any other dryer I've ever used. I have very thick coarse hair. With other dryers it took me 45 minutes to over and hour to blow dry my hair. This one dries my hair in 15 - 30 minutes. It leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers. I still have to use a flatiron, but it only takes one pressing on each section instead of several to get it to lay flat.I strongly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't waste my money","review":"My professional grade hair dryer died, so I just picked up a dryer from a local retail store. This was the best dryer they had available for sale. I wish I had kept the box so I could return it! This dryer is horrible. It is extremely heavy and has a super short cord. With my old dryer, I was able to dry and style my long, thick hair in about 15 minutes. With this dryer it takes over 35! It leaves my hair feeling dry and crunchy. Also, I'm not able to style it as well with a brush while drying, so I have to spend extra time styling with a flat iron. I would suggest that you spend a little more to get a better quality dryer. I think this would only be good for men, or women with super short hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap cord, broke in 5 months, fire hazard","review":"The hair dryer design itself is good, but the material the cord is made out of is cheap. After 5 months of daily use, it lost its connection within the wiring, near the end of the plug. Since it's more than 60 days, I can't return it to the store. And since it costs me money to ship it back to Conair, AND I have to include another $5.00 for their shipping an new on back to me, I think I'll just toss it in the trash.

I would just take out the spindle, but then my toddler could just crawl through the sizable hole that would be left in its absence which would defeat the whole purpose of having a baby gate on the stairs.I felt kind of stupid for not thinking about how much room might be needed next to the newel post before I ordered the product, but I didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake.

However, I was disappointed by this product on multiple levels. 1) we have a round post and therefore need the round adapter for both the top and bottom bracket. The kit only comes with one, and to order additional parts requires $5 for shipping and $5 for another round adapter. The form is not on line and requires that you mail in the form to order. (so who knows how long it will take to actually get them) 2) the screws did not fit the brackets well and as a result were prone to stripping. We definitely stripped one while trying to install and had to buy a replacement.

I give them 4 stars because I think that they are a bit pricey; it would be great if you could purchase them in a set of two.They were the only thing that I could find to work to save my banisters from drilling and holes and they worked perfectly for that purpose - so maybe they are a bargain:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solution!","review":"If you have the mindset that you dont want to drill into your wood bannister, then this is a great solution.

It is a kit to help you install a gate you have purchased separately onto your stairway. It is designed so that you can install the stairway gate (again, not included) without drilling into or otherwise messing up your banister and posts.I probably will end up using this product, it is a good idea and I already own it, but I don't want to use it with the gate I currently am getting ready to install.

What a mistake ! Yes, it assembles relatively easily, and yes, the 24 volt power is impressive. But the heart of a trimmer is the trimmer head, and this one simply doesn;t work well. In the first 20 minutes of operation, the string retracted inside the head 4 times, causing me to have to stop, unscrew the head, rethread the string and re-assemble. And the automatic string trim 'blade' (and I use the term loosely, because that is one dull blade) doesn't so much cut the string as splinter it, rendering it very ineffective. The trimmer guard effectively prevents the string from hitting anything in front of the trimmer at all - so if you're trying to trim grass around a set of steps or tight to any other obstacle, you can't.

The only complaint I have is that it is fairly heavy and as a woman I found it a little awkward and tiring for my forearms.

The knit was also shockingly scratchy for having such a high synthetic fiber content- it has all the scratchiness and discomfort of poor-quality 100% wool! The seam at the bottom of the sock along the toe is poorly sewn up, overly long and bulky; it protrudes into your foot when wearing boots and creates a whole other layer of discomfort along the balls of your feet, since the seam wraps around almost the the underside of one's foot, and actually underneath your foot when the socks are sized for giants.

The vacuum mulched very well and had good suction for an electric, although the flared out vacuum nozzle left it prone to frequent clogs. The bad news, after only 1 and a half seasons of light use, it burned up - as in started smelling hot and by the time I got it shut off it was pouring smoke. Thought it might have been the variable switch, but on ivestigation found the fiberglass mount for the motor brushes completely burned up allowing one of the brushes to jam in the motor. Overall, really great performance the first few times you use it, but in the long run, a disappointing fire-hazzard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"Great value for the money.

I borrowed a friends Husqvarna 225B Hand Held Gas Blower and the Toro Ultra literally blows it away, not to mention no exhaust fumes or messing with gas mixture. Its quieter and lighter too. Variable speed is a very nice option when you dont want full \\"thar she blows\\". Only problem is of course its electric and you need to fool with a cord which can be somewhat annoying particularly when you got a 3 acre lot like I do. I do have 200' of 12 guage cord which puts me in good shape. It matches up nicely with my Toro 38025 1800 Electric Power Curve Snow Thrower which is also a great performer. I highly recommend the Toro Ultra Blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro Blower. satisfied.","review":"I bought this as a blower, I don't intend on using the other functions.

This job would normally take me most of a day. Over eight large leaf bags later, there was no looking back. I will never rake another leaf and with it's ease of use and non-combersome design, I may just offer to help some of my neighbors! I have used many blowers in my day, but this one takes the cake.

I had a used gas powered one which I paid $40 to have repaired and then it only lasted 3-4 weeks. This time 'round, I opted for electric based on the price and future maintenance free performance. I love the metal blades, as I'm never fearful of vacuuming up something that I shouldn't, as well as the infinite speed control. I suspect there may be some gas blowers that are more powerful and offer freedom of mobility (which is the only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars), but I can't imagine an electric blower getting any better.Addendum: It is now November 2012, 5 years since I purchased this item. It is getting louder and sounds as if it may die soon, but it is still performing admirably. When it does die, I will replace it with another Toro electric blower/vac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the machine, but...","review":"If I could remove the bag to empty it without sitting on the ground with my feet braced against the body of the thing, pushing IN on the tab locks with both hands while pulling BACK to disengage the collar, I'd definitely give it five stars. The variable speed blower is terrific for cleaning under shubbery without defoliating, the shredder is excellent and definitely produces a finer mulch than my old blower/vacuum. Too, it is significantly quieter than any other that I've been around. If I can come up with a way to take the bag off, it will be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Power Than Expected!!","review":"I got this blower/vacuum recently, and i must say that i am very impressed......it is very powerful and it is lightweight......i cannot imagine needing a leaf blower with more power!! the vacuum/mulcher made short work of my pile of leaves........it really is a good machine, and at the price Amazon is offering it for, you can't beat it.......i love it and will get great use out of it......the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it is a little cumbersome when you are switching from blower to vacuum, and when i went to remove the leaf bag, the attachment was very tight and i could not remove it. this would not be a problem if you are a man, but being a woman it was a struggle.......other than that, i would say buy it........i am still glad i got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, and the broken!","review":"Toro has long been a consumer brand name known for it's quality products. The blower/vac I bought worked as advertised..... for a few days at least. The high speed went out after one week, the entire motor stopped after 2 weeks. When it was working the blower did a great job of blowing leaves, and the vacum shredded them just fine, cutting down the number of bags need by a large margin.I buy nearly everything from the internet and this is the first \\"bad\\" product I have recieved. Perhaps I was just due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Out of the box it was easy to use and quite effective. However by the third use, it would loose contact at the power switch (knob). Finally it stopped working all together.

For the brief time it worked, performance was impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Variable Control didn't last the first day!","review":"After reading all the other reviews it's my summary that when it works, it's good. Unfortunately my unit failed at what's obviously the weakest point, the variable speed control. If Toro could make this switch reliably, the unit would be great. Unfortunately the control is failure prone and the unit is unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Toro Quality. Don't buy it!","review":"Had this blower 2 seasons. Bought it because Toro is supposed to be one of the best and reviews stated same. I don't use it heavily, but I do blow the driveway in the summer as well after cutting grass. In the fall it gets about an hour's useage for leaves about 8 times. After cutting the grass today the motor began to slow down and smoke heavily so I turned it off and took it apart. One of the brushes burned up and the mount along with the board that holds them burnt up as well. Can't find replacement parts. If I wanted junk I would have purchased a $20 blower and thrown it away after the first season. Toro won't get my money again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro, the Great Machine company","review":"This is my 2nd experience buying Toro Machines at Amazon .I am very satisfied with the quality and performance .It does have a speed control dial , to set the velocity of the unit , it is very powerful and rugged ,the craftsmanship reminds me of the recently perchased Toro Electric snow blower.it does have the same extra power and durability .I highly recommend this unit, it cleared mt porch deck in 3 minutes, by broom it would take 15 min,porch deck is covered with the nylon grass carpet, twigs, leaves and seedlings just are hard to sweep away by broom, I love this machine !I would look for other Toro machines to buy ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Leaf Blower","review":"I purchased this leaf blower/vacuum in Dec 2002. I used in moderately that year and in the fall of 2003. It burned out today, Nov. 18th. I have three Toro products - this one, a gas powered lawn mower, and a cordless electric string trimmer. The leaf blower and lawn mower have been unreliable. The string trimmer is only a year old, so the jury is still out. The bottom line is that I don't intend to by Toro products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Blower/Vac When it is Working","review":"Bought mine last fall but it only ran for about an hour before it died. Took a month to get a replacement from Toro and by then it was winter. Used the replacement for the first time this spring and it also died in about an hour.I'm impressed with how the product performs when it is functioning correctly but obviously there is a design flaw; most likely it's the variable speed control. I read the 70 reviews on this site and 11 others seemed to have had similar problems.I'd like to keep the product if Toro can come up with a permanent fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK ... while it worked","review":"2 years worth of leaf blowing and suddenly stopped working. We've only got a small yard, front and back, so it hasn't done a lot of work. Now it won't do anything. Poor workmanship, Toro, and I'm not impressed. Not particularly cheap either. Now I'm going to get rid of the piece of crap and buy a gas blower with more power and no cord to get in the way. Oh yeah, the vacuum/mulcher never really worked well - had to vacuum up leaves really slowly (take a few, mulch, then return to the pile) and it kept on jamming. I got a mulch ratio of about 4:1, better than some but nowhere near the 10:1 or 16:1 that Toro claim. Impeller kept clogging even with dry leaves. Let's face it, Toro ain't no Craftsman or B&amp;amp;D, but for this money you can get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last too long :(","review":"I used it about 10 times in 2 years and it did the job well. Used it as blower and mulcher and was pretty happy with the results. Unfortunately now it smells like burnt everytime i use it. I opened it up the other day and it looks the like motor collectors are giving up. Not an expesive tool but it should have lasted more than 2 years of light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Given a challenge, it chokes","review":"I bought the Toro for its supposed ability to vacuum leaves. Here in Florida, oak leaves rain down upon us this time of year, especially in older neighborhoods such as mine that are filled with beautiful oaks. The result was mixed: It handles oak leaves just fine -- although the 16 to 1 ratio that Toro claims for the machine's mulching ability must be a figure plucked from someone's imagination -- 2 to 1 maybe. The problem comes when something other than leaves, such as twigs of the tiniest type, or the pine nuggets often used for mulching in flower beds and under trees, are added to the mix. The Toro chokes on such a challenge, increasing the work for the user. The last time I raked leaves without the Toro, I filled 11 plastic bags. The first time I used the Toro, the result was 9 bags. Not much labor-saving in this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!!","review":"This blower is light, quiet, and very powerful. I especially like the graduated control. I've used both the blower and the vacuum/mulching attachments and am very satisfied.

Minor drawback is that conversion from one mode to the other is somewhat tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The vac hose is a real bottleneck!!!!","review":"I did not have a problem with the blower but the vac really sucked! The vac hose starts with a wide oval opening but then tapers into a bottle neck that quickly traps and stops leaves going into the mulching blade. I was so disapointed and returned the blower. They should redesign this hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good as a vacuum","review":"Although it has plenty of power it is extremely difficult to get the bag attachment off of this machine. Tried this unit with and without the universal leaf collector that was suppose to blow the leaves into a trash can. The universal leaf collector would not stay on the can and kept blowing off no matter what speed I ran the vac at.Bag attachment contact point needs tweaking by Toro."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much-improved product","review":"I bought the Toro Ultra Blower/Vac to replace my very old Toro blower/vac.The old B/V had a nylon rotor which jammed on small twigs and wet leaves and a very inconvenient method to change the configuration.The Ultra B/V has more power, a metal rotor, and an easy method to change from blower to vac. The tool sucks in both large (oak and maple)leaves, even a mix of wet and dry leaves, with no problem. Small twigs shoot right threw the rotor chamber and into the bag. The B/V hasn't jammed yet.The variable speed control is especially handy in the blower configuration.I would recommend the Toro 51598 to anyone looking for useful electric B/V."},{"rating":"2","title":"ms","review":"Works like a charm but you have to watch the size of the leaves that you are picking up.

Dan was very cool about it, and replaced my husband's bike, yadda yadda yadda.Over the course of settling everything from the accident he gave us a CD of his band, The Rockett Band. We loved the CD, and to this day it still finds its way into the CD player.I heard Dan Rockett's solo song \\"Driving Home\\" on Pandora while I was at work today, and had to laugh as I remembered our introduction to Dan, as I haven't thought about all that in a long time.LOVE the solo stuff Dan.

I appreciate that the characters included imperfect people who have chosen to follow God's path, people still struggling with issues of life.

Sam Vaknin has written the book on narcissism. Read Malignant Self Love so you will understand that you are NOT crazy, you are just embedded in a crazy making relationship.Understanding the narcissist in your life is the first step toward healing. Malignant Self Love will help you to see reality through the eyes of a narcissist-a person devoid of empathetic feelings.

Malignant self-love has become my bible, my survival and go-to guide. If I ever feel like I'm being sucked back in by the Narcissist in my life (whom I don't have the choice of removing permanently), I simply start the book over and re-arm myself with Vaknin's powerful principles.

After I read the book, I was sure it had been written about him. They are real charmers at first,who once they get their narcissistic supply, discard people without a second thought.But more than anything, it helped me realize it wasn't me. And no matter how much or what I did, it would never be a 50/50 relationship. It explains how a narcissist thinks of himself and the others around him.

I was stimulated; just as I was challenged and enlightened.Importantly, I knew I would eventually emerge to disembark at its end. But I also appreciated that some other riders, including the Conductor himself, would remain trapped in that House of Horrors forever.

Uniquely powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah's Psalm","review":"I liked this book and read it twice. It is about people I know well. They do not ordinarily appear in American fiction although their world view points in the direction of our national future. The author has brought them to life in such a way that I eagerly await a sequel that will tell what happens next in the lives of the characters we meet in Sarah's Psalm. The cameo appearances of people like Ellis Haizlip and James Baldwin help to anchor the novel in the reality of its time and to emphasize the effect of these giants on their generation. The conflicts that move the novel along are nevertheless the eternal ones. They show how men and women relate to God, to each other, to their communities -- and what forces impel or restrain them in their journey through life. Immediacy and timelessness -- I like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly one of the worst books I have ever read","review":"This is one the most self-indulgent, poorly written novels I have ever read.

I initially mixed per instructions using the packets and after 2 days had 'stuck bubbles' and a non-functional ladder.I went to the store and bought my own bakers yeast, and on a whim decided I'd just replace the mixture to see if I could do better. Within ~3 hours I have a fully functional ladder with what may even be TOO much CO2.The real value here is the unit - it's just like a DIY unit except without any of the hassle.

Dobson/Miller put the idea of conflict and how to deal with it into its proper perspective. The techniques are not only informative but extremely practical. I began to use the philosphy of blending with attack immediatly. The results are that I am able to difuse angry situations quickly and build meaningful relationships with those around me.

He has a knack for isolating salient facts about trading from multiple angles. The most consistent message is that we're hardwired to do what feels comfortable and that leads to losses. The best approach is to make a game of it, not worry (if possible) and find a method of trading that fits our personalities.For comparative purposes, I much prefer Schwager's first book on Market Wizards. It just seemed to me there were more pearls of wisdom there, particularly from interviews with Ed Seykota and Dr. Van K. Tharp. Still this book has great interviews too.

No other book does so much to put the reader into the mind of a trader.

It has three important chapters. The interview with William Eckhardt is worth the price of the book alone. Eckhart will talk about how human nature will work against you in trading and system development. The Tom Basso interview will show how a trader remains cool under trading pressure, and the last chapter is Market Wiz(ar)dom.

I thought the beginning read rough while I was trying to understand her odd future-tech world that she didn't explain well. But in the middle it went much better and I was thinking it was a great book. Then poof, she obviously had NO idea how to end it, and the last 50-100 pages just plod on horridly like she had no real inspiration or motivation for writing those words other than to get it published and make some money. A book that just drops off from great to bad like that isn't worth reading in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"William Gibson Meets John Le Carre","review":"An eco terrorist group sets up an orphan who has fallen in with them.

Go back and re read, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has it come to this?","review":"First, I resent having to give this novel even 1 star. It was that bad. The story was difficult to follow - why do I have to work that hard when reading a story? Maybe if the author had bothered to re-read it and edit it, rather than finishing it and dashing it off to the publisher, as is evidently the case. That it was published at all still amazes me.The worst thing about it however is that it is poorly written. The author's grasp of the language is, at best, \\"modern\\". She does not employ it well, and besides being ugly and frustrating to plough through, it makes understanding the tortured plot that much harder.There was a time when, to be published, you needed to be able to write reasonable English, and tell a story well. No longer.As for the gushing reviews published here, I hazard a guess that they are written by people known to the author. They do not seem to be about the book I read.Some books are so bad, they can be fun. This is not one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this published?","review":"Boring, trite, and not worth half the price. This fluff could have been written by a dottering victorian spinster, and it's a mystery why a publisher would bother. It's insulting when this sort of garbage is sold at full market price with so much worth reading available. The story is hackneyed, the writing is uncomfortable and lacking style or grace, and the tone is preachy but directioneless. Gaia's Toys is the first book I ever paid for that I couldn't finish.

I was one of those teens that only listen to him and nothing else for several years.After a long desert crossing, he finally came back with \\"Boucan d'Enfer\\" that was an excellent album. The tone was darker than usual, and you could feel a different level of maturity of the artist.This concert though, is bad. Just plain bad. Renaud really shows us how bad these last years have been for him. The singing is laborious, and often out of tune. He knows the lyrics, but they sound like the slur of an unmotivated 10 years old reciting boring poetry.No interaction with the public with his usual and very personal tone. He was really out of it at that concert. I suspect he was drunk. It reminded me of some of the late concerts of Gainsbourg when he was showing up on stage completly wasted.I recommend the album strongly, but you can pass on this concert unless you are a die hard fan that need to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony DAVDX255 Integrated DVD System","review":"i bought this system about 2 months ago and it works fine so far. hence, i can't tell much about it's technical reliability. the sound is, well, very bass-dominated. even switching off \\"bass-enhancement\\" doesn't produce a significantly different sound (placebo button?). so does the automatic speaker calibration. however, one can fine-tune it manually. then the sound is pretty good for a system in that price range.another shortcoming is the \\"read-in\\" time of dvds. it simply takes too long for the player to start a dvd or change to another one. again, given the price, i think this is acceptable. even more if you keep in mind that you insert dvds, say, once per day.with my experiences made so far, i would buy this system again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It \\"eats\\" discs and Sony doesn't have a clue","review":"I'd owned my machine 14 months when it froze a DVD and refused to eject it.

Then I was told to send it to a Service Center and for $134 they would tell me how much the fix was.

We've used some for programs and sometimes I assign \\"homework\\" for the kids to go home and teach their family the songs with themselves as the leader. Echo songs are great for shy singers because they only have to sing a short little phrase by themselves. Usually they don't even realize they're singing a solo because we've sung the echos so much as a group activity that they just do it as a natural response. I'm on my third book/CD as the other two books/CDs have disappeared from my room. I love the pages that list musical aspects, musical activities, learning aspects, learning activities and sometimes even art activities so do with each song.

Tried Mylicon, this gripe water, infant massage, chamomile tea, quitting dairy, using probiotics (for myself, to pass through breast milk) as recommended by the pediatrician, and now onto Colic Calm. The pacifier helps him get through the worst of the gas. Hopefully something else will work, or he will just \\"grow out of it\\" once his GI system matures a bit more, as it is said will happen.

I gave her this and in less than a minute she stopped fussing and didn't fuss the rest of the night. Poor little thing had a tummy ache all along. Don't listen when others say, \\"they just need to grow out of this stage\\". This will really work unless your little one has acid reflux. If it doesn't work, you should have the doctor check for acid reflux because I don't know of any other reason that it wouldn't! Also, the small amount of fructose is to help with taste so they will drink it down. It is not harmful, and our little girl took a nap soon after taking it.

The view, as expected, is a mirror image which I am already used to. I checked If I can see from the outside and I can't. However, I noticed that there was a crack on the prism that can be seen from the outside.

Second, although there is a hole for a screw to attach it to the T-track in the clamp, one is not provided. But thirdly and most frustratingly, the slot in the plastic for the clamp's track to go through is too tight so it gets stuck.

I threw the damn thing away, another $20 wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"This plate is junk","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but the router plate, and it's sibling, the saw plate are really worthless. The clamp itself works well, but the cheaply made plastic plates will not slide at all on the clamp bar. This could be weather dependent, since my garage is quite cool, but the plates should slide regardless of the temperature. If you take the plate out of the track (gliding only on a portion of the track) then it will slide, but what good is that since it would be easy to cut crooked, if you didn't keep pressure on the clamp side.Believe me, using your saw or router directly against the clamp bar will work better than using one of these lousy plates. I paid $63.00 for these two plates (including shipping), and this was one of the worst things I've ever bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Yaoi","review":"The blurb says it is love at first sight but it is mistaken. Only late in the story do you find out it was one-sided love.The plot is not deep but that's ok because it does other things right. Love develops over time (instead of rape at first sight). The young men are beautiful, the damsel(silly uke) gets rescued, and there is a plot twist.So on the yaoi scale it scores in what some of us read yaoi for. It gets points for unrequited love(!), one-sided love(!), romance(!!) and beautiful buff guys get happy(!!!!). The art is clean and attractive.On my personal meter it also gets points for costumes(!!). (Authors please note: I love men in long hair and skirts.) No schoolyard teenage angst here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"better read it before buying","review":"I am afraid I have to agree with most of the reviewers, mostly Straitjacket and Elizabeth Lockett.This manga has fairly beautiful art and titillating ideas but for the rest it falls short, shorter than it is usual even for the worst examples among this genre.The plot is desperately thin and contrived, characterization stereotyped and highly inconsistent with the prehistorical setting chosen. There is not a single move of the characters which is not predictable and trite, plus the usual skinny effemminate boy versus the manly dominant figure.A booklet to borrow before buying: the art may be interesting (sex scenes are dull, though, as it is often the case) and the sequence of the drawings confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"well, at least the art was good.","review":"All I can say is that it is a good thing that my main interest in manga is the art. The art in this book is beautiful. The people and backgrounds are beautifully done, the frames flow well from one motion to the next. On the other hand the stories left me wanting. Maybe it's because this is a one shot deal, instead of a series, but there was not alot of character development. The stories were brief and didn't really hold my interest. So if your looking for beautiful art I recomend this book, but if your looking for an interesting story with deep characters go elsewhere. Wild Rock is worth buying, just not for its plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of wishy-washy garbage.","review":"I picked up this book at the local libarary, thinking it would be a scholarly analysis of the scriptures.

I challenge Mitchell to read Zacharias's book as well and see if he still holds to the theories he puts forth here. It'll be tough -- Zacharias is a brilliant theologian who makes his case beautifully and thoroughly in \\"Jesus Among Other Gods.\\" If Mitchell can come up with a substantial refutation of Zacharias's arguments, I'd like to see it (yes, Mr. Mitchell, that's a challenge to you.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"About humility and God's love for the mentally handicapped","review":"There are stories from this small book I was privileged to read once that still challenge and draw me in...

The stories are good, but the language needs to be updated. The term \\"sub-human\\" was used often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wyeth Estate should sue","review":"Just a guess here: Writer's block dealt with by taking Andrew Wyeth's story and changing the names and adding a few fictitious characters to pad things. I was not able to care for these characters in any way; I couldn't feel any sympathy for them or identify with them. This was for a book club, and I came away feeling like I'd wasted a couple of hours. You know how it is, you buy a book and you know it's not going to get any better, but you think you just have to finish what you've started. That's a bad habit, like not walking out on a bad movie. Why am I reviewing it after all this time? I cleaned out a closet, found the book and gave it to my auntie. She reads bodice rippers, and loved it! She didn't know who the heck Helga was, so not a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Distortion of Wyeth","review":"Watson is indeed a fine prose writer, but if you are thinking of reading this book to get some insight into Andrew Wyeth and his magnificent work you would be better off sticking with the great Meryman biography. It seems that Watson has taken events in Wyeth's life and thrown them into a distortion machine with results that are at times laughable. If this was meant to be a novel about Wyeth's life,which I was led to believe by a newspaper article, it has failed, for it is, sadly, a crude, mixed-up caracature which does no honor to this great artist. However, if it is just a story about an artist and his models you are looking for, you might find Chevalier's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" to your taste. Sorry, Mr. Watson, you write extremely well, but as a fan of Andrew Wyeth who has read every book in existence on his life, I wish I had skipped this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it...","review":"I'm really surprised that I managed to get through this book. I wanted to close it so many times. I didn't care for the characters at all. I felt that they had no emotions. I didn't understand how any of them could do the things they do. There was so much cheating going on from so many people in this book & although the spouses may have not liked it they all basically knew about it & allowed it to continue. Made no sense to me.I felt that this book was pointless & the way it was organized may confuse you quite a bit. It's so out of order it's like you took the chapters out of the book & shuffled them like a deck of cards. I don't think it was really necessary. I didn't laugh, smile or grip the edge of my seat at any time. There was nothing exciting.I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to put it down","review":"A really sad novel if you're into that kind of thing.

People act as if this never happened or dismiss it. Any attempt at making this expulsion known, was until now totally rejected by any mainstream publisher. Anyone daring to even hint at it, was and is immediately attacked.A. de Zayas has the courage to stand up against intimidation. This book is the tip of the iceberg of the actual records of thesurvivors. De Zayas made an event public, that by mere denial of the actively involved perpetrators for the last 50 years, led to many repeats such as Kosovo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and well written","review":"This is a Great book.

If Mr Zayas writes more on this subject I will buy it also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, and In a Historical Vacuum","review":"Throughout the book, DeZayas completely avoids discussing the real reasons for the expulsions. To begin with, the taking away of prime industrial territory away from Germany was designed to weaken her in the event that she wanted to start another war. The rest was for the benefit of the Soviet Union. The shifting of Germany hundreds of miles westward had a strategic purpose in the event of another war. The awarding of these lands to Poland was designed to palliate the thievery of Poland's eastern half in 1939, and again in 1944, and to add legitimacy to the Communist government then being forcibly imposed upon Poland for the first time. Finally, Stalin wanted to create a frontier settlement so odious to Germany that Poland would (hopefully) be forever bound in a dependency relationship to the Soviet Union, and Communism, to defend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to Convert Germans From Agressors to Victims","review":"DeZayas masterfully avoids major facts, and invents others. He repeats the baseless canard about 2 million Germans killed during the expulsions (a product of of statistical legerdemain). He fails to inform the reader that almost ALL Germans (not just card-carrying Nazis) supported German imperialistic claims, and that the territories which they were being expelled from had been taken by Germans from their Slavic neighbors over a thousand years of wars of aggression (including the times of the Teutonic Knights, Partitions of Poland, Bismark's Kulturkampf, etc.). Thus DeZayas makes an unconvincing case for his tacit premise that Germans should be free to inflict suffering on others without experiencing any of it in return. For the Germans to experience REAL revenge, they would have had to have suffered in much greater numbers, and over a long period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"boxer glove","review":"the glove is pretty well made except after a week of using it in the warehouse the no slip tabs on the fingers that you grip boxes and etc with began falling off.I think they were not properly glued.

Although Gallo's secrets aren't so secret (be prepared, be passionate, look spiffy), his style is punchy, if a bit windy and repetitive, and he has gathered a virtual roomful of people you'll find interesting. While his book does offer basic techniques that beginning communicators can use - and old pros have always used - Gallo's real accomplishment is in sharing the insights of his podium role models.

His voice is more of a croak than ever but remarkably he's greater than he ever was and he was always great. Broken Freedom and This Old Road, both recorded in 2006, have the extraordinary resonance of a man nearing the end, with nothing left to lose, sharing his emotions in a so-honest-as-to-be-heart-wrenching manner. Both albums approach a cappello in delivery. They are equally magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kris's songs have been with me all my adult life","review":"I loved Kris's songs when I first heard them in my twenties. They helped me through difficult times, sometimes making me cry and others times just identifying with that something deep in your soul. I have bought Kris's last two CDs and love them both. I'm so glad he's continued to \\"tell it like it is\\". In the early years he \\"told it\\" more on an individual basis. Now the problems of this world are huge and he sees it and is not afraid to say so. Honesty, integrity and soul are in all his songs, and this CD proves he still has these marvellous qualities. He's the kind of guy I'd like to sit down and listen to as he talks of his take on the world today. I hope he puts out more CDs. I will most definitely be a buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You just cant hide a fire","review":"The last Kristofferson songs I owned (and I have them all)are on vinyl-and thats how long its been.

As every one knows you cant really go back - except for the \\"walking Contradiction\\" that is.He still has a voice like God and is effortlessly lyrical in Broken Freedom Song. In an age when most artists try to reinvent themselves (usually badly) Kris Kristofferson comes back at you with more poetry and lyric to break your heart. And the tone of the album in terms of subject is exquisite and speaks more for this Picasso of song than anything else.

But this wasn't Boston it was Trapeze, they got down to what they did, regular blokes who rocked out. Who cares about his voice not sounding perfect. They do some great long song jamming here, with all the tunes you'd expect to see them play. Mel gets that Les Paul of his to sing along, even if he wasn't the best vocalist.

The power supply must be faulty as I tried the TV in several WORKING outlets, but stopped trying after detecting a burning smell and hum from the power supply. I even consulted the manual. I do not recommend this model of Sharp. Usually, companies use cheap power supplies to sell a cheap TV set. I guess you get what you pay for. I bought it at a BestBuy in CO for $169.99+ tax.

I exchanged it for a new TV of the same model. I've had the second TV for about four months, and now one of the speakers is making a strange noise.

Clearly, that reviewer had an agenda.I own the entire Mozart Piano Concerto cycle with Derek Han, and although it is not ideal, it is an excellent set. With bargain prices from Brilliant Classics for the complete set, it's hard to pass up. Han's playing is simple, clear, and concise. The recording and remastering, although a little bland and lacking in detail, is nonetheless consistently good. You can pay four times as much for another cycle, but it won't be markedly better than this one. Skip the single discs, go straight for the complete set, and enjoy without the guilt of a major purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bust","review":"Ok, I confess, I didn't listen to the whole CD, just the clips provided by Amazon.

This thing is supposed to get up and GO!!! with lots of blood. These guys all sound like they just swallowed a bottle of 'ludes. Avoid it.Good alternatives for a complete cycle: Bilson/Gardiner; Anda/Mozarteum Orchestra. Also, Schiff and Vegh in selected concertos; Staier and Concerto Koln in selected concertos.

Don't make my mistake.I've also watched a friend play all of Onimusha 4. If you've played the first two and you're looking for more, it's safe to purchase that one. It's not nearly as good as the first two, and in some ways it's different enough that it probably should be even called part of the Onimusha series, but at least it doesn't suck.

After playing, I was disappointed. It's a very \\"AVERAGE\\" game, that doesn't have anything special to make it stand out from other games.I found it very weird that there is no jump function. The only way to kill air-born enemies is to shoot them with a bow n arrow. This can be tedious since you have to stop and stand still, then use the lock on target button.And since there is no jump, you can NOT jump in the air and perform hard landing attacks.There is also no kick button. Kicks would have added a little more variety to the attacks.You should buy God of War instead.

For ps2 only owner check out Prince of Persia, Devil May Cry or even Castlevania (LOI). In my opinion better games and at a cheaper price. If you do own all the games I said earlier this is a decent action game while your waiting for better ones to come out. Things I didn't like obout Onimusha 3 where boring storyline, fixed camera angles,and the fact there's no jump button. It's backgrounds are fully 3d but it doesn't matter because the camera angles are fixed like they were in the past games. Get Onimusha only if you love the series or are a hardcore action game fan.

Its a testament to this group that I haven't removed it yet. Following up on their release \\"Beyond Here and Now\\", Neuropa deliver another very intriguing album. The songs are mostly in the vein of their older music, with new twists thrown in. Going from poppy to slower to instrumentals there isn't a filler track on this album. I especially like the songs \\"There for You\\", \\"A Better Place\\", \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\". The lyrics on those songs are really meaningful and the guitars add a nice backdrop to the electronics. The electronics on \\"A Better Place\\" are really catchy and infectious.As always with Neuropa's music the vocals are the strong point of the album.

I bought her one for her first birthday, although she already knew how to walk, I felt it would be fun for her to ride on. I was so excited to get it home and open it, once it was ready to go, she had the hardest time getting the hippo to move ( as a ride on toy). Still at 16 months the toy does not stimulate her at all.

I would not purchase this toy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Just quickly adding this review since I'm actually in search of something else.... Do NOT waste your money! Get the CHICCO PLAY 'N RIDE TRAIN instead!!! I was able to do a side-by-side comparison of this toy, the Play n' Ride, and Tek Nek's My First Play & Learn. The Gobble 'n Go Hippo was by far the lightest and worst thought-out of the three. The Chicco won hands down due to the fact that there actually IS a back support for little sit-on riders, and it is substantial at that. Also, the front support is comprised of a LARGE, sturdy ball and horn toy enclosure, whereas the Gobble 'n Go has a puny handle down by the child's crotch area... not at all stable!!! Trust me when I say I was so excited to buy the Gobble n' Go. Now I'd be thrilled if I could prevent someone else from making the same mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Boring","review":"I bought this toy for my son last christmast...

We returned it after 1 day of use. Our son could not get up on it without it falling over and when he could the thing didn't let him move forward easily. Also, it was hit or miss if the block would get gobbled up or not. Definately, not worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gobble 'N Go Hippo is a hit!","review":"We got this toy for my 9 month old son. He doesn't walk yet but this toy is helping him work on his gross motor skills. First, he pushed it along while crawling. Now, he stands up and uses it to cruise for a few steps. It isn't the most sturdy toy for beginning walkers because it is fairly light and lifts off the ground really easily. He plays with the blocks separately for now, but one of his friends who walks already enjoyed using the hippo to pick up the blocks. We also own the rounds and we found that the hippo actually has an easier time of picking those up. My son really likes to play with this toy. Sometimes he tries to chew on it. Other times, he likes to put things in it or to take stuff out. It is a really cute toy and I can tell that it will only become more fun for him as he gets older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We bought this at Christmas for our 1 year old. The age says up to 36 months,no way. My small for her age 2 1/2 year old is too big for this. We were disappointed because it is pretty small so there is not a lot of room to grow, it only picks up the blocks some of the time, and it really needs some kind of back support. The blocks have to be in exactly the right position. We will be returning this. Too bad, it looks cute on the box anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"This toy is great. My 11 mon old got it for xmas, and she loves to walk behind it pushing it. She finally got the concept that it would eat the blocks, now everytime she sees a block she will go over then lean over the handle on her tip toes to see if it is in the tray. I have had no trouble getting the hippo to gobble any of the blocks on any surface, we have carpet, hardwood floors, and laminate flooring, and he worked on all of them. Thank goodness for fisher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great one","review":"What a great toy, I have a 9 month old, who has been stuck in the house due to a cold, then that stomach virus,I needed something to amuse her, because of her cabin fever, and that was just perfect, I opened one of her Christmas gifts .....Naughty Mommy, but away she went, She was happy with something new to look at and play with ....Thank You Gobble 'N Go Hippo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"We are huge peek a block fans in our home, so when this toy came out, I went right out and got it for our daughter's first b-day. We played with it right away, but I was not impressed! Of course the blocks are great, but Mr. Hippo doesn't eat up his food like he is supposed to, my daughter has a hard time pushing him cause the handle is small, and to top it off, she has a hard time riding on him cause she is very tall and just can't move her legs right when she is on him. As excited as I was to purchase this toy, I will be returning it as soon as I can. We are going to get her something a little more suitable. I would not reccommend this toy, and am kind of disappointed by Fisher Price with this toy. (I am still a huge fan of Fisher Price though!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walking toy!!","review":"We received this toy for my daughter's first birthday. She is not yet walking and it is great for emerging or early walkers. She loves it when the hippo gobbles up the blocks. To my surprise she also loves playing with the blocks and pointing to what is inside of them. My son is 5 and he loves to watch her gobble up the blocks. They did not have a walker out like this when he was a baby!! Overall, we love this product and we are purchasing the incrediblock for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy, but some flaws","review":"We got this for my daughter when she was 6 months old. At that time she loved just playing with the blocks. Now she is walking with it and loves it. It is hard to get turned around, so we have to help her with it. She likes to sit on it too but is still too short. My 4 year old loves it too, and they both end up playing with it together. My 4 year old will lay out the blocks for th 10 month old to gobble up. The only other flaw is that once you get a couple of blocks in there, sometimes the other ones won't go in unless you move them around. But overall it is very durable , cute and lots of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gobble 'N Go - Even if it's only in a straight line","review":"I bought this toy for my 14 month old son who was cruising, but not walking hoping it would encourage him to start walking. The gobbling part worked pretty well and even picked up other small toys. However, the hippo doesn't turn easily at all, so once he ran out of space in the straight line he was walking it was all over. It's not much fun to play with a toy for a few seconds then have to have Mom turn it around so you can play for a few more secondsMy son has since started walking - no thanks to the handful of times he used the hippo- and I have tried converting it to a ride on. The base is pretty wide and he hates sitting on it.All in all, it was a waste of $25."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"This hippo is one cute toy. I love the push it/ ride it option. As others have mentioned, the block pick up mechanism isn't perfect (not that big a deal for me), and it is hard to turn (for my 9 month old son). The blocks that come with it are very nice, considerably more so than the ones that come with the wagon from this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasting Entertainment Value = Nill","review":"I was so excited to purchase this, thinking it would last forever since it converts to a ride toy. But the hippo just wasn't hungry enough for us. We had to run over blocks a couple time to \\"finish\\" the gobbling mechanism, and even then the toy doesn't work that great on carpet. And the blocks have to be spaced farther apart to get gobbled up, something our young one just doesn't understand yet. The hippo isn't that great for pushing the other way either, which a learning child is prone to do. The one thing this toy has going for it? It's silent. But if you don't mind songs, I suggest the LeapFrog Learning Band Walker instead. I should have known LeapFrog would have been better anyway since our young one likes all their other toys too."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed","review":"My mother-in-law bought this for my son for his first birthday after I suggested he might like it. Boy was I wrong. The moment we opened it the hippo looked smaller and cheaper then it did on the box. I'd been eyeing this toys since my son was only a few months old and now we finally have, I am so disappointed. Like another review said, my son can't even move the hippo when he is riding on it, it sits too close to the ground. Pushing it doesn't even interest my son. Gobbling the Peek-A-Blocks, well if I can't get him to ride on it or push it, the gobbling action is worthless. This hippo has sat in the corner of our dining room from day one, the only thing my son does like about it are the blocks. My son loves Peek-A-Blocks, we have the train, the dump truck, Popity the Elephant and the IncrediBlocks toys, all of those are better made and hold my sons interest much longer then the hippo. For the money you can do MUCH better in the Peek-A-Block line."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Gobble, No Go","review":"We got this toy as a gift for my 7 month old son. He was a late starter with sitting because of his weight, so crawling and walking hasn't happened yet. I found that there was no place for his legs to go when sitting on the hippo. The seat is also very small, causing him to lurch forward over the \\"handle bar\\" and \\"hood\\" of the hippo. Also, the hippo doesn't really pick up the blocks very good unless they are positioned directly in front and center AND if you push it backwards, some blocks fall out. I gave it 3 stars for fun because my son likes to bang on it and 5 stars for durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"my daughter didn't like it!","review":"i saw this and fell in love! i thought it was adorable and would be a perfect christmas gift for my then one year old who had been walking for a month, but was still a bit wobbly. she already had the peek-a-blocks table, which she loved, so i thought she'd love this. she didn't! she never played with it. not once. maybe because she was already walking she didn't think it was so great to push it around. she was too tall to ride on it well, so it just sat for a couple of months until i packed it up. i still think it's cute, so i'm saving it for a future baby. i'll try introducing it before the new little one is walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippo doesn't gobble.","review":"We received this for our daughter's first birthday.

It doesnt move to fast when she pushes it like some other ones do (that my son had when he was young, he would push them and he would go running or take a nose dive)She LOVES the blocks, and thinks its sooooo funny to see Ms. Hippo eat them.. Also she LOVES it when we put it in riding mode and push her around on it!!! Needless to say this is now her morning, noon, and night toy!! She cant live with out it now..

Even though they were 11 weeks early (which makes them about 9 1/2 months size), they are trying to walk. The hippo does not get ahead of them while pushing in the walker set up. Other walkers we tried at friends' homes would roll too fast and they would fall forward. The gobble action works on carpet or hard floors. The wheels work well enough on carpet for my daughter to continue pushing when my son crawls on top.

When she sits on the seat, the ears and the edge of the head are right at her knees. There is a thin edge of plastic at this part of the head that hurts her legs if she moves her legs to try to ride on the toy. This is poor design. If you only look at this as a walking toy, it is great. When my daughter was learning to walk, I liked that it didn't turn at all. Now that she is older, her lighter weight walker is better, because she can turn it on her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good toy","review":"My son enjoys this toy.

He is 10 months old and LOVES pushing this up and down the house.The house we are renting has very cheap carpeting with no cushion whatsoever. It creates no drag on the hippo, but the toy doesn't seem to get away from him either and he only occasionally has trouble pulling himself up to it.The gobble feature works ok if you have enough speed or give it enough time. DS is not really interested in gobbling toys or playing with the blocks. He just wants to walk, walk walk.My only complaint is that he can't really steer it (even if he knew where he wanted to go!). So when he hits a wall, he yells for one of us to turn it for him.Thanks to other people who have posted safety concerns.

The only promblem is that their is not a computer sleve or compartment,the straps are not comfortable and when fully loaded it can be heavy and might hurt your back if you do alot of urban walking as I do.But don't get me wrong I do like this packback every much.I like having my hands free when going from account to account. and after a few days of use. I only pack the tools that I need instead of every tool I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"I had read some questionable reviews on this bag but I really liked the idea of a tool backpack for my job so I gave it a try. As a previous reviewer said its only good for short tools and thats true theres lots of pockets for 4 inch tools. Anyway after about two months of full time use the one of the zippers gave out. The straps on this thing are the same as the ones found on a normal backpack used for school. Overall the construction is light duty and is not at all comparable to my other clc bag.

Returned the Item because it was not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Great idea, bad design. Although the pockets are neat and convenient, the back pack is uncomfortable. The weight of the drill and hardware case (when full) pulls the pack down and away from you. In addition, the shoulder straps are cheap and not well designed. It would help to have a chest strap to clip the two shoulder straps together like on the hiking packs. The pack is also too big and bulky. Back problems have occured. Im going back to my $40.00 NorthFace pack. Much more confy."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless for hand tool carrier","review":"I do my own work on my cars and around the house, and I keep my front-line hand tools in a shoulder bag so that I can move them around as needed. I was looking at this backpack so that I could get the tools clearly organized and onto my back (and off my shoulder) but it is useless for my needs. There is only one wall for wrenches so I have to choose metric or SAE and leave the other set behind. There is one wall with elastic straps that is good for screwdrivers and such but every other wall has closed-top pockets that do not close when filled with common tools like pliers and wire cutters. There is no good facility for storing socket sets and ratchets either. It seems well-made and would probably work well for things like roofing contractor who has to carry 20 different kinds of screws up a roof but it's useless as a general toolbag. Perhaps if they replaced the pockets with elastic and/or velcro straps it would be more useful. As it stands it's useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing in tool cases ever!!!","review":"I love this, it beats me having to carry around a tool box all the time.

Its still ticking, but thats about the best I can say for it. The casing is stainless steel plated, but is actually made of brass. Some watches gain character as they get older and worn, but this one just starts to look cheap and shabby after a few months.Friends who own watches from Victorinox (who makes the REAL Swiss army knife) claim the crystal doesn't scratch as easily. I can't say how scratch resistant the Victorinox are, but my Wenger definitely has some prominent scratches on the crystal.Also, the luminescent paint on the hands no longer glows in the dark, even after prolonged exposure to bright sunlight. Maybe the lifespan is longer on other watches, but I'm not sure.In my experience, the battery in this watch needs replacement about every 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Watch (Almost)","review":"Great watch. Works fantastic. Two criticisms: band should be solid steel (this really makes a difference) and the illumination needs to last through the night.

The pictures on line don't give you a proper sense of its dimensions. The watch is tiny and the numbers are tinier. I am going to have to return it, but it's going to cost me monty to ship it back. It makes me wonder if I should ever shop at Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Life!","review":"I have almost the same watch, except that I purchased it a good 15 years ago. Although I have not treated it well, it has rewarded me with a long life and excellent performance. It keeps perfect time, so I only reset it at the beginning and end of Daylight Savings Time or when I go to a different time zone (which is rare). A few years ago, I thought it needed to be repaired. I took the watch to the watch repair shop, and they informed me that it only needed a new battery. They were right. Other than the occasional band cleaning, that is the extent of the maintenance this watch has required for 15 years.My only disappointment is that, like a another reviewer mentioned, Wenger has changed the model to a white face. I prefer the black face that I have, now. It just looks better with the steel (white looks better with either gold or something dark). So, I knocked off a star for appearance (only). For performance, this guy gets five stars and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya","review":"Maya fills in some missing puzzles for The Solitaire Mystery, but, of course, not without creating more mysteries afterwards.

After several attempts to call them I finally listened to their message long enough to hear a website listed, so I emailed them.

This would have been expensive and trouble so I complained enough they finally agreed I could just mail them the proof of purchase.

However, when I arrived in Germany I quickly realized how little I was able to communicate. The sentence structure of German is far different than English, and therefore stringing vocabulary words together can only result in confusion and the Germans taking pity on you by replying in English.

Call me cynical, but I always think that like a good wine, they get better with age. Collections and Anthologies always chart a growth, and I subscribe to keeping it in the bottle until it has matured. So why did I buy this first collection by an unknown poet? Its not long, 90 odd pages, but it was somehow compulsive. The author denies in his preface that the poems are snapshots, but in fact I am convinced thats exactly what they are. Yes, its clumsy in places, and could have benefitted from some more aggresive editing, but there is a genuiness, warmth, some humour, a lot of passion and much eloquence on display here. Most importantly I feel, an astute obeservance of the human condition. This belies a first book and bodes well for the future.

Soulful lyrics are paired with pop rock melodies that are catchy and at the same time meaningful. This is definitely not an album that should not be taken at face value (i.e. listening to the 30 second clips to decide whether or not to purchase it). This is an album that improves each time you hear it. By the 4th or 5th time through the listener will be thoroughly glad they decided to pay the nominal fee.

The footage used is from Yessongs and some Steve Howe DVD I saw years ago; nothing new, nothing insightful and nothing the less-informed should take as gospel and spew forth. It would take very little research to ascertain that the album Close to the Edge was an important and significant piece of work; this DVD does nothing you couldn't do yourself if you cared to. Stop giving these people power and money; listen for yourself and draw your own conclusions, which could well be as valid or more so than this lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"This is a big waste of time and money.

The audio and video quality are excellent. It has all of the great classic Fleetwood Mac songs.

Needless to say, I was glued to the TV that night. My coffee table could've been on fire and I still wouldn't have moved. The band is in peak form. There's Christine, regally perched at her keys. The legendary Stevie, dancing like a Witch at Samhain, and Lindsey, arguably one of the best rock guitarists out there, John, singing for the first time (albeit backup), and Mick, with the wild faces. How many over 50 rock bands still have drum solos?That said, I must say that Stevie's voice sounds.. well, different. At parts, she kind of sounds like Marianne Faithfull doing a wicked impression of Stevie Nicks. Not that that's a bad thing! I worship Stevie, and Marianne! Stevie's voice, though the upper register is gone, definitely still retains great tonal quality, and it has a lovely vintage to it.So, in short, the Mac are back, and I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dance is a monster homerun in the music industry.","review":"As a quasi-fan of Fleetwood Mac, I happened to catch the end of The Dance on public television a couple of months ago. I was fascinated not so much by the sound (I was only hearing it in stereo), but by the fun Mick Fleetwood was having on the drums. He was absolutely fantastic. The others former members of the band, Stevie Nicks, Christie McVie, John McVie, and Lindsey Buckingham were absolutely enjoying their reunion of sorts. It really showed. Well, that short clip made me go out and buy the DVD. When I watched the concert in its entirety, I was in awe. The 5.1 soundtrack is awesome, Mick's drum playing is one of the best performances I've heard, and Lindsey's guitar playing is, well, a work of art. The vocals of Stevie and Christie are timeless.

It seemed to me that all of the members of the band were having a lot of fun just being back together as well as entertaining the audience. My favorite, of course, is Stevie Nicks, but Mick, Christine, John and Lindsay were all great. I have since bought a number of their CDs and am wondering how I missed out on their music for all these years.

The good highlight was \\"Over my head\\", \\"Landslide\\" \\"Sweet Girl\\" \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Silver Springs\\" plus \\"So Affraid\\"Where is \\"Little Lies\\", \\"save me\\", \\"7 wonders\\", \\"Hold me\\" and \\"Sara\\" + \\"Sisters\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work on a Blu Ray/DVD","review":"I didn't realize when I purchased this item that it was being shipped from the United Kingdom.

If you want to see the band in concert but don't care if the sound recording is of poor quality buy the DVD.

I noticed during the ending of \\"Gypsy\\" (which was an incredible performance) Lindsey's guitar playing was very much more prominant. You can really hear the individual musical sounds of each instrument here, and the vocals are much better, someone mentioned them not ben n sync with the picture, thats not the case on the DVD i have, definetely worth your money!

I love Gold Dust Woman on here, I can't believe they didn't put it on the cd!

If you know the history, the conflicts and tragedies of this band, this concert takes on more meaning than any before it. The energy and interaction between all five members just pulls you onto the stage with them. The Mac dishes up the comfort food of the past and offers 4 new tunes to make you think in the now. They all sound wonderful-every single one of them. As always, Stevie was absolutely fabulous!! Her voice is still unbelievable! She is unlike anyone before, or since. Lindsey and Mick are powerful and Christine has grown even better with the years. John exhibits his talent excellently. You can't watch this and not notice the spark between Stevie and Lindsey. It's STILL there, but somehow wiser. Knowing what brought them to this point makes it all the sweeter. I cannot say enough about this video.

The Dance is ... A W E S O M E. Fleetwood Mac in the 1970's were so over promoted- I liked them, but they had almost become bubble gum pop (to me) after all the incessant radio play. But! Now! This is one of my top 3 dvd shows (in my collection of 20+). If you ever liked just ONE Fleetwood Mac song- then you need to get this dvd. And according to my research- Christine Perfect (maiden name) McVie is around 53 years old-- and her presence on stage gives me thrills. Christine is not in the Live in Boston show and her absence became obvious- by comparison with The Dance show.BTW: the other 2 of my top 3 are-- Joe Bonamassa at the Royal Albert Hall and Tina Turner One Last Time (Wembley Stadium)."},{"rating":"1","title":"fleetwood mac the dance","review":"had to send it back to the U.S.A it would not work in my dvd player now waiting for money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix my hair","review":"This is NOT a concert! It is a movie made with the intention of making you think it's a concert.

Very low energy on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor production values and sound","review":"The sound quality on the DVD is abominable. It does not come close to the James Taylor Live at the Beacon DVD. The sound is flat and restrained. What is worse is the poor use of the 5.1 format with percussion instruments such as marachas eminating from the fromt and rear speakers without any sense of spacial reality. A terrible effort which will stand as an embarrassment to the production staff and ultimately the band for allowing its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Fleetwood Mac, The Dance","review":"When I received my DVD in the mail and opened it up, the round middle thing that the DVD snaps onto was broken...I didn't think too much of it since everything else looked okay. I played the DVD that very night, and about 25 minutes into it, the picture became extremely grainy, then it would clear up, then back to grainy, then it finally went completely black. It was almost as if it was a bootleg copy! I tried to fast forward to see what would happen, and it still continued to be black....no sound or anything. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I had already thrown the shipping slip away, so I couldn't return it...dumb move on my part! The Fleetwood Mac DVD itself is an excellent DVD..too back the product itself didn't work correctly.So, overall, I will never order any DVD's from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Dead\\"","review":"This DVD should have been called \\"TheDead\\".All the band members except Mick look like they are bored & uptight. Mick looks like he's awake. That's a step in the right direction. Do not buy this DVD if you are thinking about showing off your home theatre. The sound stinks.

Even if you have the CD of the same name, you still need this DVD. The CD doesn't contain all the music that the video does. For me, the most notable example of this is Gold Dust Woman...one of my favorite Fleetwood songs of all time. The band plays great here, despite their years--so much so, that I've grown to like some of the concert versions of the songs (The Chain, Landslide, etc.) better than the actual studio version. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chain brought them together again, and I'm glad it did.","review":"'The Dance' is an absolute must - have for all Fleetwood Mac fans, as it was this reunion which brought the famous five back together to make some controlled, superb and thoroughly listenable music! They are all on top form in this video, and although not quite as active on stage as before, they still keep the audience wanting more, with neither a note or a foot out of place throughout. A large portion of the setlist is included, though unfortunately Stevie Nicks' solo smash, 'Stand Back' was not put on the video. Four new songs, and a breathtaking version of Nicks' 'Silver Springs' are featured, as well as an entire live USC marching band for 'Don't Stop' and 'Tusk'.So all in all, a quintessential part to any pop/rock music fan, and a fine performance from all angles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like fine wine....","review":"I guess I never thought it was possible.

WOW!Not only do they look great...especially Christine, but they some better than ever.Some musical standouts...Silver Springs.

The learning comes naturally, its comprehensive; you listen, read and speak. This is not a word for word translation guide. This software goes far beyond those French books that simply give you a few phrases without any real life context. RosettaStone gives you the building blocks to think, and start building sentences in your new language. O.k., this product is a little pricier than other programs, nevertheless, after I have spent hundreds of dollars on French college courses and, many, many books and CD ROM's. It is - the best investment I have ever made for improving my French; - it's like having your own personal tutors.

This is of course necessary, but it did not give me any glue with which to commit the characters to my long term memory.Having bought both the books from the Tokyo Uni group, I was able to enjoy the process of learning. The mnemonic system is just what you need. It allows you to create links to the components of the complex Kanji. That is, to identify what makes up the meaning of the characters. With a mental picture cemented, it is quite simple to make the associations when you are presented with new kanji.I found this invaluable and a pleasant reading experience. The pleasant and interesting experience part was especially necessary trying to learn kanji after the average 12 hour day at work here in Tokyo.Ganbatte kudesai!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome tires","review":"My husband bought these for his trials bike, but I ended up wanting to try them on my full suspension.

All of my jumps were a split second off; Mega Man moved a bit sloppy and reacted slowly. Alas, whoever play tested this game did not play the original versions which had lightning fast reaction and precision control as this version does not have the superior control of the originals. Perhaps the pressure sensitive controls that maqus1213 referred to are the culprit.

The lamp heads are all adjustable and can be positioned to light up every corner of a room. The only problem as others have suggested is the stand is relatively flimsy where it attaches. It's not sturdy, or thick, and so it's easily broken. Our 2 yr old thought it would be fun to stand on the base and lean back holding the pole, so it snapped. We quickly went out and purchased an identical lamp placing it behind a heavy piece of furnitre so it wouldn't be messed with and it's lasted and worked wonderfully.I'd recommend purchasing the lamp, but make sure when you're handling or moving it that you be gentle, and don't keep it in an open space with young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding results","review":"I have gotten two of these lamps so far and both are exactly what I needed.

Eleven songs that are supposed to sound like industrial/metal, but come off as a hair band trying to sound \\"hip\\".

This is not a true video production, but rather zoom and pans of about 100 photographs. The collection of photos is impressive, the subject matter is interesting and beautiful, and I liked the concept of viewing the park in different seasons. But photographs have only a single plane of focus and zooming in on areas off center to see blurry detail is uncomfortable to watch. Photographs also do not do justice to waterfalls, raging rivers, and wildlife. There is no natural soundtrack. The music is not as annoying as is common in this genre, and but I preferred to mute it. There is a narrated soundtrack that I did not listen to for more than a few seconds, and but it seemed informative.I should have researched Telly Awards on Wikipedia before buying this DVD-R, as it is not impressive that the winners have to pay for their own award statues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great supplemental learning tool","review":"I have been taking Japanese for a little under a year now; studying alone for a few years. I found that using RS in conjunction with my classroom studies is really amazing. I can spend a day studying vocabulary lists and not remember the words. Words I've used in RS are just engraved into my memory.I will admit, a large downside of this revolves around the lack of explanation. Japanese is very difficult to speak correctly, and a lot of honor tenses and words must be used. Also, if you have no prior knowledge of the particles and cannot read Hiragana/Katakana, it may be more difficult to learn. I would not recommend this alone for someone trying to learn to read/write Japanese.However, for the taught individual, this is an excellent study tool for your Japanese class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good supplemental program","review":"Personally, I feel this program would be great for students already in a Japanese class. It has greatly improved my abilities to listen and pronounce Japanese, and has also given me reading and writing practice.Unfortunately, I have to agree with others on the lack of explanation for words and phrases. I often find myself with questions about why words changed in a certain phrase and there are some words that I've been unable to decipher at all. It's easy to pick the correct answer with a little reasoning but it leaves me with a feeling that I'm \\"cheating\\" by not fully understanding what the sentences say.I wish this program came with a textbook!Overall, if you plan to use this program as a supplemental to classes, then it's a great buy.

This is why Columbus, the \\"founder of the West,\\" is one of the many heroes whom they denounce as evil; the truth is that they hate him because he was in fact, good.

People commented on the narrowness of the stroller. This is a very narrow stroller. I took my 3 month old with me, and while she is a big baby, she was still up against the sides of the stroller. As she gets bigger this will get more cramped and I can't see being able to use this past one year old if that.It also does not have a 5 point harness and for safety reasons I like having the shoulder straps even though she doesn't sit up right now.If you have a small baby and are looking at travel use stroller, it's probably not bad, but don't expect to use it up to the weight limit.

I'm 5'5\\" and I find the handles to be at an awkward height but my 5'11\\" husband thinks it is fine.

If someone wants to read a nice novel like the Da Vinci Code - fine, but do not expect to get any scientific truth about the Shroud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science and worse logic","review":"I never understood why the Da Vinci Camera Obscura theory was even suggested in the first place. One has to realize that Carbon 14 dates are a probability range and the range reported usually only has about a 66% probability. To get a 97% probability range one DOUBLES the original range. So given a 130 year range (1260-1390) there is a 97% chance that the Shroud has made between 1145 and 1405.So the latest the shroud can be dated with 97% likelihood is to c1405 but Leonardo da Vinci was not born until 1452 almost 50 years later. Furthermore the Shroud has a decent provenance (documented historical record) back to 1350 which pushes it another 50 years BEFORE Da Vinci was even born.This book like many of its ilk play on the public's ignorance of how science really works and leave out important data to create a story that is better suited to the fiction section."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good laugh","review":"This book was not worth reading.

Although the game has some glitches, by and large I found myself wholly impressed by the graphics and overall presentation. Some of the lighting effects rival the Splinter Cell series and the voice acting is bested only by GTA 3 Vice City. When your character gains the shiny-eye ability later in the game it opens up tons of possibilities for executing your foes without their knowledge of your presence. It seems too often a game is hyped long before its release only to disappoint. This game however came out of nowhere with little fanfare and delivers a solid game. With graphics such as these, there is no excuse for other developers not to utilze the Xbox's hardware to its fullest.

I had seen Pitch Black and it sucked. When I first played this game the first-person view caught me off guard. I had never seen punching as a main combat thing but after the annoying tutorial I quickly learned how great Riddick really was. You are Riddick in a maximum security prison, without any weapons, friends, and hair. You have to figure out a way to get out. The game really gets good in the double-max prison but enough chat.

I was very very dissapointed. It starts you out with a full sentence and words are conjugated. Now, since I took Spanish I knew what it meant, but to new learners...it is forcing you to guess, basically just to memorize not uderstand. It needs to have more explaination and some type of lesson on vocab words and grammar. Simple things like what does \\"el\\" mean. It is so simple, but to new learners, they may not know.

Sure, this software can teach you some sentences to repeat, but it is useless if you want to really understand and speak the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations - try Pimsleur","review":"I spent a lot of money on this program, and, so far, all it's doing is MAYBE teaching me to RECOGNIZE what is being said - not to speak it. There is absolutely no English translation (in Level I anyway), no breakdown of pronunciation, and no opportunity to construct NEW sentences with words I've already learned. All you do is look at pictures and repeat what is already written or spoken to you. I've already made it through Pimsleur Spanish I and I'm into II and I've learned so much more. Pimsleur is slower on vocabulary, but when you learn it, you learn how to conjugate and incorporate it into an original sentence.

With a beautifully sweet voice and interesting arrangement, she manages to squeak ahead of the group. \\"Waiting,\\" for instance, is a delicate piece of work, which manages to convey the sounds your mind makes while you're twiddling your thumbs. The Portuguese lyrics keep the proceedings authentic, as does the music -- it's spiced with the uniquely Brazilian mixture of jazz and rhythm.

An evil spirit is returned to Earth to wreak havoc on all who come in his path.True to form for many Japanese samurai & horror movies, there was a lot of slashing & blood spouting; but aside from that, there was no story that I could follow.While some people will applaud the director for making a \\"David Lynch\\" or \\"Cronenberg\\" style movie, it was (for me), little more than a waste of time.It was so bad, that I gave up watching the last 30 minutes.If you really want to see this movie, hire it, don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh..........","review":"I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing.

Death is Hell, too.\\"","review":"Well Miike fans here we go with a movie that I didn't like. It's definitely strange enough and bloody enough but it's also too long, too boring and it doesn't have that Miike feel to it, like say DEADLY OUTLAW: REKKA, ICHI THE KILLER, YAKUZA DEMON or GOZU. It felt like Miike was just cashing a check.From what I gathered Izo was an evil samurai who's crucified and speared to death. His spirit goes into an eternal Hell where he uncontrollably jumps from place to place throughout time and dimensions. Wherever he lands he kills people then just jumps to somewhere else and he does this over and over again and again and again for two hours.Unless you're a diehard Miike fan I'd skip it. If you're looking for a more straightforward and rewarding samurai movie then check out THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI or SWORD OF DOOM or if you're looking for some quality non-Miike weirdness watch Sasaki's CRAZY LIPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martial Mush","review":"Maybe it's me but I cant understand why some martial movies don't stick to the format of a basic story line nothing to compilcated but simple, wrapped around well designed fight scenes. But this movie was like nothing I had seen before or could have imaged in my wildest dreams. It's an onslaught of blood and gore making no sense at all, and no attempt to put together a good fight throughout the film. Why do these people think that most people buy martial arts movies it's for the FIGHTING, FIGHTING, FIGHTING and maybe if you'll lucky you will find one that has a decent story line.This movie is so bad that I dont know anyone I could give it to, maybe I could get rid of it at a flea market?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta look in between the lines.","review":"Many say that this film is just a completely brutal and totally pointless movie. I disagree with this enormously. Miike would never make a movie that has no theme or hidden message in it. Izo, to me, is a reflection of today's society. Our man, Izo is hardcore and ruthless, and seems to be killing out of the pure joy of it. Do we not in today's world also commit such acts? Maybe not to such an extreme as this movie portrays... but Miike always ALWAYS shows us things exxagerated to the utmost and fullest. I found Izo to actually be very philosophical and actually referenced Buddhism folk-tales from time to time. You gotta look in between the lines. Izo is for the intelligent crowd who knows how to handle sarcasm and large (very large) amounts of violence. I think if you really study Miike's work, you'll find this film satisfactory. And if you don't want to think and just wanna see some repulsive scenes of gore, you can go for this one as well (weirdo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very wearying tale of nonstop bloodshed","review":"I'm a fan of Miike, but _Izo_ is just too much. There's no plot whatsoever, just a poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time and space and killing everyone who crosses his path. That's it! End of sentence! If you think you can stand over two hours of this, give it a try. If you're looking for something with even a rudimentary plot, you might want to try something else, like _Audition_ or _Ichi the Killer_. I'd rather watch the incomprehensible _Gozu_ again than be forced to sit through _Izo_. It is a beautifully-photographed, but ultimately pointless film. Maybe the 6th or 7th other film Miike directs this year will be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is one of the worst CDs I've heard lately.

I wanted a full cat-back kit and after reading all the reviews and listening to this system that people had uploaded I took a chance. I am very pleased with this system; not only does it look better than stock but it is the right sound for a VW. It has a very low pitch and cannot be heard inside the cabin with the stereo on. You do have to cut the original exhaust plumbing out but that was expected and I have the right tools to make that happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Entertainment","review":"If you're coming into this period romance looking for a lot of accurate details on the social history of the period, you will probably feel a bit disappointed, but otherwise, it's a fairly entertaining story about the hero's discovery of two treasures, when he was seeking redemption through only one. The heroine turns out to be of much more worth than he ever initially credited her with, and the author makes it easy to identify with her this way, which is a good trick when she's an heiress destined for a spot beside a titled gentleman. The espionage story isn't predictable, so extra points for an overall pleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE DISAPPOINTING... NOT AT ALL LIKE HER OTHER NOVELS","review":"Unfortunately, this one just didn't grab me at all. Although the story had the same sweet and endearing qualities like Jacquie's other books, NOT QUITE A GENTLEMAN was a very slow read for me and not quite as engaging as her other novels, which I love and enthusiastically devour!Although the early development of Nathan's and Victoria's relationship seemed promising and worthwhile reading about, the storyline was feeble and the story uninteresting. The plot lacked backbone and the story, with an underlying spy-thriller backdrop was a thin. I struggled to get into this book and the only reason I finished it because it is bacause it is a Jacquie D'allessandro book. I am trying not to be too disparaging in my review but needless to say it was disappointing, as her other novels have been a totally winning read for me and the protagonists engaging and charismatic. Not so this book. Sorry Jacquie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby & I both love them!","review":"I love these shoes and so does my one-year-old! He tries to put them on himself.The insides are a nice, soft suede and can be worn with or without socks. He has wide feet, but these adjust to the width of the feet since the bottom is not rigid. As an added bonus, they're crazy-cute and stay on pretty well.This best feature is the hand stiched soft leather sole which is perfect for a new walker and really does allow him to feel the floor and helps with balance. I recommend these shoes.One small thing: because the soles are a soft leather sole, these are not for wet places. But for rainy season, check out See Kai Run shoes -- also good soft soles but rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap, flimsy plastic","review":"The plastic this part is made out of is so thin and flimsy that I cracked the adapter just taking the packaging wrap off of it.

I manage scheduling for 6 different people, do initial sales, and really live in it as receptionist/office manager. It wasn't super easy to figure out on my own, I admit, but I was able to get training in an all day class, which really set me up to use it more efficiently.I know people have made comments on it's speed, and compared to version 2004, it is slower, but it can do so much more! Also, I found exiting the program, and making sure to shut down my computer every night helped keep the program from being really buggy.Anyhoo, hope this sheds a little perspective on ACT - I really love it.

I thought it would be in good condition, but when I opened it up, half the pages fell out and there is writing all over the book. If I didn't need the book now, for this semester's school class, I would've sent it back and demanded my money back! This is a disgrace to have bought something so expensive from a reputable company (Amazon) and have the book fall apart in a Master's Degree class is nothing short of embarrassing and shame for being taken as a fool. I doubt that I will ever purchase from Amazon again with this kind of garbage! Please check the sellers' stuff as best as you can and don't do business with the people who will give Amazon a bad reputation, which is already tarnished now. Most unfortunate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clamp Review","review":"This is very well finished product. The surface is smooth and measurement markings are clear and easy to read, the channel track are snug for plate to glide. However, I have an issue with the clamping method, which exert pressures from both ends of the work piece, I would prefer something like using C clamps that hold the workpiece from underneath on both ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item does not work","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but the saw plate, and it's sibling, the router plate are really worthless. The clamp itself works well, but the cheaply made plastic plates will not slide at all on the clamp bar. This could be weather dependent, since my garage is quite cool, but the plates should slide regardless of the temperature. If you take the plate out of the track (gliding only on a portion of the track) then it will slide, but what good is that since it would be easy to cut crooked, if you didn't keep pressure on the clamp side.Believe me, using your saw or router directly against the clamp bar will work better than using one of these lousy plates. I paid $63.00 for these two plates (including shipping), and this was one of the worst things I've ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plate needs improvements","review":"Similar to other reviews here, the plate does not slide very well so you have to put baking soda so that it slides better. The plate is not universal, I have a milwaukee hand saw and the saw disc does not fit in the plate slot, I have to chip away some pieces for it to work. Overall this was a bad investment, too much work around when it should've worked from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw Plate is garbage - bad design, wrong plastic","review":"The saw plate is just a couple of pieces of molded plastic with a few holes drilled though it. Comes with no mounting hardware and tells you that if the holes don't line up with those in the base plate of your saw, drill new ones.The plastic is not correct for the application. It is way too sticky. Don't use a large drill bit as a counter sink if you decide to make new holes to fit your saw. Sticky plastic caused drill bit to grab most of the way through counter sink and ride up the bit (I was using a drill press).Worstly, as stated in a previous review, the saw plate binds on the clamp track and doesn't slide.Strongly suggest you buy a better designed system."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not recomend","review":"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I was very dissapointed in this book. Like the other reviewer, I found many mistakes- both simple editing mistakes and completly wrong answers on some of the practice questions.

I am terrible at math, so I assumed I was just stupid, until I got to test 1, # 15 (I took the tests in reversed order: 3,2,1).

It gives it a classy noir feel. Our two British robbers Anton (Treva Etienne) and Tyrone (Gary McDonald) drink tea and frequently quote The Bard, testing each others knowledge.

Why they are robbing him is revealed during flashbacks within the flashback.C-Note runs a classy strip club. He has a wife and a mistress (Tina Casciani). The movie is a slow thriller.

At best this movie should be selling for $9.99.Much to my chagrin, the cover art does what it is meant to do....get the customer to buy. I'm a sucker for a slick cover, so I was taken in.The movie actually rates less than one star, but I gave it credit for some good actors...but, as is usually the case...to bastardize another phrase... they were in the wrong movie at the wrong time.

I purchased two of these black diesel pliers, one for myself and one for my son. I have an original set that I've had for many years that I actually prefer as Gerber has changed the action. One must now hold only one handle to flick out the needle nose with one hand. I don't care for this change but I'm sure that I will get used to it eventually. The black Diesel is for my Bug out Bag so I won't use it much. The quality of the tool is top grade as ever. Much better tool than Leatherman tools. I required all of my Mechanics to carry a Gerber Tool on their belts. If a man accidently gets caught in a belt or roller on a live conveyor system, he can with one hand use a Gerber Tool to either cut the belt or even in a worse case cut his arm off to keep from being killed. (Yes, that does happen). In an emergency, you can count on a Gerber working easily and quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"dream come true","review":"I have been looking for this product for yrs never could find these thankyou for having this product I really apreate it thanks again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good with some flaws.","review":"The multi-plier arrived with a defective set of scissors so I had to immediately send it back at my cost for shipping to Gerber. However, they did promptly fix it and send a replacement. I have used it several times at work and so far its holding up just great - the knife is superbly sharp and the pliers seem very strong. The \\"black film\\" on the hands that some people are experiencing is just the excessive lubrication they put on the tool before shipping to ensure ease of one-handed opening. It's easily wiped off with a rag and can be re-lubricated as necessary. The one-hand opening action varies from easy to stiff from tool to tool and you may have to adjust the sliding screws and add or remove lubricant as necessary, but once tuned it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerber stuff rules","review":"I love anything from the Gerber company! The only issue that I for-see with this product is, the little tip that sticks out past the end of the handle is GOING to eventually dig a little worm hole in the bottom of the holster and you're going to loose it.

What I didn't like about it is, it is much too big and bulky when wearing it. I didn't like the black either as it is hard to see it at night, and the tools are hard to get out of it. If you are planning on using the phillips head screwdriver...forget it! It is paper thin and will just damage the screwhead instead of removing it. I guess they did that to cram more tools into it. Overall I love Gerber tools, however this one did not impress me, I guess I will just get the same old 400 again, It proved itself strong over and over again.

I have been very satisfied with it so far.It does come out of the package heavily coated in thick black grease that gets all over your hands. I wiped down the whole thing with denatured alcohol, then treated it twice with Froglube CLP. Now it works like a champ and slides open like butter. I use Froglube on all my knives and tools to keep them rust free. I agree that this multitool has some sticking at first, but a quick break in and a good coat of CLP really makes a world of difference.

And it is long overdue. The material is not easily accessible save by someone in the field and this compendium is invaluable for a relative outsider aware of this scholarship but unable to proceed into the details. As the author notes, one can only wonder at the influence of the views of Arrow and his followers on a whole generation of students now global executives, stewards of industry, and diplomats. The apparent rigor of this kind of mathematicized sociology hides the often spurious character of these exercises in ideology (with Neo-Classical eonomics the champ in this deceptive vein). The behind the scenes influence of this kind of thinking needs an alertness to its actual effects, which aren't speculative, e.g. the Chinese propaganda system is known to exploit this thinking for its legitimation purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I received the book in new condition and it contains everything I wanted and more.

That maybe Vinnie and Roger from AF decided to help out their young friend and give him some direction seeing as he was starting out so young? Side project my ...! From day one, Madball has been Freddy's band! And so it continues to this day. Representing the best of NYHC and the DMS crew, is MADBALL. They're style and sound is relentless!

As anyone who has ever played in or been involved in the hardcore scene will tell you, putting out an album is really just an excuse for playing live shows at back ally clubs. OK, I guess these guys get props for being in the NYC scene for this long along with Sick of It All and others but sadly, the hayday for this music is long gone.

Hardcore bands don't have to say that they're Hardcore, the just are, and it comes out in the music. Madballs music sounds more like rapcore bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. In \\"Hold It Down\\", they make fun of hardcore bands that make money- what a bunch of hypocrites. Hardcore bands have to make money, so they can eat.

It seems like every East Coast hardcore band owes their life to them. To me, they seem pretty insignificant, given the fact that the band was formed as an Agnostic Front side project [who I feel are much more influential], and there is only one original member left in the band. This just seems silly to be living off of past accomplishments. The music itself is nothing special, it's the same thing Madball's been doing forever, although this stuff sounds a bit more metal than some of their older material.

Closer is a sweet song, but that's about it. The rest of the record is, well ... it just sounds the same.

Unfortunately, beyond the experimentally smooth and subtle 1st track, the project is disappointingly average. The overall tone of the album is dark and moody and can lull you into a \\"zone,\\" which is fine as far as consistency is concerned. However, Gaopele's vocal range is nowhere near stunning - her phrasing and delivery remains the same on nearly every song, her lyrics smack of \\"neo-soul\\" posturing (see musiq) and the melodies are quite monotonous, for the most part in the same key and tempo range. The track with soulive grinding out the groove would be the silver lining, were it not for the gratuitous profanity.Stick with Amel's Bravebird for true soul, and people, let's kill this neo-soul ridiculousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I definitely expected more...","review":"The CD is ok but, it falls way short.

As is mentioned in its pages, you will gather a new understanding of the Way and its meaning each time you pick up this book and seek the Way with all your heart.

The only problem I had with the pillow is that it's bulky and sometimes if I rolled around in bed, I would get caught up in the pillow and you would have to reposition the pillow (It's a BIG pillow). Moving around that much in bed wakes you up, but what is the differnce when you have to get up in the middle of the night (multiple times...) to pee anyway!:) Great productPS: No need to purchase slipcover...it has a nice breathable, machine-washable cover on it to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I have a few issues with this pillow. First, it is really expensive for a body pillow, but I figured Boppy would not steer me wrong. Like other reviewers, I feel that it is not firm enough to support the hips and I just don't find it comfortable enough to use as a neck pillow. Also, there is no cushion for supporting the belly whatsoever, so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this item.I've been sleeping with it for about 2 months now and what I have found helpful is that it prevents me from rolling on my back if I use it with the \\"belly support\\" on my back side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!!!","review":"This pillow is NOT worth the price!!!!!!! It has very little stuffing in it........ Its not very fluffy.......... Kinda flat and it has two different sections. It is not very comfortable and only slightly better than no pillow at all!!!!!!!!Look into better options for the price!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better options out there...........","review":"I had a hard time sleeping well even before I was pregnant ( I have Fibromyalgia), now that I'm in my 7th month it can be nearly impossible to get good sleep. I was hoping that this would help. I bought this with high hopes, but it just didn't help at all. In fact wrestling with it in the middle of the night made things worse! The cover is said to be \\"super soft\\" on the package- NO WAY it feels like sandpaper! I put 2 king size pillow cases over it to fix that, but then it gets even more tangled. There is nothing at all in the middle of the pillow, it's totally flat! I might as well just use two smaller pillows. It also doesn't seem nearly long enough to me, and I'm only 5'2! I'm returing this and getting one of Leachco's designs instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it!","review":"I got this pillow when i was about 5 months pregnant as I could not find any comfortable position to sleep in, i was so excited to get this after ordering it on amazon, but what a disappointment! it barely had any padding inside, and it would flatten with a simple touch. I am 5'5 and weight about 145 back then, and by no means was I THAT big that the pillow would just flatten between my legs. I ended up just using king size pillows which did the job better than this, i think this was a waste and the shape kind of sucks too. They could totally improve the shape and padding on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat after a couple weeks :(","review":"I wouldn't say that I'm a larger gal, but after only a few weeks, I could half this pillow into a standard pillowcase! It was great at first for my 5'4\\" frame, but I may be going back to my old body pillow now. Not really worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost its loft within a couple weeks","review":"If you weigh more than 100 lbs prior to your pregnancy, don't purchase this pillow. I purchased it to change from being a stomach to a side sleeper. However, I have four months to go in my pregnancy and am having hip pain. I have written a letter to Boppy, but have received no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, saggy, and expensive","review":"I don't even know what to say. This pillow is so bad! It's too flat to align hips. Awkward under my head, probably too flat there. There is no stuffing where the pillow lies at my stomach so it is useless to support my belly. Quite honestly, I'm not sure what Boppy is thinking on this one.I ended up with a snoogle and LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money.. the good reviews must have been written the first few days...","review":"At first I loved loved loved this pillow. It was comfty, perfect support.. it was wonderful. In less than a month it lost its shape, the filling inside the pillow became seperated and now my boppy is floppy. It was soooo not worth the $50+ i spent on this. I am extremely disappointed. Do not waste your money on this one.. go get another brand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The key to a good night's sleep","review":"I have been using this pillow for the past 5 months now (since my 4th month of pregnancy) and I can't say enough good things about it. Prior to using this pillow, I bought an expensive dual pillow (two pillows connected in the center) from The Company Store and hated it. It took up way too much room in the bed, made me WAY too hot at night, and did nothing to help my back pain. The larget part of the Boppy pillow cradles my stomach and I sleep with the smaller part between my upper legs. I can no longer fall asleep without the pillow and on the few occasions I've had to travel and sleep without it I wake up with terrible back pain. I would highly recommend this pillow to anyone going through pregnancy!BTW, I disagree with the comments about this pillow being low quality - I've washed the pillow several times and it comes out nice & fluffy. The pillow case also washes nicely - it gets softer with each washing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable book","review":"A very enjoyable book about love, romance, family and self-esteem.

It is really easy to remove ice from the tray by pressing from behind because the tray is just so flexible. On the other hand, the tray tends to be harder to fill in with water than standard trays because the small ice pockets are not interconnected like it happens in most ice trays, so you can't just hold it close to the faucet and let it fill in by itself. You need to keep moving it around so that it fills completely. This is not something that really bothers me, but it is does not make my life easy either. Anyway, it is a very good ice tray. Its flexibility in removing ice compensates it is supposedly difficulty in being filled with water."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and fun","review":"Loved serving drinks with these heart shaped ice cubes.

I broke down and bought it for him. It was difficult to put together, but well worth it. He plays for hours and hours preparing and serving food. He also loves the cash register on it and is learning about paying for things as well as cooking and serving. It is a little bit flimsy, but it's been holding up pretty well. I would recommend this for preschoolers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare your children for their futures","review":"Prepare your children for their futures by buying them this toy. Set them up for success so that they can role play to prepare as a future member of the McDonald's work force.

If you want your child to grow up obese then this is the toy for you!

It was a \\"good-guess\\", because he said the three of them enjoy both A&E & the Biography Channel at home. He married my husband's niece a little more than a year ago. We see them so seldom, I don't feel like I know him very well. I also think that their daughter, who is in second grade now, will soon be writing reports for school & this program could be a good reference for her studies. Old Ben is a \\"colorful\\" character & this program does him justice. I enjoy this TV series & the program \\"crams\\" a lot of information into 45 minutes!

But, in truth, this record is more than that, one of 96's standout tracks, Mouth, think you've never heard it, then think again.

It has warnings about not getting it on your skin or eyes and not breathing it. How are you supposed to not breathe it if you put it in your humidifier?

May you be blessed and encourged. I got my sister one and we are doing it together at our own pace and reviewing it long distance via the phone.

I could find no answers because everything was just surface studies. This book goes deep and I am finally understanding myself. I am understanding my past and how it has effected me now. It has given me the tools to move beyond the past and focus on changing myself now. I would not recommend doing this study alone. The past can be painful and it has been so helpful to have the other ladies in my bible study to discuss each issue and also the prayers and support by safe, caring people is invaluable.

My experience with the costomer service line was beyond frustrating--from the horrible and inaccurate menu to the customer service agents who are not able to adequately communicate with the callers beyond the scripted situations they are trained for.

I was on the edge of buying the C.D, but after a quick taster of the tracks, I was disgusted. None of the songs had the same spirit as the originals and most of the songs are sung by punk bands that sing the track out of synch and at double speed! I agree remakes should be crafted into the style of the band remaking the tracks, but they should be done with passion, experience and commitment at least (Take \\"White Lines\\" by DD!) I was really let down by the great songs on offer, ruined without consideration for real DD fans like myself. They don't even sound like the originals!I wish it was good, but it wasn't.

Alain Le Beau (Allan the Beautiful) had aspiring dreams of becoming an architect and was a highly intelligent human being who paid for his education by becoming a porno star. Unfortunately, his downfall was that he knew he was going to grow old and committed suicide. I did not go to see a porn film and thank Willima Jones for allowing me to view the human and compassionate side of the porno star. What Jones has done now is immortalized Lambert the second time around in this film, Lambert's first immortalization occured on celluloid with his porno appearances.

This collar features a broad ovoid tab as the latching mechanism, and it's just hands above the snap latches on other collars. Unfortunately, the reflective material, which to me is as much a safety requirement at a reliable latch, quickly faded and the adhesive holding the reflective fabric fails, rendering the nice and otherwise durable collar ineffective within a few months. When new, the reflective material was easily bright enough to spot a kitty in the dark at a 100 yards with a single bulb AA LED flashlight, so no problem being visible in car headlights. Without the same reflective material, the cat is invisible under the same conditions. The snug latch releases easily when torqued from the side as it would when caught on a passing object or brush.

Some songs survive; they don't fall into this trap, like \\"Stars\\" and \\"Stop, Time\\" both of which I found actually moving, in a \\"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown\\" kinda way.

Mr. White's journal was well juxtaposed with the tale of Wesley Horner, the down-on-his-luck cop who arrested him. The two interrelated tales work well together to really make the reader think about issues of love and loss, truth and fiction, and the nature of human freedom.

This becomes problematic with the weight of the attachment. It fell out over and over while vacuuming the rugs. Black and Decker could have easily solved this by making it a secured attachment on the end of the vacuum, click into place if you will. Without it it just keeps falling out rendering it useless.

Proofreading is one of the important skills that a lawyer needs to master. It is difficult to teach proofreading, however, particularly when we are also teaching large-scale format of legal memoranda and other documents, fundamental legal research skills, and effective communication of legal analysis.I wouldn't assign this book to my entire class, but every semester or so there is always a student (or two) who needs to learn the importance of proofreading (and time-management in writing). This book provides 185 pages (plus an index) of materials on proofreading. The book isn't really for those who are seeking careers as professional proofreaders, but it should be helpful to many writers who need to pay more attention to their writing.I'd also recommend a good grammar book and a dictionary as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"This book will show you how to become a first rate proofreader.

So these days when nuclear energy is in question, when projects for building dams are also rejected by the noisy handful of environmentalist, when fossil fuel it is being depleted, you wonder where the you know what you get energy to supply the billions souls of this earth -that's the reason to read more about fusion! which by the way, still lies in diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disapontment","review":"I figured that for this price the improvements would be huge, but no.

I give it only four stars because you do have to put it together - which wasn't difficult, just annoying, because it oscillates whether you want it to or not, and because on the highest speed it has a slight rattle.

It was about as noisy as other small table fans I've bought. Not terrible, but certainly not the soft hush I had hoped for.

As a consequence pieces don't snap together as cleanly as they should. The fan is nosier than other desk fans I have, but it does also move more air than quieter models. As another reviewer pointed out the vertical distance from the fan guard to the base is shorter than depicted. Therefore, it is difficult to reach the knob to change the fan speed. The inability to tilt the fan up and down decreases the fan's usefulness. I will definitely not buy another fan from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super quiet, Great Value!","review":"I had this thing out of the box, assembled, and plugged in in less than two minutes.

How horrible it must have been for Judys child, parents and siblings. They have to relive this tragedy daily. The fact is, its very disturbing this author is making money at this familys expense.

Each song is great stuff... good riffs and solos... and even some catchiness like Forever Hate You and Worst Enemy. Only complaint I have about this is the ending part of the last track... squealing pigs don't do it for me *sorry*. And the songs are short... but Deicide's known for that. I don't know why people bash this album and others by Deicide so much... the lyrics are expected to be about Satan and violence against God (after all... Deicide DOES mean \\"killing of God\\").

I don't really like any of the other Deicide albums and I only bought the ones I have because a friend said they were insanely awesome.

The music is a good blend of energizing and soothing tracks blending musical elements of ambient, New Age, and smooth jazz, all of which are evocative and capable of sparking the imagination. These serve well as both \\"listening\\" music (for those who wish to sit back and appreciate the music itself, whether on a technical level or an imaginative one) and as background music for reading, driving, etc. Most of these would provide a good soundtrack for a drive or hike through forests and mountains, whether intentionally (as when visiting a park) or simply because that's where you're driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winston Please","review":"While I think that the Taliesin Orchestra is a very talented group, I really prefer the Winston originals over the Forbidden Forest interpretations which I find somewhat ersatz and grandiose and lacking Winston's natural simplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"...10 STARS IF IT WERE INSTRUMENTAL","review":"these albums should be released with the instrumental tracks!!as hard as i try, i just can't get into these type of raps over this type of music. the raps are totally random. in my opinion, the music is totally spoiled.then again, it's my opinion.good lookin & lookin good need to re-release these and other jams as instrumentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"It came with no CD","review":"I was aware that I was buying a second hand item.

With the two bishonen on the cover, the exciting set up and the word \\"gay\\" repeated more than once (although unfortunately in reference to \\"gay Paris\\") on the back cover, I am sorry to say that my hopes were too high for this manga. For a yaoi enthusiast like myself, this story is at best, a tease. At worst, it's downright dull. I'm leaning toward the latter, unfortunately.Although the art is great (hence the second star), the story is pretty boring, that is, not enough to keep me interested without at least even a hint at yaoi. Which there pretty much isn't. So maybe if I was new to yaoi or manga in general I might have enjoyed this, but the plot line is sketchy, the characters nonexistant except for the antagonist, and no boylove to speak of!! *sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable selection of chamber music, and as one reviewer previously noted, a perfect accompaniment to a quiet evening.

My nephew can sometimes shoot the gun (he is very muscular) and my niece can not shoot it at all (she is tiny). You have to have a good amount of arm strength to shoot these. They have like a pump-n-shoot style and a lot of resistance. They are more for a 10 year old boy or older. After awhile the pump-n-shoot gets kind of old too."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive box","review":"The box says for ages 6 and up. The gun uses an air pressure pop-gun type mechanism to fire the balls.I don't think there are many 6 year olds on the planet who can make this gun fire. You have to manually pump up enough pressure to force the balls to pop out. It takes way too much strength for young kids.Overall the toy was a big disappointment to our kids. It would probably be a fine toy for kids over 8.I would have no problem with this item if the packaging was more honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain safe fun","review":"Although this is not a true educational toy, it is a safe way to teach children about handling a gun without them or our house being destroyed. It is a load of fun and has provided hours of delight for grandchildren and their friends at our home. It seems that shooting a gun is a natural curiosity for children and this has provided an avenue for that curiosity. Of course, the Nerf toys have always been a preference for us and so one more is always welcome. There does not seem to be an age range for this item!! Even grandpa gets in on the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, safe, but takes some strength","review":"It's a fun toy that's not going to put out any eyes or bust up your house, but the pump-action firing mechanism seems to take a lot of upper body strength. My nieces are 4 and 6, and pretty fit for little kids. The 6-year-old can just barely muster the muscle to pop off a shot if she grits her teeth, squeeeeeeeezes 'til she's purple, and doesn't bother trying to aim at anything. The 4-year-old? Well, she's figured out that she can make it shoot if she braces the gun against the floor and pushes down. But then, more often then not, she shoots herself in the face, so it's kind of a wash.It's a fun, safe toy, and the blue Nerf \\"ammo\\" balls are large and conspicuous enough that they're not going to get lost too easily. I'd recommended it for kids who are a little older, though. From my observations, you'd have to be one buff 6-year-old to have an easy time with this gun's pump-fire action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children","review":"Bought this for my 6 yr old grandson.

It was pretty sturdy, and had a fairly high rate of fire for a Nerf gun (Up to 2 rds. per sec.). It's also probably one of the loudest Nerf guns out there, which can make it good for a surprise blitz attack, but not very good for a stealth hunt. The only problems I had with this gun were 1. It doesn't have a trigger (I hate guns with no triggers, the're so unrealistic), and 2. It only has a range of about 10 feet, which makes it useful for close-range indoor combat, but TERRIBLE at long-range and sniper combat. In conclusion, you would probably be better off with a NERF Crossfire or Maverick than this bulky, short-range gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to load balls","review":"This is a poorly designed toy.

The foam balls fit so tightly in the chamber that it takes Herculean strength to get them to pop out. He had to hold the blaster against his abdomen and use both hands to try to fire the balls, and he still couldn't do it. Even the adults present had a hard time with it. Nerf toys have always been pretty good, but pick another model or style of Nerf blaster. All this toy does is aggravate the user."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH YOUR FINGERS","review":"My son will be 5 years old.

And I admit that I am a little familiar with the Scottish history of the period. But, even without those advantages, I found the book to be outstanding.The author brought the characters to vivid life--both the good guys and the bad guys. He provided a realistic description of the ways of life in Scotland around 1300.

She loves the kitchen set. After my husband put the set together my daughter played with it immediately.

Well I find the kitchen to be sturdy, all the parts are working the door stays shut while cooking the sweets change colors, if the kitchen is put together correctly everything will work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad Santa","review":"My daughter had expressed months ago that she wanted the Sweet Magic Kitchen for Christmas. I wasn't convinced that she wanted this particular kitchen until she wrote her letter to Santa . I had a very difficult time finding the particular kitchen. Assembly was easy. The plastice was very flimsy,the overn door would not stay shut and the refrigeator door would not stay on the hindges. The ice tray that fits in the oven was most distrubing. After one hour of fun suddenly the treats she was baking and inside of the oven was filled with water. I forgot about the ice in the tray melting. We had to wait until the ice froze again to cook the treats by oven. Now my child doesnt want to use the oven because she is afriad that water will drip on her treats. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another kitchen option","review":"I just wanted to thank those of you who took the time leaving your comments. If I was up to my husband we would of bought this,he has the idea that with price means quality that it is the best. Which we all want the best for our kiddos. I liked the Little Tikes Tender Heart Tea Party kitchen, which is cheaper. I read the reviews here on both to make my choice. We went with the Tea party kitchen, best choice ever. It is less expensive yet better. When I went to buy it, it is so popular I got the last one at a [local store]. That tells me something considering there were several left of this kitchen. I'd highly recommend the Little tikes kitchen anyday.Hope this helps~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent kitchen!","review":"My daughters have had this kitchen for several years and it has held up incredibly well. I know some of the other reviewers were disappointed when they took it out of the box and returned it but they did not give it a chance. My kids have put it through the most strenuous tests and it has been very sturdy and everything still works on in. They weren't too excited with the \\"cooking\\" you could do with it (done by freezing a water unit and circulating cool air) but have used it daily to create their own masterpieces. The music it plays when something is cooking can be kind of annoying to an adult and that explains why I have not gotten around to purchasing new batteries for it when the old ones wore out....I will eventually but I just needed a break :-) The best part of it is how compact it is and will fit in the smallest of bedrooms or look great in the largest toyroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My twins love this kitchen!!!","review":"I am surprised by the other online reviews that give the impression that this kitchen is poorly made. It is not made of the same plastic as Little Tikes kitchens, but it is a very nicely designed kitchen. I have 3 year old boy/girl twins, and we initially bought this as a Christmas gift for my girl twin. Of course, as with everything else, they both play with it. My boy twin is fairly rough with the kitchen; he pushes it across the room and slams the oven and refrigerator doors and it has still held up. The kitchen comes with a lot of cute accessories including pretend food, dishes, and also pretend pastries that change color when you take them out of the oven (there is a cooling mechanism within the oven that causes this color-changing effect). The oven also plays music and makes a \\"cooking\\" sound when the dial is turned. Overall this is a very nice kitchen for the price. We also purchased a separate set of play food from Target for my twins to use with the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to hear about other peoples experience with this toy","review":"I am so glad I took the time to read the reviews from other consumers about this kitchen.

After playing with this with her Christmas morning I wasn't sure if I had read the right reviews. My six and eight yr old love it!We have had no problems with our doors falling off or breaking and she has played with it non-stop. I wonder if Fisher Price should rethink the age on this.There is an ice chamber in the oven that needs to be frozen, then put in the oven for the cookies to be able to change color. My daughter being six knows exactly when it needs to go back in the freezer to refreeze.(It gets a little messy when it melts completely) I personally think this is the cutest kitchen on the market.

We had no problem assembling it. It took about 20 minutes. We had all the pieces & no broken parts. She loves it and plays with it every day! The color change is very subtle but she doesn't care. Most often she plays without the frozen part needed to get the color change. I would not reccomend it for a child under 4. There are lots of small pieces that are really pretty and very cool but are potential choking hazzards. And although it is sturdy enough, it's not made for a young toddler's lack of coordination and sometimes unneccesary roughness. If we had purchased this 2 years ago, it would probably be in pieces.All in all, it's a little girl's dream kitchen complete with pastels and sprinkles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS KITCHEN!!!","review":"I purchased this kitchen and it is just so so cute!!

Yes, the food is precious and quite durable, but the inner workings are a different story. We bought this for our daughter this Christmas and once the kitchen was assembled, we realized that it was broken. It didn't play music nor did the fan work which would blow onto the food to change the color. So, we now have a kitchen that does nothing special. We could have bought another name brand for cheaper if we would have known this. We're totally disappointed in the customer service of Fisher Price as well. When we called to voice our complaint, they offered to send the replacement parts, but they won't be in until two months from now. So now our daughter cannot fully enjoy her new kitchen.

Not all the food turns colors and some will not stay changed for very long at all. You need to put the cooking tray as close to the ice tray as possible to get the food to turn colors. The icing bag really doesn't work at all. We have actually taken a piece of ice and used it to get the food to change colors. It is more of an effort to get the food to change than what you are led to believe. The kitchen does come with lots of accessories. If you don't really care too much about the color changing process you will have lots of fun with this kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Kitchen","review":"We bought this for our 2 year old.

Ms. Townsend's issues clearly go way beyond being TS. And, despite being brutally blunt about the seedier side of her life, the reader somehow gets the feeling that she's still not being totally candid!The big lesson here for a young TS is to avoid sex work...also, try to avoid sex work.

Far to dark to ever get much radio play it seems to sadly remain an obscure masterpiece.Every song on this album is perfect. The song writing, structure and melody lines are on par with the beatles IMO but the subject matters dive into the darkest aspects of modern emotional life.The anger and contempt ooze from the speakers. If you can ever see holly live, do it. Drive 300 miles if you must. The power of her voice is never quite captured when recorded. The last time i seen her live she was playing to about 30 people and even then was singing with such intensity at times she pierced the ear and drowned out the entire band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than JOBST at 1/3 the PRICE.","review":"I used to pay $40.00 to $60.00 or more for a pair of good compression stockings in the 20-30mmg range for brands like Jobst until I discovered Truform about four years ago.

I pretty much just completely avoided my kitchen for a week because I was so skeeved out by the little critter invading my home. I went to the local discount store to find a solution and one of the clerks suggested these pellets. They were only .59 cents each so I figured it was well work a shot.I bought a couple and put them behind my stove and refrigerator. These things work incredibly fast because I never heard from the critters again after I put down the poison.I now live in the country, which I won't be for long since discovering field mice are a big thing down here, but in the meantime I will be getting myself more of these pellets.Some people are against the whole poison thing, well I am not one of those people, as long as you don't have small children or animals who may come in contact with the poison."},{"rating":"1","title":"old model - buy the newer one","review":"This is the original splitter from iGo.

So my review is:-Do not waste your money on this!My guess is that because the information is over 2k years old it's copyright free right? If so then you could also photocopy most things in this book, use artistic license to change things around a bit and sell your own photocopied \\"book\\" for $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"read reviews before you buy","review":"I wish had read the reviews prior to my purchase now. I received this item today and when I opened the box it was nothing more than a few pages of photocopied paper with a single staple in the top left corner holding it together. The seals on the parchment are ok i guess, but a few of the seals are not printed squarely on the page and a portion of the seals are cut off making some incomplete. Also the quality of the print is not good on most of the seals.. some of the markings and writing are very unclear.Save yourself some money and do not purchase this, unless you have the money to waste and just want some very basic eye candy for your magickal library.

Reality is this a small fan, with a very small motor. It does OK for it's size, but does not move what I would consider all that much air even on high. Is it noisy, yeah a little, not unexpected given it's price range.The owners manual gives diagrams for air circulation for whole rooms, up and down stairs, etc. That idea is extraordinarily optimistic considering the lack of power for this fan.This fan should really be considered a cubicle fan, better then the clip on fans costing one half as much, but certainly far short of the oscillating table fans you can get for just a few dollars more. Unless you like overrated mediocrity, there are better choices.Which brings me back to the fan description itself, \\"Super Turbo High Performance\\" is either hilarious or a sick joke.

There is a lot of razzle dazzle with military terms and vocabulary, but it hinders the book more than it helps. I would not put this book in the same category as Tom Clancy, it doesn't belong there.

Vividly described is a surprise attack on the West coast of the United States by millions of Chinese which caught us anaware even though China was under constant satellite surveillance. This chilling scenario was described so vividly that it brought chills to my spine. We are given insight into the thinking and plans of both the communist and American leadership.

It takes place in the year 2007, with Communist China as our nemesis. A war veteran or military buff would really enjoy the detailed action accounts.

Trinity Roots are an exceptional and unique creative force. A core of three musicians who play with passion and take the listener into their big beating hearts and the soaring soul of their land.

Maori music meets roots in a swirling tide of sonic bass sounds, threading guitar, vocals and then underpinning it the build up of drums. This is not quite there with \\"True\\" but is different enough to be an extension of their work. It does have the beautiful title track \\"Home, Land and Sea\\" the hypnotic \\"Egos\\" and the soulful organ driven love song \\"Angelsong\\". All are well crafted songs, high quality and rare.

The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible and cash in on the series. I see no reason why \\"The Indwelling\\" and \\"Assassins\\" couldn't have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward in the later books in the series is rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other.

I had to order them special after I tripped over a old review . They were written over 10 years ago. However, I noticed in BN a few weeks ago, they have been re-released in hard back.

I agree that this series should have been done in say 6 or even 9 books instead of 12.However, this is the best novel in the series I have read since about the 6th book. This book has action, suspense, and people die for it. In this book you witness much more first hand how people are willing to die for God, and you also see the reality some people who already took the mark who realize they made the wrong choice and there is nothing they can do about it. And the ending is something you won't expect.This book gave me a little bit of renewed faith for the final book. However, after 12 books, I'm glad that it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I can't believe people are gripping about this book and this series. I love the series! This is one of the best spiritual fiction books out there and lot's of people are getting saved from it. I'm at a place right now were people have nothing else to do but read books and a lot of them are reading the Left Behind series. I would rather they read those than the Harry Potter novels.Anywho, Armageddon kept me off the seat! Lots of action as the Trib Force members try to rendezvous at their new camp site. I can't wait till the next book when Christ comes back and battles off Carpathia. That man needs to go DOWN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best !!!","review":"This is the beast book in all the books of left behind. It tells you just about every thing. and it is sad with who dies and we meet some new people and some fall in love and some hearts are broking i reckinmind this book for every left behind book lovers and book lovers"},{"rating":"1","title":"these books are tribulation enough!","review":"This is my first online review so I'll be breif. The Left behind series is awful. just plain awful. Armageddon is a case in point. Jenkins should go back to school and learn how to write. he spends half the book drawing out a simple plot that should have been covered in 2 chapters. the rest of the book is not stop preaching. BORING! the end was hopelessly confusing and made no sense. I will not even buy book #12 but I will rent it from the Library. I have better junk to waste money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Evangelistic Tool!","review":"While many Christians have different ideas about exactly how the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will occur, there is a clear consensus that He IS returning! This book continues the powerful, evangelistic series of LaHaye and Jenkins, describing the experiences of the Tribulation Force leading up to the Battle of Armageddon. The word pictures are vivid, the characters are well-developed, and the plot is captivating. This series has compelled many persons to become disciples of Jesus Christ.I have read all of the published titles, and a few of the later volumes dragged in their pace. This edition returns to the original intensity of the earlier works. For persons who are familiar with the characters Rayford, Chloe, Buck, Tsion, etc., the twists and turns of this latest release should definitely NOT be missed!If you enjoyed the \\"Left Behind\\" series overall, you will LOVE this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Armagarbage","review":"More than the series, I have most enjoyed reading the reviews. Some are much better written than the Left Behind books. Since no one had given No. 11 one star, I just had to give my two-cents worth. Yes, I have read some of the series. Enough already. Not only are the books literary garbage--even many of the four and five-star reviews agree on that point--but the theology proclaimed by the series is weak, to put it nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I think people do not realize","review":"Is that the basic premise of these books is not Biblical according to II Thes. I had to go to my Pastor after reading the first one, and he re-assured me I was right.The Bible tells us that if we have had a chance to become saved before the rapture and did not take that opportunity, there will not be another (except for the number of Jews mentioned in the Bible). So, the main guy, and his daughter would not have been saved, neither would the pastor of their church or so many others.I have stayed far away from this series so as not to confuse myself with what the books teach vs. what the Word of God actually says!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My god! I think you are all mad.","review":"Trying to relate some nonsense fiction to the fates and realities of real living people is ludicrous. Either all of you guys are at the far left on the bell curve or you are misfortunate enough to have been raised as a fundamentalist.The bible was written by men and the koran was written by men. So please use your heads people and get in touch with reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind series: Books 1 through 4","review":"I was given the 1st book in the series as a free gift in the store 'Books-A-Million'. I read it out of curiousity, having heard so much about being \\"left behind\\". Still curious, I bought books 2 and 3 and was given book 4. After reading the anti Catholic crap in those books, I decided to throw them away and not make the Authors any richer. I do not believe in \\"rapture\\" and think it is a very selfish theory. I don't think the author is very Christian to knock other religions. All Christians believe in one God and Jesus Christ. As long as we follow their teachings, we will see heaven. Maybe this world would be better off if we all just except our differences and love one another."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Left Behind Series in NOT GOING TO HAPPEN","review":"I do not believe that the themes explored in the Left behind series will ever take place. God is loving, He just wouldn't do that what is described in these books. In fact I do not believe that the Lord will come again in person, but he will come again in a new understanding of his Word (the Bible). This new understanding is accessible in the New Church, a New Christianity. Based on the teachings of the Old and New Testaments and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg. To find out more about these amazing teachings of a New Christianity, check out www.newchurch.org"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush's Bedtime Reading","review":"This is an ideal way to see into the mind of the right-wing Christian fundamentalist who is running this country.This book is dangerous escapist nonsense which peddles fear and bigotry to a population that ought to know better. If the right wing put more money into education, perhaps people would see through this claptrap and think for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just how far can you stretch 10 pages of the bible...","review":"I really enjoyed the first 5 books or so of this series - but after that point they describe in 200 pages what could be done in 10. Armageddon is just another example of this. The \\"plot\\" was half baked and often pointless and the ending was just agony. In addition, the main characters do things completely out of character and for little to no reason. I almost tossed the book out the nearest window!! (But it was a library book so I thought better of that idea.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Padding Than A Sealy Posturepedic","review":"From the first book to the latest, it's evident that the authors had one thing in mind: Money. The entire series could have been condensed into three (at the most) books. LOTS of padding. To demonstrate; While reading a chapter, I stopped halfway through and started reading the next chapter. Once I finished it, I went back and completed the previous chapter. The result? I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING RELEVANT TO THE STORY!The story is good, but the writing is horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother when others do it so much better?","review":"Left Behind is a fairly decent series, but that's all. The writing is pedestrian and the theological concepts almost nonexistent. I could understand why people bought this series when it ws the best there was to offer, but now, with We All Fall Down, The Christ clone books, and Conquest of Paradise, all of which are simply much better books, why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, somebody make them stop","review":"The series that started out with such a compelling story has eroded badly with the last three or four volumes, and \\"Armageddon\\" (volume 11) continues the downward spiral. Characters with story lines that span multiple volumes suddenly make ridiculous decisions that end their lives, but miraculously, a new and previously unknown character emerges from nowhere with a perfect set of highly specialized skills to replace them. Please give me a break. The plot moves forward in fits and jerks (one chapter actually begins with something like \\"Five months later...\\"). I was intrigued with the authors' interpretation of the End Times as the series begun, so I will grudgingly follow this through to its conclusion -- as long as the rumors are true that the next volume is truly the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Never Ends","review":"This series of books just keeps going on and on with no end in site. The story gets weaker and weaker with each book. When the authors started making money with the series they obviously decided to stretch the series out as long as possible to reap all the money they could. I've seen this happen to other series I've read, and they have taken what was a great start and instead of finishing it they put it on life support and let it turn into a vegetable. Do us all a favor and pull the plug!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Series Only Worsens","review":"I don't know why I keep reading these books. The first two in the series were actually interesting. The ensuing books in the series have only gotten worse as time wears on.What a HUGE disappointment. My cat could write a better book.The Seven Years of the Tribulation is such an awesome topic! These two clowns have managed to complete adulterate it. Tim Lahaye is such a disappointment.I'd give this book no stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vendor","review":"This book came with no dust jacket, and the vendor sent me several e-mails to make sure that I knew that. In my humble opinion they went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that I was aware of this fact. My book arrived in great condition and I am reading it now. Thank you for doing a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book since the first one.","review":"I flew through the first 250 pages in I think about 3 days. LOVE the Left Behind series, this book has me excited about being a Christian again! This book was very hard for me to put down.Non-Stop action like and good Clancy book, plenty of Biblical references for those that doubt God's love for them. Grateful I don't have to wait a year like other readers for the Glorious Appearing to come out, I picked up the series at the right time.Do I sound like a Bible thumper yet, apologize if I do, but don't mind being called a Jesus Freak either...Odd how this series grew on me, even from the beginning of the series I said to myself \\"Great I get to red Christian related stuff -like reading the bible without having to read the Bible.\\" Enjoying the Word of God w/o having to REALLY read His Words... Now that I'm almost through with the series I almost look forward to reading the Bible..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book was great","review":"This series just keeps getting better, it amazing how they show people the events in revalation. they tell the story in away that makes sense for today. it also helps to point out that Christian authors can be as succesful as non-christian authors. the important thing to remember is that the books are fiction, they are the way the authors chose to portrait events from the bible. so you can't be critical of every action in the books. if u want to read the writting its about read the book of revalations in the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armageddon: The Cosmic Battle of the Ages","review":"I loved the first five books of the series. Then it started to drag. I kept up with it though, because I knew how it was going to end.Armageddon, was the best book so far. I couldn't put it down. It is almost as if the first five books and this one were written by a one author, and books 6-10 were written by a different one.At any rate, I am glad I didn't give up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Only Took Me 2 Days to READ!!","review":"I thought Armageddon was very good. For change, the book wasn't overly drawn out. For awhile there, it did seem that Chole, Buck, Tsion and Rayford were going to survive until the Glorious Appearance, but, lucky you will have to read it for yourself. I would rate this book as a MUST READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO so.","review":"I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then \\"the False Prophet\\")People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"That will be enough guys....","review":"Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Lahaye, please stop pumping out this crap. This is like a bad Michael Crichton/Clive Cussler series for southern fundie conservatives. You're making Americanized christianity into an even bigger joke than it already is.I have a Newsflash for you Left Behind fans: People of all cultures all over the world have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning, and you know what? It hasn't happened yet, nor will it happen for a long time, and it definitely isn't going to happen like this. The fate of the human race doesn't rest on Judeo-Christian beliefs anymore than it does on New Age ones. Give it up already."},{"rating":"1","title":"FICTION, pure and simple","review":"It disturbs me that many people seem to take these books literally, which is why I gave it only 2 stars . . . a good, thrilling, FICTIONAL representation of revelation, yet it is in FACT, fiction, people. Please stop saying things like the books make you feel happy you're \\"SAVED\\". People who \\"BELIEVE\\" in these book also probably believe WMD's will be found . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever (in this series)","review":"Lamest plot line so far. Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens at the beginning of the book.How can the authors possibly have Chloe go outside without a phone or radio? The set up was incredibly lame. What are editors for? Couldn't they have come up with a better way to have another exciting situation?The first two books were fantastic; the rest have just milked it. The crass commercialization of the series has served to offset much of the good message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Move It Along Shall We?","review":"I have read every book in the series, so far, but my patience is wearing thin. Tyndale et al. are milking their cash cow for all its worth.From book six on the authors have been dragging their heels, by either having the characters become moody and self-absorbed for pages on end. Or they start ridiculous cliff-hangers with characters refusing to answer their cell-phones and other rot.I have read this series for two reasons. One is see pre-millenialism fleshed out. Two is to see some interesting characters say and do some provocative things that might challenge my thinking.But its starting to get pretty clunky.Advance the plot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the others","review":"Book number 11 in the Left Behind series. The writing, as in all the books, is simplistic and easy to follow, written at probably an 8th grade level.This one brings us to the battle of Armageddon and closer to the Glorious Appearing.If you're like me you read the last book last year and you probably have a fuzzy memory of where it left off. It took me a few chapters before I finally remembered what was going on with whom and where.If you are a fan of the series you will enjoy it.Now we just have to wait another year for the final book...This book brings you right up to the day off or maybe the day before the second coming of Christ. As I read and I realized how close the action was to that point, I thought that maybe this was the last book. But no. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armageddon: The Cosmic Battle of the Ages","review":"This book, like the past few, has been a big disappointment. This series started off with a bang, it was very exciting and a real page turner but the authors have lost the original tempo of the series and now it has become very preachy and long winded. The whole story line of the characters has become incredibly hokey. I use to recommend this series to people but now I can't without warning them about how bad the last few books have been. I think they could have wrapped this series up a couple of books ago but it looks to me as if it has been dragged on so they can sell more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say.","review":"The last two books in this series have volumes of scripture in LaHayes and Jenkins attempt to use The Word as a way to create character development. They don't do a good job. I guess I am like the marathon runner. After spending so much time with the other books in the series, I felt forced to continue with the current edition.This book's ending was very poorly conceived. It felt like the bell rang in an exam and everyone had to put down their pencils. Like most good things, there is time to call it a night."},{"rating":"2","title":"spritually lifting","review":"All of the Left Behind series are excellent reads. If you are rooted / grounded in the Lord Jesus, this will help you witness/ have an assurance that you won't be left behind. A MUST read series."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this book finally in the end times?","review":"When I first started reading this series, I could not stop. I was literally addicted.. I went from one book to the next loving every moment. I just loved the feasible storyline and characters Jenkins and Lahaye created to go along with Revelations. From Book one to eight were wonderful! Then.. Desecration came out.. it was still fairly good.. but it was definitely a disappoitment compared to the previous books.. So. i anxiously awaited book #10. the remnant figuring it would be back up to par. Wrong! IT was horrible. the whole book was nearly pointless! but yet again since i had loved the series in the past I went right on hoping that Armageddon would be better. Yet again I am deprived. I think that Jenkins and Lahaye just lost hold of the masterpiece that they started because they ran out of ideas and imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear, please save us....","review":"This series started out very well. I remember reading that the Left Behind books were going to be limited to seven. Well, I guess the authors found a lot of money. The story lines are getting old and the books are getting more painful to read.Overall, the book is \\"okay.\\" It's just getting old. Now I'm hearing that book 12 is the last one. Please, please, please let it be the last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book of the Series Thus Far...Only One More To Go","review":"The absolute worst of the series. The book starts with some good action and some slight character development - a big change from the disappointment that Book Ten was. However, halfway through the book, it changes from a decent book into nothing more than an extremely preachy bible tract. The character development goes right out the window, the plot development resembles something closer to a ride at Disneyland than a rolling, churning adventure at the End Times. Absolutely disappointing work from these two authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement on the last","review":"I thought that Armageddon was an improvement over the last Left Behind book, The Remnant. I enjoyed that the authors are speeding things up(no, not with action, I mean time-wise)and I thought that the book had some of the spark from the first few Left Behind books. Overall, it was a quick and enjoyable read, and I think the series is ready to be over with the next book.MY GRADE: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"LaHaye and Jenkins have done it again! Although I was reading fiction, I felt inspired as though I were reading the Holy Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armageddon","review":"The 11th book in the Left Behind series picks right up where The Remnant left off. Like all of the others in this series, I found it to be a page turner that I could not put down.Fans of the series won't be disappointed, and the story takes some twists and turns along the way that I found unexpected.I don't know if there is going to be another book in this series, because it really didn't state whether it would or not. If not, then they did a fine job ending the tale.Recommend the entire series to anyone, especially any Christians who have not read the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again...","review":"Isn't this...over yet? Unable to look away, I picked this up and read most of it at my local grocery store. I was just curious to see if hyperconservatives LaHaye and Jenkins were finally going to end this ... series, which will likely be longer than the complete works of Robert Jordan by the time it's done. Alas, no.Once again, the \\"final battle\\" is put off for a future volume. Once again, the margins are enormous and the print is huge, so tiny-brained ... can think they're reading a big kids' book with chapters and everything.Once again, the writing is done on a third-grade level so there aren't any pesky \\"big words\\" to get in the way of the so-called gospel truth.... The only things worse than these books are the movies based on 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title Is A Misprint....","review":"It should read \\"Comic\\" Battle. This book reads like a comic book moving from frame to frame at a jagged pace with characters acting irrationally throughout. The problem is there's no pictures! I agree with another reviewer. If the writers ( I should say millionares) stretched this out about 50 more pages they could end this once and for all. But let's go for the even dozen and a few more dollars. Of course you have to read it...you're hooked. But once you're finished you'll realize you're a few hours older and a lot less wiser. If you really want \\"the battle of the ages\\" watch the first Frazier vs. Ali fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this WAY behind","review":"Each time a book in this series has come out lately, I have renewed hope that it will grab me. The last 50 pages or so did get me, but generally this was a disappointment. The story lines are very forced. The characters do completely illogical and irrational things and then are surprised when something goes wrong.With another 50 pages tacked on, this could have been the last book. Easily. I can't even imagine what they are going to cover in the last book! There'll be a bunch of reunions, no doubt, but not enough content to fill a 300-400 page book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've stuck with it this long ... I might as well finish!","review":"I almost didn't buy this, but figured I might as well take it to the end. The first 2 and maybe 3 books of the series were great and I happily loaned them out to friends. My advice now is, \\"Don't get started!\\"The writing style is obviously geared towards stretching out the story. The wide margins are a pitifull example of how the writers are milking the public for every last dime. This series should have been at most 6 books.What started out with a bang is going out with a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. What I thought was going to be the final apocolyptic battle between good and evil was never contained in this book. It's just more of the same: the Trib Force evades the GC and changes hiding places. They kill off three of the main characters and finish it right before the battle reaches its climax. This was done so that people have to buy the next (and final, thank God) installment of the series. Left Behind has gotten rather old and repetitive and when they pulled this stunt, it just plain ticked me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book; Awesome series!","review":"I have adult ADD and am NOT a big reader, but this book and series keep my attention.

The people I care for look forward to a world full of life and promise, not death and destruction. These myths are perpetuated by a highly superstitious and dangerous mind-set...one I pray will never have access to nuclear armament in our military.

They've been great for tummy time, starting at about 4 mos, and sitting. He likes to take the stack apart, and then will work quite hard to reach the individual cups if we move them away from him. He works on nesting them, and occasionally succeeds (totally by accident). I got them for the bath, but they haven't gotten wet yet, and they're at the top of the hit parade. I love the colors, shapes, and different patterns on each one. They are rigid plastic, but he loves sucking on them and has not yet bonked himself in the face. Also, if dropped on a hardwood floor they make a fabulous noise and go all over the place. The blue one once rolled into an alternate dimension under the bed and was AWOL for a while, but they bounce back (and I do mean bounce) without a scratch. I anticipate a lot of good times with these if we don't lose them."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a tbig fun with simple little cups","review":"I bought these before my daughter was born and gave it to her when she was five month old.

It is the cheapest thing I bought so far and she keeps having fun with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I can't believe that my one year old can spend so much time playing with cups!

I think she likes the bright colors and the shapes that are on the bottoms. I am trying to teach her the colors. She is really good at getting them stacked up, if not she will sit there until she gets it figured out.At the end of the day, I do clean them with dish soap and let them air dry overnight. My daughter puts everything in her mouth right now and I want to make sure they are clean when she picks them up again.I am very happy she is happy with them.

Very vibrant colors and nice quality wood (although I've also seen the GuideCraft sparkley version too, and that is great as well). These were well worth the fifteen dollar asking price at barnes and noble. we love looking through them and seeing how the world changes color - and seeing how blue and yellow make green, etc. Update: We've had them for a few months, but only played with them a lot recently (because I had them on the window)... after two days of playing with them, one of them cracked (as warned by another reviewer). It cracked in the inner part of the class and no liquid is leaking - but I did want to note that (although these are otherwise great)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Open the stupid thing!","review":"I have a Food Saver, which I dearly love, and thought this would be great for camping, boating, etc. It may be the greatest thing since vodka, but I can't open the battery compartment to put the stupid batteries in to see if it works at all.While I appreciate the reviews of others before me, I would have really appreciated it if, after they said they'd figured out how to open the battery compartment, they had told the rest of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eurosealer does not seal","review":"I have tried the Eurosealer with potato chip bags, and just plain, thin bread bags, and neither will seal. I have tried sealing s-l-o-w-ly, at a normal spead and it makes almost no difference. The potato chip bag sides won't even stick together. The bread bag - I thought I finally had it sealed but I tugged just a little to test it and :-(((( it came apart with almost no effort.

It doesn't really seal *any* plastic bag as it claims on the front of the package. Lightweight plastic don't really work. And after making three full line seals across my bag of cookies in a mylar type bag, it's still not quite air tight.I wasn't really looking to use it for freshness but to seal plastic bags for a craft project. It won't work at all on the bags I have for that. Either it doesn't seal or it melts all the way through, with no in between.Also it has trouble heating enough to meld areas with seams or double thickness (like a bag that folds in on the sides).But hey what do you expect for 8 bucks?Maybe I just haven't learned the little dance of the \\"feel of the seal\\".They do make more professional ones which work better, but they also cost upwards of 40 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable","review":"I bought this in September. It worked just OK at first. It wasn't the best seal. Then all of a sudden it would work GREAT! It sealed wonderfully, but after two days, it would stop working. I would change the batteries and lo and behold it worked great again. The problem with that was that I didn't think that such a small item should be using up batteries at that rate. But the batteries were not drained. I started to try them in a flashlight after taking them from the Euro sealer and they were fine. Then all of a sudden it just stopped working all together. It is an unreliable item and I would not recommend it to anyone. I thought that mine was faulty but after reading two other reviews I guess I was wrong. It's just a cheap product in my opinion or there are a lot of faulty units being sold. It is not worth it.

Just make sure you get the real unit. Here is the listing for the vendor who sent me the fake unit:EURO SEALER"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Euro Sealer is Snake Oil","review":"Another snake oil product advertising on TV, it's too bad as that is the medium where a lot of REAL inventors get their start.The Euro Sealer might work on some bags, but I have not found any. The following bags I tried:Plastic Cereal bagsPlastic Bread bagsPlastic corn chip bagsPlastic pasta bagsand every other bag laying around the kitchen. None of them worked. I tried it fast, slow, I held the euro sealer on the plastic for a good 3 minutes on a single spot. It held for a second, but while putting the bag away it opened back up - the seal was that weak.If you're looking for a product to do what the eurosealer claims, you're going to have to spend more than $15 - more like $115, and get a vacuum sealer. Tupperware would also work, or zip-loc baggies. The euro sealer will not do a thing.The magnet works great and is very handy for putting up pictures on the fridge.

Basketball is my passion, and I love statistics, so this book combined everything I wanted. I have ran basketball leagues before and I wanted to have a better way of rating players with the stats that we kept rather than just the basic ppg, rpg, etc. Sometimes the person who scores the most isn't really the best player in the league (or even the game) statistically. And John Hollinger shows how he came up with his formulas. I really appreciate the depth he goes into on each player in the NBA as well. I wish there was an updated Summer 2009 version out or coming out. This book is something I would probably buy yearly if it kept being published. I would like to see how it predicts some of today's best players and some of the rookies even coming in."},{"rating":"2","title":"I work as a prostitute because the client wants me","review":"This book is all about the use of (sexual) power in the struggle for survival: 'Women choose to go into prostitution because they need money'; or, 'because it is the best way to make a living.'As the author says: 'There should be laws forbidding poverty, but no laws forbidding a woman to accept money from a man for her company.'The numbers are staggering: alone in the US, there are approximatively 1300000 prostitutes.A main theme in this book is hypocrisy.Of the people arrested in the sex trade only 10 % are clients.Sexual 'entertainment' is written off as a business expense.Condoms are distributed freely to the military.In the Philippines doctors blamed prostitutes for introducing AIDS into the country ... not the American servicemen.This book is a worth-while documentary about an important aspect of human behaviour. It shows that human beings are not primarily rational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, if you don't have MORALS!","review":"This is a GREAT book. But there are flaws in it. If you simply decriminalize prostitution and not legalize it, employers might want to put 'must give head' as part of the job requirement for women.She also argues that no one under 25 should be allowed to be 'working'. Well, if the adults do it, why not the children?This is an immoral profession. But, if wanted to be done anyway, it has to be monitored tightly so that men in corp don't start taking advantage of female employees and start using loopholes in the laws caused by the legalization of prostitution."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read, not your average prostitute...","review":"Dolores is an exceptional woman in that as a prostitute she decides to experience every facet and level of the work.

It was not just a minor, barely visible crack, but a decent one which would likely grow over time, degrading the functional integrity of the knife. I sent my first one back through amazon's generally good return policy, and requested a replacement. The replacement arrived with a nearly identical crack.

A part of that included keeping a prayer journal. I purchased this Christian inspirational journal expecting it to suit my needs. It exceeded them. It has incorporated all of the best elements of favorite Bibles. The leather has the look, feel and scent that one comes to associate with quality books, the pages are gold edged, a ribbon marker is included, the timeless \\"fish\\" symbol is engraved on the front and found at the bottom of each page. The scripture quotations at the bottom of each page are excellent entry points for one's daily reflections. This journal has become such an integral part of my prayer life that I purchased additional copies. If one is seeking a quality personal prayer journal you can't go wrong with this one. It is an exceptional value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journal of Excellent Quality!","review":"I was more than pleased with the superb quality of this journal.

I love Kander and Ebb, including \\"The Rink\\" and \\"Steel Pier,\\" both of which I consider underrated. But \\"Curtains\\" is second-rate and would never have made it to Broadway without the Kander-Ebb names on it. Hyde-Pierce is charming, though Esparza deserved the Tony for his electrifying performance in \\"Company.\\" Monk is unappealing throughout. Not a star. And poor Karen Ziemba, a real talent,is wasted. There is one good ballad and the Show People number which is catchy, but the rest of the score ranges from ordinary to embarrassing. The book is thin and the choreography is awful. We'd all like to remember Kander and Ebb's last show as an artistic success, but let' not deceive ourselves. This should never have come to Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I checked this CD from the library thinking I would love it.

It sounded interesting and had a nice fat look to it. But take the booklets out of the cardboard box they are in, and you find a booklet with some information and then a fatter book that is nothing but blank pages. I wouldn't mind if this sold for [dollar amount] or something, but it's nearly [dollar amount]! The so-called 192 pages are mostly blank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It has lots of full color pictures with design ideas (although sometimes I have to wonder whether people actually *live* in some of the spaces presented.)The workbook, unfortunately, is fairly useless. It contains a set of \\"sample pouches\\" (basically clear plastic pouches), a binder to store your thoughts in and some graph paper for drawing out maps of rooms. Altogether, something you could put together for a couple bucks at an office supply store.All told, paying.. for the book might be a bit expensive, but if you want a good, concise design reference, it is the best I've found.

It seems that the fundamental design for these beasts was to take a standard monster, add tentacles, give it a name, and draw a [feeble] picture of it. When will creativity and innovation return to the RPG world of monsters? I would reccommend a cool book like the Fiend Folio instead of this <hee hee> Monstrosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have if you want to add variety to your games","review":"I really enjoyed this manual. When 3rd edition rolled around and replaced AD&D;, I was a little disappointed with the monster manual. Although they DID get rid of some really [weak] monsters from 2nd edition, they excluded some that i really would have liked the stats for - gem dragons, banshees, etc. (Personally, i think that these creatures should have been in the first MM, but...)One thing i really like is that this manual gives you not just new creatures, but whole new races- creatures with detailed society information and many different subclasses of the particular creature. It's nice to have an entire society layed out for you, just waiting to find a place in your world.I would say that for a DM just starting out, the MM is good enough. For someone who has been running games for a while, and especially those who have PC that are higher level, MM2 is a must. It will help get more variety into your games and throw something new at your players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for an update...","review":"Some interesting new entries in the D20 universe such as the infamous gem dragons :) but the format is still 3.0e and starting to show its age, very difficult to use any of the LA's PC possible entries...Save this purchase for last for the completisits out there after you have the MM, MMIII, and fiend folio in your collection. Actually after that I would probably recomend others still before the MMII, notably the advanced bestiary from green ronin which contains more interesting and up to date material than the aged MMII here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Educating Book On NBA History","review":"I bought this book for myself right before the start of this year's NBA season to get in the mood for basketball again which is my favorite sport.

It is a bit large, but the far edges just fold under. The entire windshield is covered, and the cut out for the rear view mirror is great. It's relatively thick, and definitely much better at keeping the car cool compared to my old, dull-grey folding 'double hoop' design (the ones that fold down into a small circle when you twist the sides?). This one is much shinier, and has two suction cups to keep it attached to the windshield. The cups work with mixed results, so I usually just flip down my sun visors, and that works.

It includes recognizable songs and comprehensible notation. He said it was easy for his beginner level and he had a lot of fun playing through it the first time.

He has vision problems and thankfully can read everything in the book with little trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"What piece of garbage is this so called Songbook","review":"Do Not Buy This Songbook. Here's why:1. The book contains lyrics and six chords. You can look these up online. Google is your friend.2. There are only 21 songs; total page 40. You are paying about 50 cents per song and what you receive for your money is junk. It won't show you the correct chords, just the easy approximations. If you are good, you just might be able to make it sound good. If you're a beginner like me, it will sound HORRIBLE.3. Avoid Hal Leonard's books like the plague. There are FAR better books on learning to play guitar and there are also FAR better books on playing Dylan songs on your guitar.I bought this book hoping to strum some Bob Dylan songs and sorely disappointed at the lack of details.

The text and the art unquestionably captures the essence of these classic science fiction tales from the 1960's. The language and clothing reflect the time period, and are not modernized. Reading it, I felt as if I was holding a yellowed paperback published in the 1970's. Definitely authentic.The art for each story is unique. No artist's style is the same. Best of all, Bradbury (who is still alive and writing) has written a moving introduction to the book. The introduction really touched my heart. It has to do with following your dreams, and how he got his start in writing sci-fi. And as a delightful bonus, Bradbury has written brief introductions to each and every story in the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Belle for older child only","review":"Disappointed in Belle!

Unfortunately it turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the holiday season. While the doll is beautiful, the interactive process is unimaginative and clumsy. Each accessory must be attached to Belle's hand, and the interaction between Belle and those pieces is elementary and simple. After playing with it twice my daughter became bored of the plain, repetitive language and now only plays with the doll using her own imagination. I think that consumers looking for a lot of interaction would be wise to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My daughter was so excited to get this doll but she and I were very disappointed when we got it home.

They told me that this toy was no longer available, that it was only produced for 6 months and only sold to Sam's Club. I was also told that there were no more dolls any where in the world for sale. Much to my dismay I found them here one week later.

Who still has the time to scrub their cookware by hand every single day? Further, the metal handle on this specific pan gets pretty hot and you have to use a towel to hold it if you want to mess with the food inside - bad design! Finally, after about one year the bottom of my pan warped and it has now only contact with the cooktop in the center and wobbles horribly. I did not heat an empty pan, which is what Kitchenaid warns of, but come on, you have to be able to set it on high when trying to sear sth or bring the pan up to the correct temperature without the bottom giving up on you!I guess I'll have to invest in some real cookware that you can actually cook with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Books","review":"This wasn't my favorite Seth book, and I wish that Robert Butts would go a little easier on the added comments.

I sometimes enjoy listening to the SDTK from Crouching Tiger, Flying Daggers, Hero, or other films when practicing martial arts. I was expecting more of that. I got none of it.

The mindless, nonsense writing OFTEN stands in the way of the plot.While reading the book, if you so dare, you will probably stand back at all this babble and say...\\"Mr. King...does anyone REALLY care? GET TO THE PLOT, sir!\\"The only redeeming qualitie of this book is the off-and-on plot.

In fact, I felt BETRAYED after forcing myself to finish the book.

This book will MAKE you fall asleep","review":"Insomnia was an uninteresting, horrible novel. Usually, Stephen King surprises me with sophisticated writing, interesting plots, and story lines that are fairly simple to follow. This book is a rare exception, being neither interesting or sophisticated in word form. King's summary was more interesting than the entire book! The main charictor is supposed to discover \\"the people in the small town of Derry, Maine turning into monsters straight from Hell.\\" But instead, the reader finds himself bored almost to tears over a story based on ongoing beatings--which is as far as I got before I fell asleep, lamp on and book in hand! I would reccomend highly that you forget this book entirely, moving on to better works of King literature (such as \\"It\\", or \\"Thinner\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"An old man has problem sleeping. As he suffers from insomnia he starts to be able to see another world superimposed on the world that we all see.One of Kings strengths is his ability to create new mythic concepts, new monsters and new worlds. So much popular fiction works by retelling stories which have been created before. How many detective novels are about serial killers, how many books have been written about vampires. Each time King writes a novel he creates a new genre and a new world.The other attraction of Kings books are that the characters are not two dimensional stick figures whose only purpose is to advance the plot. Rather his characters live, think, love in a way that is very close to reality. His ability to plot character and dialogue strengthen reader interest so that one get more involved in the plot than with other pulp fiction.A long book but one that brings joy on each page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"With a deja vu from Needful Things, Insomnia has about 250 unnecessary pages of fluff, padding the way to possibly one of the most unsatisfying climaxes I've ever come across. It begins much like Bag of Bones, with a painfully long development of the main plot. Admittedly, there are a few good chapters in the middle, once the plight of the main character is revealed. After that, though, things drag on unsatisfyingly. The only thing that kept me reading was the allure of finding out who the \\"Crimson King\\" really was.

I liked the Stand so much I read the Dark Tower series, and I liked that too so I decided to look for some other Stephen King books. After looking through a bunch, I decided on Insomnia, as it had some tie ins to the Dark Tower series.I am now hooked on Stephen King books. To me the great thing about Stephen King is his ability to really dig into characters, to give them depth and substance. He does this extremely well in Insomnia. As others have stated, it takes a while to get going, but I was interested in the characters and intrigued enough to stick with it, and I was well rewarded in the end. It was not incredibly scary, but more weird and intriguing. I highly recommend this book, even for the non-Stephen King fan (or especially for the non-fan)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most BORING book ever!","review":"Stephen King is one of my favourite authors. In fact, other than Tom Clancy and W.E.B. Griffin, he's the only writer who's books I buy without any hesitation. Unfortunately, this was one of the times when it was a mistake to do so.

Most of his storys send chills down my spine, but after reading this book, I lost almost all respect for Stephen King. It starts out with a lot of potential, but as the story goes on I found myself cringing at its stupidity.

All in all, a terrible read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired, Time passer","review":"This novel falls just short of average. It really doesn't challenge the reader in any facet of original thought, and the characters are interminably dull. I did not choose to finish after about 600 pages, so I'm still not sure how it ends, although the plot became rather predictable at that point so I have a good idea of what happens, I just failed to care by page 600. It is annoying to invest time to read 600 pages only to finally make the decision that I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant reading any further. The dialogue between the characters is contrived, and worse, the characters do not seem distinctive. They all act, think, and talk similarly so the whole town kind of dissolves into one old, boring morass. There is also some relatively lame science fiction, laser powers shooting out of people's hands, which is just tired.

We witness his imsomnia an his strange visions; so far so good, im an imsomniac myself and found Ralph's ordeal very interesting. Then it gets ugly. The explanation for Ralph's situation is farfetched and laughable, and has to do with an incredibly trite side plot where he now has to take part.

But I have to give it to Mr. King for allowing us into his head; he is clearly a mastermind of bringing you in, he is a very good story teller and am not surprised that many of his books have been adapted into movies.

I'm embarassed by the fact that Stephen King let this go into print for his dedicated readers to buy. I did not get Insomnia from this novel, in fact, I fell asleep trying to get through the exhaustable plot. The two main characters are frankly boring, and unrelatable to his main audience. The conclusion was rushed, the \\"bad guy\\" was not there long enough to be \\"terrifying\\" and the only real enjoyment I got from the novel was the little bald guys, yeah, even the evil one.

Also, the book is loaded with unnecessary characters and small events, which leads the reader to wonder why King wrote certain sections of the novel. This book could have been really good had it been 300 pages long, not 800."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it get anymore boring?","review":"I bought this book the first week it was out. I found it to be extremely boring and put it down half way through. Since then I have tried to finish it, but find myself getting drowsy after only 20 or so pages. This is the only King novel I have never finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS GREAT!","review":"The images and idea that King portrays in this book are riveting and though-provoking. READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, Terrible audio book","review":"I wish I could offer a better review on this. The book, wasn't one of Kings best, but certainly not a bad book either.The problem lies in the production of this audio book. The background \\"music\\" (Read NOISE) is harsh, jarring and disruptive.While most of the reading by Mr Eli Wallach is adequate, about 1/3 of the way in, 2 new characters are introduced and the screeching high pitched wailing he uses for these two characters can not be adequately described. It is horrid! Honestly, shrill doesn't even come close.What in the name of heaven were they thinking when they put this together? I'd love to see this reissued after jailing those responsible for this criminal effort. I want my $$ back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the ???","review":"At first when I was reading this book I wasnt sure what to expect with it. I thought the story was sooooooo slow and a little boring... Then it started to pick up and I just couldnt put it down. It was soo great. I really liked how things kinda ame together at the end there. The characters are all well written and its just a great story with soo much going on.I really liked the descrition when the main character would go another level higher and sees all the auras and stuff, I thought it was great !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'LL MAKE YOU SLEEP","review":"I am a big fan of Stephen King's work.

Im wont say anything about the storyline youll have to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"I've been a Stephen King fan all my life and this one...well it's a letdown. I read it awhile back and only recall being very disappointed. I finished it because I kept hoping it would get better. For those of you who liked it, you must not have read some of his better work, which is just about anything else he's written thus far. It's comforting that, more often than not, he doesn't let his faithful readers down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomnia is the proper title for this book","review":"This is the first Stephen King novel that I have read. If his other works are as bad as this one. Then Insomnia will be my last Stephen King novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man's Worst (Besides Eye Of The Dragon)","review":"If you are like me, and do not even consider \\"Eye Of The Dragon\\" to be a real Stephan King book, then \\"Insomnia\\" must truely be his worst. My interest level was minimal throughout, so it took me more than a year to finish. It is simply not a page-turner. Conservatives, stay away from this book; it espouses more feminist dogma than even \\"Gerald's Game.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS a King fan.","review":"I had been a Stephen King fan for over a decade. He helped get me through some really trying times in college and professional school - after all how bad can you have it if in another place and time there is a world-killing plague about to hit? (The Stand) Then I read this book. In other books Stephen King has been able to intelligently, if passionately and even humorously, discuss different opinions on religion, sociology, you name it - using his characters' personas. But in Insomnia he goes out of his way to, in the most offensively biased way imaginable, gratuitously insult, slander and demonize those who are pro-life. Everyone in his book is either pro-choice and compassionate or pro-life and some kind of homicidal maniac. I would have welcomed a thoughtful debate among characters about such weighty issues as he did in The Stand, but to create such ugly prejudicial caricatures is unconscionable and far beneath his writing standard. I was VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Best!","review":"Perfect to read when you have insomnia! King has created a creepy world that only the sleepless know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a plot in here somewhere, right?","review":"You know that question that goes something like \\"If you were stuck on a desert island with only one book, what would that book be?\\"? Well, my answer would be this one, because I wouldn't feel bad when I used it to start a fire. Stephen King was a great writer. Cujo, The Stand... great works of fiction. Insomnia... great example of how you can publish anything with Stephen King's name on it. Do not buy this, do not read this, do not walk too close to it in the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a long time King fan I was very let down.","review":"Having really enjoyed Kings books such as The Gunslinger, The Stand, and his masterpiece Misery, I have to say this is one of his weakest books. At 600+ pages I found this book to be a big let down with a less then inspired storey and boring unoriginal characters. Yes it does have a Darktower reference, but it's really nothing important so don't feel you need to read this book for that reason. Besides the Tommyknockers, which is another major King flop, this may be his worst, so my suggestion is to skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me Insomnia, but I still loved it","review":"I finally decided to tackle to massive Insomnia, and I am glad that I did (even if it kept me awake reading when I should have been sleeping). I had read the reviews about the first 150-200 pages being tough to get through, but I did not mind. I really enjoyed the story, and I did not mind the abortion / anti-abortion undertones. I thought the idea of what Ralph and Lois were able to see / do was fantastic. But for me the pay off was how it tied into the Dark Tower Series. Any tru King fan will suffer the beginning, and love the complet work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relief is here!","review":"Perhaps you suffer from insomnia, and this book came up in a random search for books on the topic. If you are truly seeking help with your sleep disorder, do not, I repeat, DO NOT overlook this book merely because it is a work of fiction, and will offer very little in the way of scientific illumination of your problem. Make no mistake about it, if you are an insomniac, this is one book you absolutely MUST have. With few exceptions, the mere act of READING this book offers a more expedient cure than a thousand prescriptions of your pharmacist's most powerful sleeping aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow in the beginning, great in the end","review":"Insomnia started off as a very slow and boring book, so much in fact that I almost put it down. But I forced myself to finish it, and it was great! The only thing is that I dont think that senior citizens regularly swear at each other though. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I have long been a King fan, enjoying everything from Carrie to The Stand, The Shining, 'Salem's Lot, Misery, and Desperation. But this book was a real disappointment. Either King is going stale or his editors are afraid to edit him. His old geezer protagonists spout profanity like teenagers and have Baby Boomer sensibilities; completely unbelievable. This would be non-fatal if the story weren't so ridiculous. King usually produces suspense and chills; this thing was more like The Hardy Boys go to The Wizard of Oz. I mean, come on: Not even King can wow me by the introduction of a pair of singing sneakers. Think about it -- singing tennis shoes!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Insomnia\\" put me to sleep","review":"This book was an excruciatingly time-consuming, drawn out and mind-numbing waste of time (SK's and mine). For some reason I pushed myself to finish it. Although it did manage to become somewhat more interesting towards the end the book as a whole was not at all something I would expect from an award winning writer. Don't waste your time or patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure For Insomnia!","review":"Yes, that's right, if you happen to suffer from insomnia this is the book for you. I got about halfway through it about 9 months ago and it's been sitting on my shelf since then.Besides starting out slow, it becomes almost rediculously comical in the way the characters get more and more outrageous in their behavior. I realize that Stephen King novels are based on the 'make believe' however, I enjoyed most of his other books' eeriness; Insomnia is just crazy and laughable.I recommend skipping this one and going on to one of his other good books like The Shining, Misery, or Christine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellant book","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time, I have probably read it five times. The story line is very easy to follow. It's about a man turned insomniac after his wife dies that starts seeing things, these things turn out to be wonderful real life visions that the rest of us just can't see. I recommend this book even if you are not a Stephen King fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read...","review":"Okay, first let me confess that I'm not the typical Steve King fan (is there such a thing?). I read The Stand years ago, and have loved the Dark Tower series, which has led me to start reading some the peripheral Tower books like Insomnia.I'm glad I read it, even without the Tower connection, I would have liked it. But for you Tower junkies who haven't read it, but are interested in the Tower connections, read pages 461,580, 683, and 728 (this page caught me off-guard and gave me chills). These pages are from the Viking hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!!!","review":"Item was in great condition. Pages did not even look read. Came in a timely manner. No trouble with seller. Plus book was a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate to do it...but it's a 3 1/2 really...","review":"Can't say that I totally hated INSOMNIA, but also can't say that I recommend it to other people. It was very interesting with lots of likable characters and such...but it just wouldn't get to it! Sure the ending is crazy like all Stephen King endings, but it took forever to get there. The storyline is a good, well-thought out one with interesting turns to it. King creates a wonderful cast of real and likable characters caught in a mess of insomnia, violence, and abortion. This is a good book, it just took me a long time to read. Sometimes you have to patient with it, in the end something DOES happen. What I liked best about the ending was that it did not just end abruptly. There was an ending, and then the epilouge was a whole other ending altogether and it really made the book worth it. Very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couln't sleep for reading, My first King book.","review":"First of all, do not pay attention to all the blubbering about how long this book is. When a book is good, who cares if it is long? What an intriguing novel, and probably one of the more original I have ever read. I loved the way King portrayed the seniors in such a sensitive way. He truly got to the heart of their concerns, fears and loves. This is not really the typical horror book, so if that puts you off reading it, please do not let it. I really didn't sleep much, either, for the book was better than catching those zzzz's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooring!","review":"This book took me three (3) years to finish reading. Need I say more? Boring, dragged on and on and on and on and on.........................................."},{"rating":"1","title":"I plan to use this book for kindling next time I go camping.","review":"This was absolutely the worst book I have ever read. The plot, characters, and overall concept are so thin, that they make you feel as if you are being led on the page-turning equivalent of a wild goose chase. Also, it's pretty evident he must've just finished reading the Hobbit at the time he wrote this one. There must be at least 10 references to Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"The one and only novel of stephen king that makes me wonder why ,just why I bought it. It is really a 600 page torture....."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book drags you in and holds you there.","review":"I love Stephen King's books. This book was one I did not think I would like until I started it. The booked grabbed a hold of me and I could hardly put it down the week it took me to read it. What I liked was the supernatural religious presence, heroes being real people, especially those on in years, and the reassuring view of death. The ending of the book was sad but not pointless. I knew deep down what would happen to Ralph but hoped it wouldn't. The ending pulled heart strings that made tears come to my eyes"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRAGS ON LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.","review":"I CAN'T SAY I HAD AS MUCH FUN WITH THIS BOOK AS I DID WITH IT. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT TRIES TO COPY A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR PREMISE, BUT IT IS JUST TOO BORING. READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE READ NO OTHER STEPHEN KING BOOKS. QUITE A DISAPPOINTMENT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even those who are not King fans will love this story.","review":"I found this story to be very different from much of King'sprevious work in that it was more concise. He tells a wonderful tale of a lonely man and his final journey in life...not to mention the amazing things he discovers along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still sticks with me after reading it when it first came out","review":"I thought this book was a fantastic work by Mr. King. I read this book 4 or 5 years ago when it first came out, and it still sticks with me as one of his most memorable. I prefer the King books that take your mind places you normally wouldn't make it to by your own imagination , versus his blood and gore and pure horror books. If you are a fan of King's less gorey books, you will definitely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just aint that good.","review":"Stephen King's Insomnia is not his best book. It's not his worst either, it just aint that good. For one thing, IT'S TO DAMN LONG. I mean, instead of getting right to the point, King goes off on these long monolouges about what the weather is like and what colored shirt someone is wearing. I really don't care, get to the point. But I will defend the book in one aspect: People have been saying that the book is to far-fetched. C'mon, honsetly, when did Stephen King ever write anything that was realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL! I LOVED IT!","review":"Just a short one. I was hooked on King back in the seventies.I started with salem's lot, and have read every thing(but short stories, I don't like short stories)he has written.The thing I like best about stephen king is the way he builds stories(solid).This one will stand, a very long time.I agree, this is not a book for someone who is wanting \\"blood, gore, and imediate action\\". king is a storyteller! He climbs slow, but it is well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of the fantasy reader.","review":"For the fantasy reader, Insomnia is one of the best books you will ever read. It combines King's modern day experiences and his indescribable talent for fantasy. Like most King books, there is some graphic and sexual content. This, however, manages to enhance the experience and make the book more enjoyable. Story is original and fairly easy to read. Plot is impossible to describe without quoting most of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite things...","review":"As an avid King fan, I've read most of what he has to offer, but this is quite possibly my favorite. Derry, Maine keeps us up late at night once again. Scary, touching, and by turns even funny, King has blown me away on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish modern fairy-tale","review":"King pretty much calls himself a fantasy writer in Danse Macabre, and this story displays deftness in translating a fairy-tale into a story about another class of \\"dependents\\", senior citizens. The story reminds me of C.S. Lewis's story about children who perceive and participate in a deeper reality and help to save the day in times of crisis. In this story, the protagonists can SEE what's going on \\"behind the scenes\\" in our transitory reality of life and seemingly random death. They see what's going on and so help. Some may see the work as too theoretical, but it's just another approach to fantastic fiction. I'll agree that the blurb on the back of the book is pretty distortive, but I still enjoyed Insomnia. It's a good fantasy story from the perspective of older characters, something lacking in most fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slower than my grandma!!","review":"I love Stephen King. But, I was so hyped on getting this book, then when I read it, I wanted to scream. The story was really nice, but 700 some odd pages is too long for such a boring book. It was too much fantasy for my taste. (Not to say that he has to make everything believable) If you people read my reviews and keep wondering why I down his books so much, it is because King rocks, and I don't want people to read stuff that doesn't help his image any."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books that Stephen could done better.","review":"The books beginning and the middle was good but at the ending I didn't like about the kamakazi situation. If you have nothing to do then just read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the first Stephen King book that I couldn't finish.","review":"I tried. I really did. This book just couldn't hold my interest. I read about half of it and gave up. Read The Green Mile, Hearts in Atlantis, It, Carrie, or any other King book before you read this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Tibbetts","review":"The first question that comes to my mind after reading this book is: \\"What were you thinking when you wrote this, Stephen?\\" I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.I felt that after several hundred pages of hallucinations, the author got bored of writing this and slapped \\"THE END\\" on the last page. The only \\"horror\\" I saw in this book was the mental picture of seventy-year olds having sex. I know it happens, but for Pete's sake, that scarred my delicate psyche for eternity. I am so glad I bought this book at a flea market. Stephen King is one of my favorite authors and I have almost all of his books in my library, but if anyone is thinking of reading Insomnia, then this novel will be the cure for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roland wouldn't even read this book...","review":"I'm a big Stephen King fan. Over the last 10 years I tried on several occasions to read this and didn't make it past page 122. I think the fact that in the Dark Tower Roland is handed the book and choses not to read it, even though it's pivotal to the end of the book, is enough for me to say it's just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Up ALL NIGHTER","review":"I was up at nights reading this. It really is a great book.I love his spooky stuff. I love the characters in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I thought this was a good book. One of the many that keeps you turning the page due to suspense. Ralph Roberts had no clue that his Insomnia would lead him to heroism and he would finally get to \\"sleep\\". Stephen King's one of a kind creativity definitely comes to play here. I would recommend this book to anyone. I think anyone would enjoy the suprise ending in finding out about the \\"promise\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Origionally I had checked this book out from the library, but it was so good I bought a copy for myself. The character development is very good, and the story (though it has a few ho-hum spots) is interesting and flows really nicely. However, this is not a scary book at all but really a rainy afternoon read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start goes flat...","review":"What a great introduction to the idea that an old man has got the 'gift' and can see people who are loosing their souls...... just goes banal just more than half way through to the point where you need to be a Dark Tower fan, big time, to like it. If you read Black House and liked that (because you are a Dark Tower series fan, and you read The Talisman) then Insominia has all that some other-worldy stuff that isn't really every King fan's cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"People With Insomnia Only Ones Able to Finish This Book!","review":"I tried, I really, really tried. This is not only the first King book I couldn't finish, but the only book EVER I haven't finished. Reason? I didn't CARE what happened. I didn't CARE what became of the characters, so I never wondered. In most books, (IT, Carrie, Bag of Bones or Koontz's Watchers, Phantoms) I wanted to know what would happen. I cared and felt like I was a part of their lives. Not in this one! This book might actually have been written as a cure for insomnia! Put me right to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy, pretentious, political propaganda","review":"If you like political diatribes disguised as \\"fiction\\", this book is for you. If you think pro-choice Lesbians are all unsung heroes and pro-life activists are all raving, wife beating control freaks, this book is for you. If you want to slog through hundreds of pages of \\"Goodliness is admirable but Godliness is vile\\", then this book is for you. If you are an \\"openminded\\" liberal who believes that perpetuating ugly stereotypes about conservatives is an honorable mission, then you have hit paydirt.If, however, you were expecting a book with interesting characters, intriguing situations and thoughtful contemplation of different ideas and motivations, then skip this and try something else. This book is an insult to serious readers and a 600+ page tribute to smug, self congratulating humanists.Before purchasing, you might want to sleep on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, poor quality","review":"This is a great book on audio, Eli Walach is fantastic as the reader, but the quality is extremely poor. I purchased the first set and it had a really bad scratch on one of the dics, and quite a few of the discs skipped as you reached tracks 18 - 20 which made it harder to follow. Amazon.com sent me a second set, and the qulaity was just as poor, even without the scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"READING INSOMNIA HELPED ME FALL ASLEEP","review":"I respect most of Stephen Kings work but I did not enjoy reading Insomnia. He draged the story along with a few good ideas but for the most part it was a chore to read. In my opinion one bad point that stood out the most was that there were too many liberal minded characters voicing their opinion when it was really unecessary. It looked to me like Mr. King was using his story to get certain political beliefs into the minds of his readers. Another annoying apect of the book was how trite the characters dialouge could be at times. There were a lot of predictable moments that spoiled the little suspense the novel offered.One highlight of the book was at the end of the story when the main character (his name slips my mind) faces one of the best villians ever emagined. Taking this into consideration I gave this book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get off your GD soapbox, Stephen!","review":"Please get off your soapbox and get back to great stories, Stephen King. I agree with another reviewer who said this book should be in the political section and not the fiction section for books. We love you as a story teller, Stephen, and hate it when you try to shove your political views down our throats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money. too political","review":"This book was just another addition to King's political rants that he wastes too many pages preaching instead of building a good story. I have lost faith in King, I did enjoy many of his past work, but with this and many others it really belongs in the political section and not the horror section."},{"rating":"1","title":"is there a point to this endless book?","review":"The book goes on and on endlessly. I usually don't have an issue with profanity and cursing but this book seems to have an abundance of it with no particular point. Also some of the abortion discussion is overly descriptive. All this and no story. King can't be counted on to provide a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted mess","review":"What starts off as a creepy, intriguing story, quickly snowballs out of proportion and into a total mess. A convoluted mythology that makes little sense and a very questionable philosophical underpinning are the biggest failures, followed by the sheer amount of words King wastes on such a primitive story. He is at his best when at his most minimal and when the dangers stem from within (The Shining), not from something this abstract and baseless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen's worst book!","review":"This is his most boring book, I couldn't finish it. Every character has a childish mind and behavior. Stephen wrote this book just thinking about how would it look like on the screen, with the visual efects. I recomend this book to children between 12-15. Don't waste your time/money with Insomnia, only if you ARE with insomnia: you'll always sleep like a log after 20 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours of my life wasted on this...","review":"Crap, crap, crap, crap! I love King, but had to drag myself through this uninteresting story. I made myself finish it because I had faith Uncle Stevie (King that is) would reward the reader in the end. Boy was I wrong! Look to his earlier stuff for a good read, this book's a real nightmare! PS- Did I mention it's crap?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insomnia","review":"I love this book. From the first time I read it when it first came out to when I put it on my Kindle. However I was not impressed with the misspellings in the Kindle editin. Some words had letters missing. The story is still there and one of King's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through it!!","review":"I am sorry, I truly think that King is an extremely talented writer and a gifted human. But what was he thinking with this one? I really did try, it took me six months to get 1/2 through it and I finally gave up! Please don't waste your time on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve, what happened?","review":"I've loved every single Stephen King book I've read - except for this one. It stinks! I can't understand what happened - how can such a talented writer produce such a bomb?It's just *dull*. You'll just be waiting for it to end. If you have not read any King, do not choose this one. Anything else he has written is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite King book.","review":"I could not finish. I read the first half and the epilogue. It was so boring. Too much description, ramblings, dreams, visions. The guy sees auras and things other people don't see. The epilogue explained some major events. That was somewhat interesting, but not enough to make me want to read more. One of the things I love about King is his characters. I didn't care about these characters. My favorite King books are Carrie, The Stand, and Rose Madder.The narrator Eli Wallach was painful and hard to listen to. He sounded like he had laryngitis. He has a soft, whispering, gravely voice. At times it felt like he was reading as opposed to acting. My mind kept wandering."},{"rating":"1","title":"to many errors in type","review":"I love Stephen King novels. This Kindle edition has serious errors throughout the book. I read page after page with errors, it was getting annoying after awhile.Not simple mis spellings, but incorect words.The town is Derry, at one point the name is Deny.The word me where the word obviously was meant to be the.Corndor for corridor.Then instead of the, that one I forgive.My problelm that there are so many errors throughout the book, most are in the first quarter through middle of the book. It was just annoying to read.Generally the errors are the incorrect word than mis spellings. I'm not trying to be an editor, this is just bad proof reading if any proofing was done at all.If a book is going to be released this way for Kindle I feel that 6.99 is too much to pay. I think a partial refund is in order.I like the story, maybe not as much as other of King's stories, but still I enjoyed the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"King at his best!","review":"This is definitely one of King's finest books yet. I have been an avid reader for years and I am always amazed at how King can bring your biggest fears to life through your imagination. Read it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and different","review":"Despite what some people may say about this book, I found it one of King's best. It holds elements of the supernatural and while very detailed (which some people may find annoying) this detail has to read in order to understand the story and the underlying implications. This is a story that could happen. Other King books lack some of the moral and social aspects of this story (fopr example Thinner, and Gerald's Game which I found very boring). With so many new writers coming into the horror market and with King being one of the oldest writers of Horror (not necessarily in age) he needed an eye opening book. The reason why the story was left with an open end is so the possibility of a follow-up can be done. This book would make a brilliant movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't stop listening. . .","review":"Ralph Robert is a character you will worry about and cheer for, as Eli Wallach splendidly takes you through this spine-tingling tale. There is a world that very few can see, and King will have you suffering from insomnia as you listen and await the outcome of Ralph's adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Stephen King fans!","review":"This complete novel in itself is an imaginitive, brilliant piece of science fiction. Combine it with the fact that it ties together \\"Rose Madder\\" and \\"The Dark Tower\\" series and you have an even greater appreciation for just how deep into his imagination King can travel. This novel is full of characters who are so real, you'd swear they were living right in your own neighborhood. King has really written something different here. If you choose to read it, do so with an open mind and be prepared to be taken on a vast journey into yet another albiet unique story about good vs. evil. To truly get the most enjoyment out of this book, I would recommend first reading: \\"Rose Madder\\", \\"The Dark Tower\\" series, and \\"Eyes of the Dragon\\". After reading these pre-requisites and \\"Insomnia\\" I'm sure you'll agree that King is really on to something special"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small book, small print","review":"I was very disappointed when I ordered this book for my husband. Was a very small book with very small print. I returned it for a refund.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO many levels...","review":"Yes, it's in Derry, Maine.Yes, it's a mystery.Yes, it's a love story. (Maybe that should be YIKES, it's a love story.)Yes, it's gory in places.Yes, it's very confusing at times..BUTIt has a beautiful Metaphysical component. The Universe giggles at our concept of Good and Evil. REAL Evil can still be defeated by Pure-Sincere Good.I appreciated the theme without the discussion of religion! The Higher Power is just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower is in Here","review":"This is one of King's BEST \\"stories\\". The master story teller of our time is at his best here creating visible characters and worlds - the King pin at his best. Any fiction fan, and especially any King fan -like me - who doesn't love this book is loosing their edge. I've read the hard back and listened to the audio book 3 times. The audio veresion is super. For you Dark Tower series fans - like me - the Crimson King and company is here also. And, if i'm not mistaken, Jake is here too. I think he is perhaps the young artist saved by Ralph Roberts, he's drawing the tower and Roland. Sneaky, another King twist just like in Heart's in Atlantis and Black House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best King Novel...","review":"I have read a lot of Stephen King, and this was my all time favorite. Less on the blood and gore, more on the darkness of age and fate. Still good vs evil, but for me, it was a small step out of the norm and I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"O, What to Say","review":"Alright. King is the man. No question he is one of the top storytellers of his generation. This book starts off a little slow, as some King novels tend to do, but stick with it until you get to the little bald doctors, then it wont leave your hands for any reason. You will lose sleep at the point, trying to finish the story to see how such a story could possibly end. And the ending(especially for anyone who has read the DARK TOWER series by King) brings a bittersweet conclusion that will almost make you cry. The development of characters and all of the other literary areas one could critique are all used as well as possible, which King is great at. It is a little long, but I love the feeling you get when you finish a book like this. Its just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best.","review":"Long, drawn out, and at times plain boring, this ranks as one of the very few King books I've regretted buying. It's not horror, suspence, drama... anything that you would typically look for in a King book can't be found in this, other than a handful of quasi-interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of his best","review":"The idea behind the story is clever and ripe with possibilities, but this book just doesn't work. The biggest problem is, at 650 pages, it is way, way too long and at some points utterly dull. Just when you think you've hit the meat of the story, it meanders away like a lost dog.There are large chunks of boring exposition and bad dialogue and when you finally do start to find out what's going on, it gets repetitive. I'm a big King fan and think he's an incredible writer but this was a misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea, badly executed","review":"This started out as great read, it was more spooky than scary and it kept you guessing and trying to pick up hints and clues. The story was awesome - guy who can't sleep starts seeing wierd stuff and travels to other 'levels'.However, it all fell apart. Firstly, it dragged on way too long. Secondly, the moment I found out the little bald men were good guys my interest level dropped. And third, the ending got so predictable it was a joke.The first half or so was fantastic, the second half was plain boring. All in all, a great idea - badly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read that I couldn't put down.","review":"I really do not understand why so many people have given this book such negative reviews.The main character is lovable and easy to identify with although part of the senior community, this story drew me and kept me turning the pages. The story has so many things to contiplate, growing old, abortion rights,woman's rights, and how we handle death.For king fans it is easy to pick out refrences to some of his other works, especially the tie in to the Dark Tower series.Unlike others I found this a quick read, often finding myself compelled to read just one more page, but unable to stop there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insomnia","review":"This book starts off really slow - took me 3 months to get past the first 50 pages and like 3 days to get thru the other 600 + LOL. Great book. Kept me on the edge of my seat (bed, couch whatever)A definite must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overly long disappointment","review":"As usual, the writing is stellar in INSOMNIA, but the quality of the writing isn't enough of a reason to wade through a book with a modest premise that's basically overwritten and padded everywhere it can be padded. King's basic weakness as a writer is that he provides the reader with EVERY thought the protagonist has at EVERY turn of the story. This pushes what could have been a basically sound story at maybe 350 pages to an almost 700 overly-packed monster. King is better when he is working short and concise, as in FIRESTARTER, DEAD ZONE, and the stories in FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT. Only die-hard fans of King will like this book. But for me, I ended up skimming the last half. And I _hate_ doing that. I like to honor the words writers write, but I don't like writers who are thieves of time--_my_ time."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's book is a sure cure","review":"Having been a Stephen King fan for years, I have had the pleasure of witnessing his evolution from a writer of blatant horror stories to a chronicler of the struggle between good and evil. With Insomnia, King seems to have become stuck in a rut, albeit a prolific one. The formula for this book is a thinly veiled alteration of the same theme that has predominated King's recent overlength works. Unfortunately, even after sifting through the fluff and surviving the first several hundred pages, the end of the journey provided no rewards. Is this rut merely King's manifestation of writer's block? Will we be able to stay awake through his next work long enough to get an answer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I would expect from King. . .","review":"I'm a fan of Stephen King, and I like most of his books, but I was really disappointed by this one. It starts out really slow, and my problem became the opposite of Ed's. . .This book was putting me to sleep. Then the book finally began to pick up the pace, but instead of finding something entertaining, I'm exposed to some magical rainbow land where you can only go if you are an imsomniac. I thought the hallucination parts were the silliest crap that King has ever come up with. King is a good author, but even good authors can write a dud every now and then"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL! STAY AWAY!","review":"First off, I'm a big ol King fan, dont get me wrong. I had high high hopes for this book. I mean, judging from what the description on back said, it sounded way cool! So I went to the library and got the big ol hardcover edition that was just HUGE! Well, I got about, oh, one or two hundred pages into it and it just got so, \\"Blah!\\". It was boring, and just went no where.. Now, some of the descriptions of the scissor dudes and the auras, that was ok. But it just did NOT keep me interested.. I read it all the way through. It was torture. It just did not work at all. I was so thankful I got it from the library and didnt waste MY money on it. Please, I advise you to do the same or! : JUST SAY NO! :o) Youve been warned! Go get Desperation or The Green Mile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did King write this under the influence of Unisom??","review":"My problem with about half of Stephen King's fiction is that it gets stupid about halfway through. I picked up this mammoth tome with some trepidation, but also with glowing reviews from a few friends of mine. Boy were they WRONG! The plot was interesting (if not dreadfully slow) until ... you guessed it ... about halfway through. Unfortunately, I had invested hours in reading what I had finished and I just couldn't stop. Now I wish I had. Clotho and Lachesis are the two worst characters in contemporary American fiction (and you can quote me on that). Mr. King gets a 2 from me because he kept me reading... but certainly NOT for keeping me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel was thoroughly disappointing.","review":"I have never before read a Stephen King book that I didn't enjoy. This one, however, was a struggle to read and a bigdisappointment. While usually I read one of King's novels in a few days, this one took me weeks to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I have read a lot of King and this book was one of my favorites, really identified with the main character and really enjoyed all of the tie ins with other King work, at the time I read this I was more than a little obsessed with the Dark Tower series. If you enjoy the Dark Tower series then this one is a no brainier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling","review":"Insomnia is a gripping tale of two ordinary people who share an extra-ordinary experience.Ralph Roberts and Lois Chasse have both been suffering from insomnia. What makes this experience unique is that their insomnia becomes a catalyst, enabling them to not just see, but also briefly become part of a whole other realm of existence. They discover a world of auras where 3 'Little Bald Doctors' are the emisaries of death.They soon learn that their new power comes at a price. Something terrible is going to happen in their hometown of Derry and only they can stop it.That Stephen King chose to make his protagonists senior citizens is refreshing. This story challenges the idea of heroism being a young man's game.Don't let the length of the book put you off. This is an engaging, well crafted tale that is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUXURIOUSLY FASCINATING","review":"INSOMNIA ranks right up there as one of Kings top 10. A fabulouse rich story as only King could tell.Relax, sit back and take the time to enjoy this one. It's a luxurious novel, FILLED WITH LIFE & STRENGTH and of course death.A few of the reviewers below say Insomnia is 'boring' and 'too long'. Don't believe it... Such reviewers must have the attention spans of birds or are not open minded enough to imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book!!","review":"This book really goes into the concept of a man who looses his wife, meets little imp-like people who go to their homes yet really good to read. Even though the book nearly 800 pages long, this book is good to the last page. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily his worst","review":"If this had come from a new, no-name author, no publisher would have touched it. The story is ridiculous and utterly unconvincing; I liked the idea of an elderly protagonist, but other than that the novel was simply boring. I'm a big fan of King's earlier novels, but the books he wrote in the 90s have been just one disappointment after the other, and this one takes the cake. Please Mr King, even if you are THE bestest-selling author around, PLEASE let someone edit your books. Do your fans a favor and give them readable, enjoyable books. And how about putting some heart back into your stories? They need a little breath of fresh air, and so do your readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courteously awaiting dawn shines the path of fear","review":"S. King reveals here what makes him one of the most endearing and irritating author of the modern era. On one hand his tendency to overdo the pop culture references, blood is never red but is \\"red as the coke cartoon cups from mcdonalds\\". This same quality paradoxically makes reading this novel feel like wearing an old pair of sneakers to check out anoise under the stairs, you're comfy and you know what is that you'll find under the stairs, but there's still the curiosity to go down there and check it out \\"just in case\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of my life","review":"It must have taken me over a month to read this book and i read 90 percent of it and put it down and never finished it.Why? Because it sucked and it didnt go anywhere and i didnt care what happened to anybody in it. this is hands down the WORST book he ever wrote and everyone knows it. If you go in the store and pick up any Stephen King book you always see tons of great reviews on the front back and inside, this book does not have one good review written on it so that must mean something. After this book i pretty much gave up on King,I think i tried to read The Regulators and Desperation but they both were pretty uninteresting. so basically what Im saying is dont read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will definitely cure","review":"....your insomnia. lots of people are saying that the first 200 pages are the hardest to get through.

If you have insomnia, look no further....couple hundred pages and you will be cured"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not keep you up at night","review":"\\"Insomnia\\" is a negative example of the problems with later period Stephen King novels. A passibly scary story idea worthy of perhaps a novella length treatment in a \\"Four Past Midnight\\" type collection, instead stretched out for seven or eight hundred pages until as a reader insomnia is one of the last of your problems. Once again, King creates a decent setup that loses effectiveness as many pages crawl by with little or no action. This is not one of his best or in the end even all that scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect cure for insomnia","review":"If you have insomnia, read this book.

Do not waste any time out of your life on this one. Narrow minded one sided political rants with the most STUPID story known to humanity mixed in.

I'm not giving up on him because I know that he must be good given all the praise he has received and the great movies that have come about from his work. However, this book was so ridiculous, just cookie cutter material that provided no real feelings and I found myself reading it just to finish it, hoping for an improvement on the next page, chapter or part. The only reason that people have rated it so well is...well I have no clue, unless they're die-hard fans just giving all his work 5 stars. Ridiculous. Don't bother. I'm just 40 pages into The Shining I can tell it will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"When I bought it their wasn't anything mentioned about it being on casset tapes. So I can't listen to it untill I can find a tape player."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD!","review":"This is Stephen King at his BEST people. Ralph Roberts is suffering from insomia, and things are not going his way. Of course if this was not written by Stephen King, then this novel would be boring, but it isnt. First it starts off with Insomia, then it leads of these things that float around everybody's heads (sort of like life.), and when he breathes them in, he grows stronger.Then he starts seeing these gray beings everywhere. Eventually he meets one of them and talks to them, they tell him that he has to save a four year old boy named David because the bad gray being is out to kill him!Now David is a certain key in The Dark Tower series, and the same thing with Ralph Roberts. So all in persective, this is a good novel, it may be long, but it is good nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dedicated King fan says \\"the worst\\"","review":"Are you a King fan, but disliked Tommyknockers? If so, I bet you'll dislike this one as well. It has all of the same problems ... cartoonish characters and protagonists, made-for-the-movie- screen cliches ... the multiple-dimension universe idea was standard and weakly developed, and this book really had nothing else going for it ... I mean, little doctors who snip lifeline strings; singing tennis shoes?Here is my theory: this was another of King's tests of his readers, like the Bachman books. Either he got someone else to (poorly) write a Stephen-King-like book, or he intentionally wrote a bad book, to see if his fans would still snap it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"Why waste words? King's Insomnia wasted enough already. If you're an incurable King fan, and will read anything he dishes out, then go ahead and buy it. Just be aware that this book is an agenda with a weak plot wrapped around it. Not since \\"Tommyknockers\\" has King been so thoroughly absorbed in peddling his tired liberal slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing as hell","review":"The generalizations that King makes toward the pro life movement stinks. He characterizes all pro-lifers as evil and insane, while making all others angelic. Gimme a break King, leave your politics out of your books. Aside from that, the allusions to the dark tower themes were well placed. An otherwise intesteting book packed with worn out political issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Skipped to the End....","review":"to find out what happened. I began reading this book when I received it for Christmas in 1995. This is the first Stephen King book I could not finish. It was so slow. Finally I gave up and read the ending.

Usually I pass my books onto my mother, but this time I told her not to even bother reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst King book I have read","review":"This is the worst King book ever written.

But then I saw it averaged three-and-a-half stars and thought I should do my part to bring that down, and to warn potential buyers. Don't get me wrong about Stephen King: Some of his books have brought me more enjoyment than those of any other author. But certainly not this one. King has tried here to get inside the heads of senior citizens and fails miserably; his characters seem to be some 13-year-old boy's idea of what \\"cool\\" geezers might be like. When King is at his best (read Misery), he goes light on the supernatural and heavy on the realistic suspense. When he's at his worst (read this one) he has cartoon characters spouting (literally) cartoon balloons above their heads. Did Cujo scare you? How about Carrie? Me, too. But hey, wait until you meet up with King's singing tennis shoes in this piece of junk -- sounds scary, doesn't it? Not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know yourself before you trade","review":"Finally a book that prepares you mentally as well as technically before you begin to trade.

I have actually tested and traded the system that I developed with the books help. Not only did the system test out well, but when I started trading it, it traded exactly as tested.

Whereas volume 1 covered the core principles that are the foundation for good hand technique, this DVD adds a great deal more information on developing advanced technique, and all within a framework of avoiding any tension in one's playing. Meligari expands on his recommendations from volume 1 of practice routines that one can use to master this material, which is very helpful. There is a vast amount of solid technical information in this DVD (as well as in volume 1) and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Plate!\\"","review":"I have yet to see the movie in its entirety but after hearing Lyle Lovett over the closing credits, I had to buy the CD.

I thought that they wanted all these masterpieces to be accessible to music fans, but this way, it will be no music fans pretty soon.

The other talk about other dimension is pretty unheard of to me.Overall, if you did not understand about what is the meaning behind the void and emptiness, buy this book.

I don't recommend it as a cover-to-cover read unless your OC switch is on; it should be left somewhere like a night stand, bathroom shelf, or by the computer where one has a few free minutes. Judging from the many other books Pickover has written, this appears to be a syncretic collection of research notes assembled in a fairly logical collection of mini-biographies. And, contrary to other reviews, there are enough references and citations for further readings about a particular person. I also suspect he was researching information relating to himself -- as a multi-talented genius (and not a madman). If so, I would support that he qualifies for this distinction.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BUT LOST INTEREST AFTER AWHILE","review":"I liked this book in the beginning but some of the chapters were longer than others, and the facts were interesting but it was also very disturbing in some parts.

There was only one madman in there Ted Kaczynski who shouldn't have been in there. The book would have been better if it was just about scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raining on the parade: author is instrusive and tiresome","review":"After a friend reacted to the book in the exact same way as me, I decided to pass this along. Subject matter is hugely interesting, but Pickover seems most interested in himself, in his cutesy writing style, in showing off unnecessarily grandiloquent vocabulary, in categorizing and putting in boxes.... in fact, the \\"subjects\\" were treated just that way, as subjects.

Please buy this wonderful gem of a book and learn about the limits of what it means to be human, and how disorders like ours can sometimes be a blessing -- because they can enhance creativity -- as well as a curse. Clifford Pickover, the author, of this book, is the biggest genius of all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, poorly executed","review":"This book isn't bad as a starting point; if you want to learn about some interesting and ingenious eccentrics, it will steer you in the right direction. But his research is really weak -- some chapters are drawn almost whole from a single source (e.g. his chapter on Pyke) -- and Pickover's writing style can be clumsy at times. There is no serious attempt explain what real connection there is, if any, between madness and genius. Fortunately, the people he's discussing are interesting enough that even the author's fumbles don't keep the book from being fairly entertaining.Pickover has the makings of a better book here, and I can only hope that someday he will get a decent editor -- and maybe a new library card -- to deepen and refine it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book. Lots of curiosities.","review":"Hi, this book was excellent and filled with amazing array of curiosities dealing with interesting people and the human mind. The negative reviewer here said that readers will not have heard of many of the people discussed in the book. That's true, but to me that is a plus! Also, the negative reviewer seemed to focus on an error about defining Tesla's birthplace, but recall that back then Tesla's home town was part of Austria-Hungary, which Pickover points out. In any case, this is not too important. The book's treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy and obsessive compulsive disorder is fascinating, and I loved reading about Geoffrey Pyke, the man who made battleships out of ice! The book is quite fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet tale as all Cartland's are","review":"Unusual that in this story the Duke of Tynmouth was not all that nice.

She has proven herself as a brilliant songwriter and talented musician, but with this CD, she stands to achieve status as a country superstar. \\"When we were Beautiful\\" is a haunting ballad featured in the movie \\"Hope Floats\\" that, for some unknown reason, didn't make it on the CD. Matraca has the gift for lyrics to paralell Mary Chapin Carpenter, and the chirpy enthusiasm to paralell Shania Twain. This CD is fun, thought provoking, and touching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blandness supreme","review":"My hopes, raised by favorable reviews, were cruelly dashed. Berg has a generic country voice, the backup band is pure vanilla, and the whole thing seems designed by a committee tasked with churning out a \\"modern country\\" album. No freshness or spark of originality appears in any of the lyrics or arrangements, and there's not a memorable melody to be heard. Instead, you'll find some awful rhymes, stereotypical rural characters and sentiments, and complete colored-inside-the-lines country conformity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and Boring!","review":"such a boring album that I sold after my first listen. listen to it if you want to fall asleep and have nightmares!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after 3 years","review":"These are extremely comfortable business casual shoes. They're too casual for a suit (of course, you would should never wear shoes lighter than your pants, so most suits wouldn't work with them anyway), but they are great for business casual attire. The cushioning is excellent, and for me the fit was ideal. I'm planning on getting the version with the brown/black combination for variety, and I was greatly relieved to see that they are still making this model.The only signs of wear after three years of frequent use are some user-error scuffs on the front and some wearing through of the innermost leather layer at the heel, nothing uncomfortable or visible to others.

The main reason is because it's so packed with details and fascinating information that I am always finding something I missed or had forgotten in the flood of knowledge. Some might see that as a detraction, but I think it speaks to how well the author did his homework.One of the great appeals in this book is in its truth and how it correctly points out that 1940's Hollywood, which we think we know so well from legend and the films, was actually much much more. As the book shows, Los Angeles was not only the filmmaking capital of the world, but quite possibly the center of business, classical music, and literature. It was one of those times and places when most things that were \\"great\\" were all lumped together. Throw that against a backdrop of World War II and the ensuing Cold War, and you have a narrative that is almost too good to be true.Really a great read, many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterling Sliver Bold Dk.

Anything that looks that good on the cover, has to be good right? WRONG. WTF i dont understand i dont think i even saw a fkn clown untill halfway through the movie. No dialouge, very little plot, which my thirteen year old sister could have imagined. I actually bought this copy from amazon. I should have listened to the other reveiewers, when i read this was unbearable. Being stubborned like i am, i just had to find out for myself.

Never in a million years would that ever happen. Here's the real deal. This DVD would be more fun used as a frisbee. It doesn't even deserve ONE star. When I saw the cover I thought \\"hmmm this could be cool\\". Boy was I wrong. There is barely any dialogue, and the little that there is is BAD. The movie is so dark that you can barely even tell what is going on. And for a movie to be about clowns, um, where are they? There are no freakin clowns, just some stupid zombie looking things that walk around and eat people. There is no plot. There is no story. There is nothing. This movie sucks. It shouldn't even exist.

This one is definitely in my worst 3 horror movies of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What category is below B-movies?","review":"This was just not good. In the world of straight-to-DVD movies, this is one of the worst I've ever seen. There is minimal dialogue; which is probably a good thing because the actors didn't do too well with the simple lines that they had. The costumes might have been good, but the lighting was so terrible that you couldn't see what was going on most of the time. The lack of a plot was the film's biggest problem. It's just clowns killing people.Unfortunately, there isn't even a cheese factor to give this movie some redeeming quality. I was hoping for something overly done like Killer Klowns from Outer Space. But there is nothing in this movie. This will never be a cult classic, or even a cheap thrill. At least the producers only had to make about 50 bucks to break even on the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I have seen this movie.

Now I am not one who NEEDS a good plot to enjoy a horror movie or good acting for that matter.

The FX were terrible, the clowns looked like any everyday schmuck wearing a Wal-Mart clown costume and a plastic \\"mummified face\\" mask, the acting (what little there was) was horrible, the plot (what little there was) was terribly written.

I do happen to agree with this person that the selection of songs in this album seem calculated. Donny does not sing with as much passion as before and as such, the fire in his voice and enthusiasm (and feeling) is missing in this album. I was very disappointed with this 70s kitsch album. Clearly, he's jumping on the bandwagon of all these older singers comeback (eg rod steward, barry manilow) by covering these tired numbers. I wish his selection of material were more original and personal. I do believe that he has more sensitivity in delivering stronger and more quiet numbers. Listen to Donny's earlier music.

It covers a wide variety of information without getting to in-depth into any one subject, so it feels like a pretty well-rounded experience. I also felt that the use of some historical examples really helped not only to make the book more interesting to read but to make some of the concepts easier to understand.My biggest problem with this book is that at points it reads like a college textbook, which isn't always a particularly good thing.

It is a light introduction at best with many examples to demonstrate aspects at work that were all too obvious.

I forget it is there most of the time. It is a great knife for the price. I would recommend this knife for anyone wanting a quality, comfortable knife to carry. My only complaint is that the locking button is a little small and is uncomfortable to slide to locked or to open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanism broke.","review":"I really liked this knife, for about 2 weeks, at which time the spring mechanism broke, rendering this knife useless as it won't stay open. I hate to leave a bad review on a product, but just wanted to let others know that if you purchase this knife, you're kind of at the mercy of the assisted opening mechanism. If it goes out, the knife is nothing more than a paperweight. When you're looking for an EDC knife such as this, you need it to perform anytime and every time. And this one might fail. Hopefully not, but I don't want to take that chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to left handers","review":"Got this knife a few months about and I would say overall the knife is ok but don't expect it to be on the same level as a SOG or other high end knifes. I have to also warn that if you are left handed I would recommend not buying this knife. The knife has a thumb lock only on the right side of the knife. If you are holding the knife in your left hand you can not release the lock with your thumb since your hand is in the way. The only way to do it is to use both hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good knife for the money","review":"Over the years I have had 3 or 4 of these knives. They have all been of good quality, the blades all hold an edge pretty well. The \\"action\\" and stiffness of them all have been a little different. The one that I just got from Amazon has been the stiffest with the most difficult safety to operate. I am not sure if it is this knife or Gerber has changed something, I hope that is breaks in. I am a generator and power equipment tech and I use my knife on a daily basis, for everything from opening boxes, to a screw driver to open non keyed locks on control panels, cutting hose even very small gauge wire and prying on small parts. I would not have replaced the first one or any others if I hadn't lost them. That is one of the reasons that I stick with these they have a good price point compared to Kershaw or other companies. I got sick of replacing $50+ Kershaw knives because I lost them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good knife","review":"Highly recommended. For the price, can't find a better knife - very sharp, functions perfectly (thus far). Only complaint - minor damages to blade after a few weeks of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap feeling - Not even sharp out the box!","review":"Unbelievably, this knife didn't even arrive sharp. The overall feel of the knife is cheap as well almost like a child's toy. That will be the last dollar I ever give Gerber.Fast/one-handed open was a big overstatement as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality slipping...now missing","review":"I'm disappointed in the Gerber Fast Draw knife I purchased recently. In fact, I purchased one that I was disappointed in, so I returned it, thinking it was just a poor single instance, and then bought another. It was no better. I owned a Gerber Fast Draw in the past that I was very pleased with but Gerber must be going to an inferior manugfacturer, now, to have slipped so far. Gerber was less that sympathetic when I contacted them regarding the knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have owned 3 of these knives now and I carry one every day. The spring assist and the lock switch work flawlessly and I have cycled mine literally hundreds of times with no failures. The size is perfect for my purposes and the blade holds an edge for quite some time. A great value for the money and I will buy another. Five stars for the Gerber 22-47161 Fast Draw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance is perplexing","review":"This book is sheer drivel and as a resident of Phoenix I am appalled at how the ignorant author portrayed each city/town/village listed. The numerous grammatical errors result in distracting the reader and the validity of images and some of the data is at best questionable, the authors criteria for listing a city/town is reasonable at best because as a Phoenix resident I can say that over ONE MILLION people reside here and putting it in the same category as Nederland, CO a town of a few thousand is completely ludicrous, and besides each town has its own reason for existence as well as attractions, if the author wanted to write a book about the worst towns, he should have focused more on actual fact rather than the conjecture of his unnamed field reporters. In essence the title should be changed from \\"The Worst Towns in the USA\\" to \\"The Worst Book in the USA\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you're going to claim a town such as Melrose, Mass. is one of the worst towns in America, then you should probably portray it in such a way that does not make me want to go there. The pictures of all the beautiful places in this town make me want to maybe stop by there for the scenery next time I'm in Boston. Not only that, but the text itself failed to to convince me that there was anything wrong with Melrose. How could you possibly place an otherwise educated town on the same list as a place like Markham, IL? Being a resident of Illinois, I know that Markham is a true pit, so why would the author ever even list nice towns such as Melrose or Butte? Even Modesto doesn't deserve such harsh treatment, it being wine country and all.In response to the 5 star review, I'd have to wonder if the reviewer even has any idea of just what British satire is? To say that this comes close to being a good example of British satire is a complete insult to the said tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"D- for spelling and grammar...","review":"I spotted this book at a local major book store on the bargain rack. I was excited about it because it looked like a silly and humorous book. After getting home and delving into it, I was disappointed.It is obvious that this book is meant to be humorous, but the many spelling and grammatical mistakes really detract from the satirical prose. Being a writer/editor myself, seeing those kinds of errors makes me cringe. In addition, some of the photos don't really seem to match up completely with the locales described. Not only that, but some of the pictures are digitally enlarged beyond their original size, resulting in unattractive pixel artifacts. Not flattering.I would suggest you pass up this book. Poorly executed humor is rarely funny. There are many other praise-worthy books on \\"urban studies\\" - both serious and amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I purchased this machine new in January and by mid-August it stopped working. Two months later it still hasn't been fixed. So far I've had six scheduled repair visits, each of which require that I take a half day off work to accommodate them. Whirlpool service refuses to consider a replacement or refund and tells me I should be grateful for their service.So before you think about buying this, ask yourself if you can afford to go for two months without a washing machine and spend days away from work waiting for repairmen.I strongly recommend that you research other online reviews where you'll see countless similar complaints with Whirlpool customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking to buy","review":"Wished there was an option to hear what was on the CD before the purchase. I wanted the actual musical named Carmina Burana and thought the Medieval Poems and Songs would be similar, but I personally do not like the \\"music\\" or \\"songs\\" on this CD. Just a personal preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg your pardon, Ms. Cheatham","review":"Contrary to your claim, Shakespeare did indeed \\"have the full benefit of the thinking of the Reformation.\\" He was born during the reign of Protestant Queen Elizabeth.

In that time, I have read many books on the subject and none has ever aided me the way that this book did. I strongly recommend it to those who are able to acknowledge the fact that they have a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Most books and authors are consumed by their own theories and narrow-mindedness. This book though allowed for a more complete picture of social anxiety to shine through. I would strongly recommend this book to others who suffer from shyness and want to get beyond it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To shy to say","review":"I suffer from social anxiety and have been super shy my whole life. I have also been working to overcome it most of my life. This book is great for parents who want to understand shyness in their children and for anyone who wants to overcome their own fears in social settings, whether it be isolated shyness (ie, stage fright, workplace fears), or general anxiety, this book can come in handy. It has techniques to help overcome fears and live a healthier social life without fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"very harmful reading","review":"If you are shy, I strongly recommend that you NOT read this book. While it WILL make you more aware of the unconscious processes that cause the social anxiety in you, it will not help you overcome them in the slightest. The suggestions encourage you to focus-- no, OBSESS-- over these processes, causing worsened self-esteem. I would recommend any book in the field of Gestalt Therapy over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, packed with information","review":"I bought the first edition of this book many years ago, and was quick to buy the 2nd edition when I found out about it. Ms. Brox organizes her book by season to visit and within that, the various areas she recommends for that season. Within each area, she gives reviews of places to stay (lots of B&Bs!) and restaurants (organized by which meal she'd recommend going for). Plus she details activities such as historic sites, shopping, sports activities, and theater - and finally tells you how to get there from the closest airport and the nearby highways. Very good information, and we've found her opinions to fairly accurately reflect our impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will screw up your kindel","review":"I had all sorts of softwear problems with my kindle the day I downloaded this. When I deleted it because I couldn't read it any way My kindle started working normally. If You want this get it on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Earl Jones should stick with Darth Vader.","review":"I was excited to get this CD set, since I know James Earl Jones has a great set of pipes, and I have listened so much to Alexander Scourby's reading of the Bible that I was ready for a new reading. I was disappointed the first time I listened. Jones does not use inflection while he reads; the result is that the words sound lifeless. As a Christian believer, that abhors me.But more than his lifeless reading, I am apalled at Jones' changing of the text. He is reading the King James Version, but he changes the words at will. For example, the text will read \\"Christ Jesus\\" and Jones will read \\"Jesus Christ.\\" I counted 21 errors in his reading of the Book of Ephesians alone. If you believe, as I do, in the divine inspiration of the Word of God, you will not be able to stand how Jones imposes his own changes to the text without any textual or scriptural justification. Jones should stick with Darth Vader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The guy has a voice like no one else, but the original King James version language (all the \\"unto's\\" and \\"ye's\\" and \\"thou's\\"). - lame backround music - and a whispery, momontone reading (if you can imagine James Earl Jones doing that) - makes this far inferior to Johnny Cash's reading of the New Testament.Johnny Cash proclaims the Word of God beautifully and simply. If you're not much of a believer, it just is done well and straight forward.The New King James Version in Cash's reading is more modern English (Easier on the ears.) But this is still majestic langauge. Also, no accompanying organ music. Just him reading slowly and with understanding.If you are going to buy one - get Johnny Cash reading the New Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another version","review":"Mr. Jones uses a dead monotone voice, mispronouncing words, and does not read a complete sentence fluidly.\\"And then......Jesus said to his......disciples, go and......find Mary....\\" etc etcDrove me crazy and I'm sorry I spent so much money on this. I will look for another version and listen to the speaker before I buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mclusky are back!","review":"It must be a hard task to follow up an album as great as Mclusky Do Dallas, but Mclusky have hit another home run with The Difference Between Me & You is That I'm Not on Fire. The Welsh trio have gone in a darker direction with this album; the big rock hooks are largely discarded in favour of snarling, noisy punk. Songs like \\"Slay!\\" and \\"Support Systems\\" are amazingly loud, verging on death metal at times. Steve Albini's production fits Mclusky perfectly again, I can't imagine them recording with anyone else. The result is an album that is a lot less accessible but ultimately just as rewarding as their previous effort. This is real, vital rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but short of Do Dallas","review":"First, a little jab. I guess I'm a bit of a different breed of Mclusky fan. All this talk in the Do Dallas reviews of getting kicked in the nutts and getting your ass kicked by the music sounds pretty Beavis & Butthead-ish to me (that's not intended as a compliment). Uh, he said \\"You got a puppet's name\\", uh. It's actually \\"prophet's name\\". Apparently you've been kicked in the nutts one too many times that you can't hear, or spell correctly for that matter. Ok, on to the review. The first half of this cd will blow you away. From that point on the cd loses its pace a bit and I start skipping around. The first six songs on this cd are brilliant, especially \\"That Man Will Not Hang\\", \\"She Will Only Bring You Happiness\\", \\"Kkkitchens, What Were You Thinking?\\", and \\"Icarus Smicarus\\". Mclucky Do Dallas is overall a better album, but I highly recommend picking up both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activa Watches Defective","review":"I ordered this watch, Activa Children's Elephant Design Watch #SV621-001, and three similar (different colors/designs) Activa children's watches in November to give for Christmas. I didn't open the watches until I was gift wrapping them a day or two before Christmas. None of the watches worked. I took them to a battery shop, where I learned that the watches were defective in that the stems/crowns of all had been pulled out when the watches were manufactured (maybe years ago) and the batteries had thus run down. When the batteries were replaced ($7 each), three watches worked and one didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid drivel","review":"Oh, for God's sake! What utter drivel. Diana wasn't bright enough to implicate anyone more substantial than a poorly trained manicurist.Here's a conspiracy question to think about -- if Diana was so committed to the anti-landmines issue why did she chose Dodi Fayed as a consort? Some of his relations are huge arm dealers. Hey -- maybe THEY knocked her off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Prosecution Lost the Case","review":"The book was written in the form of a trial and the reader is the jury. Well, if I was on that jury, I would have voted for the defense. And if I was the judge, I would have thrown the case out after the prosecution finished his case for lack of evidence. The title is perfect \\"Hidden Evidence\\" as the evidence was so hidden that I couldnt find it in the book. The author makes many hypothesis but does not have any REAL support for his hypothesis.I believe that we have not heard the full and real story of the death of Diana and was hoping to find it here - but I was disappointed. Stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden or Recalled Evidence?","review":"Jon King and John Beveridge offer some intresting theories for the murder of Diana, Princess of Wales; however, the book lacks focus and wanders from the Jews (BC) to the Stuart dynasty to a supposed plot to put Diana on the throne in order to fill up 400 pages. The authors often make a point, then recant or weaken it by offering other explanations. Some information was given by sources who could not prove their statements, so the book was given a \\"maybe, maybe not\\" quality. The whole book could have been summarized in a few pages without all of the extraneous elements thrown in. A bit \\"over the top\\" for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"The premise for this book was and is still interesting; however, this writer is in need of an editor!! The book is highly repetitive and the arguments are not well organized. There is information that is valid and does bring up questions in one's mind; however, there are too many times when the author does not follow through on validating his claims (ie, \\"I'd lay out the evidence, but it is not legal\\" - since when??). Maybe someone else could have a go at this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!!!","review":"Very dry reading, difficult to follow..While it does bring up some very interesting facts and hypotheses, there is no cohesion. It is written in a textbook fashion, making it somewhat tedious.The Foreward by Prince Michael of Albany sheds interesting light on the Conspiracy theories and he shows a true understanding of how the People feel about Diana's death and the subsequent cover-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely inappropriate","review":"This ABC book goes through the alphabet with a little word & poem for each letter. The gimmick is that these are all spooky words. The book is recommended for ages 5+, though I think Amazon has it as 4+. Either way, I think it's completely inappropriate for any child under 6 unless you want your curious preschooler to ask for explanations of death, demons & Satan (& his various monikers -- the book is quite thorough). Then there's the little ditty of someone being stabbed with an icicle. Frankly I'm quite incensed over this book. The artwork is pretty nice but I really don't need my sensitive & overly imaginative 4-year old waking up with nightmares.

I have read all the books, and I must admit that this one disappointed me somewhat. I have enjoyed these novels for what they are; a fictional dramatization of one possible interpretation of the end times. The Indwelling left me a little cold. I read it in about 4 hours and at the end my jaw practically dropped. That was it? The story covered only a few days' time and told me practically nothing that I hadn't already figured out.While I am reluctant to say this about two of my brothers in Christ, I can't help but feel that the focus of this series has turned from producing entertaining fiction to making money. I sincerely hope that is not the case. The series could have been done in 7 books as originally planned, I think.Chances are I'll buy #8, The Mark. I hope it is an improvement over #7.

I think that the authors did a better job on this one than any of the others. The only slight problem was that LaHaye and Jenkins took a bit too long to get around to some of their points--but I suppose it was better for clarification purposes. The events that actually transpired were very interesting, and the Biblical correctness was amazing.

It focases on a main group of believers as they try to survive against the \\"Antichrist\\" and make it to the Glorious Appearing. This book answers a lot of questions left off in the previous 6 books, such as the cliff-hanger from Book 6, Assassins, and ends with a huge mystery... I loved this book!

I really enjoy the series and The Indwelling is no exception. Once again the Tribulation Force is in danger, and following the assassination of Carpathia Christians wait for his resurrection. The force is split, some members being forced to go underground and others spread throughout the world. Very intense read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Promised","review":"I haven't read this book yet because I'm working my way through the series, for the second time no less. But the book came in excellent condition and before the scheduled date. I would definitely order from this source again.Cathy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepiest Left Behind Book Yet!","review":"The Indwelling is just as good as the first 6 Left Behind books and is incredibly more creepy. Once the antichrist rises from the dead, he is Satan himself. He's much more evil than Nicolae Carpathia alone ever was. I was incredibly surprised to discover who had killed the antichrist in the last book and you'll discover that pretty shortly into this one. The Indwelling is very gripping and I doubt you'll be able to put it down. It's one in a series that kept me up reading until late hours of the night so I could finish it and move on to the next book. Don't pass this up--or any in the series, for that matter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Mister Nice Antichrist","review":"Number Seven. Just as it's title declares, the indwelling of Satan happens here. We begin with the world at large in an uproar due to the assassination of Supreme Potentate Nicolae Carpathia. Is he really dead? And who did it? Although Rayford is accused, the cliffhanger from Assassins is resolved. The Great Tribulation begins; we find Hattie; Leon gets a bit too big for his britches; and by the way, Nicolae's pretense of peace has ended - no more mister nice Antichrist! Side note: living through the Tribulation with a baby would be extra hard...Just saying.Even though this entire book takes place over only a few days, I didn't feel that it dragged - bring on number eight!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Even though I've never read any of the books in this series, just from reading the excerpts, comments from other reviewers and the editorial reviews, I can tell you that it's a poor excuse for not reading the Bible. Which is, after all, the only book that can tell us about salvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woe to the inhabitants of the Earth who read this drivel!","review":"Okay...maybe that title was a bit harsh. I would like some of the reviewers here to realize it's REVELATION not..I repeat NOT \\"REVELATIONS\\"..but on to the book...I don't get the 5 stars..I don't get the 4 stars. There's about 20 pages..maybe of action in this entire book, it's written on a 6th grade level (and that's being generous)...and, as a Christian, I'm insulted, embarrassed, and yet hopeful that maybe..just maybe the authors will think less about the money..and more about the story...I do believe both are capable writers...but with this...I'm vastly reconsidering that idea...Gentlemen...what, exactly, \\"took possession\\" of you to publish this book? Surely you have to know it's poor...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, and Christians wrote this...","review":"Personally I found this book to be somewhat mundane due to the vast amount of irrelevant filler. That the authors felt compelled to drag out the indwelling event, as it were, for 365 pages out of a 385 page book is kind of odd. That is, when one considers the title to be representative of what any given book is going to be about. I will admit it is a real page turner, if one only can't stop reading for fear that the storyline will cease to exist if not constantly viewed. No offense, but did the authors get paid by the word or by the quality. I know what I suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL FILLER---NO MEAT!","review":"AFTER WAITING 6 MONTHS, THIS BOOK WAS MOST DISAPPOINTING! IT'S WRITTEN AT FIRST GRADE LEVEL, LACKS CONTENT, AND POORLY EDITED. I WILL NOT BUY THE NEXT 4 BOOKS----I'M SURE THE FINAL BOOK WILL BE A REHASH OF ALL OF THEM. IT'S TOO BAD THE AUTHORS HAVE COMPROMISED THE SERIES IN ORDER TO WRITE MORE BOOKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revelation","review":"All the \\"Left Behind\\" books are clumsy attempts to transpose the Book of Revelation of John into our times. Revelation was ridiculouss at the time it was written, and it is much more so today. The dragon, the first beast and the second beast, the 4 riders of the Apocalypse etc. were creatures invented by the author of Revelation to cow a superstitious and credulous audience into submission. The goal hasn't changed, only the audience. Common people today know much less about religion than they did in the 2nd C AD, and are therefore easier to manipulate."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same...","review":"I don't know how long this can continue, but this book justcontains more of the same schlock as all the others. Poor writingcombines with silly plot lines to make another big-seller that deserves doorstop status instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"As a literature lover, I find it troubling that this book, with its large print, TV-byte writing, and shallow characters, is so popular. As a Christian, I'm disturbed by its fortress mentality and the reduction of Christianity to an insurance policy. I think Jenkins means well, but I hope readers who are dissatisfied with the Christianity presented in this series will look further and not judge it based solely on these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope #8 is better ...","review":"I have read all seven books in the series. The Indwelling was nowhere near the quality of the others. In this book, the plot comes to a near standstill. I loved the other six, but The Indwelling just is not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Indwelling","review":"The 7th installment in the \\"Left Behind\\" holds the audience's attention well. The anticipation for the coming of the second half of the Tribulation is met with quite a \\"different\\" Nicolae for the readers. The Tribulation force will now be confronted with no doubt their biggest challenge. The value in this and the other books from the series lies in their instilled curiousity to descern fact from friction. Perhaps such reviewers that tend to give little credence to the book's value should adopt \\"John\\" as a preferred author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to form","review":"The Indwelling stands as one of the best books of the series, and definitely in the same league as the first installment, Left Behind. The characters are more detailed; the dialogue is less stilted. The authors have struggled since book #1 to find a style and pacing that works, and this is it. Although the book covers only one week of the entire seven year tribulation, it is packed with action. The book represents a major turning point in the story and therefore deserves this level of detail. Of course, if you've already gotten this far in the series, there's no backing out now! Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry It up, the END IS NEAR!","review":"C'mon you guys, I would really like to get to the end of this series B-4 I die. You guys are making millions off a bunch of filler, almost every book near the end is where everthing happens. Why? so you 2 can hook us and sell another book. Hurry it up already. Do you 2 think that you can take all that money with you? The END is near, so please finish the story already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Indwelling","review":"Although the story is riveting, it moved more slowly and became wordy in placed. It seems the authors were milking this part, so that they could stretch what remained. Last book ended with the assassination, this book only got to the resurrection. I did however, enjoy this story and look forward to the next volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, TRIPE!","review":"Regardless of the authors' intent, this book is just BAD, BAD, BAD and they should be ashamed to market it in the name of Christ. I HAVE read Revelation (it's not \\"Revelations,\\" by the way) and there are plenty of other sources that non-believers can read to get a good explanation of it -- for instance, any of Tim LaHaye's books about Revelation. As far as excusing the authors for poor writing because they are publishing a book every six months -- no one made them publish them that close together or forced them to string the series out over so many books. Again, this is criticism of the writing of men -- not the inspired Word of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Indwelling","review":"I received it in reasonable condition on the last day it was promised. more words more words more words more words"},{"rating":"1","title":"moving to a crawl","review":"The first two books in this series were good, but since then its been getting worse book by book. This book moves so slow its unbelievable. It leaves you with the impression that the authors have run out of things to write about and are deliberately slowing the story down banking on the success of their first books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series","review":"This is the worst book of the series. Almost nothing happens. You might as well save your money and read the intro in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book!","review":"I thought that this book was an excelent example of what is going to happen! It gives such vivid discriptions of everything. It's just incredible! I definitly give it a 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than \\"Assassins!\\"","review":"The writers are back on track with \\"The Indwelling\\" by re-establishing a better storyline. It was heartening to see the character Rayford Steele get refocused and inspiring to witness Tsion's experience. I can hardly wait for \\"The Mark!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Indwelling","review":"I could hardly wait for Indwelling to hit the bookstores. So, I had to find another way, Amazon.com. They brought this great! book to my door at work and I proceeded to read. I had already re-read the previous six (6) three times. I have shipped this series to my nephew in prison in Virginia. He has since shared with many inmates. He always has many, many questions about Revelation. This series has prompted these question. This series is a great way to peak the unbelievers interest in God's Gift of love through Salvation through Jesus Christ. It warms my heart to be able to share in prison the shared talents of LeHaye and Jenkins. Keep writing as I continue to search the Scriptures for growth and knowledge in God Word. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and redundant","review":"As an avid reader, I have enjoyed the Left Behind series for what it is: entertainment. The books are not well written works of literature; however, the lastest edition to the series, The Indwelling, has stooped to an all time low. The plot was completely predictable and drawn out. It was evident from the previous book who is the assasin. It is interesting to see the attempts at spiritual questioning and maturing of the characters but it stops at interesting. I find myself no longer caring about the characters because they are shallow. I got the feeling the authors were just trying to drag out books so the series could last longer. I know these men are capable of better and I hope that the next book will prove to be better written and to have a tighter plot. If not, I'm afraid they may lose readership. For those interested in an author who approaches spiritual content in an excellent manner; you may want to check out Francine Rivers books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough book for the money","review":"Although I enjoy the story of the left behind series and enjoy seeing what will happen next I continue to be disapointed in how much is covered in one novel. I feel ripped off with reading an entire book just to learn what happens in a few days. Ever read a Michner novel? He can cover in about one chapter what Lahaye and Jenkins cover in one book. I won't be buying another one of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very spiritual and riveting","review":"I have found this book in the series (I have read all 7 books twice now) to be the most spiritual so far. I found it to be a huge cliffhanger, with the Trib Force on the run to a new safe house, and Carpathia just having come back to life and threatening the Trib Force with what's to come. I can't wait for the next one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pits! (no pun intended)","review":"A family member who likes these books keeps passing them on to me, and I have read them ONLY so we can discuss them. I think they are the most ineptly written fiction... for either children or adults...that I've ever seen. It's too bad someone with the ability to create believable characters, story line and dialogue hasn't had the kind of success with fiction derived from biblical prophecies that LaHaye and Jenkins are enjoying. I fear that this series has alienated many more people from belief in God than it has won over. (My aforementioned family member has finally conceded that the writing in the \\"Left Behind\\" series is \\"pretty awful.\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is highway robbery","review":"I agree with all those that thought that this book was a review of all the preceding books. I could have visited Barnes and Nobles, Sam Wholesale or any other bookstore and spent 30 minutes reading the last couple of pages. That's where the story of the book should have started. This book was a BIG let-down. The opening chapters should have been on the body of Nicholae coming back to life and the person responsible for his death, not how everyone was trying to get away. For the next book, I'll wait for the reviews. And will someone please tell me the page number to start reading?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead or Alive?","review":"This book reminded me of a offshore fishing adventure. You start by trolling the bait for something (first 100 pages), then you think you saw something after the bait (next 75 pages), then the creature from the deep hits and the fight is on (next 165 pages)and finally to get to see the catch (last 50 pages) BUT it gets off and you can't go fishing again until November when \\"The Mark\\" (book #8) RETURNS.<g> The authors again kept my interest building through the book. The male Israeli's agony of defeat turned into the thrill of victory was memorable. The series is still ALIVE and well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Talks","review":"I and my husband were very disappointed in Book #7,\\"The Indwelling\\". We felt taken by the lack of substance in the book compared to the previous books. Surely, the authors are not trying to drag out the series for the money! I am hoping they will redeem themselves with their readers in Book #8. Please don't take advantage of your readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many books in the series","review":"It becomes obvious that the authors are trying to stretch their story into more books. What initially began as a quick moving and interesting story line, has become bogged down in continuous recaps of previous story lines and lack of forward movement to the plot. The first books of this series made you think and question your life...the last couple of books make you wonder why you are wasting your time on a storyline that could be summed up in a couple of chapters, rather than 400+ pages. The books are becoming more and more disappointing. The authors should have kept to their initial plan of a shorter, more intense series that left a deep message rather than watering down not only their plot, but their message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This was far and away the slowest moving book in the entire series. After finishing \\"Assassins\\" I looked forward to this book with much anticipation. Unfortunately, I wasted an entire evening reading this book when I could have skipped to the last 50 or so pages and gotten all the entertainment value to be had.Come on guys, the first few books were excellent. The quality of the last few has not been up to par. Faithful readers like me will continue to buy the remaining books of the series because the basic storyline is so interesting, but it would be nice to be entertained as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I am an avid Left Behind Series reader. I've read all the books and own all the CD's that have come out. I'm hooked! BUT...the latest - The Indwelling - has no punch, no bite. I understood when the series first started that it would be seven books. This is book seven and we're only at the three and a half year mark, and then this book covers such a small space in time that it may be four more years to complete the series. Don't get me wrong, I'm in no hurry to get to the END but the books need to keep moving at the pace of the first six. My wife says I'm wrong, and I pray I am, but it appears that the authors may be getting greedy (more books than originally planned, payed speaking engagements, a movie, CD's and tapes). Mr. Lahaye, Mr. Jenkins, please get back to the basics which has made this series so popular. This is the first time I've seen so many negative reviews for any of your books. I hope you're seeing them, too. God Bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wait for a disappointment","review":"I eagerly awaited the next installment in this series, but have to admit I was disappointed with \\"The Indwelling.\\" Although it \\"reads\\" very well, the book only covers three days. The consequences of the wounds suffered by the Antichrist are either not mentioned or are not biblically accurate, something that surprised me coming from these two biblical authorities. There was the usual jetting around the world we have seen in the previous books...one wonders where DO they get the money for all the jet fuel and planes they wreck?Their new headquarters needs a better explanation. Either it has a roof with solar cells, or it doesn't. If it has been cut in half, how can a helicopter land on it? The hero, Capt. Steele, was left as a simpering, indecisive leader. How and why did this happen?I found it long on detail, but not the helpful kind. Get it and read it, but don't have high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it already","review":"the book started off really good but soon beacme just another game of wait and see, so to the authors get on with it already for those of us that have read the whole series this was very disappointing hope the next one is not as lacking in story line"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the others.","review":"This is not the best of the series, but it is much better than book five -Apollyon- which moved incredibly slow. I enjoy the cliff-hangers that are usually present, but Assasins doesn't leave too many (unfortunately) I would definately recommend this book just because it's in the series and you'll miss out on something if you don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad excuse for a book","review":"this is by far the worst of the left behind series. Don't get me wrong, i loved the first one, but this is almost too much. It seems to me that Lahaye is just dragging the books out to make more money. The characters are all whiny, totally transparent, and they lack no depth whatsoever. This novel should have been a few chapters in the next book. Really bad writing, even the editing is bad, i found so many mistakes it was confusing at times. I would not purchase this book again, And sad to say but i think i am done with the \\" Left Behind\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Entire Series!","review":"I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed reading this book. I have read all of the Left Behind series and this was the best of all. If you have not been saved, this book will convince you of the need to be saved. I salute Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins for making the Bible prophecies seem so real. I can't wait to read the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outreach Tool","review":"I carry a book wherever I go. It is a great conversation opener. Airplanes, buses, etc. I have had many opportunites to mention the Left Behind series. More and more people today are interested in \\"Armagedon\\" and the end of the world. When I mention the Left Behind series deals with Revelations and talks about what is going to happen, people express greater interest. What a way to get the message out to unbelievers and believers, reminding all of us we need to be \\"found ready\\". A believer from the Northwest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots and lots of nothing","review":"What a let down. It takes 300+ pages to get to anything of merit in the story line. Those 300+ pages are spent rehashing the same fly here, fly there; almost get caught plots they have covered over these first 6 books. Little character development and little advancement of the story line. The last 75 pages are so rushed that the return of Nicole seems cartoonish and silly. I'll be borrowing the next book from friends instead of preordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"This is the worst of the series. I enjoyed the previous books; however, this one was very limited. It's a shame, you can sum up the whole book in one sentence. Nicolae Carpathia dies and comes back alive. No surprises, little action.Skip this book in the series and wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Until this book, I have been riveted by this series. This book moved too slowly, and did not have much depth to the story. It only covers three days, and all of this information could have been covered in three or four chapters. The next one will have to be much better, or it will be the last one that I read in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"I read five books in the series while visiting my son in VA on vacation for a week. The first 4 books were great and by the time I got to the 6th and 7th my interest fell. I bought the 6th and 7th when I got back home. I was very disapointed it was very hard to keep up with the story. There seemed to be very little of one in the seventh. I will not get another. There certainly was a long wait for the 8th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this series to bed, Please!","review":"I admit, I've gotten hooked on this series just like the rest of you. But I've had the feeling since the second book that I'm being sucked into this never ending series just to line the pockets of the authors. All of these books could have easily been combined into one nice fat paperback. The latest, the indwelling, had only about 50 pages of substance, with the subject of the title not taking place til the last two or three pages. While I enjoy the story that is unfolding, after reading each of them I've felt like I had just been robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Augh!","review":"Why,oh WHY is this poorly written book hailed as such a great work?! The writing style reminds me of how I used to write when I was in 5th grade..the dialouge is unbelivable. Why couldn't they have just made it a shorter story? Or just tacked a prolouge onto the previous book or something? 3/4 of the book is filler and does Rayford Steel always have to toss off some psuedo-dramatic one liner? This is so full of cliches that I keep waiting for Carpathia to rub his hands together and burst into a fit of insane laughter...Ugh,don't waste your time on this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Out-of-Body Experience!","review":"This is one of the better books in the series for it's blend of mysteries and tense interactions between our heros and the Global Community. There is one annoying element in the books that is becoming more frequent. That is that no one engaged in a conversation with another hardly ever finishes a sentence because they are always being interrupted in mid-sentence! Overlooking that, this book progresses right along with scripture, and even gives us a satisfying view of an out-of-body experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lahaye does it again","review":"This book like the others in the Left Behind series is a cliff hanger that pulls you in at the first page and still hasn't let you go even at the end. After reading the first six, I anxiously awaited the release of this book and I was not disappointed already looking forward to the next. If you have not started the series you are missing out! This book is so far the best in a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The END-Dwelling","review":"I must admit that I am a huge fan of the Left Behind series and have enjoyed every book, that is until now! The 389 page book did not live up to it's title until the 364th page! Basically little to no action and our Trib Force remain intact (bumps & bruises aside) and retreat to a safer \\"safe-house\\". Tim & Jerry have lost the action and suspense seen in the eariler series and seem to stretch what could have been written in 2 chapters into a 380 plus page turning BUST!

At the rate these authors are going, this Left Behind series will be as long as an encyclopedia set. Get on with it, PLEASE!

I am so glad that I borrowed this #7 book."},{"rating":"2","title":"End times information brought to life","review":"I have read each book in the series. One leaves me waiting for the next. While the effect of the times portrayed may not be as horrifying as it surely could be, I appreciate the way it is presented for two reasons. Many people may not be able to grasp and digest the realism of such a devastating time; and many more simply may not wish to. The way in which the story is presented makes it appropriate for a vast portion of the poplulation. In a world of negativism and horrible crime, maybe this is all we can handle for now. Maybe some insight is better than no insight. Maybe focusing on God's mercy and his ability and willingness to help us through horrible situations is the reason to read this series--not to dwell on the devastation and ugliness that brings us to that point in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled","review":"This book should have been called (A long drawn out lead up to)The Indwelling. Nothing really happens until the final ten pages. As I read, I kept telling myself that surely something will happen in the next few pages. This book should have started where it ended and moved on from there. It is, of course, a must read, but only because it's part of the series. I appreciate the authors presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I can't help but feel like they are trying to sell books rather than advance the storyline. Let's hope the next one is more to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession","review":"Considering how much I liked the first six books, this one was definitely a disappointment. The entire book covered a grand total of three days and didn't say anything that we didn't already know. I felt it was just a \\"quick fix\\" item to fill a gap till the next \\"real\\" book comes out. At least I'm hoping that the next one, The Mark, is better written and has more meat to it than this sad edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As an avid reader of the series, I was disappointed that this book covered less than a week's worth of activity. With 3 and 1/2 years left to cover, the next four books will have to be pretty intense. I agree with the reviewer who said that this should have been condensed and made a few chapters in a more filled out book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real let down","review":"AFTER WAITING MONTHS FOR THE INDWELLING, I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

Got home and dove back into the world of Rayford Steele to meet up with my new friends. The book clicked back and forth from one continent to another quickly, building suspense that finally came to a head very close to the final pages, and closed with a terrible threat to all.. Though I am anxious for the next installment, I felt cheated of more story, more insight from the authors about the times to come. I have done some study, and I am so glad that these authors are putting into plain language the prophesy of scripture for all to understand and ponder. These stories have served to help me envision how these events might actually appear and affect us all. They serve as food for thought, and I would've liked more to chew on for the next few months while I await the next addition to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put it Down","review":"You can't guess what is going to happen next.

My only disappointment with this volume was the pacing. I was hungry for more than just three days worth of the lives of my, now friends, Rayford, Ben, Chaim and the rest of the tribulation force. The suspense was good and created even more excitement for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks!","review":"How could you possibly imagine I would be interested in this book?

Well, that pretty well sums up how I feel after finishing THE INDWELLING-LEFT BEHIND #7. Let's face it people, this series is really baaaad: bad writing, unrealistic characters, goofy coincidences, stupid dialogue, unconvincing plots, etc, etc, etc. And I'm finally leaving it behind (along with more dollars than I care to think about). I've got no one but myself to blame for my contribution to it, but (as many others have noted) it seems like this series has just turned into a real \\"cash cow\\" for the two authors, and they seem to be milking it for all its worth. Not very exemplary behavior for writers who consider their motivation to be spiritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indwelling reignites a series diving from Assassins","review":"The Indwelling picking up on the coat tails from the averagely pieced together novel \\"Assassins\\" in this ongoing series is spectacular.Lahaye & Jenkins get their chemistry back , and this book explodes into a real thriller. I am a fan fan of the Left Behind series, but not every book in it screams out to me as a good one. Indwelling does. It has superb character development, fast pacing, and a climactic ending. And it delivers that feeling of \\"when can I get more\\".I'm sure many who think these books are for christians only plan on avoiding them. Don't. The story is great, the characters are believeable, and it's message is for everyone. We don't have forever to decide what we believe. If you don't know now you probabley need to go find out soon.Take it as you may.

The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible off of the series. I see no reason why &#65533;The Indwelling&#65533; and &#65533;Assassins&#65533; couldn&#65533;t have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward was rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other. Those still interested in reading well written, realistic scenarios of the apocalypse should read The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise instead. Both those books were a lot more believable, and they didn&#65533;t need twelve books to tell a good story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The action is just beginning---","review":"Despite what a lot of people are saying, in my opinion, The Indwelling is just as good as all 6 of the previous in the series!

While the series helps with the comprehension of Revelations, it is sad to see the commercialization of a very important message.

I mean, I can not for the life of me understand why Messers. LaHaye and Jenkins feel so compelled to pad this series out to another five books (it's already too long as it is) when we as believers already know how this is going to turn out! This book spent 400 pages of zero action and plot advancement, when a good writer would have kept it moving quick!My patience is now exhausted with this series.

LaHaye and Jenkins have composed a book so thrilling that you can't stop reading it. There were only a few things that I didn't like about the book, such as Tsion's out-of-body-and-in-heaven experience. It was a good idea fore explaining Revelation 12, but it seemed rather weird. I also missed reading the messages the the worldwide church, and I didn't like the fact that the whole book took place during the course of one weekend. I really love how they portrayed the image of the beast, and the way that they always take the Scriptures so literally. The late night landing in Greece and the events at the safe house will keep you riveted and guessing.

Their bias truly comes out in the series.My advise is to NOT buy the novels, but find a library or book store with a coffe stand and read them there. Trust me, it won't take long.

Beyond the terrific writing, fine characterization and wonderful pacing, the \\"Left Behind\\" series as a whole is serving as a warning of sorts to those who still have doubts, a warning of what's to come. My own spiritual journey was a difficult one--hampered by organized religion, believe it or not. I couldn't help wondering how each denomination could come up with different answers from the same Bible. La Haye and Jenkins made me ask questions and seek the answers--and through this wonderful series, provided me with a wonderful road map.

Since the \\"Who shot J.R.\\" ending of the of the last book I have been waiting for the next in the series to arrive on the shelves. The one thing I have enjoyed in the other books of this series is the link to scripture and how it supports the writers interpretation of end times. This books did not flow with that same biblical support. Tsion having an out-of-body experience was really a stretch for the way he had used his wisdom and faith in earlier books. If the rest of the books in the series only cover three days each, it seems to me the authors are interested in making a great deal of money.

The pointless dialogue, the repetition, the easy predictability. I skipped many pages of rambling, pointless dialogue and examinations of the characters' moral struggles repeated for the 98th time, and still knew what was going on. Here's some good writing advice: If it doesn't contribute substance to the book, leave it out. If the authors followed that advice, this book would be 30 pages long. For example, they could have easily left out all the verbal one-upsmanship between David and Guy Blod. What was the point of that?It's hard not to be distracted the \\"technical\\" screw-ups. The authors' overuse and misuse the past perfect tense of verbs (as in \\"he had believed\\"). It also struck me when the Greek lady who knew so little English knew the English word \\"fingerprints.\\" Get real. Those are just a few examples.It gets interesting in the last 20 pages.

But while \\"Assassins\\" at least had some chapters that were interesting, \\"The Indwelling\\" has nothing. This is not a novel, it's about 30 pages worth of plot stretched out to novel length. There is no reason that this and \\"Assassins\\" could not have been one volume. The only possible reason is that they just wanted to sell more books.

I think by expanding the series to 12 from the orginal 7, the authors are stretching the story line - and it's getting pretty thin. When I read fiction, I at least want it to be believable. There wasn't much substance to this book and everything was too convenient - the only one who seems to ever sleep is Kenny (and I think that's just to get him out of the way). Unlike the title implies - there wasn't much of the \\"Indwelling\\", which happens at the end of the book. Unless Lahaye and Jenkins delivers on their next book, I'll give up the series.

There were no more than four events that absolutely needed to be said---everything else was literally filler.

This book rambles on literally forever about all the main characters trying to get back to the same location, which if it were even the first quarter of the book, might have been ok. Then the very purpose and/or premise of the book, the Antichrist becoming \\"indwellt\\" doesn't take place until page 364 for a story that ends on page 389.

But if you would like to engage your MIND on occasion; if you would like to read quality WRITING; if you appreciate intelligent PLOTTING and SUSPENSE, then you won't find it here. For the discriminating reader, there is a novel in this genre that delivers what this LEFT BEHIND pablum lacks.

I read his most recent book, Assassins, first and it was great. Exciting and riveting. This is the first book in the series and basically introduces all the characters you will see in the other books...slowly and with too much detail in some instances. Also, this book is filled with religous mumbo jumbo. I never realized Ollie was so religous. Assassins had a lot less religious stuff in it.You really don't need to read Ollie's books in order as Ollie is good at \\"re-introducing\\" characters in his other books so you aren't lost if you did not read the earlier ones. I would skip this one. I still look forward to reading the Jerricho Sanction and Assassins was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"First off, let me start by saying that I have a great dealof respect for Oliver North and find myself agreeing withhim on many points. That being said, I would not recommendthis book to anyone. It was about 300 pages too long anddidn't go anywhere fast. I had to force myself to finishthe last 200 pages and wasn't impressed. Also, the underlyingChristian theme, while ok, had no place in the book. I hopethat any books he writes in the future turn out better than thisone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome seller!","review":"I was half-way through this audio book when the third of six tapes broke.

This was a great book that ranks right up there with the best of the genre. It held my interest right to the end of a 600+ page thriller. It opens at a fast pace and keeps you hooked all the way through. Some North East liberal media reviewers just can't get past Ollie's politics and admit that this is a great read. As for me, I can't wait for number two!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Put It Down!","review":"Ollie North and Joe Musser have crafted a powerful, fast-paced narrative in \\"Mission Compromised\\". It's a real page-turner that far outshines many other novels, and features a style that rises above most best-selling faith-based books. The mixture of well-researched detail about the inner-workings of government and its \\"what if's\\" makes this fascinating, fun and often very sobering reading. You won't absorb the daily news in the same way after enjoying this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Compromised","review":"War stories have never been of much interest to me, but I loved this book. The writing style reminds me a lot of Tom Clancy without the tedious details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"It is very refreshing to read such an exciting book, without all the foul language.

It is nice to know that an author can write such a captivating book and still show his love for Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...","review":"Colonel North's first book had a few ups and downs but I would recommend it highly. There were things that I questioned but as a previous reviewer mentioned, sometimes it was hard to keep in mind that the book was fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"I bought this book because it was reviewed with 4/5 stars. This book is a huge dissapointment. The first 300 pages are decent and had the makings of a good novel. However, I had to force myself to read the last 300 pages. They consisted of nothing more than 300 pages of Christian preaching and self indulgence. The book ended bad enough that this will be my first and last north book. How this book has received a 4 out of 5 rating is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"As a devote' of high-tech/war novels, I eagerly gobbled up this new novel by Oliver North. However it didn't take long to realize this was going to be 700 pages of misery to finish. Col. North is using this forum as a means to expunge his guilt and show his transformation from a criminal to religious right. It fails!! It does have a few moments of actual enjoyable fiction, but they are not worth reading about old Ollie's escapades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaving three times in one day says it all-too much detail.","review":"I'll have to confess I only read the first 200 pages of this novel, so maybe something happens toward the end. At any rate, the story moves at a glacial pace. Naturally, all the characters sit and stand ramrod straight, etc. Peter's brother's death and funeral were described in excruciating detail; so much so that I expected something to happen there. We also learn that it's a good idea to go to McDonald's for breakfast before hitting the office, and that military men always use public transportation for a chance to catch some zzz's. (Yawn.) I still read Tom Clancy, because, even though he has become quite a gas bag in recent years, there is actually something happening in his books. I do admire Ollie's personal accomplishments, and find myself agreeing with him quite a bit, so I wonder where he leaves off and Joe Musser takes over here? This book is a sleeper and not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever written!!","review":"I am planning on purchasing 7 more books for my friends. This book is GREAT and you won't go wrong with it. Caution you won't be able to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts Slowly but Ends With a Punch","review":"I was given this book by a friend who thought I might be interested. After a few months I began reading it on a whim. It started out slow, primarily becuase Mr. North was developing his characters, which you later become attached to (especially in the following books in this series). From a detail and fact standpoint, Mr. North hits is on the head. I agree with another review that a beter editor may have improved upon the flow of the story.It's a long book and I approached that dreaded 100 page mark: do I continue or not? FOrtunately I had built up enough momentum by that stage and the book was extremely good from there on. I was so drawn in that I immediately ordered the next two book of the trilogy upon completion of Mission Compromised.I would recommend this for those interested in modern military (post 1980) and Christianity. I applaud Mr. North for boldly inserting a strong Christian message into his stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Review","review":"Fiction or non-fiction? Could go either way. Military plot in the style of Tom Clancy, but not nearly as technical as Clancy's books can be. Very good story tended to wander a few times. The overt religious aspects got distracting after awhile. Entertaining. Will probably pick up more of his work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huh? I think it was good.","review":"Looking at the review above from Publishers Weekly, I'm wondering what book they read. Obviously not the same one everyone else on this page read.

Unfare Publishers Weekly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Be advised once you get into this book its hard to get out. While a few chapters of this 500 page brick were highly unessisary the book was incredibly good. I beg to differ with the reviewers who said the book was too preachy. While it did include a trac like christian message it was weaved into the book and hardly noticable (if you skip a few paragraphs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Pleeez. Is this a military suspense or religious novel?","review":"A very good military suspense novel, but I got very tired of North's Christian recitals, which I felt were beginning to be forced upon me. It seems like the only way the story could end was all the characters -- and I mean almost ALL the characters (who were not killed) had to be born-again Christians, and with their renewed faith in Christ were they able to overcome the enemy.I also felt a little cheated with how the authors ended the story. True to the movie format, you could almost see the ending fade out and the conclusions \\"rolled\\" like screen credits, like, \\"well it's time to end the story, so let's just stop it here like this.\\"This was my first Oliver North novel. Would I read another one? I'll spend more time thumbing through it carefully before plopping down another eight bucks.Semper Fi,A former Vietnam Marine 1/9 ('67)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something For Everyone! A Great Christmas Present!","review":"Both men and women will be vastly rewarded by this happily sizable, multi-dimensional novel. It will satisfy a reader's need for serious and no-holds barred adventure, mystery, romance, and a whole lot of TRUTH at no extra price. And what a treat it is to read this from a man who is no doubt more than just well-versed in all elements explored!An added plus...all of this from A-Z is written within the increasingly rare boundaries of good taste, even given the wrenching, personal and soul-searching events covered within. You can feel comfortable giving this book to your own mother or other loved one who would enjoy a great full action and also moving novel (a rare combination, might I add!)I highly recommend this book, and I know I will be including it on my Christmas list to give to many others this year.Thank you, Oliver North!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mission aborted","review":"I wanted to like this... I really did but I can't get past page 203. They haven't even left on the mission yet. The first 200 pages could have been edited down to 20 pages.

National security issues will never be viewed the same way again. Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissonance","review":"I did try to read this thing but the dissonance was too great. Every time Mr. North beat the drum of duty, honor, loyalty I kept seeing and hearing my father, retired army col. and verteran of three conflicts, turn off the TV after listening to North testify in front of Congress and say \\"That man is a scoundrel and a traitor.\\" And then he explained how North violated his officer's oath to the Consitution. So forgive me, I really can't comment on the literary merits my stomach was turning too violently to notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not want to read a book about Christainity","review":"This was a fantastic military adventure ruined by the inappropriate constant references to evangelical Christianity. I bought this book because I have great respect for Oliver North and was looking forward to the military suspense and great adventure. Unfortunately, I was turned off by the constant religious overtones and hijacking of the plot to perpetuate religious views. I would have rated this book a perfect ten if it stuck to the plot, instead I feel I was duped in to reading a book that would be more appropriate for a Christian Science Bookstore than the Marine Corps Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Setting up straw men to knock them down . . .","review":"Just read the first two pages right here on the site to see what tired, familiar garbage this is. You'll meet the absurdly cliched character of the National Security Council head who \\"loathes the military\\" -- \\"like his President\\" (yes, it's a book full of gratuitous Clinton-bashing), is one of those arrogant elitist liberals who went to, you know it, Harvard, AND who's \\"grossly overweight and disheveled.\\" I'm surprised they didn't also give him dandruff and bad breath. Tedious polemics unartfully garbed in the trappings of a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put money into the pockets of traitors!","review":"Oliver North is a traitor to the United States. We should never forget that this is a man who sold weapons to Iran in the 1980s. That's giving aid and comfort to the enemy. That's the definition of treason. The mere fact that this reprehensible human being gets to be a pundit on Fox News, and gets to write books, is mind-boggling. If there was any justice in the world, Mr. North would be spending the rest of his life in a 10x10 cell, where he most certainly belongs. Don't put your hard earned money into the pockets of traitors like Ollie North. If you do, you're only letting the terrorists win."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy Has NOTHING to FEAR!!!!!!!!","review":"Oliver North can not WRITE! This book is boring and a pathetic attempt to cash in. I was hoping it would be exciting. If you like thrilling books do not read this one. The plot is downright stupid and the characters have no soul...no life to them. This book is a MAJOR \\"literary\\" DISASTER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what happens when writers don't read . . .","review":"I am a huge fan of the spy genre and was unsure how a \\"fictional\\" work by North would be written. Laying aside the utter ridiculousness of the plot and characters, we simply did not need a book to tell us what a victim the author(and I use that term lightly)is. Politics have nothing to do with what North did and was bagged for - if the same events transpired under Clinton, you can be sure that the Right would be all over the guy forever. Enough is enough Fox News. Your \\"newsmen\\" are hardly literate to begin with. When they enter the print world, it becomes even more apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reheated tripe","review":"Probably not the last we'll hear from this lying, contemptuous of Congress cocaine-running weasel. If you really want to waste time reading this poorly written, self-aggrandizing drivel, go ahead, but don't say you weren't forwarned.

Most humans charge an arm and a leg simply to stand there anyway - and not much can happen that way either. It's true, not all people are going to have the same wonderful experience that I [and others] did. This is simply what Reiki is all about, each of us having a togetherness connection to the Reiki Energy source itself, while ALSO having our own experiences learning about how to harness and use it.

Nadya, the heroine, traveled from Missouri to California and finally set up near Astoria. Her character besides wildness and abnormal sexual desire, is those put out from comic's hero. Kind. Brave. Everything. Description about her travel is vividly written, not too much to feed up the imagination.The plot, however, is too simple. Everything can be predicted from even in the first part of the story. The rushing in final part does not make the story interesting, instead it deprives the preasure in wandering more inside Nadya's world. The bias against her foes is also so much that it becomes comical. Nevertheless, the idea presented in this story is superb. Though the story will not linger long in memory, the understanding and appreciation of the wild gained from this book will be always remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"No colander/strainer needed","review":"I usually hate non-stick pans, but I have to admit that I really like this one.

I did buy an inexpensive silicone potato masher just for this pot, though, so I wouldn't scratch the non-stick surface.

I'm sure it would be a great film for police officers going through their initial training on route to the world of the beat. It is a good film and holds up well and should have more kudos than it does. Stacey Keach gives an accurate portrayal of the new policeman while George C.

Great fun to skim through even when you're not prepared to cook anything.Everything I've made from the book has been delicious. That being said, there are numerous recipes with ingredients that are either difficult to find outside of the region the dish is from (such as unripe grapes), or ones that will take up space in your pantry forever because you only use them for one or two recipes (pomegranate paste, ground angelica petals, and so on).

It also contains in depth sections on programming the Roland JX-synths,Yamaha DX7,CZ101, and Oberheim Xpander. The book is worth getting just for the fact that its one of the only sources providing a background for the synthesis that goes on inside the Oberheim Xpander. Don't go to The Berklee College of Music to learn about the Xpander, save your tuition, buy an Xpander and this book.Lots of drawings, pictures, and relatively small number of pages (111 if you are wondering).

This book ends in a way you would never expect for the way it starts out.I thought this book was very good. It kept me interested, laughing, and got me scared at certain moments.

A boy moved to a small town called Lost River which was named after the river that the town is near and his name was Russell Cooper. He made good friends with his new next door neighbor Joey Banks. Both Joey and Russ had sisters who were cruel. Their names were Amanda Jane, Joey sister and Jenna Mae, Russ's sister or \\"sissy\\" as everyone calls her. Joey and Russ didn't know that this was going to be the most tragic summer of their lives.I liked this book because it is funny and it kept me on the edge of my seat when I read it.

They both had an older sister, and they were the same age, and they were best friends. Rusty and Joey were always trying to do something to their sisters. One night they wanted to do something and they went to far.I really liked the book a lot. It is probably for teenagers and adults because they would understand it more.

This was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow I think the author described this book really well.","review":"It was interesting, curious,and funny. The author described it so well I could picture it in my mind. For example, in the beginning Joey gets bit in the privates and the fish clamps on.

Rusty and Joey find themselves in a lot of sticky situations, but some they do regret.I thought Swear to Howdy was a great book. The beginning was a little boring and confusing, but once it got good it really got good. This was an easy read but that is one of the reasons I loved it. The book kept building up until I didn't think it could get more exciting. The author wasn't too detailed, but when you really needed a picture in your head it was there.

It arrived as ordered. Why did I give it a poor review? Because the top hole in the bracket is aligned with the curved bar that has the hook for the tendrils. You will not be able to screw it in straight with a normal drill and screw bit. So far I have been unable to install it securely. This aspect is poorly designed and is not worth a great rating.

He proposes the following litmus test for politicians; ask them about their stand on the right to get high.Kubby's book is well written, but not well designed.

I thought it was black, or a charcoal, it is really a variegated reddish-brown color (nice though!). Is just a bit wider than my stove (I installed above and it balances well) and looks quite nice. I'd give 5 stars, except the screws that came with it were cheap (sheared the head off one way too easily). I highly suggest you purchase a package of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\\" wood screws either with it or before it gets to you (the screws included are 1-1/2\\") - no one wants this thing falling down on them! The pan 'hooks' did not want to go over the center straps comfortably, and the picture on the box has them along the front (they did fit there well).All in all, a solid 4 star.

Any product that has a spray on finish is going to end up chipping in the future so I was trying to make sure that this product had a quality workmanship.

They were very easy to work with.The vest itself is well-constructed and worked great. We went to Maui and I used it probably 6 times snorkeling off the beach. As other reviewers have mentioned it does have a tendency to ride up a bit since there is nothing at the bottom to hold it in place.

There is nothing that a Golden Dawn temple will provide in writing about the first 3 or 4 grades of advancement toward adepthood. I took away a couple of points because of the author's terse and slightly archaic method of writing and for the fact that he wrote an entire chapter on enochian magick and enochian chess after admitting in the first sentence that he knew nothing about them.

My son pulls out screws.","review":"We chose this highchair because of the size and style. I loved that it dd not take up so much space in my small apartment and I liked the wood look better than the plastic options. The problems with it are: The plastic tray is very difficult to remove. The screws become loose after about 2 months, depending on how squirmy your child is. My 20 month son only sits in it for meal time and it has totally fallen apart on us. The screws fall out leaving the highchair unsafe. My son has even pulled out som of the screws on his own. We wasted our money on this and now we are going to have to buy another high chair as I have a second on the way and I want a safer, more conveniant option. I hope nobody else has to waste their money and energy on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this highchair!","review":"We love this high chair. Finally a high chair that isn't a giant, ugly presence in my kitchen/dining room!

After first trying larger screws (the original screws just pulled out of the wood), we finally had to drill through the tray from above and attach strong bolts.The bolt heads actually look good, but this should not happen with a chair this expensive.Day to day use, the chair has been fine, but just not worth the cost. Yes, it looks nice, but it will be out of your life in a year or two, and I think one with a bigger tray would have served us better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Clasps are a weak link","review":"While this chais is obviously very stylish and sleak, i found the plastic clasps that brace the tray to the actual chair to be a significant problem. the table rarely feels very secure, due to the fact that the clasps are typically loose. i have to re-tighten them very often, to the point that the screws no longer have much wood to grab onto, and i will have to begin using larger, non-svan issued screws. the clasps are bent at an angle that makes tightening both screws very difficult with anything other than a very short screw driver with a large philips head on it. it seems like an easily fixed flaw, but when i read about people complaining about the loosness of the tray, this is the core problem that they are referring to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have had this highchair for 2 months and the paint is chipping and the wood is splintering.

It comes with a plastic tray cover which we figured we didn't have to use, but unfortunately the paint is chipping and peeling and gets all over babies hands. So we started using the plastic cover, but the thing is so hard to get on and off it has almost ripped our nails off. Baby has been using this about 2 months now (she's 8 months) and already it is loose and the screws are coming out. The fabric is very nice but not very practical, there is no way to clean it without putting it in the wash. I can get over that in order to avoid plastic, but the other issues with the chair have made this a bad purchase for our family and we will be looking for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good but is hazardous","review":"I will say this chair looks great, but that is where the good review ends. It is SO WOBBLY that my 9 month old is going to tip it over.(I saw one review by a nanny where someone actually did tip it.) She can move back and forth in the chair and shake it so much that the back legs lift off the floor. It is also a pain to clean with a giant gap in the center of the main pole that catches food. I was so afraid that I actually stuck it in the basement (really annoying at $250 but better than wondering the second you turn your back what will happen.)I now have the OXO Sprout. No movement there! Love the Sprout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks beautiful but...","review":"it has a few serious design flaws:1. The tray cannot be adjusted to fit snug against our child when she is sitting in the chair.2. It does not have a lip on the tray on the side facing the baby and since it does not fit snugly, would allow all of the food to end up in her lap or on the floor.3. The seat height cannot be adjusted to the height of a normal kitchen counter top/breakfast bar - a critical feature common in most high chairs.So we returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy...","review":"This was a beautiful chair and worked great until my son started feeding himself...~The food fell on his lap, the floor, and in the very hard to clean crevices of the chair.~The wood soak up the water when I wiped it down. This really concerned me because the wood started to blister up. My husband and I had to take it apart and polyurethane it to protect the wood.~Once my son got a little bigger (12 months), he would rock in the chair and I was always concerned he would tip it over. This never happened, but he did loosen the screws enough that the whole chair wobbled seriously.We ended up turning it into a toddler chair once he was old enough to eat at the table. For our second we bought a Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat and can't say enough good about it. It's plastic, but you can still scoot the chair under the table and you can't see it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money--Hard to clean, cheap, not practical","review":"Do not waste your money on this chair. First, its cheaply made. The wood is basically plywood and as the other reviewers have noted, the screws come lose all the time. Second, its impossible to keep clean. The cushion basically has to be washed every day, but more than that because there are so many nooks and crannies food gets lodged and stuck everywhere. Finally, our son has never been comfortable in it, the seat tips him forward and he's constantly fighting to get out. In short, this $250 chair is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I bought this tray for my daughter when she was four months old and for the first few months it was fine. Now that she is 15 months, she has completely outgrown the highchair. The tray is way too small and she is constantly knocking her cup off while eating meals. It's also really difficult to clean because the plastic tray doesn't easily come off. I am extremely envious of my mother's inexpensive Graco high chair that has a large tray and a comfortable chair. I will be replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not traditional cherry wood","review":"Ok, maybe I'm partially to blame as I did NOT look at each of the color samples. After receiving my chair almost 2 WEEKS LATE it was not cherry wood as I would typically think of it. It appears as more of a walnut stain. Not exactly what I had hoped for. In addition to this, the tray was damaged and could potentially pose a choking hazard. We all know how little fingers like to pick at things and a piece of the splintering wood could have chipped off and been swallowed. Or been a splinter to remove from little fingers. Now, Baby Because wants me to pay the $24 to ship it back to them and $24 to ship a new one in \\"Mahogany\\".

It covers a lot of material very quickly. The book is also organized very well. Categories are concise and to the point.For the more advanced student, it may be too brief of an overview. If so, try Majid Fakhry's \\"A History of Islamic Philosophy\\" for a medium-sized overview (A History of Islamic Philosophy)... or pick up Fakhry's book after finishing this one.I have read the Qu'ran and thousands of hadiths, but I was uninformed on extra-textual developments within a historical context.

From the obvious inclusion of Stephane Grappelly,Stuff Smith and Joe Venuti to dazzling appearances by Svend Asmussen,Michel Warlop and Eddie South(who on one track swings a Bach concerto), I can't think of a single dud amongst the 36 songs on these discs. One even gets to hear Django Reinhardt put his guitar down and pick up the violin! The range of performances run from the soulful(Ray Nance's \\"moon mist\\") to the hilarious(Marshall Sasson's \\"humoresque\\") while remaining always entertaining and truly swinging. Mr. Asmussen is still around but I fear this world may one day forget it can express itself as sweetly as it has on these two discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy pop!","review":"What a lazy decision to release this as a single! \\"Crazy People Rock\\" was the final nail in the coffin of Cain's music career with Warner. Not only did it lack in being promoted, but unfortunately there was very little to actually market here.Its cheesy pop at it's cheesiest! The remixes of it are bearable and the non album track \\"On the dance floor\\" is quite catchy and enjoyable. It's a little less cheesy and has a \\"Jamaraquoi\\" sound to it.Not too much else to say on this one. It's disappointing that Cain wasn't able to release his preferred style of music. I think you can hear it in the lack of emotion in Cain's voice on the track, a sign that he doesn't really enjoy singing such rubbish! If you are going to buy \\"Crazy People Rock\\" stick to the Supafly remix (track five), otherwise keep it on repeat on track three!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect kitchen decor!","review":"I love this pot rack!

It's no great work of art, but it's good fun and most of the music isn't half-bad.The CD is presented in a narrative story format by Stan Lee, telling a sort of \\"day in the life of Spider-Man\\" tale, with the song tracks filling in the action between the spoken story-telling. The music carries the balance of the CD and the effect comes off pretty well. Most of the songs aren't all that thrilling, but there's a couple catchy ones to hold your interest for the occasional repeated listing. And it's just a cool item to have for your average Spider-Man fan.'Nuff said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Spider-Man!","review":"This collection of songs is a lighthearted embodiment of the old Spider-Man comic books. Take the amazing adventures of good ol' Spidey in the 60's and 70's, add a beat (and maybe a tambourine), and you have this CD! The style of the songs vary greatly, and the lyrics, while somewhat cheesy, reflect the dramatic style of a superhero comic book. However, don't try to listen to this CD with your non-Spiderfan friends and family members unless you want them to look at you funny. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, cheesy fun","review":"Okay, I saw this listed and thought it might be worth it for nostalgia and cheese, plus, being a Dr. Octopus fan with a song devoted to him didn't hurt.This CD is just plain fun, running a weird maze of styles from 50's Doo Wop to pop opera. There are tracks that will make you laugh at how cheesy they are. There are others that make you go, \\"Huh?\\" wondering how they could ever get made.As you could probably guess so far, my favorite cut is Dr. Octopus Part 2. A weird, imaginary expression of a world enthralled by the majesty of the multi-armed villain, singing genuflictions to their new god in a style from Jesus Christ Superstar. Also recommended: \\"Peter Stays And Spider-Man Goes,\\" \\"Square Boy,\\" \\"No One's Got A Crush On Peter,\\" a re-mastered and complete version of which appears on this CD for the first time, \\"Gwendolyn,\\" (The song done in 50's Doo Wop style, irresistable to sing along to.) and \\"A Soldier Starts To Bleed,\\" a surprisingly solemn number tossed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"spider-mans back and brought all his gay 70's songs with him","review":"Well i didnt buy the CD because i had already heard it and well i don't want to swear but it was very very rubbish.

Incredibly energetic and entertaining. I only give this CD 2 stars because this studio recording takes away some of the band's original feel - what is supposed to be an \\"improvement\\" actually increases the songs' cheesy-ness with odd sound mixing and strips the band of its intensity.

However, this is a shell of what Lovehammers have done in the past. I know they are better than this. They somehow lost their spark and charisma. It's probably because of the producer on this album and not Lovehammers themselves. It's just not Lovehammers as I know and love them. I hope in the future they stop listening to the producers or whoever told them that this was good and rock like they used to. The sound is just too contrived and over produced. However, it's a ok album and I still love the Lovehammers. They are great guys and deserve the best and I know they can rock way harder than this album makes it seem.

I recommend this highly to anyone with a young teenage reader who needs to be reminded there are books to capture their attention and make reading an enjoyable pastime."},{"rating":"2","title":"MYTHOLOGY TO ITS BEST!","review":"First of all, I'd say this is one of the best books I've ever read. I've never realized the greatness and interesting facts that mythology has. It was a big topic in which helped the story of Percy Jackson go to top #1 in the charts. I recommend this book even if you have no idea what mythology is or whether you don't like it, just read first couple chapters.PROPS TO RICK RIORDAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review for The Lighting Thief","review":"This is the first book about Percy Jackson and it is very exciting.

There's no wonder it's so long! Each page is filled with action, and so many gods and everything! I would tell you more, but it'll ruin the surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of a 6th grader who is a awesome demigod","review":"5 StarsI loved this book so much because of the amazing quest and doing the capture the flag at night. My favorite part was Percy Jackson and his friends saving the three animals from those guys who work at \\"The act of Kindness\\" company because they were too cruel to the animals. Anyway I love this book and I hope the next book will be fun soon. -Michael Dinkelman"},{"rating":"2","title":"percy rocks","review":"some people are saying that percy is compared to harry potter that makes me quite angry if you even took the time to do some research you would find that percy is based on mr.ricks son i love pery because he reminds me of me ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a really good book for the people who like to read about adventurous books and like to learn about about the Greek goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lighting theif","review":"I LIKE it when Percy battled Ares.I LIKE it when they went to the underworld.

It is a pure classic fantasy book for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!","review":"I read this book in school and I couldn't stop reading! Percy Jackson has to find Zues' lightning bolt so he can surrvive! He goes with his best friends Grover and Annabeth. He meets a bunch of different gods through our the series like Hades, Ares, Zues, Poiseden, and much more! It is a very funny book. I read the other books in the series and I would read them in 3 days or less! Lots of people didn't like the book because they thought it was to much like Harry Potter. I have never read the Harry Potter series because I thought that they put way to much detail over nothing! In my opinion it doesn't matter if they are a like because they have different plots and problems! I loved the Lightning Theif because after each chapter there was suspense that wanted you to read on. It is a long book but a very quick read. You have to read the series in order because other wise they won't make a whole lot of sense. Buy it! It is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I like the approach the author takes with his story. It doesn't compare with the Harry Potter books but is definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting journey worth re-reading again and again","review":"SO MUCH FUN!!!! As an adult I really enjoyed this book. I was so surprised and thrilled to finally see a worthy story incorporate Greek mythology into such an easy fun read. I wish this was around when I went to elementary school. This is the kind of book that really gets your imagination spinning.Percy Jackson is a 12 yr. old that discovers his chaotic dyslectic life is influenced by his tie-ins to the Greek Gods. Yes, they are real, and so are the monsters that come with!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun story and a quick read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It kind of reminds me of a combination of Harry Potter and The Parent Trap. I like that it incorporates mythology; I don't know if it has the same effect on it's target audience (10 and up), but it definitely made me want to learn more about mythology.If you are looking for a fun story and a quick read, give The Lightning Thief a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every good story was borrowed from a previous one","review":"This is a book or a novel that is suppose to entertain....Every book, every story has borrowed ideas from somewhere... West Side Story? Twilight? sounds like Romeo and Juliet.... Look at all the Dracula stories or Werewolves stories... There are so many adaptations of Cinderella from all over the world... In every book you can sense oh I read that somewhere before... It's a great tool for writers to allow their readers to feel comfortable with the story... It gives the readers the background knowledge to appreciate the story more... It's a reference point... It adds to their reading skills as well because it is fluid... they don't have to stop and wonder what's going on... I am rambling...My point is to read the book for the sole purpose of entertainment... It may resemble another book but there are new antagonist and protagonist that are interesting... Don't take everything to seriously..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY review that counts","review":"This book was probably the best fiction book written around the topic of greek mythology ever. It keeps the kids entertained with the whole \\"quest\\" aspect, and provides a lot of information into the mythology of greece as well. Im fourteen, and i still think this series has some sick $wagg. (That means its good for all the parents out there). I know that Harry Potter and this book have similarities, but both were good due to the fact that they were easy to get into. This book comes from a whole different point of view than the HP books and are a lot shorter for the wimpy readers out there. Nice job Rick Riordan, and thank you JK Rowling for writing a good series also.dalTex@sR3v!ew$�?\\n2\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"First time reader","review":"Good young adult novel with an interesting story.

Who would have thought of that? ButPercy Jackson did it again! Rick Riordan's graphic Novel of Percy Jackson and the Lightning thief is a one to buy. The artwork is amazing, the story flows, and its everything I thought it would be! But there is one little snag. They leave out little parts of the story or don't put in a lot of detail. But what else are you supposed to expect from a comic? If you are a Percy fan: get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"This is what I call popcorn reading. Light, fun and nothing to really take too much energy. I like the use of the gods and the research behind the books. The characters are likeable, typically teenager, and interesting. I decided to read these because so many of my students had read them and liked them. I can see why they liked them."},{"rating":"2","title":"warning: you may not be able to out book donw after reading","review":"This book is called the lightning theif by Rick Riordan.This book is an ausome mix or myth and present. This book is about a young boy named percy jackson, he seems like a regular troubled kid, but hes more troubled when he figures out he's a half blood.this brings you from spots of the world, to Mt.Olympus. Theres also very many greek monsters and sons and daughters of gods.This book brings you places you've probably never heard of too. You get to meet greek gods like Zeus,Posiedon,and athena. Theres tons of great battles like capture the flag....but a very dangerous version with swords and shield, and unplanned battles and conversations, but there is a traitor in this book, think you can figure out who is the kightning theif?well read this book and you can put your thoughts to the test!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A got to read book","review":"I thought the book would be ok at least from the outside,but I guess thats why they say not to judge a book by its cover.

Why was he wasting time with young adult books when he should be telling us about Tres? When I looked closer and saw the plot was about modern demigods living among us, I had to give this book a chance. A great treat for adults who love mythology as well as for the target audience of young(er) adults. My sister (50) liked it as much as my niece (11). I couldn't wait for the second installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it than the movie","review":"This book awakened the kid in me and made me travel to the farthest part of my mind which is my imagination. Percy is quite a lovable school boy who was blamed and thought to steal Zeus' lighting bolt. From the plot itself, it is very interesting. I also love Greek mythology and how Riordan incorporates them to create a wonderful story is really fascinating. A good book for any given day. Keep it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Percy Jackson Graphic Novel","review":"My 10 yr old has read all the Rick Riordan books, several times over. He can't get enough mythology.

I think Riordan had the right idea but in my personal opinion a few changes need to be made... I like the way he joined mythology with the modern world but thought that the flurry my friends made over the book was pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lightning Thief Is The Best Book Ever!","review":"I love this book.

While I realize my home schooled 11 year old may be a rarity in the speed from which he reads. These books by Rick Riordan have inspired within our son the keen interest in Greek Mythology and he will just be entering into 5th grade (by public school standards) this fall! Now this is the same kid who read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7) in less than 3 days! While his interests are in fantasy these mythology books by Rick Riordan have ventured him out into a new realm of wanting to know all about Greek Mythology and have made my work harder as I now need to find teachings on the subject for the classroom. Obviously Rick Riordan knows how to entice our young readers into learning and for that he gets HIGH PRAISE from this teacher/mom! And he can't publish the books fast enough for our avid reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting but good book","review":"This is an awesome book! I love to read about greek mythology.

I would have been in serious jeapordy if I had not then bought the book... We actually bought the Book 1 and Book 2 at the same time.My daughter just ate up the books.
